    "abstract": "Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) are increasingly critical to power-system stability, yet their operation and maintenance remain dominated by reactive, expert-dependent diagnostics. While cell-level inconsistencies provide early warning signals of degradation and safety risks, the lack of scalable and interpretable decision-support frameworks prevents these signals from being effectively translated into operational actions. Here we introduce an inconsistency-driven operation and maintenance paradigm for large-scale BESSs that systematically transforms routine monitoring data into explainable, decision-oriented guidance. The proposed framework integrates multi-dimensional inconsistency evaluation with large language model-based semantic reasoning to bridge the gap between quantitative diagnostics and practical maintenance decisions. Using eight months of field data from an in-service battery system comprising 3,564 cells, we demonstrate how electrical, thermal, and aging-related inconsistencies can be distilled into structured operational records and converted into actionable maintenance insights through a multi-agent framework. The proposed approach enables accurate and explainable responses to real-world operation and maintenance queries, reducing response time and operational cost by over 80% compared with conventional expert-driven practices. These results establish a scalable pathway for intelligent operation and maintenance of battery energy storage systems, with direct implications for reliability, safety, and cost-effective integration of energy storage into modern power systems."

    "abstract": "Despite extensive safety alignment, Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail against jailbreak attacks. While machine unlearning has emerged as a promising defense by erasing specific harmful parameters, current methods remain vulnerable to diverse jailbreaks. We first conduct an empirical study and discover that this failure mechanism is caused by jailbreaks primarily activating non-erased parameters in the intermediate layers. Further, by probing the underlying mechanism through which these circumvented parameters reassemble into the prohibited output, we verify the persistent existence of dynamic $\\textbf{jailbreak paths}$ and show that the inability to rectify them constitutes the fundamental gap in existing unlearning defenses. To bridge this gap, we propose $\\textbf{J}$ailbreak $\\textbf{P}$ath $\\textbf{U}$nlearning (JPU), which is the first to rectify dynamic jailbreak paths towards safety anchors by dynamically mining on-policy adversarial samples to expose vulnerabilities and identify jailbreak paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JPU significantly enhances jailbreak resistance against dynamic attacks while preserving the model's utility."

    "abstract": "Vehicle-Infrastructure Collaborative Perception (VICP) is pivotal for resolving occlusion in autonomous driving, yet the trade-off between communication bandwidth and feature redundancy remains a critical bottleneck. While intermediate fusion mitigates data volume compared to raw sharing, existing frameworks typically rely on spatial compression or static confidence maps, which inefficiently transmit spatially redundant features from non-critical background regions. To address this, we propose Risk-intent Selective detection (RiSe), an interaction-aware framework that shifts the paradigm from identifying visible regions to prioritizing risk-critical ones. Specifically, we introduce a Potential Field-Trajectory Correlation Model (PTCM) grounded in potential field theory to quantitatively assess kinematic risks. Complementing this, an Intention-Driven Area Prediction Module (IDAPM) leverages ego-motion priors to proactively predict and filter key Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) areas essential for decision-making. By integrating these components, RiSe implements a semantic-selective fusion scheme that transmits high-fidelity features only from high-interaction regions, effectively acting as a feature denoiser. Extensive experiments on the DeepAccident dataset demonstrate that our method reduces communication volume to 0.71\\% of full feature sharing while maintaining state-of-the-art detection accuracy, establishing a competitive Pareto frontier between bandwidth efficiency and perception performance."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) excel in program synthesis, yet their ability to autonomously navigate neural architecture design--balancing syntactic reliability, performance, and structural novelty--remains underexplored. We address this by placing a code-oriented LLM within a closed-loop synthesis framework, analyzing its evolution over 22 supervised fine-tuning cycles. The model synthesizes PyTorch convolutional networks which are validated, evaluated via low-fidelity performance signals (single-epoch accuracy), and filtered using a MinHash-Jaccard criterion to prevent structural redundancy. High-performing, novel architectures are converted into prompt-code pairs for iterative fine-tuning via parameter-efficient LoRA adaptation, initialized from the LEMUR dataset. Across cycles, the LLM internalizes empirical architectural priors, becoming a robust generator. The valid generation rate stabilizes at 50.6 percent (peaking at 74.5 percent), while mean first-epoch accuracy rises from 28.06 percent to 50.99 percent, and the fraction of candidates exceeding 40 percent accuracy grows from 2.04 percent to 96.81 percent. Analyses confirm the model moves beyond replicating existing motifs, synthesizing 455 high-performing architectures absent from the original corpus. By grounding code synthesis in execution feedback, this work provides a scalable blueprint for transforming stochastic generators into autonomous, performance-driven neural designers, establishing that LLMs can internalize empirical, non-textual rewards to transcend their training data."

Previous research was mainly focused on a particular protocol with a single selfish miner, while only limited studies have been conducted on two or more attackers. To address this gap, we proposed a stochastic simulation framework that enables analysis of selfish mining with multiple attackers across various consensus protocols. We created the model of Proof-of-Work (PoW) Nakamoto consensus (serving as the baseline) as well as models of two additional consensus protocols designed to mitigate selfish mining: Fruitchain and Strongchain. Using our framework, thresholds reported in the literature were verified, and several novel thresholds were discovered for 2 and more attackers. We made the source code of our framework available, enabling researchers to evaluate any newly added protocol with one or more selfish miners and cross-compare it with already modeled protocols."

    "abstract": "The equation-of-state (EOS) parameter $φ\\equiv P/\\varepsilon$, defined as the ratio of pressure to energy density, encapsulates the fundamental response of matter under extreme compression. Its value at the center of the most massive neutron star (NS), $\\x \\equiv φ_{\\rm c} = P_{\\rm c}/\\varepsilon_{\\rm c}$, sets a universal upper bound on the maximum denseness attainable by any form of visible matter anywhere in the Universe. Remarkably, owing to the intrinsically nonlinear structure of the EOS in General Relativity (GR), this bound is forced to lie far below the naive Special Relativity (SR) limit of unity. In this work, we refine the theoretical upper bound on $\\x$ in a self-consistent manner by incorporating, in addition to the causality constraint from SR, the mass-sphere stability condition associated with the mass evolution pattern in the vicinity of the NS center. This condition is formulated within the intrinsic-and-perturbative analysis of the dimensionless Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equations (IPAD-TOV) framework. The combined constraints yield an improved bound, $\\x \\lesssim 0.385$, which is slightly above but fully consistent with the previously derived causal-only limit, $\\x \\lesssim 0.374$. We further derive an improved scaling relation for NS compactness and verify its universality across a broad set of 284 realistic EOSs, including models with first-order phase transitions, exotic degrees of freedom, continuous crossover behavior, and deconfined quark cores. The resulting bound on $\\x$ thus provides a new, EOS-independent window into the microphysics of cold superdense matter compressed by strong-field gravity in GR."

    "abstract": "Nonseparability - multipartite states that cannot be factorized - is one of the most striking features of quantum mechanics, as it gives rise to entanglement and non-causal correlations. In quantum computing, it also contributes directly to the computational advantage of quantum computers over its digital counterparts. In this work, we introduce a simple mechanism that frames nonseparability as a time-averaged manifestation of an underlying oscillatory process within state space. The central idea is the inclusion of auxiliary angular frequencies that modulate the temporal evolution of composite states. These additional dynamical degrees of freedom act as coherence channels through which nonseparability is mediated. While the proposed formalism could eventually serve as an alternative theoretical handle on the mechanisms of quantum entanglement, its greater significance lies in opening practical routes for simulating multipartite entanglement in controlled classical wave systems."

Contrary to the widely held expectation that the Unruh effect inevitably degrades initially maximal entanglement, we demonstrate that the 1-3 bipartite entanglement of the $CL_4$ state remains strictly maximal for all accelerations, including the infinite-acceleration limit. This result uncovers a previously unexplored phenomenon, namely the ``complete freezing of initially maximal entanglement\" under relativistic motion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first identification and systematic characterization of such a phenomenon within a relativistic framework. These findings overturn the conventional view that acceleration universally diminishes maximal entanglement and establish the $CL_4$ state as a promising resource for quantum information processing in non-inertial or curved-spacetime settings."

It is shown that an effective attraction between conduction electrons leads to $η$-pairing. The electron-electron pairing mechanism explains the presence of superconductivity at high temperatures experimentally observed in hydrogen-rich materials at high pressure."

However, it is well-known that acoustic information is intrinsically \\textit{heterogeneous}, entangling attributes such as speech, music, and environmental context. Existing research is limited to a dense, parameter-shared adapter to model these diverse patterns, which induces \\textit{gradient conflict} during optimization, as parameter updates required for distinct attributes contradict each other. To address this limitation, we introduce the \\textit{\\textbf{MoE-Adapter}}, a sparse Mixture-of-Experts~(MoE) architecture designed to decouple acoustic information. Specifically, it employs a dynamic gating mechanism that routes audio tokens to specialized experts capturing complementary feature subspaces while retaining shared experts for global context, thereby mitigating gradient conflicts and enabling fine-grained feature learning. Comprehensive experiments show that the MoE-Adapter achieves superior performance on both audio semantic and paralinguistic tasks, consistently outperforming dense linear baselines with comparable computational costs. Furthermore, we will release the related code and models to facilitate future research."

Many applications are moving to blockchain adoption, enabling users to work in a trustworthy manner. The early generations of blockchain have a problem; they cannot share information with other blockchains. As more and more entities move their applications to the blockchain, they generate large volumes of data, and as applications have become more complex, sharing information between different blockchains has become a necessity. This has led to the research and development of interoperable solutions allowing blockchains to connect together. This paper discusses a few blockchain platforms that provide interoperable solutions, emphasising their ability to connect heterogeneous blockchains. It also discusses a case study scenario to illustrate the importance and benefits of using interoperable solutions. We also present a few topics that need to be solved in the realm of interoperability."

In this work, we address a fundamental question: what is the minimum number of free parameters required to accurately represent numerical solutions of the GS equation under fixed-boundary conditions? We demonstrate that, for most practical applications, GS equilibria can be represented using only 2--5 free parameters while maintaining relative errors below 5\\%. For higher-accuracy requirements, we introduce a unified spectral representation based on the Miller extended harmonic (MXH) expansion in the poloidal direction combined with shifted Chebyshev (Cheb) polynomials in the radial direction. This MXH--Cheb basis exhibits rapid convergence for two-dimensional GS equilibria. For configurations where three geometric moments (shift, elongation, and triangularity) are specified at the last closed flux surface (LCFS), relative errors on the order of $10^{-2}$--$10^{-3}$ can be achieved using as few as 13--20 parameters. In more general cases, including up--down asymmetric equilibria, X-point configurations, and stiff pressure and current profiles (e.g., H-mode pedestals), accuracies beyond this level can be obtained with fewer than 100 parameters. The resulting equilibrium configurations and profile functions are fully analytical, with smooth derivatives of all orders. These results provide a systematic foundation for developing high-fidelity, ultra-fast GS solvers and enable efficient reduced-order and AI-based surrogate modeling of tokamak equilibria."

An inhibited peak heat flux and preheat of the conductive heat flux are observed, which are expected from physical arguments and previous kinetic studies. Nonlocal behavior of other transport fluxes, namely the Righi-Leduc, Peltier, Ettingshausen, Nernst, thermal force, friction, cross friction, viscous stress, and gyroviscous stress terms are also demonstrated. Neglecting the nonlinear component of the Fokker-Planck collision operator is justified a posteriori.

    "abstract": "In large-scale resource-constrained wireless networks, such as those prevalent in the Internet of Things (IoT), efficient communication scheduling remains a critical challenge. Among the various approaches, Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) protocols have been widely adopted for their structured and collision-free communication capabilities. Nevertheless, despite extensive research in this area, current solutions often exhibit suboptimal performance, particularly in dynamic environments where node activity levels fluctuate over time. This paper introduces a novel fully distributed TDMA-based scheduling protocol that intelligently maximizes the utilization of communication resources. The proposed approach adaptively reallocates underutilized time slots, originally assigned to temporarily inactive nodes, to those experiencing higher communication demands. This dynamic reallocation not only improves channel utilization but also reduces idle periods, thereby enhancing overall network efficiency. To further enhance performance, we incorporate a lightweight probabilistic mechanism that governs the temporal leasing of unused slots. This mechanism balances the trade-off between slot availability and transmission reliability, minimizing packet loss while preserving fairness and stability within the network. Simulations across a range of network scenarios demonstrate that our protocol significantly improves throughput, latency, and reliability in resource-constrained environments. These results highlight the protocol's potential as a robust and scalable solution for adaptive and energy-efficient scheduling in next-generation IoT networks."

In this work, we introduce PrismVAU, a lightweight yet effective system for real-time VAU that leverages a single off-the-shelf MLLM for anomaly scoring, explanation, and prompt optimization. PrismVAU operates in two complementary stages: (1) a coarse anomaly scoring module that computes frame-level anomaly scores via similarity to textual anchors, and (2) an MLLM-based refinement module that contextualizes anomalies through system and user prompts. Both textual anchors and prompts are optimized with a weakly supervised Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) framework. Extensive experiments on standard VAD benchmarks demonstrate that PrismVAU delivers competitive detection performance and interpretable anomaly explanations -- without relying on instruction tuning, frame-level annotations, and external modules or dense processing -- making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world applications."

Additionally, hybridization displaces part of the Au wavefunction in regions of large electrostatic potential gradient, thereby enhancing spin-orbit splitting.

In this study, we present a systematic analysis of logical reasoning under controlled increases in logical complexity, and reveal a previously unrecognized phenomenon, which we term Logical Phase Transitions: rather than degrading smoothly, logical reasoning performance remains stable within a regime but collapses abruptly beyond a critical logical depth, mirroring physical phase transitions such as water freezing beyond a critical temperature threshold. Building on this insight, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Curriculum Tuning, a principled framework that adaptively aligns natural language with logical symbols to establish a shared representation, and reshapes training dynamics around phase-transition boundaries to progressively strengthen reasoning at increasing logical depths. Experiments on five benchmarks show that our approach effectively mitigates logical reasoning collapse at high complexity, yielding average accuracy gains of +1.26 in naive prompting and +3.95 in CoT, while improving generalization to unseen logical compositions.

In this paper, we describe the \"Takano_UTokyo_03\" system submitted to XACLE Challenge. Our approach leverages a CLAPScore-based architecture integrated with a novel training method called Standardized Preference Optimization (SPO). SPO standardizes the raw alignment scores provided by each listener, enabling the model to learn relative preferences and mitigate the impact of individual scoring biases. Additionally, we employ listener screening to exclude listeners with inconsistent ratings. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that both SPO and listener screening effectively improve the correlation with human judgment. Our system achieved 6th place in the challenge with a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) of 0.6142, demonstrating competitive performance within a marginal gap from the top-ranked systems.

Existence, uniqueness, and temporal regularity of mild solutions are established by Laplace transform techniques and contour integration, leading to the construction of associated resolvent families. A unified resolvent framework is developed, enabling a precise comparison between ABC and W dynamics and clarifying the influence of rational memory kernels on decay and smoothing properties. Several examples, including fractional diffusion-type equations, illustrate the abstract theory and highlight the impact of non-singular memory on long-time behavior."

Gridded forecasts from classical numerical weather prediction or data-driven models often lack the necessary precision due to unresolved local effects. Typical statistical postprocessing methods correct these biases, but often degrade spatio-temporal correlation structures in doing so. Recent works based on generative modeling successfully improve spatial correlation structures but have to forecast every lead time independently. In contrast, STIPP makes joint spatio-temporal forecasts which have increased accuracy for surface temperature, wind, relative humidity and precipitation when compared to baseline methods. It makes hourly ensemble predictions given only a six-hourly deterministic forecast, blending the boundaries of postprocessing and temporal interpolation. By leveraging a multivariate proper scoring rule for training, STIPP contributes to ongoing work data-driven atmospheric models supervised only with distribution marginals."

We present several key adaptations to diffusion models, which are important in this discrete setting. Notably, we show that a location-aware palette with our 2D gray code ordering improves performance. Adding a final tanh activation function is crucial for discrete data. On optimizing diffusion parameters, the sigmoid loss weighting consistently outperforms alternatives, regardless of the prediction type used, and we settle on x-prediction. While our current model does not yet surpass leading mask-based architectures, it narrows the performance gap and introduces unique capabilities, such as principled ambiguity modeling, that these models lack. All models were trained from scratch, and we believe that combining our proposed improvements with large-scale pretraining or promptable conditioning could lead to competitive models."

The research addresses a critical theoretical gap in existing approaches that empirically combine textual and numerical data without a formal understanding of their interaction mechanisms. We conceptualise a prompt-based LLM as a mathematically defined signal generator, capable of extracting directional market sentiment and an associated confidence score from financial news. These signals are then dynamically fused with structured historical price features through a noise-robust gating mechanism, enabling the Transformer to adaptively weigh semantic and quantitative information. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed Hybrid LLM-Transformer model significantly outperforms a Vanilla Transformer baseline, reducing the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) by 5.28% (p = 0.003). Moreover, ablation and robustness analyses confirm the model's stability under noisy conditions and its capacity to maintain interpretability through confidence-weighted attention. The findings provide both theoretical and empirical support for a paradigm shift from empirical observation to formalised modelling of LLM-Transformer interactions, paving the way toward explainable, noise-resilient, and semantically enriched financial forecasting systems."

This paper presents a Swin Transformer UNet 3D (SwinUNet3D) framework for lesion segmentation in Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (FDG-PET/CT) scans. By combining shifted window self-attention with U-Net style skip connections, the model captures both global context and fine anatomical detail. We evaluate SwinUNet3D on the AutoPET III FDG dataset and compare it against a baseline 3D U-Net. Results show that SwinUNet3D achieves a Dice score of 0.88 and IoU of 0.78, surpassing 3D U-Net (Dice 0.48, IoU 0.32) while also delivering faster inference times. Qualitative analysis demonstrates improved detection of small and irregular lesions, reduced false positives, and more accurate PET/CT fusion. While the framework is currently limited to FDG scans and trained under modest GPU resources, it establishes a strong foundation for future multi-tracer, multi-center evaluations and benchmarking against other transformer-based architectures. Overall, SwinUNet3D represents an efficient and robust approach to PET/CT lesion segmentation, advancing the integration of transformer-based models into oncology imaging workflows."

Based on the NE2001 model and using 92 localized and 574 unlocalized non-repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) at Galactic latitudes $|b|>15^\\circ$, we find a significant dipole anisotropy in $\\mathrm{DM_{halo}}$, pointing toward $(l=130^\\circ,\\, b=+5^\\circ)$ with a $1σ$ uncertainty of approximately $28^\\circ$. The $\\mathrm{DM_{halo}}$ value in this direction is $63\\pm9~\\mathrm{pc~cm^{-3}}$, exceeding the all-sky mean by about $2.6σ$. This result is not significantly affected by the choice of Galactic ISM models. Furthermore, even when using a refined sample of 62 localized FRBs (excluding CHIME detections, repeaters, and unlocalized events), the dipole anisotropic structure persists, with a direction of $(l=141^\\circ,\\, b=+51^\\circ)$ and a larger 1$σ$ uncertainty of $\\sim 44^\\circ$. Model comparisons using the Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian evidence yield consistent preferences, and together they suggest that current FRB data slightly favor the existence of a dipole structure in $\\mathrm{DM_{halo}}$. If this feature is not a statistical fluctuation or systematic error, its physical origin requires further investigation. Future FRB samples with larger sizes and more complete sky coverage will be essential to confirm or refute this possible anisotropic structure."

This study analyzes ICD-10 chapter-level morbidity and multidimensional poverty as outcomes embedded in a spatial interaction network. Interpreting Thailand's 76 provinces as nodes within a fixed-degree regional graph, we apply tools from spatial econometrics and social network analysis, including Moran's I, Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA), and Spatial Durbin Models (SDM), to assess spatial dependence and cross-provincial spillovers. Our findings reveal strong spatial clustering across multiple ICD-10 chapters, with persistent high-high morbidity zones, particularly for digestive, respiratory, musculoskeletal, and symptom-based diseases, emerging in well-defined regional belts. SDM estimates demonstrate that spillover effects from neighboring provinces frequently exceed the influence of local deprivation, especially for living-condition, health-access, accessibility, and poor-household indicators. These patterns are consistent with contagion and contextual influence processes well established in social network theory. By framing morbidity and poverty as interdependent attributes on a spatial network, this study contributes to the growing literature on structural diffusion, health inequality, and regional vulnerability. The results highlight the importance of coordinated policy interventions across provincial boundaries and demonstrate how network-based modeling can uncover the spatial dynamics of health and deprivation."

The electronic transport in these compounds is governed by electron-phonon and electron-magnon scattering and shows anomalous Hall resistivity $ρ^A_{xy}$. Our analysis indicates that the anomalous Hall effect arises from contributions of skew scattering and intrinsic Berry curvature mechanisms, with electron-phonon and electron-magnon scattering playing an important role in skew scattering at high temperatures.

To examine whether LLMs released by Chinese and U.S. developers exhibit cultural differences in Chinese-language settings, we evaluate their performance on questions about Chinese culture. This study adopts a direct-questioning paradigm to evaluate models such as GPT-5.1, DeepSeek-V3.2, Qwen3-Max, and Gemini2.5Pro. We assess their understanding of traditional Chinese culture, including history, literature, poetry, and related domains. Comparative analyses between LLMs developed in China and the U.S. indicate that Chinese models generally outperform their U.S. counterparts on these tasks. Among U.S.-developed models, Gemini 2.5Pro and GPT-5.1 achieve relatively higher accuracy. The observed performance differences may potentially arise from variations in training data distribution, localization strategies, and the degree of emphasis on Chinese cultural content during model development."

    "abstract": "Community detection seeks to recover mesoscopic structure from network data that may be binary, count-valued, signed, directed, weighted, or multilayer. The stochastic block model (SBM) explains such structure by positing a latent partition of nodes and block-specific edge distributions. In Bayesian SBMs, standard MCMC alternates between updating the partition and sampling block parameters, which can hinder mixing and complicate principled comparison across different partitions and numbers of communities. We develop a collapsed Bayesian SBM framework in which block-specific nuisance parameters are analytically integrated out under conjugate priors, so the marginal likelihood p(Y|z) depends only on the partition z and blockwise sufficient statistics. This yields fast local Gibbs/Metropolis updates based on ratios of closed-form integrated likelihoods and provides evidence-based complexity control that discourages gratuitous over-partitioning. We derive exact collapsed marginals for the most common SBM edge types-Beta-Bernoulli (binary), Gamma-Poisson (counts), and Normal-Inverse-Gamma (Gaussian weights)-and we extend collapsing to gap-constrained SBMs via truncated conjugate priors that enforce explicit upper bounds on between-community connectivity. We further show that the same collapsed strategy supports directed SBMs that model reciprocity through dyad states, signed SBMs via categorical block models, and multiplex SBMs where multiple layers contribute additive evidence for a shared partition. Across synthetic benchmarks and real networks (including email communication, hospital contact counts, and citation graphs), collapsed inference produces accurate partitions and interpretable posterior block summaries of within- and between-community interaction strengths while remaining computationally simple and modular."

Specifically, it achieves simultaneous optimization across global modules of uplink AI/ML-based joint source-channel coding with modulation, and downlink AI/ML-based modulation with precoding and corresponding data detection, reducing traditional inter-module information barriers to facilitate end-to-end optimization toward global objectives. Moreover, multiple enhancement mechanisms are also proposed, including i) an AI/ML-based cross-layer modulation approach with theoretical analysis for downlink transmission that breaks the isolation of inter-layer features to expand the solution space for determining improved constellation, ii) a utility-oriented precoder construction method that shifts the role of the AI/ML-based CSI feedback decoder from recovering the original CSI to directly generating precoding matrices aiming to improve end-to-end performance, and iii) incorporating modulation into AI/ML-based CSI feedback to bypass bit-level bottlenecks that introduce quantization errors, non-differentiable gradients, and limitations in constellation solution spaces. Furthermore, AI/ML based control agents for optimized transmission schemes are proposed that leverage AI/ML to perform model switching according to channel state, thereby enabling integrated control for global throughput optimization. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed solutions in terms of BLER and throughput. These extensive simulations employ more practical assumptions that are aligned with the requirements of the 3GPP, which hopefully provides valuable insights for future standardization discussions."

We study local decision-theoretic robustness by allowing the posterior to vary within a small Kullback-Leibler neighborhood and choosing actions that minimize worst-case posterior expected loss. Exploiting low-dimensional functionals available under exchangeability, we (i) adapt decision-theoretic robustness to exchangeable graphs via graphon limits and derive sharp small-radius expansions of robust posterior risk; under squared loss the leading inflation is controlled by the posterior variance of the loss, and for robustness indices that diverge at percolation/fragmentation thresholds we obtain a universal critical exponent describing the explosion of decision uncertainty near criticality. (ii) Develop a nonparametric minimax theory for robust model selection between sparse Erdos-Renyi and block models, showing-via robustness error exponents-that no Bayesian or frequentist method can uniformly improve upon the decision-theoretic limits over configuration models and sparse graphon classes for percolation-type functionals. (iii) Propose a practical algorithm based on entropic tilting of posterior or variational samples, and demonstrate it on functional brain connectivity and Karnataka village social networks."

    "abstract": "Blockchain plays a crucial role in ensuring the security and integrity of decentralized systems, with the proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism being fundamental for achieving distributed consensus. As PoW blockchains see broader adoption, an increasingly diverse set of miners with varying computing capabilities participate in the network. In this paper, we consider the PoW blockchain mining, where the miners are associated with resource uncertainties. To characterize the uncertainty computing resources at different mining participants, we establish an ambiguous set representing uncertainty of resource distributions. Then, the networked mining is formulated as a non-cooperative game, where distributionally robust performance is calculated for each individual miner to tackle the resource uncertainties. We prove the existence of the equilibrium of the distributionally robust mining game. To derive the equilibrium, we propose the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR)-based reinterpretation of the best response of each miner. We then solve the individual strategy with alternating optimization, which facilitates the iteration among miners towards the game equilibrium. Furthermore, we consider the case that the ambiguity of resource distribution reduces to Gaussian distribution and the case that another uncertainties vanish, and then characterize the properties of the equilibrium therein along with a distributed algorithm to achieve the equilibrium. Simulation results show that the proposed approaches effectively converge to the equilibrium, and effectively tackle the uncertainties in blockchain mining to achieve a robust performance guarantee."

MOFs, a versatile class of crystalline porous materials, have garnered significant attention due to their unique properties and broad potential applications in gas storage, separation, catalysis, and sensing. Among them, Zr-based MOFs stand out for their exceptional stability and high surface area. This research systematically investigates six key Zr-based MOFs (UIO-66, UIO-67, UIO-68, MOF-801, MOF-802, and MOF-841) using multiscale computational methods, including molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, and density functional theory (DFT). The study explores the impact of metal ion substitution (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) on the mechanical and hydrogen storage properties of these MOFs. Our findings reveal that metal ion substitution significantly influences the mechanical stability and hydrogen adsorption capacity of Zr-based MOFs, providing valuable insights for the design and optimization of high-performance MOF materials."

    "abstract": "We introduce Textile IR, a bidirectional intermediate representation that connects manufacturing-valid CAD, physics-based simulation, and lifecycle assessment for fashion design. Unlike existing siloed tools where pattern software guarantees sewable outputs but understands nothing about drape, and physics simulation predicts behaviour but cannot automatically fix patterns, Textile IR provides the semantic glue for integration through a seven-layer Verification Ladder -- from cheap syntactic checks (pattern closure, seam compatibility) to expensive physics validation (drape simulation, stress analysis). The architecture enables bidirectional feedback: simulation failures suggest pattern modifications; material substitutions update sustainability estimates in real time; uncertainty propagates across the pipeline with explicit confidence bounds. We formalise fashion engineering as constraint satisfaction over three domains and demonstrate how Textile IR's scene-graph representation enables AI systems to manipulate garments as structured programs rather than pixel arrays. The framework addresses the compound uncertainty problem: when measurement errors in material testing, simulation approximations, and LCA database gaps combine, sustainability claims become unreliable without explicit uncertainty tracking. We propose six research priorities and discuss deployment considerations for fashion SMEs where integrated workflows reduce specialised engineering requirements. Key contribution: a formal representation that makes engineering constraints perceptible, manipulable, and immediately consequential -- enabling designers to navigate sustainability, manufacturability, and aesthetic tradeoffs simultaneously rather than discovering conflicts after costly physical prototyping."

    "abstract": "We explore the transition from the $Λ$CDM to an interacting dark sector by introducing a model with a redshift threshold that controls the onset of the energy transfer between the dark energy and the dark matter. Below the transition redshift, the interaction between dark matter and dark energy becomes active, while at earlier times the cosmological evolution coincides with that of $Λ$CDM. This approach allows us to determine the epoch in the comic history where the interacting effects have an impact in the description of the dark sector. We constrain the free parameters of the model using late-time cosmological observations, namely Cosmic Chronometers, DESI DR2 Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations, and Supernova data from the Pantheon Plus, Union3.0, and DES-Dovekie catalogues. The analysis provides an indication of a strong interacting term that describes energy transfer from dark energy to dark matter, which is activated at low redshifts. The PantheonPlus sample provides a threshold of $z_{T}<0.624$, the Union3.0 sample yields $z_{T}=0.400_{-0.23}^{+0.021}$, and the DES-Dovekie sample gives $z_{T}=0.371_{-0.26}^{+0.028}$. The model fits the data in a similar way to the CPL parametrization, without the dark energy to cross the phantom divide line."

However, none of these simple systems are chemical dynamical systems (CDSs) - a special subset of polynomial DSs that model the dynamics of mass-action chemical reaction networks (CRNs). In particular, only a small number of three-dimensional quadratic CDSs with chaos are reported, all of which have at least 9 monomials and at least 3 quadratics, with CRNs containing at least 7 reactions and at least 3 quadratic ones. To bridge this gap, in this paper we prove some basic properties of chaotic CDSs, including that those in three dimensions have at least 6 monomials, at least one of which is negative and quadratic. We then use these results to computationally find 20 chaotic three-dimensional CDSs with 6 monomials and as few as 4 quadratics, or 7 monomials and as few as 2 quadratics. At the CRN level, some of these systems have 4 reactions of which only 3 are quadratic, or 5 reactions with only 2 being quadratic. These results quantify structural complexity of chaotic CDSs, and indicate that they are ubiquitous."

    "abstract": "Earth vision has achieved milestones in geospatial object recognition but lacks exploration in object-relational reasoning, limiting comprehensive scene understanding. To address this, a progressive Earth vision-language understanding and generation framework is proposed, including a multi-task dataset (EarthVLSet) and a semantic-guided network (EarthVLNet). Focusing on city planning applications, EarthVLSet includes 10.9k sub-meter resolution remote sensing images, land-cover masks, and 761.5k textual pairs involving both multiple-choice and open-ended visual question answering (VQA) tasks. In an object-centric way, EarthVLNet is proposed to progressively achieve semantic segmentation, relational reasoning, and comprehensive understanding. The first stage involves land-cover segmentation to generate object semantics for VQA guidance. Guided by pixel-wise semantics, the object awareness based large language model (LLM) performs relational reasoning and knowledge summarization to generate the required answers. As for optimization, the numerical difference loss is proposed to dynamically add difference penalties, addressing the various objects' statistics. Three benchmarks, including semantic segmentation, multiple-choice, and open-ended VQA demonstrated the superiorities of EarthVLNet, yielding three future directions: 1) segmentation features consistently enhance VQA performance even in cross-dataset scenarios; 2) multiple-choice tasks show greater sensitivity to the vision encoder than to the language decoder; and 3) open-ended tasks necessitate advanced vision encoders and language decoders for an optimal performance. We believe this dataset and method will provide a beneficial benchmark that connects ''image-mask-text'', advancing geographical applications for Earth vision."

MiMo-V2-Flash adopts a hybrid attention architecture that interleaves Sliding Window Attention (SWA) with global attention, with a 128-token sliding window under a 5:1 hybrid ratio. The model is pre-trained on 27 trillion tokens with Multi-Token Prediction (MTP), employing a native 32k context length and subsequently extended to 256k. To efficiently scale post-training compute, MiMo-V2-Flash introduces a novel Multi-Teacher On-Policy Distillation (MOPD) paradigm. In this framework, domain-specialized teachers (e.g., trained via large-scale reinforcement learning) provide dense and token-level reward, enabling the student model to perfectly master teacher expertise. MiMo-V2-Flash rivals top-tier open-weight models such as DeepSeek-V3.2 and Kimi-K2, despite using only 1/2 and 1/3 of their total parameters, respectively. During inference, by repurposing MTP as a draft model for speculative decoding, MiMo-V2-Flash achieves up to 3.6 acceptance length and 2.6x decoding speedup with three MTP layers. We open-source both the model weights and the three-layer MTP weights to foster open research and community collaboration."

    "abstract": "Human-like dexterous hands with multiple fingers offer human-level manipulation capabilities, but training control policies that can directly deploy on real hardware remains difficult due to contact-rich physics and imperfect actuation. We close this gap with a practical sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) framework that utilizes dense tactile feedback combined with joint torque sensing to explicitly regulate physical interactions. To enable effective sim-to-real transfer, we introduce (i) a computationally fast tactile simulation that computes distances between dense virtual tactile units and the object via parallel forward kinematics, providing high-rate, high-resolution touch signals needed by RL; (ii) a current-to-torque calibration that eliminates the need for torque sensors on dexterous hands by mapping motor current to joint torque; and (iii) actuator dynamics modeling to bridge the actuation gaps with randomization of non-ideal effects such as backlash, torque-speed saturation. Using an asymmetric actor-critic PPO pipeline trained entirely in simulation, our policies deploy directly to a five-finger hand. The resulting policies demonstrated two essential skills: (1) command-based, controllable grasp force tracking, and (2) reorientation of objects in the hand, both of which were robustly executed without fine-tuning on the robot. By combining tactile and torque in the observation space with effective sensing/actuation modeling, our system provides a practical solution to achieve reliable dexterous manipulation. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of controllable grasping on a multi-finger dexterous hand trained entirely in simulation and transferred zero-shot on real hardware."

    "abstract": "Visual abductive reasoning (VAR) is a challenging task that requires AI systems to infer the most likely explanation for incomplete visual observations. While recent MLLMs develop strong general-purpose multimodal reasoning capabilities, they fall short in abductive inference, as compared to human beings. To bridge this gap, we draw inspiration from the interplay between verbal and pictorial abduction in human cognition, and propose to strengthen abduction of MLLMs by mimicking such dual-mode behavior. Concretely, we introduce AbductiveMLLM comprising of two synergistic components: REASONER and IMAGINER. The REASONER operates in the verbal domain. It first explores a broad space of possible explanations using a blind LLM and then prunes visually incongruent hypotheses based on cross-modal causal alignment. The remaining hypotheses are introduced into the MLLM as targeted priors, steering its reasoning toward causally coherent explanations. The IMAGINER, on the other hand, further guides MLLMs by emulating human-like pictorial thinking. It conditions a text-to-image diffusion model on both the input video and the REASONER's output embeddings to \"imagine\" plausible visual scenes that correspond to verbal explanation, thereby enriching MLLMs' contextual grounding. The two components are trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on standard VAR benchmarks show that AbductiveMLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming traditional solutions and advanced MLLMs."

Smith Telescope. The source was originally discovered in the UKIRT Wide-field Infrared Survey for Fe+ (UWIFE; Lee et al. 2014). Our spectra reveal multiple kinematic components in the [Fe II] 1.644 um emission. The high-velocity components exhibit elevated [Fe II]/Br gamma ratios characteristic of shock excitation, while the low-velocity components are dominated by hydrogen and helium recombination lines and are consistent with photoionized gas, indicating an H II-region origin. G25.8+0.2 lies within the G26 complex, a large (~15'x 30', corresponding to ~28 pc x 57 pc at a distance of 6.5 kpc) star-forming region in the inner Galaxy. The shock-excited [Fe II] filaments closely trace the morphology of the bright radio shell that partially encloses centrally filled soft X-ray emission, strongly suggesting recent supernova activity in this region. We discuss the physical nature of G25.8+0.2 and its relationship to the surrounding G26 star-forming complex. In addition, we derive the extinction toward the source using Brackett-line ratios and constrain the spectral types of the dominant ionizing stars from the He I 2.058 um/Br gamma line ratios."

We identify three critical limitations: (a) fixed user-defined parameters (e.g., voxel size, search radius) that fail to generalize across varying scales, (b) learned keypoint detectors exhibit poor cross-domain transferability, and (c) absolute coordinates amplify scale mismatches between datasets. To address these three issues, we present BUFFER-X, a training-free registration framework that achieves zero-shot generalization through: (a) geometric bootstrapping for automatic hyperparameter estimation, (b) distribution-aware farthest point sampling to replace learned detectors, and (c) patch-level coordinate normalization to ensure scale consistency. Our approach employs hierarchical multi-scale matching to extract correspondences across local, middle, and global receptive fields, enabling robust registration in diverse environments. For efficiency-critical applications, we introduce BUFFER-X-Lite, which reduces total computation time by 43% (relative to BUFFER-X) through early exit strategies and fast pose solvers while preserving accuracy. We evaluate on a comprehensive benchmark comprising 12 datasets spanning object-scale, indoor, and outdoor scenes, including cross-sensor registration between heterogeneous LiDAR configurations.

AVOID reformulates early detection as a new paradigm of evidence generation, where propagation signals are actively simulated rather than passively observed. Leveraging LLM-powered agents with differentiated roles and data-driven personas, AVOID realistically constructs early-stage diffusion behaviors without requiring real propagation data. The resulting virtual trajectories provide complementary social evidence that enriches content-based detection, while a denoising-guided fusion strategy aligns simulated propagation with content semantics. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that AVOID consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the effectiveness and practical value of virtual propagation augmentation for early fake news detection.

Existing blockchain-based platforms leverage verifiable credentials but typically lack automated skill-credential generation and the ability to incorporate unstructured evidence of learning. In this paper,a privacy-preserving, AI-enabled decentralized LER system is proposed to address these gaps. Digitally signed transcripts from educational institutions are accepted, and verifiable self-issued skill credentials are derived inside a trusted execution environment (TEE) by a natural language processing pipeline that analyzes formal records (e.g., transcripts, syllabi) and informal artifacts. All verification and job-skill matching are performed inside the enclave with selective disclosure, so raw credentials and private keys remain enclave-confined. Job matching relies solely on attested skill vectors and is invariant to non-skill resume fields, thereby reducing opportunities for screening bias.The NLP component was evaluated on sample learner data; the mapping follows the validated Syllabus-to-O*NET methodology,and a stability test across repeated runs observed <5% variance in top-ranked skills. Formal security statements and proof sketches are provided showing that derived credentials are unforgeable and that sensitive information remains confidential. The proposed system thus supports secure education and employment credentialing, robust transcript verification,and automated, privacy-preserving skill extraction within a decentralized framework."

    "abstract": "We devise a technique to suppress the effect of noise transients occurring at gravitational-wave detectors based on temporal anticoincidence. Searches for gravitational-wave signals in the detector data are prone to spurious disturbances of terrestrial origin. The technique presented here benefits from the fact that such effects are generally non-coincident in time at geographically separated detectors. Therefore, abnormally loud triggers that are not time-coincident can be vetoed. We implement the veto technique in a matched-filter search for transient signals from binary black holes and observe search backgrounds to be generally close to the Gaussian limit. An improvement in the sensitivity of the search is demonstrated using simulated signals. The technique is expected to especially improve the detection efficiency of the search toward short duration transient signals."

    "abstract": "Optimal power flow (OPF) is one of the fundamental tasks for power system operations. While machine learning (ML) approaches such as deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely studied to enhance OPF solution speed and performance, their practical deployment faces two critical scaling questions: What is the minimum training data volume required for reliable results? How should ML models' complexity balance accuracy with real-time computational limits? Existing studies evaluate discrete scenarios without quantifying these scaling relationships, leading to trial-and-error-based ML development in real-world applications. This work presents the first systematic scaling study for ML-based OPF across two dimensions: data scale (0.1K-40K training samples) and compute scale (multiple NN architectures with varying FLOPs). Our results reveal consistent power-law relationships on both DNNs and physics-informed NNs (PINNs) between each resource dimension and three core performance metrics: prediction error (MAE), constraint violations and speed. We find that for ACOPF, the accuracy metric scales with dataset size and training compute. These scaling laws enable predictable and principled ML pipeline design for OPF. We further identify the divergence between prediction accuracy and constraint feasibility and characterize the compute-optimal frontier. This work provides quantitative guidance for ML-OPF design and deployments."

    "abstract": "Sentiment analysis focuses on identifying the emotional polarity expressed in textual data, typically categorized as positive, negative, or neutral. Hate speech detection, on the other hand, aims to recognize content that incites violence, discrimination, or hostility toward individuals or groups based on attributes such as race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion. Both tasks play a critical role in online content moderation by enabling the detection and mitigation of harmful or offensive material, thereby contributing to safer digital environments. In this study, we examine the performance of three transformer-based models: BERT-base-multilingual-cased, RoBERTa-base, and XLM-RoBERTa-base with the first eight layers frozen, for multilingual sentiment analysis and hate speech detection. The evaluation is conducted across five languages: English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and French. The models are compared using standard performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. To enhance model interpretability and provide deeper insight into prediction behavior, we integrate the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) framework, which highlights the contribution of individual words to the models decisions. By combining state-of-the-art transformer architectures with explainability techniques, this work aims to improve both the effectiveness and transparency of multilingual sentiment analysis and hate speech detection systems."

    "abstract": "The uniformly accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detector serves as a fundamental model in relativistic quantum metrology. While previous studies have mainly concentrated on single-parameter estimation via quantum Cramér-Rao bound, the multi-parameter case remains significantly underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the multiparameter estimation for a uniformly accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a vacuum scalar field in both bounded and unbounded Minkowski vacuum. Our analysis reveals that quantum Cramér-Rao bound fails to provide a tight error bound for the two-parameter estimation involving the initial phase and weight parameters. For this reason, we numerically compute two tighter error bounds, Holevo Cramér-Rao bound and Nagaoka bound, based on a semidefinite program. Notably, our results demonstrate that Nagaoka bound yields the tightest error bound among all the considered error bounds, consistent with the general hierarchy of multiparameter quantum estimation. In the case with a boundary, we observe the introduction of boundary systematically reduces the values of both Holevo Cramér-Rao bound and Nagaoka bound, indicating an improvement on the attainable estimation precision. These results offer valuable insights on and practical guidance for advancing multiparameter estimation in relativistic context."

    "abstract": "Optimization is fundamental across numerous disciplines, typically following an iterative process of refining an initial solution to enhance performance. This principle is equally critical in prompt engineering, where designing effective prompts for large language models constitutes a complex optimization challenge. A structured optimization approach requires automated or semi-automated procedures to develop improved prompts, thereby reducing manual effort, improving performance, and yielding an interpretable process. However, current prompt optimization methods often induce prompt drift, where new prompts fix prior failures but impair performance on previously successful tasks. Additionally, generating prompts from scratch can compromise interpretability. To address these limitations, this study proposes the Hierarchical Attribution Prompt Optimization (HAPO) framework, which introduces three innovations: (1) a dynamic attribution mechanism targeting error patterns in training data and prompting history, (2) semantic-unit optimization for editing functional prompt segments, and (3) multimodal-friendly progression supporting both end-to-end LLM and LLM-MLLM workflows. Applied in contexts like single/multi-image QA (e.g., OCRV2) and complex task analysis (e.g., BBH), HAPO demonstrates enhanced optimization efficiency, outperforming comparable automated prompt optimization methods and establishing an extensible paradigm for scalable prompt engineering."

We demonstrate that the tensor renormalization group (TRG) offers an efficient framework to compute the symmetry-twisted partition functions, which enables us to detect the symmetry-breaking transition and also to study associated critical phenomena. As concrete examples of SSB, we investigate the two-dimensional (2D) classical Ising model and the three-dimensional (3D) classical $O(2)$ nonlinear sigma model, and we identify their critical points solely from the twisted partition function. By employing the finite-size scaling argument, we find the critical temperature $T_c=2.2017(2)$ with the critical exponent $ν= 0.663(33)$ for the 3D $O(2)$ model. In addition, we also study the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) criticality of the 2D classical $O(2)$ model by extracting the helicity modulus from the twisted partition functions, and we obtain the BKT transition temperature, $T_{\\mathrm{BKT}}=0.8928(2)$."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world fact-checking systems, yet existing evaluations focus predominantly on claim verification and overlook the broader fact-checking workflow, including claim extraction and evidence retrieval. This narrow focus prevents current benchmarks from revealing systematic reasoning failures, factual blind spots, and robustness limitations of modern LLMs. To bridge this gap, we present FactArena, a fully automated arena-style evaluation framework that conducts comprehensive, stage-wise benchmarking of LLMs across the complete fact-checking pipeline. FactArena integrates three key components: (i) an LLM-driven fact-checking process that standardizes claim decomposition, evidence retrieval via tool-augmented interactions, and justification-based verdict prediction; (ii) an arena-styled judgment mechanism guided by consolidated reference guidelines to ensure unbiased and consistent pairwise comparisons across heterogeneous judge agents; and (iii) an arena-driven claim-evolution module that adaptively generates more challenging and semantically controlled claims to probe LLMs' factual robustness beyond fixed seed data. Across 16 state-of-the-art LLMs spanning seven model families, FactArena produces stable and interpretable rankings. Our analyses further reveal significant discrepancies between static claim-verification accuracy and end-to-end fact-checking competence, highlighting the necessity of holistic evaluation. The proposed framework offers a scalable and trustworthy paradigm for diagnosing LLMs' factual reasoning, guiding future model development, and advancing the reliable deployment of LLMs in safety-critical fact-checking applications."

    "abstract": "Feature selection is essential for high-dimensional biomedical data, enabling stronger predictive performance, reduced computational cost, and improved interpretability in precision medicine applications. Existing approaches face notable challenges. Filter methods are highly scalable but cannot capture complex relationships or eliminate redundancy. Deep learning-based approaches can model nonlinear patterns but often lack stability, interpretability, and efficiency at scale. Single-head attention improves interpretability but is limited in capturing multi-level dependencies and remains sensitive to initialization, reducing reproducibility. Most existing methods rarely combine statistical interpretability with the representational power of deep learning, particularly in ultra-high-dimensional settings. Here, we introduce MAFS (Multi-head Attention-based Feature Selection), a hybrid framework that integrates statistical priors with deep learning capabilities. MAFS begins with filter-based priors for stable initialization and guide learning. It then uses multi-head attention to examine features from multiple perspectives in parallel, capturing complex nonlinear relationships and interactions. Finally, a reordering module consolidates outputs across attention heads, resolving conflicts and minimizing information loss to generate robust and consistent feature rankings. This design combines statistical guidance with deep modeling capacity, yielding interpretable importance scores while maximizing retention of informative signals. Across simulated and real-world datasets, including cancer gene expression and Alzheimer's disease data, MAFS consistently achieves superior coverage and stability compared with existing filter-based and deep learning-based alternatives, offering a scalable, interpretable, and robust solution for feature selection in high-dimensional biomedical data."

The measured masses and radii indicate the presence of volatile-rich gaseous envelopes on both planets.

Combined with the low mutual inclination constrained by the photodynamical analysis ($ΔI < 8.7\\,\\mathrm{deg}$), the planetary orbits are likely coplanar and aligned with the host star's spin axis. We show that the planets are near, but not in, the 2:1 MMR, with a circulating resonant angle. We also find substantial free eccentricity for the inner planet, TOI-4495 b ($e_b = 0.078^{+0.020}_{-0.013}$). Given the observed proximity to the 2:1 resonance and the more massive outer planet, TOI-4495 b and c are particularly susceptible to resonant overstability, which can convert resonantly excited eccentricity into free eccentricity. However, additional mechanisms (e.g., planetesimal scattering) may be required to further excite the eccentricity by $\\sim 4\\%$. To prevent tidal damping from reducing the eccentricity below the observed level over the star's lifetime (1.9 Gyr), the reduced tidal quality factor of TOI-4495 b must be $Q' \\gtrsim 10^5$, consistent with the presence of a thick envelope on the planet."

A time-dependent model of intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) in acetone, implemented by \"plucking\" a single mode, produces evolving sound textures that mirror energy flow through the molecule.

While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown strong performance, it often fails to adapt to real-world short-term distribution shifts, which arise as different batches of goods arrive sequentially, causing performance drops. We argue that the short-term lookahead information available in modern logistics systems is key to mitigating this issue, especially during distribution shifts. We formulate online 3D-BP with lookahead parcels as a Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem and adapt the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework to solve it. Our framework employs a dynamic exploration prior that automatically balances a learned RL policy and a robust random policy based on the lookahead characteristics. Additionally, we design an auxiliary reward to penalize long-term spatial waste from individual placements. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving over 10\\% gains under distributional shifts, 4\\% average improvement in online deployment, and up to more than 8\\% in the best case--demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework."

This is reminiscent of a commensurate band folding with wave-vector $q=(0,0,π)$. Together with previous results from macroscopic measurements, namely heat capacity and resistivity, our findings suggest that Ni intercalation drives a structural instability at $T^{*}=287$ K, which causes the observed electronic band reconstruction.

Crucially, depending on one's choice of data reduction/background estimation algorithm, these objects can induce both apparent brightening and/or dimming events in processed light curves. To quantify the impact of these objects on archived TESS light curves, we used N-body integrations of all currently known minor planets to postdict all 600,000+ of their interactions with stars selected for high-cadence observations during TESS ecliptic plane sectors. We then created mock images of these moving sources and performed simple aperture photometry using the same target and background apertures used in SPOC processing. Our resulting 10,000+ target-specific light curves, which faithfully model the time-dependent positions and magnitudes of the actual solar system objects that approached each target, reveal that $>95\\%$ of high-cadence ecliptic plane targets experience a minor planet crossing within 1 TESS pixel of the source. Additionally, 50% of all $T>13$ mag targets experience at least one instantaneous moment where the contaminating flux from minor planets exceeds 1% of the target flux.

    "abstract": "Credit assignment--how changes in individual neurons and synapses affect a network's output--is central to learning in brains and machines. Noise correlation, which estimates gradients by correlating perturbations of activity with changes in output, provides a biologically plausible solution to credit assignment but scales poorly as accurately estimating the Jacobian requires that the number of perturbations scale with network size. Moreover, isotropic noise conflicts with neurobiological observations that neural activity lies on a low-dimensional manifold. To address these drawbacks, we propose neural manifold noise correlation (NMNC), which performs credit assignment using perturbations restricted to the neural manifold. We show theoretically and empirically that the Jacobian row space aligns with the neural manifold in trained networks, and that manifold dimensionality scales slowly with network size. NMNC substantially improves performance and sample efficiency over vanilla noise correlation in convolutional networks trained on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-scale models, and recurrent networks. NMNC also yields representations more similar to the primate visual system than vanilla noise correlation. These findings offer a mechanistic hypothesis for how biological circuits could support credit assignment, and suggest that biologically inspired constraints may enable, rather than limit, effective learning at scale."

However, traces from OS kernels or large-scale applications like Chrome or MySQL are massive and difficult to analyze. Existing tools rely on predefined analyses, and custom insights often require writing domain-specific scripts, which is an error-prone and time-consuming task. This paper introduces TAAF (Trace Abstraction and Analysis Framework), a novel approach that combines time-indexing, knowledge graphs (KGs), and large language models (LLMs) to transform raw trace data into actionable insights. TAAF constructs a time-indexed KG from trace events to capture relationships among entities such as threads, CPUs, and system resources. An LLM then interprets query-specific subgraphs to answer natural-language questions, reducing the need for manual inspection and deep system expertise. To evaluate TAAF, we introduce TraceQA-100, a benchmark of 100 questions grounded in real kernel traces. Experiments across three LLMs and multiple temporal settings show that TAAF improves answer accuracy by up to 31.2%, particularly in multi-hop and causal reasoning tasks. We further analyze where graph-grounded reasoning helps and where limitations remain, offering a foundation for next-generation trace analysis tools."

This relation reveals that the integral of the extinction cross-section is fundamentally locked by the scatterer's static effective mass and stiffness, which is validated numerically using seminal examples of underwater metamaterials. Furthermore, the proposed sum rule predicts an optimal condition for an anomalously broadened transmission loss bandwidth, as experimentally observed through the spectral shaping effect of an acoustic Fano resonator. Our findings open up an unexplored avenue for enhancing the scattering bandwidth of passive metamaterials."

    "abstract": "The growing complexity of modern system-on-chip (SoC) and IP designs is making security assurance difficult day by day. One of the fundamental steps in the pre-silicon security verification of a hardware design is the identification of security assets, as it substantially influences downstream security verification tasks, such as threat modeling, security property generation, and vulnerability detection. Traditionally, assets are determined manually by security experts, requiring significant time and expertise. To address this challenge, we present LAsset, a novel automated framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to identify security assets from both hardware design specifications and register-transfer level (RTL) descriptions. The framework performs structural and semantic analysis to identify intra-module primary and secondary assets and derives inter-module relationships to systematically characterize security dependencies at the design level. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves high classification accuracy, reaching up to 90% recall rate in SoC design, and 93% recall rate in IP designs. This automation in asset identification significantly reduces manual overhead and supports a scalable path forward for secure hardware development."

    "abstract": "High-k oxides such as SrTiO3 promise large capacitance, but their dielectric response is often limited by leakage currents due to reduced bandgaps. We show that introducing a thin barrier layer beneath SrTiO3 is a simple and effective way to suppress leakage and increase charge density. Using hybrid molecular beam epitaxy, we grew uniform SrTiO3 films on Nb:SrTiO3, CaSnO3/Nb:SrTiO3, and 2-inch SiO2/p-Si stacks to directly compare how different barrier layers influence device behavior. Both CaSnO3 and SiO2 reduce leakage, but the ultra-wide-bandgap SiO2 layer enables much higher operating voltages, yielding charge densities exceeding 5x10^13 cm^-2 at room temperature - more than a fivefold enhancement compared to devices without a barrier layer. This improvement comes with a predictable trade-off: the lower dielectric constant of SiO2 reduces overall capacitance, making its thickness an important design parameter. Together, these results demonstrate that rational barrier-layer engineering - including wafer-scale integration on Si - provides a clear pathway to achieving higher charge densities in SrTiO3-based dielectric devices."

    "abstract": "Reservoir computing is a bio-inspired machine learning paradigm that exploits the intrinsic dynamics of nonlinear systems with fading memory for efficient temporal information processing. Microelectromechanical resonators offer a promising platform for reservoir computing as they inherently possess the requisite nonlinear and temporal properties while also facilitating the integration of sensing and computing within a single platform. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a physical reservoir computing platform based on two capacitively coupled drum resonators, operating in the MHz frequency regime. Taking advantage of the concept of phonon-cavity electromechanics, a pump tone is applied at the sideband of the phonon cavity while probing one of the coupled modes, analogous to optomechanical systems, thereby creating nonlinear dynamics in energy transfer between the two resonators. Physical reservoir computing is implemented by exploiting the nonlinear response induced through pump amplitude modulation in combination with a time-delay feedback loop, and the performance is evaluated using both parity and Normalized Auto-Regressive Moving Average benchmarks. This work demonstrates a compact microelectromechanical platform for the integration of sensing and reservoir computing. Moreover, the sideband pumping scheme can further extend conventional single resonator reservoir computing to a multimode architecture."

We present Chronicals, an open-source training framework achieving 3.51x speedup over Unsloth through four synergistic optimizations: (1) fused Triton kernels eliminating 75% of memory traffic via RMSNorm (7x), SwiGLU (5x), and QK-RoPE (2.3x) fusion; (2) Cut Cross-Entropy reducing logit memory from 5GB to 135MB through online softmax computation; (3) LoRA+ with theoretically-derived 16x differential learning rates between adapter matrices; and (4) Best-Fit Decreasing sequence packing recovering 60-75% of compute wasted on padding.

Hydraulically amplified electrostatic (HASEL) actuators, a class of soft artificial muscles, offer high performance but exhibit memory effects and hysteresis. Here we present a data-driven reduction and control strategy grounded in spectral submanifold (SSM) theory. In the adiabatic regime, where inputs vary slowly relative to intrinsic transients, trajectories rapidly converge to a low-dimensional slow manifold. We learn an explicit input-to-output map on this manifold from forced-response trajectories alone, avoiding decay experiments that can trigger hysteresis. We deploy the SSM-based model for real-time control of an antagonistic HASEL-clutch joint. This approach yields a substantial reduction in tracking error compared to feedback-only and feedforward-only baselines under identical settings. This record-and-control workflow enables rapid characterization and high-performance control of soft muscles and muscle-driven joints without detailed physics-based modeling."

Consider a distributed system with $K$ users, where each user $k\\in [K]$ holds a data stream $W_k$ and an individual key $Z_k$. A server aims to compute a linear function $\\mathbf{F}[W_1;\\ldots;W_K]$ without learning any information about another linear function $\\mathbf{G}[W_1;\\ldots;W_K]$, where $[W_1;\\ldots;W_K]$ denotes the row stack of $W_1,\\ldots,W_K$. The open problem is to determine the minimum required length of $Z_k$, denoted as $R_k$, $k\\in [K]$. In this paper, we characterize a new achievable region for the rate tuple $(R_1,\\ldots,R_K)$. The region is polyhedral, with vertices characterized by a binary rate assignment $(R_1,\\ldots,R_K) = (\\mathbf{1}(1 \\in \\mathcal{I}),\\ldots,\\mathbf{1}(K\\in \\mathcal{I}))$, where $\\mathcal{I}\\subseteq [K]$ satisfies the \\textit{rank-increment condition}: $\\mathrm{rank}\\left(\\bigl[\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathcal{I}};\\mathbf{G}_{\\mathcal{I}}\\bigr]\\right) =\\mathrm{rank}\\bigl(\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathcal{I}}\\bigr)+N$.

We demonstrate how activity controls the structure of the bicontinuous network. Quantitative analysis reveals the dominance of dynamical steady-state sheet-like interfaces, in marked difference from the transient bicontinuous structures observed in passive liquid-liquid phase separation, where saddle-like surfaces dominate. These results demonstrate how active stresses suppress the coarsening dynamics of conventional phase separation, generating steady-state reconfigurable morphologies not accessible with conventional surface-modifying agents or through quenching of transient phase separated structures."

However, existing approaches (e.g., simulator-based and neural-based) cannot effectively realize the digital network twin, in terms of fidelity, synchronicity, and tractability. In this paper, we propose oneTwin, the first online digital twin system, for the prediction of physical layer metrics. We architect the oneTwin system with two primary components: an enhanced simulator and a neural radio radiance field (NRRF). On the one hand, we achieve the enhanced simulator by designing a material tuning algorithm that incrementally optimizes the building materials to minimize the twin-to-real gap. On the other hand, we achieve the NRRF by designing a neural learning algorithm that continually updates its DNNs based on both online and simulated data from the enhanced simulator. We implement oneTwin system using Sionna RT as the simulator and developing new DNNs as the NRRF, under a public cellular network. Extensive experimental results show that, compared to state-of-the-art solutions, oneTwin achieves real-time updating (0.98s), with 36.39% and 57.50% reductions of twin-to-real gap under in-distribution and out-of-distribution test datasets, respectively."

    "abstract": "Spin waves (magnons) in 2D materials have received increasing interest due to their unique states and potential for tunability. However, many interesting features of these systems, including Dirac points and topological states, occur at high frequencies, where experimental probes are limited. Here, we study a crystal formed by patterning a hexagonal array of holes in a perpendicularly magnetized thin film. Through simulation, we find that the magnonic band structure imitates that of graphene, but additionally has some kagome-like character and includes a few flat bands. Surprisingly, its nature can be understood using a 9-band tight-binding Hamiltonian. This clear analogy to 2D materials enables band-gap engineering in 2D, topological magnons along 1D phase boundaries, and spectrally isolated modes at 0D point defects. Interestingly, the 1D phase boundaries allow access to the valley degree of freedom through a magnonic analog of the quantum valley-Hall insulator. These approaches can be extended to other magnonic systems, but are potentially more general due to the simplicity of the model, which resembles existing results from electron, phonon, photon, and cold atom systems. This finding brings the physics of spin waves in 2D materials to more experimentally accessible scales, augments it, and outlines a few principles for controlling magnonic states."

We verify their conjecture in the case of the two-point spectral density for a quantum particle in a three-dimensional box, subject to a Diophantine condition on the domain's proportions. A permissible choice of width, height and depth is for example $1,2^{1/3},2^{-1/3}$. This extends previous work of Eskin, Margulis and Mozes (Annals of Math., 2005) in dimension two, where the problem reduces to the quantitative Oppenheim conjecture for quadratic forms of signature $(2,2)$. The difficulty in three and higher dimensions is that we need to consider the distribution of indefinite forms in shrinking rather than fixed intervals, which we are able to resolve for special diagonal forms of signature $(3,3)$ in various scalings, including a rate of convergence. A key step of our approach is to represent the relevant counting problem as an average of a theta function on $\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{Z})^3\\backslash\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{R})^3$ over an expanding family of one-parameter unipotent orbits. The asymptotic behaviour of these unipotent averages follows from Ratner's measure classification theorem and subtle escape of mass estimates."

A rigorous and unified treatment of these equations is therefore essential to ensure the reproducibility and comparability of theoretical and experimental studies. The present study aims to establish a coherent and systematic development of ion exchange kinetic flux equations, with particular emphasis on the consistent definition and dimensional formulation of the relevant physical quantities. Beyond refining the theoretical foundations, this study extends the classical formulation by incorporating the influence of mechanical stress on ion transport and considering cross-term interactions within the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics. These developments provide a more comprehensive description of ion exchange kinetics, particularly as applied to silicate glasses, where coupling between chemical and mechanical effects plays a crucial role in determining transport behavior and performance."

The framework comprises hundreds of unique task types and an automated calibration pipeline across ten difficulty levels. Furthermore, to mitigate binary reward sparsity and the Non-negative Reward Trap, we introduce the Bipolar Float Reward (BFR) mechanism, utilizing graded penalties to effectively distinguish perfect responses from those with logical flaws. Our experiments demonstrate that task diversity is the primary driver for reasoning enhancement , and that BFR, combined with a difficulty matching strategy, significantly improves training efficiency, guiding models toward global logical optima."

To address these limitations, we propose PALU (Prefix-Aware Localized Unlearning), a framework driven by a local entropy maximization objective across both temporal and vocabulary dimensions. PALU reveals that (i) suppressing the sensitive prefix alone is sufficient to sever the causal generation link, and (ii) flattening only the top-$k$ logits is adequate to maximize uncertainty in the critical subspace. These findings allow PALU to avoid redundant optimization across the full vocabulary and parameter space while minimizing collateral damage to general model performance. Extensive experiments validate that PALU achieves superior forgetting efficacy and utility preservation compared to state-of-the-art baselines."

    "abstract": "Varieties of quantitative algebras are fully described by their free-algebra monads on the category Met of metric spaces. For a longer time it has been an open problem whether the resulting enriched monads are precisely the strongly finitary ones (determined by their values on finite discrete spaces). We present a counter-example: the variety of algebras on two close binary operations yields a monad which is not strongly finitary. A full characterization of free-algebra monads of varieties is: they are the semi-strongly finitary monads, i.e., weighted colimits of strongly finitary monads (in the category of finitary monads)."

    "abstract": "We show that dispersion in propulsion strength qualitatively alters collective behavior of active multi-particle systems interacting via short-range attractive potential, giving rise to novel ordered phases that combine spatial and orientational ordering. Considering a binary mixture of active Brownian particles with two distinct self-propulsion strengths, we find that, the interplay between interaction range, self-propulsion strengths and the relative numbers of the particles with different propulsion strengths can lead to three different phases, namely, a disordered one, and two ordered ones with partial and complete spatial and orientational ordering. The partially ordered phase is characterized by formation of a ring-like assembly of the slower particles while the faster particles diffuse randomly. Two concentric rings, comprising faster and slower particles, form in the fully ordered phase. Using the example of a truncated harmonic potential, we analytically characterize the phase boundaries and identify the associated order parameters. Our results demonstrate that propulsion dispersion provides a robust and novel route to collective ordering in attractive active matter."

    "abstract": "When a large air cavity breaks in a turbulent flow, it goes through very large deformations and cascading events of new interface formation, including elongated filaments and bubbles over a wide range of scales, with their rate of formation controlled by turbulence and capillary processes. We experimentally investigate the effects of surfactants and salt on the fragmentation, and observe an order of magnitude increase of the number of bubbles being produced in some cases. For bubbles larger than the Hinze scale $d_H$ (defined as the balance between surface tension and turbulence stresses), we observe that bubble size distributions remain unchanged for all solutions tested. For bubbles below $d_H$, however, we observe an increase of the number of bubbles produced and an associated steepening of the bubble size distribution upon the addition of surfactant or salt. This later effect is only visible for some of the surfactants tested when their adsorption timescale is fast enough compared to the rate at which new interfaces are being generated by turbulence."

Our two step procedure estimates own-volatility dynamics via OLS to preserve persistence (roughly 0.99), then applies ElasticNet regularization to cross-market spillovers. The sparse network structure that emerges shows equity markets (ES, NQ) act as the primary volatility transmitters, while crude oil (CL) ends up being the largest receiver of cross-market shocks. Agricultural commodities stay isolated from the larger network. A simple univariate HAR model achieves equally performing point forecasts as our model, but our approach reveals network structure that univariate models cannot. Joint Impulse Response Functions trace how shocks propagate through the network. Our contribution is to demonstrate that hybrid estimation methods can identify meaningful spillover pathways while preserving forecast performance."

The density of a (sub)graph is the number of edges divided by the number of vertices. This problem was recently introduced and shown to be NP-hard for $τ\\in \\{2/3, 3/4, 1 + 1/25\\}$, but polynomial-time solvable for $τ\\in \\{0,1/2,1\\}$ [Bazgan et al., JCSS 2025]. We provide a complete dichotomy with respect to the target density $τ$: 1. If $2τ\\in \\mathbb{N}$ (half-integral target density) or $τ< 2/3$, then $τ$-BDED is polynomial-time solvable. 2. Otherwise, $τ$-BDED is NP-hard. We complement the NP-hardness with fixed-parameter tractability with respect to the treewidth of $G$. Moreover, for integral target density $τ\\in \\mathbb{N}$, we show $τ$-BDED to be solvable in randomized $O(m^{1 + o(1)})$ time. Our algorithmic results are based on a reduction to a new general flow problem on restricted networks that, depending on $τ$, can be solved via Maximum s-t-Flow or General Factors.

Meanwhile, closed-source systems (e.g., Nano Banana) have demonstrated strong reasoning-driven image generation, highlighting a substantial gap to current open-source models. We argue that closing this gap requires not merely better visual generators, but executable reasoning: decomposing high-level intents into grounded, verifiable plans that directly steer the generative process. To this end, we propose Unified Thinker, a task-agnostic reasoning architecture for general image generation, designed as a unified planning core that can plug into diverse generators and workflows. Unified Thinker decouples a dedicated Thinker from the image Generator, enabling modular upgrades of reasoning without retraining the entire generative model. We further introduce a two-stage training paradigm: we first build a structured planning interface for the Thinker, then apply reinforcement learning to ground its policy in pixel-level feedback, encouraging plans that optimize visual correctness over textual plausibility. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation and image editing show that Unified Thinker substantially improves image reasoning and generation quality."

We prove distributional convergence in the Skorokhod space equipped with the $J_1$-topology of the running maxima and the first passage times of decoupled random walks.

Among the foremost challenges facing 3D IC implementation is thermal management, where a deep understanding of heat conduction across bonded interfaces is essential for addressing heat dissipation and reliability issues. Nevertheless, the thermal conductance of bonded dielectric-dielectric interfaces remains poorly understood. In this study, we employ the low-temperature bonding technique integral to hybrid bonding to fabricate SiO-SiO interfaces and investigate their thermal boundary conductance using time domain thermoreflectance. Structural characterizations show high quality bonded interfaces. By fitting the data with an equivalent multilayer thermal model, we establish a lower limit TBC of 150 MW/m2-K for the SiO-SiO interfaces, which corresponds to a thermal resistance lower than that of a 9.2-nm-thick dielectric layer. These findings offer valuable insights into thermal transport in hybrid-bonded structures and provide critical guidance for the thermal design of advanced packaging solutions."

While single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films are recognized for their gas adsorption capabilities, their integration with photonic structures often overlooks complex light-matter interactions. In this work, we report a counterintuitive polarization-dependent response in an evanescent-wave NO2 sensor, fabricated by depositing aerosol-synthesized SWCNT thin films onto SPFs. The device demonstrates high performance, including a limit of detection of 400 ppb and stable operation in humid environments. However, its sensing behavior deviates strikingly from established models: upon NO2 exposure, transmitted light intensity increases for TM polarization but decreases for TE polarization, a phenomenon not attributable solely to changes in the intrinsic absorption of the SWCNTs. We pinpoint that the dominant mechanism is a gas-induced alteration of the SWCNT film's complex refractive index, which subsequently perturbs the evanescent field mode profile of the waveguide. Numerical simulations confirm that accounting for this mode-profile redistribution is essential to accurately describe the sensor's response. Revealed mechanism provides an important design framework for advanced evanescent-field sensors based on tunable nanomaterial claddings."

Existing explainability approaches in robotics typically either focus on individual modules, which can be difficult to query from the perspective of high-level behaviour, or employ monolithic approaches, which do not exploit the modularity of robotic architectures. We present HEXAR (Hierarchical EXplainability Architecture for Robots), a novel framework that provides a plug-in, hierarchical approach to generate explanations about robotic systems. HEXAR consists of specialised component explainers using diverse explanation techniques (e.g., LLM-based reasoning, causal models, feature importance, etc) tailored to specific robot modules, orchestrated by an explainer selector that chooses the most appropriate one for a given query. We implement and evaluate HEXAR on a TIAGo robot performing assistive tasks in a home environment, comparing it against end-to-end and aggregated baseline approaches across 180 scenario-query variations. We observe that HEXAR significantly outperforms baselines in root cause identification, incorrect information exclusion, and runtime, offering a promising direction for transparent autonomous systems."

This unified framework applies to both continuous and discrete distributions. Explicit bias expressions are obtained for gamma population, showing that the estimator is generally biased in finite samples.

    "abstract": "Recent research on medical MLLMs has gradually shifted its focus from image-level understanding to fine-grained, pixel-level comprehension. Although segmentation serves as the foundation for pixel-level understanding, existing approaches face two major challenges. First, they introduce implicit segmentation tokens and require simultaneous fine-tuning of both the MLLM and external pixel decoders, which increases the risk of catastrophic forgetting and limits generalization to out-of-domain scenarios. Second, most methods rely on single-pass reasoning and lack the capability to iteratively refine segmentation results, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel agentic MLLM, named IBISAgent, that reformulates segmentation as a vision-centric, multi-step decision-making process. IBISAgent enables MLLMs to generate interleaved reasoning and text-based click actions, invoke segmentation tools, and produce high-quality masks without architectural modifications. By iteratively performing multi-step visual reasoning on masked image features, IBISAgent naturally supports mask refinement and promotes the development of pixel-level visual reasoning capabilities. We further design a two-stage training framework consisting of cold-start supervised fine-tuning and agentic reinforcement learning with tailored, fine-grained rewards, enhancing the model's robustness in complex medical referring and reasoning segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IBISAgent consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source SOTA methods. All datasets, code, and trained models will be released publicly."

    "abstract": "The Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system based on Large language model (LLM) has made significant progress. It can effectively reduce factuality hallucinations, but faithfulness hallucinations still exist. Previous methods for detecting faithfulness hallucinations either neglect to capture the models' internal reasoning processes or handle those features coarsely, making it difficult for discriminators to learn. This paper proposes a semantic-level internal reasoning graph-based method for detecting faithfulness hallucination. Specifically, we first extend the layer-wise relevance propagation algorithm from the token level to the semantic level, constructing an internal reasoning graph based on attribution vectors. This provides a more faithful semantic-level representation of dependency. Furthermore, we design a general framework based on a small pre-trained language model to utilize the dependencies in LLM's reasoning for training and hallucination detection, which can dynamically adjust the pass rate of correct samples through a threshold. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves better overall performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines on RAGTruth and Dolly-15k."

Here, by optically suppressing ultrafast charge-transfer (CT) to interlayer excitons in WSe2/WS2 heterostructures, we uncover dynamics of moiré IALX revealing long lifetimes (τ > 1000 ps) arising from localized Wannier and in-plane CT nature. We then observe moiré intralayer intervalley biexcitons with binding energy ~ 16 meV, with long lifetimes due to moiré confinement. Furthermore, we find time-domain signatures of strong coupling between moiré-IALX and ~ 10 micro-eV phasons, evidenced as twist-angle-dependent GHz oscillations in IALX dynamics. Our findings establish moiré superlattices as interacting hybrid quantum systems and for engineering non-equilibrium phenomena, as well as for GHz-scale optoelectronics."

Existing post-training approaches for VLA models are typically offline, single-robot, or task-specific, limiting effective on-policy adaptation and scalable learning from real-world interaction. We introduce a Scalable Online Post-training (SOP) system that enables online, distributed, multi-task post-training of generalist VLA models directly in the physical world. SOP tightly couples execution and learning through a closed-loop architecture in which a fleet of robots continuously streams on-policy experience and human intervention signals to a centralized cloud learner, and asynchronously receives updated policies. This design supports prompt on-policy correction, scales experience collection through parallel deployment, and preserves generality during adaptation. SOP is agnostic to the choice of post-training algorithm; we instantiate it with both interactive imitation learning (HG-DAgger) and reinforcement learning (RECAP). Across a range of real-world manipulation tasks including cloth folding, box assembly, and grocery restocking, we show that SOP substantially improves the performance of large pretrained VLA models while maintaining a single shared policy across tasks. Effective post-training can be achieved within hours of real-world interaction, and performance scales near-linearly with the number of robots in the fleet. These results suggest that tightly coupling online learning with fleet-scale deployment is instrumental to enabling efficient, reliable, and scalable post-training of generalist robot policies in the physical world."

F-DPO (i) applies a label-flipping transformation that corrects misordered preference pairs so the chosen response is never less factual than the rejected one, and (ii) adds a factuality-aware margin that emphasizes pairs with clear correctness differences, while reducing to standard DPO when both responses share the same factuality. We construct factuality-aware preference data by augmenting DPO pairs with binary factuality indicators and synthetic hallucinated variants. Across seven open-weight LLMs (1B-14B), F-DPO consistently improves factuality and reduces hallucination rates relative to both base models and standard DPO.

In this work, we consider three well-known extensions to regular expressions called backreference, intersection and complement, and we show that, unlike in the case of lookaround, the matching problem for regular expressions extended with any of the three (for backreference, even when restricted to one capturing group) cannot be solved in $O(n^{2-\\varepsilon} \\mathrm{poly}(m))$ time for any constant $\\varepsilon > 0$ under the Orthogonal Vectors Conjecture. Moreover, we study the matching problem for regular expressions extended with complement in more detail, which is also known as extended regular expression (ERE) matching. We show that there is no ERE matching algorithm that runs in $O(n^{ω-\\varepsilon} \\mathrm{poly}(m))$ time ($2 \\le ω< 2.3716$ is the exponent of square matrix multiplication) for any constant $\\varepsilon > 0$ under the $k$-Clique Hypothesis, and there is no combinatorial ERE matching algorithm that runs in $O(n^{3-\\varepsilon} \\mathrm{poly}(m))$ time for any constant $\\varepsilon > 0$ under the Combinatorial $k$-Clique Hypothesis. This shows that the $O(n^3 m)$-time algorithm introduced by Hopcroft and Ullman in 1979 and recently improved by Bille et al. to run in $O(n^ωm)$ time using fast matrix multiplication was already optimal in a sense, and sheds light on why the theoretical computer science community has struggled to improve the time complexity of ERE matching with respect to $n$ and $m$ for more than 45 years."

    "abstract": "Autoformalization, which translates natural language mathematics into formal statements to enable machine reasoning, faces fundamental challenges in the wild due to the multimodal nature of the physical world, where physics requires inferring hidden constraints (e.g., mass or energy) from visual elements. To address this, we propose MMFormalizer, which extends autoformalization beyond text by integrating adaptive grounding with entities from real-world mathematical and physical domains. MMFormalizer recursively constructs formal propositions from perceptually grounded primitives through recursive grounding and axiom composition, with adaptive recursive termination ensuring that every abstraction is supported by visual evidence and anchored in dimensional or axiomatic grounding. We evaluate MMFormalizer on a new benchmark, PhyX-AF, comprising 115 curated samples from MathVerse, PhyX, Synthetic Geometry, and Analytic Geometry, covering diverse multimodal autoformalization tasks. Results show that frontier models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-3-Pro achieve the highest compile and semantic accuracy, with GPT-5 excelling in physical reasoning, while geometry remains the most challenging domain. Overall, MMFormalizer provides a scalable framework for unified multimodal autoformalization, bridging perception and formal reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multimodal autoformalization method capable of handling classical mechanics (derived from the Hamiltonian), as well as relativity, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics.

While the equivalence $p^{1/T} \\propto \\mathrm{softmax}(z/T)$ is well known, our contribution is an operator-level analytical framework built on this foundation rather than the equivalence itself. The framework comprises four core components: (i) operator-agnostic bias--variance decompositions that characterize when sparse students outperform dense teachers, (ii) a homotopy path formalization of multi-stage pruning in function space explaining why iterative compression succeeds where one-shot pruning fails, (iii) convergence guarantees establishing $O(1/n)$ rates for $n$-stage distillation with explicit parameter dependence, and (iv) equivalence class characterizations identifying distinct probability-domain operators that yield identical student models under capacity constraints. We introduce an axiomatic definition of probability-domain softening operators based on ranking preservation, continuity, entropy monotonicity, identity, and boundary behavior, and show that multiple non-equivalent operator families satisfy these axioms. All learning-theoretic guarantees are shown to hold uniformly across this operator class, independent of implementation details. These results provide theoretical grounding for black-box teacher distillation, partial-access settings such as top-$k$ truncation and text-only outputs, and privacy-preserving model compression."

    "abstract": "Recent work on activation and latent steering has demonstrated that modifying internal representations can effectively guide large language models (LLMs) toward improved reasoning and efficiency without additional training. However, most existing approaches rely on fixed steering policies and static intervention strengths, which limit their robustness across problem instances and often result in over- or under-steering. We propose Adaptive Test-time Latent Steering, called (ATLAS), a task-specific framework that dynamically controls steering decisions at inference time using an external, lightweight latent verifier. Given intermediate hidden states, the verifier predicts the quality of ongoing reasoning and adaptively selects whether and how strongly to apply steering, enabling per-example and per-step adjustment with minimal overhead. To our knowledge, ATLAS is the first method to integrate learned latent verification into test-time steering for enhancing LLMs reasoning. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that ATLAS consistently outperforms both vanilla decoding and fixed steering baselines, achieving higher accuracy while substantially reducing test-time token usage. These results demonstrate that verifier-guided latent adaptation provides an effective and scalable mechanism for controlling reasoning efficiency without sacrificing solution quality.

While recent approaches including ReAct, Reflexion, and Self-Refine improve reasoning through iterative refinement and reflection, they often lack structured exploration of alternative solution paths and persistent learning across problems. We propose ReTreVal (Reasoning Tree with Validation), a hybrid framework that integrates Tree-of-Thoughts exploration, self-refinement, LLM-based critique scoring, and reflexion memory to enable bounded and validated multi-step reasoning. ReTreVal constructs a structured reasoning tree with adaptive depth based on problem complexity, where each node undergoes iterative self-critique and refinement guided by explicit LLM-generated feedback. A dual validation mechanism evaluates reasoning quality, coherence, and correctness at each node while persistently storing insights from successful reasoning paths and failure patterns in a reflexion memory buffer, enabling cross-problem learning. Critique-based pruning retains only the top-k highest-scoring nodes at each level, controlling computational cost while preserving high-quality solution paths. We evaluate ReTreVal against ReAct, Reflexion, and Self-Refine across 500 mathematical problems and creative writing tasks using Qwen 2.5 7B as the underlying LLM, and demonstrate that ReTreVal consistently outperforms existing methods through its combination of structured exploration, critique-driven refinement, and cross-problem memory, making it particularly effective for tasks requiring exploratory reasoning, rigorous verification, and knowledge transfer."

Similarly, in a Bell test using any given Bell inequality, the maximum violation achievable using quantum strategies respecting or disregarding a certain symmetry can be different. In this work, we focus on the symmetry involved in the exchange of parties and explore when we have to trade this symmetry for a lower-dimensional quantum strategy in achieving the maximal violation of given Bell inequalities. For the family of symmetric Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu inequalities, we provide evidence showing that there is no such trade-off. However, for several other Bell inequalities with a small number of dichotomic measurement settings, we show that symmetric quantum strategies in the minimal Hilbert space dimension can only lead to a suboptimal Bell violation. In other words, there exist symmetric Bell inequalities that can only be maximally violated by asymmetric quantum strategies of minimal dimension. In contrast, one can also find examples of asymmetric Bell inequalities that are maximally violated by symmetric correlations. The implications of these findings on the geometry of the set of quantum correlations and the possibility of performing self-testing therefrom are briefly discussed."

Prior work typically decomposes inference into prefill and decode stages, with the decode stage dominating total latency. To reduce time and memory complexity in the decode stage, a line of work introduces sparse-attention algorithms. In this paper, we show, both empirically and theoretically, that sparse attention can paradoxically increase end-to-end complexity: information loss often induces significantly longer sequences, a phenomenon we term ``Less is Less'' (Lil). To mitigate the Lil problem, we propose an early-stopping algorithm that detects the threshold where information loss exceeds information gain during sparse decoding. Our early-stopping algorithm reduces token consumption by up to 90% with a marginal accuracy degradation of less than 2% across reasoning-intensive benchmarks."

    "abstract": "Choosing a suitable ML model is a complex task that can depend on several objectives, e.g., accuracy, model size, fairness, inference time, or energy consumption. In practice, this requires trading off multiple, often competing, objectives through multi-objective optimization (MOO). However, existing MOO methods typically treat all hyperparameters as equally important, overlooking that hyperparameter importance (HPI) can vary significantly depending on the trade-off between objectives. We propose a novel dynamic optimization approach that prioritizes the most influential hyperparameters based on varying objective trade-offs during the search process, which accelerates empirical convergence and leads to better solutions. Building on prior work on HPI for MOO post-analysis, we now integrate HPI, calculated with HyperSHAP, into the optimization. For this, we leverage the objective weightings naturally produced by the MOO algorithm ParEGO and adapt the configuration space by fixing the unimportant hyperparameters, allowing the search to focus on the important ones. Eventually, we validate our method with diverse tasks from PyMOO and YAHPO-Gym. Empirical results demonstrate improvements in convergence speed and Pareto front quality compared to baselines."

    "abstract": "Microservice systems have become the backbone of cloud-native enterprise applications due to their resource elasticity, loosely coupled architecture, and lightweight deployment. Yet, the intrinsic complexity and dynamic runtime interactions of such systems inevitably give rise to anomalies. Ensuring system reliability therefore hinges on effective root cause analysis (RCA), which entails not only localizing the source of anomalies but also characterizing the underlying failures in a timely and interpretable manner. Recent advances in intelligent RCA techniques, particularly those powered by large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated promising capabilities, as LLMs reduce reliance on handcrafted features while offering cross-platform adaptability, task generalization, and flexibility. However, existing LLM-based methods still suffer from two critical limitations: (a) limited exploration diversity, which undermines accuracy, and (b) heavy dependence on large-scale LLMs, which results in slow inference. To overcome these challenges, we propose SpecRCA, a speculative root cause analysis framework for microservices that adopts a \\textit{hypothesize-then-verify} paradigm. SpecRCA first leverages a hypothesis drafting module to rapidly generate candidate root causes, and then employs a parallel root cause verifier to efficiently validate them. Preliminary experiments on the AIOps 2022 dataset demonstrate that SpecRCA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing approaches, highlighting its potential as a practical solution for scalable and interpretable RCA in complex microservice environments."

We show that any proximity measure in this family admits an exact sparse matrix factorization, restricting computation to leaf-level collisions and avoiding explicit pairwise comparisons.

First, to address data scarcity, we introduce SoundAtlas, a large-scale dataset (470k pairs) that significantly outperforms existing benchmarks and even human experts in quality. Powered by a novel agentic pipeline, it integrates Vision-to-Language Compression to mitigate visual bias of MLLMs, a Junior-Senior Agent Handoff for a 5 times cost reduction, and rigorous Post-hoc Filtering to ensure fidelity. Consequently, SoundAtlas delivers semantically rich and temporally detailed captions with tight V-A-T alignment. Second, we propose Omni2Sound, a unified VT2A diffusion model supporting flexible input modalities. To resolve the inherent cross-task and intra-task competition, we design a three-stage multi-task progressive training schedule that converts cross-task competition into joint optimization and mitigates modality bias in the VT2A task, maintaining both audio-visual alignment and off-screen audio generation faithfulness. Finally, we construct VGGSound-Omni, a comprehensive benchmark for unified evaluation, including challenging off-screen tracks.

The thin dust disk's scale height increases radially from 60 to 200 pc, while the thick disk grows from 300 to 800 pc. For the first time, we find the thin and thick dust disk correlates spatially with molecular and atomic hydrogen disk, respectively. The thin, thick, and combined disks have scale lengths of 9.6+1.2-1.1 kpc, 4.2+0.4-0.3 kpc, and 6.6+0.3-0.3 kpc, respectively. The gas-to-dust ratio shows an exponential radial gradient, increasing from around 60 at 5 kpc to around 470 at 14 kpc.

Although numerous detection methods have been proposed, their accuracy often degrades when applied to images generated by novel or unseen generative models, highlighting the challenge of achieving strong generalization. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel detection paradigm based on channel removal reconstruction. Specifically, we observe that when the green (G) channel is removed from real images and reconstructed, the resulting reconstruction errors differ significantly from those of AI-generated images. Building upon this insight, we propose G-channel Removed Reconstruction Error (GRRE), a simple yet effective method that exploits this discrepancy for robust AI-generated image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRRE consistently achieves high detection accuracy across multiple generative models, including those unseen during training. Compared with existing approaches, GRRE not only maintains strong robustness against various perturbations and post-processing operations but also exhibits superior cross-model generalization. These results highlight the potential of channel-removal-based reconstruction as a powerful forensic tool for safeguarding image authenticity in the era of generative AI."

CREAM captures the evolving semantics of streaming queries and documents into dynamically structured soft memory and leverages it to adapt to both seen and unseen topics in an unsupervised setting.

    "abstract": "Smart grid infrastructure needs improved resilience and preventive maintenance through more accurate predictions. Current methodologies lack accurate representation of spatio-temporal-causal interdependencies and class imbalance in failure prediction tasks. This study introduces a Topology-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer (ST-GT) architecture that overcomes existing limitations by using three main innovations: (1) directly incorporating physical transmission network topology into the transformer attention mechanism to identify spatial failure propagation patterns; (2) unified processing of static topological descriptors and (3) temporal Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) sequences in an end-to-end framework. The ST-GT model exhibited outstanding performance in five-fold cross-validation across 10 substations, attaining perfect recall (1.000 $\\pm$ 0.001) and an F1-score of 0.858 $\\pm$ 0.009, markedly surpassing XGBoost baselines (0.683 accuracy/F1). Perfect recall guarantees that no critical failures are overlooked, which is essential for grid safety; however, it may lead to an increase in false alarm rates. This framework integrates temporal dynamics modeling with spatial graph awareness for critical infrastructure monitoring. It offers interpretable insights into failure propagation pathways and enhances maintenance strategies. Future research focuses on developing cost-weighted loss functions for precision-recall trade-off enhancement, implementing real-time monitoring systems with uncertainty quantification, and creating cost-sensitive frameworks balancing false alarm expenditures with failure consequences. The methodology success suggests its potential for wider application in critical infrastructure areas requiring spatial temporal failure prediction."

    "abstract": "We investigate the phase ordering dynamics of a uniform two-dimensional Bose gas quenched to a finite temperature in the superfluid phase. Starting from a defect-rich, far-from-equilibrium state, we model the subsequent evolution with the projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which conserves both energy and particle number. By tuning the initial energy, we control the effective post-quench temperature and examine its role in the equilibration dynamics. We find that the gas exhibits universal behaviour at all temperatures, evidenced by spatio-temporal scaling of correlation functions and power-law growth of the correlation length $\\sim t^{1/z}$, with $z$ the dynamical critical exponent. We find $z$ to be temperature dependent, with $z \\approx 1.5$ for post-quench temperatures just below the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, and $z \\approx 1.9$ for quenches to near-zero temperature. Analysis of the Porod tail of the momentum distribution suggests a temperature-dependent competition between vortices and sound waves in the coarsening process. The two-time correlation function also exhibits universal scaling, decaying as $\\sim t^{-λ/z}$, with autocorrelation exponent $λ$. Near the BKT transition we obtain $λ\\approx 2$, whereas $λ$ is found to diverge as the effective temperature approaches zero."

    "abstract": "Robustness to malicious attacks is crucial for practical decentralized signal processing and machine learning systems. A typical example of such attacks is label poisoning, meaning that some agents possess corrupted local labels and share models trained on these poisoned data. To defend against malicious attacks, existing works often focus on designing robust aggregators; meanwhile, the weighted mean aggregator is typically considered a simple, vulnerable baseline. This paper analyzes the robustness of decentralized gradient descent under label poisoning attacks, considering both robust and weighted mean aggregators. Theoretical results reveal that the learning errors of robust aggregators depend on the network topology, whereas the performance of weighted mean aggregator is topology-independent. Remarkably, the weighted mean aggregator, although often considered vulnerable, can outperform robust aggregators under sufficient heterogeneity, particularly when: (i) the global contamination rate (i.e., the fraction of poisoned agents for the entire network) is smaller than the local contamination rate (i.e., the maximal fraction of poisoned neighbors for the regular agents); (ii) the network of regular agents is disconnected; or (iii) the network of regular agents is sparse and the local contamination rate is high. Empirical results support our theoretical findings, highlighting the important role of network topology in the robustness to label poisoning attacks."

Key ingredients to the amplitudes that make up these cross sections are parameterized form factors. The axial form factor describing a weak interaction with a nucleon is part of one of the primary neutrino-nucleon interaction mechanisms, quasielastic scattering, yet this form factor is uncertain and its precision is limited by the availability of data for a neutrino scattering with nucleons or small nuclear targets. Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (LQCD) now offers another approach for obtaining mathematically rigorous constraints of the axial form factor from theoretical calculations with complete systematic error budgets. In this work, strategies for averaging LQCD results are explored, including both a random sampling of form factor values across momentum transfers as well as an averaging strategy based on analytic calculations of form factor derivatives. Fits to z expansion parameterizations are reported and compared against neutrino-hydrogen and neutrino-deuterium scattering data."

However, their luminescent performance deteriorates sharply at high temperatures. Herein, a serials of Mg2GeO4:Ti4+,Ln3+ (Ln = Tb, Eu) phosphors demonstrated anomalous thermal quenching PersL due to the temperature-dependent Fermi-Dirac distribution of bound charge carriers of Ti4+Mg2+ as remote electron traps and VMg2+ as hole traps. The high carrier retention rate of phosphors is attributed to the ability of Ti4+Mg2+ positive charge center to strongly trap non-bonding electrons over a long range (about 20 angstroms) as the electronic satellite for its stable operation. Under external optical/thermal stimulation, the released electrons and holes recombine at the different luminescent levels of Tb3+, resulting in the emission of different PersL branching ratios. Using these phosphors, we have developed 5D optical data storage (2D plane + trap depth + temperature + time) and the encrypted engine program for high-temperature aerospace engines. This study reveals the energy storage process of long-range trapping and releasing electrons by Ti4+ electron traps, and provides a new design concept for the design of PersL materials."

However, the identification of efficient SF materials is hindered by the limited availability of suitable molecular candidates and the high computational costs associated with conventional quantum-chemical methods for excited states. In this study, we introduce a high-throughput screening framework that integrates a graph neural network (GNN) with multi-level validation to accelerate the discovery of SF-active molecules. Trained on a previously reported FORMED database, the GNN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in predicting SF-relevant excited-state properties, demonstrating a mean absolute error of about 0.1 eV for S1, T1, and T2 excitation energies. This capability facilitates the efficient screening of over 20 million molecular structures from both OE62 and QO2Mol databases. Our framework significantly reduces the computational demand associated with Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory validation by four orders of magnitude and identifies 180 potential SF molecules along with more than 1000 conformers. Subsequent assessments regarding synthetic accessibility, GW approximation and Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations further highlight a subset of experimentally feasible candidates among these SF candidates. The approach presented herein exemplifies an effective strategy for accelerating the discovery of functional molecules with optoelectronic applications."

Of particular interest, cellular uptake, including phagocytosis, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and membrane fusion, critically depends on the elasticity of particles. Cellular membranes are strongly linked to a supporting cytoskeleton. However, in most previous studies, the effect of this cortical network somehow is overlooked. In this paper, we study the cellular wrapping of a membrane around a 2D elastic particle in the presence of a substrate mimicking cytoskeleton. Our simulations show that the impact of particle flexibility on the wrapping process depends on the magnitude of the membrane particle adhesion. In contrast, the extent of membrane protrusions formed around the target always increases with target stiffness. Since the extension of membrane protrusions is an essential step in the phagocytosis process, this result may indicate a selective behavior of macrophages in the phagocytosis of aged red blood cells."

    "abstract": "The Euler buckling of rods is a long-studied mechanical instability, and it remains relevant to this day, as the constituent components in many biological and physical systems are linear polymers, such as microtubules or carbon nanotubes. At finite temperature, if a polymer is shorter than its persistence length, the polymer is semiflexible, and its elasticity remains rod-like. But polymers can also stretch due to their finite extensibility, which can couple to energetically cheap bending deformations in nonlinear ways when a load is applied to the system. We show how the interplay between thermal fluctuations and nonlinear elasticity dramatically modifies the Euler buckling instability for compressed semiflexible polymers in a fixed strain ensemble. We identify a Ginzburg-like length scale beyond which thermally excited undulations lead to a softened Young's modulus, while the polymer nevertheless remains semiflexible. Both perturbative calculations and numerical Monte Carlo simulations suggest a qualitative change in several scaling properties of the buckling transition. The critical compressional strain for thermal buckling now increases with system size, in contrast to athermal buckling, where it decreases with system size. Renormalization group calculations confirm this picture, and also show that thermal buckling is controlled by a new fixed point with different critical exponents compared to classical Euler buckling."

    "abstract": "Many program transformations and optimizations require information about the future behavior of the program. A standard way to obtain this information is to build an intermediate program representation, then use a backwards program analysis to propagate relevant information against the flow of control back to the transformation/optimization site. We instead propose to use prophecy variables, which predict information about the future execution of the program, to enable such transformations and optimizations. We implement prophecy variables in BuildIt, a lightweight domain specific language implementation system. BuildIt uses staged compilation to implement high performance domain specific languages embedded within a standard general purpose programming language (C++). The BuildIt first phase uses standard C++ program execution to generate optimized C, C++, and CUDA second phase code. This approach enables BuildIt to eliminate programming language implementation components such as parsers and intermediate representations, delivering a dramatic decrease in the engineering effort required to implement domain specific languages. The combination of prophecy variables and repeated forward program execution enables BuildIt to extend this approach to include transformations and optimizations that require information about the future execution of the program without backwards analyses and without the engineering overhead associated with implementing these analyses. We formalize the use of prophecy variables for this purpose, discuss the implementation of prophecy variables and repeated execution in BuildIt, and present experimental results for BuildIt computations that benefit from optimizations enabled by the information that prophecy variables provide."

Despite the high potential benefits of automated vehicles, the needs of Persons with Disabilities are frequently an afterthought, considered only in terms of secondary accommodations rather than foundational design elements. We aim to shift automated vehicle research and discourse away from this reactive model and toward a proactive and inclusive approach. We first present an overview of the current state of automated vehicle systems. Regarding their adoption, we examine social and technical barriers and advantages for Persons with Disabilities. We analyze existing regulations and policies concerning automated vehicles and Persons with Disabilities, identifying gaps that hinder accessibility. To address these deficiencies, we introduce a scoring rubric intended for use by manufacturers and vehicle designers. The rubric fosters direct collaboration throughout the design process, moving beyond an `afterthought` approach and towards intentional, inclusive innovation.

    "abstract": "Stellar photospheric heterogeneities (e.g., starspots, faculae) distort the stellar spectrum in transit and imprint wavelength-dependent biases on the planet-to-star radius ratio (Transit Light Source Effect, TLSE). The Rackham-TLSE (R-TLSE) prescription applies a disc-averaged correction based solely on filling factor and spectral contrast, but transmission spectroscopy also depends on limb darkening, active-region distribution, and transit geometry. We include these in a pixel-resolved framework, ECLIPSE-Xlambda, and run idealised noise-free model-model comparisons to R-TLSE. For LHS 1140 b, K2-18 b, and WASP-69 b, disc-averaged corrections differ from the pixel model by up to about 400 ppm in the optical for active hosts and non-equatorial transits, but stay below about 10 ppm in the near-infrared where limb darkening is weak. We then apply both approaches to the JWST/NIRISS SOSS spectrum of LHS 1140 b. With limb darkening set to zero, ECLIPSE-Xlambda recovers stellar-contamination parameters matching the reference R-TLSE solution, confirming consistency in the disc-averaged limit. With wavelength-dependent limb darkening, reproducing the short-wavelength slope via stellar contamination alone requires hot faculae (delta Tfac about 600 K; ffac about 0.35), equivalent to a circular facular region of radius about 0.6 Rstar (about 60% of the stellar radius) on the disc; such an extended unocculted region is physically unlikely even for an active M dwarf. Purely stellar contamination would therefore require extreme faculae, whereas a genuine atmospheric contribution complementing a more modest facular signal is more plausible. These results delineate the validity regime of R-TLSE and underscore the need for geometry-aware stellar-heterogeneity models including limb darkening in high-precision transmission spectroscopy."

    "abstract": "Human cognition integrates information across nested timescales. While the cortex exhibits hierarchical Temporal Receptive Windows (TRWs), local circuits often display heterogeneous time constants. To reconcile this, we trained biologically constrained deep networks, based on scale-invariant hippocampal time cells, on a language classification task mimicking the hierarchical structure of language (e.g., 'letters' forming 'words'). First, using a feedforward model (SITHCon), we found that a hierarchy of TRWs emerged naturally across layers, despite the network having an identical spectrum of time constants within layers. We then distilled these inductive priors into a biologically plausible recurrent architecture, SITH-RNN. Training a sequence of architectures ranging from generic RNNs to this restricted subset showed that the scale-invariant SITH-RNN learned faster with orders-of-magnitude fewer parameters, and generalized zero-shot to out-of-distribution timescales. These results suggest the brain employs scale-invariant, sequential priors - coding \"what\" happened \"when\" - making recurrent networks with such priors particularly well-suited to describe human cognition."

However, the wide range and high variability of permeability prevent existing methods from providing reliable predictions. For the first time in subsurface spatial prediction, this study presents a quantum-enhanced long short-term memory with attention (QLSTMA) model that incorporates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into the recurrent cell. Using quantum entanglement and superposition principles, the QLSTMA significantly improves the ability to predict complex geological parameters such as permeability. Two quantization structures, QLSTMA with Shared Gates (QLSTMA-SG) and with Independent Gates (QLSTMA-IG), are designed to investigate and evaluate the effects of quantum structure configurations and the number of qubits on model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the 8-qubit QLSTMA-IG model significantly outperforms the traditional long short-term memory with attention (LSTMA), reducing Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 19% and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) by 20%, with particularly strong performance in regions featuring complex well-logging data. These findings validate the potential of quantum-classical hybrid neural networks for reservoir prediction, indicating that increasing the number of qubits yields further accuracy gains despite the reliance on classical simulations. This study establishes a foundational framework for the eventual deployment of such models on real quantum hardware and their extension to broader applications in petroleum engineering and geoscience."

In this paper we give an affirmative answer to this question. We show that every separable locally compact abelian $M$-group is $d$-independent, thereby removing the metrizability assumption from the result of Márquez and Tkachenko.

However, recent work shows that LRMs often arrive at the correct answer before completing these textual reasoning steps, indicating the presence of latent reasoning -- internal, non-verbal computation encoded in hidden states. While this phenomenon has been explored in English, its multilingual behavior remains largely unknown. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of multilingual latent reasoning in LRMs across 11 languages. Using a truncation-based strategy, we examine how the correct answer emerges as the model is given only partial reasoning traces, allowing us to measure stepwise latent prediction formation. Our results reveal clear evidence of multilingual latent reasoning, though unevenly: strong in resource-rich languages, weaker in low-resource ones, and broadly less observable on harder benchmarks. To understand whether these differences reflect distinct internal mechanisms, we further perform representational analyses. Despite surface-level disparities, we find that the internal evolution of predictions is highly consistent across languages and broadly aligns with English -- a pattern suggesting an English-centered latent reasoning pathway."

    "abstract": "Recent work in Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) has enabled the identification and intervention of internal features in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a persistent challenge lies in linking such internal features to the reliable control of complex, behavior-level semantic attributes in language generation. In this paper, we propose a Sparse Autoencoder-based framework for retrieving and steering semantically interpretable internal features associated with high-level linguistic behaviors. Our method employs a contrastive feature retrieval pipeline based on controlled semantic oppositions, combing statistical activation analysis and generation-based validation to distill monosemantic functional features from sparse activation spaces. Using the Big Five personality traits as a case study, we demonstrate that our method enables precise, bidirectional steering of model behavior while maintaining superior stability and performance compared to existing activation steering methods like Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA). We further identify an empirical effect, which we term Functional Faithfulness, whereby intervening on a specific internal feature induces coherent and predictable shifts across multiple linguistic dimensions aligned with the target semantic attribute. Our findings suggest that LLMs internalize deeply integrated representations of high-order concepts, and provide a novel, robust mechanistic path for the regulation of complex AI behaviors."

This study addresses the critical need for accurate digitization of Bahnar language documents through optical character recognition (OCR) technology. Digitizing scanned paper documents poses significant challenges, as degraded image quality from broken or blurred areas introduces considerable OCR errors that compromise information retrieval systems. We propose a comprehensive approach combining advanced table and non-table detection techniques with probability-based post-processing heuristics to enhance recognition accuracy. Our method first applies detection algorithms to improve input data quality, then employs probabilistic error correction on OCR output. Experimental results indicate a substantial improvement, with recognition accuracy increasing from 72.86% to 79.26%. This work contributes valuable resources for Bahnar language preservation and provides a framework applicable to other minority language digitization efforts."

Behavior is modeled as the outcome of a small library of psychologically interpretable, menu-specific rules that transform each objective menu into a perceived one. At each menu, the applied rule must make the realized choice a strict improvement under a dominance benchmark on perceived lotteries. We introduce the Maximum Rule Concentration Index (MRCI), the maximal Herfindahl-Hirschman concentration of rule shares over all locally admissible assignments, and diagnostics that distinguish rules that unify behavior across many menus from rules that mainly act as substitutes. We provide a MIQP formulation, a scalable heuristic, and a finite-sample permutation test of excess concentration relative to a menu-independent random-choice benchmark. Applied to the CPC18 dataset (N=686 subjects, each making 500-700 repeated binary lottery choices), the mean MRCI is 0.545, and 64.1% of subjects reject random choice at the 1% level. Concentration gains are primarily driven by modal-payoff focusing, salience-thinking, and regret-based comparisons."

    "abstract": "We investigate the Rice-Mele model with on-cell Kerr-type nonlinearities, where the interaction depends on the total particle number within each unit cell rather than on individual sites. This interaction enables a nontrivial interplay between topology and nonlinear dynamics in soliton pumping. In the weakly interacting regime, the ground-state soliton undergoes quantized Thouless pumping. At intermediate interaction strengths, soliton creation and annihilation break adiabaticity and disrupt quantized transport. In the strong-coupling regime, the coexistence of ground- and excited-state solitons leads to negligible coupling at energy crossings, giving rise to discrete time-translation symmetry breaking (DTTSB) in the soliton dynamics. Comparison of mean-field results with exact diagonalization along closed circular pumping paths confirms both the validity of the mean-field description and the robustness of DTTSB across different pumping trajectories. Our findings reveal how interaction-induced effects can fundamentally modify topological transport and suggest that these phenomena may be explored in cold-atom, photonic, and superconducting-circuit platforms."

Although reasons for this are multi-faceted, the sparseness of context and the limited data basis of up to ten suggestions per search query pose the most significant problem in identifying bias in search query suggestions. The most proven method to reduce sparseness and improve the validity of bias identification of search query suggestions so far is to consider suggestions from subsequent searches over time for the same query. This work presents a new, alternative approach to search query bias identification that includes less high-level suggestions to deepen the data basis of bias analyses. We employ recursive algorithm interrogation techniques and create suggestion trees that enable access to more subliminal search query suggestions. Based on these suggestions, we investigate topical group bias in person-related searches in the political domain."

On the other hand, the well-known 'energy' function employed by Hopfield turns out to be the dissipation potential of the gradient system, and this potential is shown to satisfy a dissipation inequality that can be used for analysis and interconnection."

Despite numerous pioneering studies, the field remains in its early stages; existing software implementations are often fragmented, lacking unified frameworks and standardized interfaces required for broad community adoption. Here we present DeepH-pack, a comprehensive and unified software package that integrates first-principles calculations with deep learning. By incorporating fundamental physical principles into neural-network design, such as the nearsightedness principle and the equivariance principle, DeepH-pack achieves robust cross-scale and cross-material generalizability. This allows models trained on small-scale structures to generalize to large-scale and previously unseen materials. The toolkit preserves first-principles accuracy while accelerating electronic structure calculations by several orders of magnitude, establishing an efficient and intelligent computational paradigm for large-scale materials simulation, high-throughput materials database construction, and AI-driven materials discovery."

The resulting coarse-grained transfer operator is finally estimated from dynamical simulation data by inferring the transition probabilities between the Markov states. Applied to systems with multichromatic and Morse interaction potentials, the reduced model reproduces key features of the clustering process, including transitions between cluster configurations and the emergence of metastable states. Spectral analysis and transition-path analysis of the estimated operator reveal implied time scales and dominant transition pathways, providing an interpretable and efficient description of particle-clustering dynamics."

While this symmetry breaking theoretically allows for an intrinsic anomalous Hall effect, experimentally observed signals have remained weak. In this work, we investigate the origin of this suppression and demonstrate a strategy to amplify anomalous transport responses within the experimentally accessible doping regime. Using a $\\bm{k}\\cdot\\bm{p}$ effective model, we reveal that near the valence band maximum, which corresponds to the energy window relevant for typical hole doping ($\\sim10^{19}cm^{-3}$), the intrinsic Hall effect is suppressed due to a symmetry-enforced cancellation of opposing Berry curvature contributions. We propose that breaking the crystalline symmetry via volume-conserving biaxial strain lifts this cancellation, resulting in a significant enhancement of the anomalous Hall conductivity by orders of magnitude. This strain-induced Fermi surface distortion also amplifies the anomalous Nernst effect. Furthermore, the analysis of the spin texture confirms that these strain-enabled anomalous transport signatures emerge while preserving the zero net magnetization."

In this paper, we propose TA-Prompting, which enhances VideoLLMs via Temporal Anchors that learn to precisely localize events and prompt the VideoLLMs to perform temporal-aware video event understanding. During inference, in order to properly determine the output caption sequence from an arbitrary number of events presented within a video, we introduce an event coherent sampling strategy to select event captions with sufficient coherence across temporal events and cross-modal similarity with the given video. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we show that our TA-Prompting is favorable against state-of-the-art VideoLLMs, yielding superior performance on dense video captioning and temporal understanding tasks including moment retrieval and temporalQA."

To address this theoretical fragmentation, this survey proposes a unified lifecycle-based taxonomy that organizes the research landscape into six distinct stages: Data Preparation, Model Preparation, Training, Alignment, Inference, and Evaluation. Within this framework, we provide a systematic review of the foundational theories and internal mechanisms driving LLM performance.

With the rise of artificial intelligence, data-driven gravity inversion methods based on deep learning (DL) possess physical property recovery capabilities that conventional regularization methods lack. However, existing DL methods suffer from insufficient prior information constraints, which leads to inversion models with large data fitting errors and unreliable results. Moreover, the inversion results lack constraints and matching from other exploration methods, leading to results that may contradict known geological conditions. In this study, we propose a novel approach that integrates prior density well logging information to address the above issues. First, we introduce a depth weighting function to the neural network (NN) and train it in the weighted density parameter domain. The NN, under the constraint of the weighted forward operator, demonstrates improved inversion performance, with the resulting inversion model exhibiting smaller data fitting errors. Next, we divide the entire network training into two phases: first training a large pre-trained network Net-I, and then using the density logging information as the constraint to get the optimized fine-tuning network Net-II. Through testing and comparison in synthetic models and Bishop Model, the inversion quality of our method has significantly improved compared to the unconstrained data-driven DL inversion method. Additionally, we also conduct a comparison and discussion between our method and both the conventional focusing inversion (FI) method and its well logging constrained variant. Finally, we apply this method to the measured data from the San Nicolas mining area in Mexico, comparing and analyzing it with two recent gravity inversion methods based on DL."

Starting from a one-dimensional interaction $V(x) = -g^2 e^{-αm x}/x$, we reformulate the problem in terms of a four-dimensional radial oscillator, where the finite screening length generates a systematic hierarchy of polynomial interactions in the radial coordinate. This mapping enables a controlled Rayleigh-Schrodinger perturbative treatment of the ground-state wavefunction and an explicit spectral analysis of the reduced density matrix. Working in the weak-screening regime, we compute the leading non-Gaussian correction arising from the quartic interaction $ρ^4$, which appears at order $α^2$ in the expansion of the Yukawa-like potential. We obtain closed analytic expressions for the resulting small eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix and evaluate their contribution to the von Neumann entanglement entropy. We show that the entropy receives analytic corrections at order $α^2$, originating both from explicit anharmonic state-mixing effects and from the implicit $α$ dependence of the Gaussian width parameter. Our results clarify the distinct roles of harmonic renormalization and genuinely non-Gaussian interactions in generating entanglement, establish a systematic power-counting and normalization scheme for higher-order $ρ^{2n}$ perturbations, and provide a transparent oscillator-based framework for computing entanglement entropy in weakly interacting low-dimensional and field-theoretic systems."

We develop a complete symbolic and Volterra theory, including explicit Prabhakar-type kernels, a left-inverse Volterra integral, and a fractional fundamental theorem of calculus. We show that the natural factorization of the Laplace symbol does not fit the classical Bernstein product mechanism and that the symbol is not a Bernstein function in general. Despite this non-Bernstein character, we establish well-posedness of abstract fractional Cauchy problems with sectorial generators by resolvent estimates and Laplace inversion, yielding a W-resolvent family with temporal regularity and smoothing properties.

However, scaling the number of coordinated nodes introduces challenges in feature extraction from large datasets, and transparent data fusion. We propose an end-to-end framework that operates directly on raw radar data. Each radar node employs a lightweight 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract local features. A self-attention fusion block then models inter-node relationships and performs adaptive information fusion. Local feature extraction reduces the input dimensionality by up to 480x. This significantly lowers communication overhead and latency. The attention mechanism provides inherent interpretability by quantifying the contribution of each radar node. A hybrid supervised contrastive loss further improves feature separability, especially for fine-grained and imbalanced activity classes. Experiments on real-world distributed Ultra Wide Band (UWB) radar data demonstrate that the proposed method reduces model complexity by 70.8\\%, while achieving higher average accuracy than baseline approaches. Overall, the framework enables transparent, efficient, and low-overhead distributed radar sensing."

LongBench Pro supports fine-grained analysis with task-specific metrics and a multi-dimensional taxonomy of context requirement (full vs. partial dependency), length (six levels), and difficulty (four levels calibrated by model performance). To balance quality with scalability, we propose a Human-Model Collaborative Construction pipeline: frontier LLMs draft challenging questions and reference answers, along with design rationales and solution processes, to reduce the cost of expert verification. Experts then rigorously validate correctness and refine problematic cases. Evaluating 46 widely used long-context LLMs on LongBench Pro yields three findings: (1) long-context optimization contributes more to long-context comprehension than parameter scaling; (2) effective context length is typically shorter than the claimed context length, with pronounced cross-lingual misalignment; and (3) the \"thinking\" paradigm helps primarily models trained with native reasoning, while mixed-thinking designs offer a promising Pareto trade-off.

We formalize homotokens-alternative valid subword segmentations of the same lexical item-as a strictly meaning-preserving form of data augmentation. We introduce a lightweight training architecture that conditions canonical next-token prediction on sampled homotoken variants via an auxiliary causal encoder and block-causal cross-attention, without modifying the training objective or token interface. In data-constrained pretraining, homotoken augmentation consistently delays overfitting under repeated data exposure and improves generalization across diverse evaluation datasets. In multilingual fine-tuning, we find that the effectiveness of homotokens depends on tokenizer quality: gains are strongest when canonical tokens are highly compressed and diminish when the tokenizer already over-fragments the input. Overall, homotokens provide a simple and modular mechanism for inducing tokenization invariance in language models."

Recently, disclination states have also been observed and experimentally verified in non-Hermitian systems with C6 lattice symmetry, where gain and loss are introduced to induce non-Hermiticity. In this Letter, we propose a non-Hermitian two-dimensional (2D) Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) disclination model with skin-topological (ST) disclination states, and calculate its biorthogonal Zak phase. Together with the real-space disclination index, we predict the emergence of disclination states in a C4-symmetric non-Hermitian lattice and the corresponding fractional charge. We also generalize the symmetry indicator within the biorthogonal framework to predict the anomalous filling near the disclination core. Experimentally, the model is implemented on a nonreciprocal circuit platform, where we analyze the impedance matrix characterized by complex eigenfrequencies and directly observe the ST disclination states. Our work further extends the bulk-disclination correspondence to the non-Hermitian realm."

    "abstract": "Socio-demographic prompting (SDP) - prompting Large Language Models (LLMs) using demographic proxies to generate culturally aligned outputs - often shows LLM responses as stereotypical and biased. While effective in assessing LLMs' cultural competency, SDP is prone to confounding factors such as prompt sensitivity, decoding parameters, and the inherent difficulty of generation over discrimination tasks due to larger output spaces. These factors complicate interpretation, making it difficult to determine if the poor performance is due to bias or the task design. To address this, we use inverse socio-demographic prompting (ISDP), where we prompt LLMs to discriminate and predict the demographic proxy from actual and simulated user behavior from different users. We use the Goodreads-CSI dataset (Saha et al., 2025), which captures difficulty in understanding English book reviews for users from India, Mexico, and the USA, and test four LLMs: Aya-23, Gemma-2, GPT-4o, and LLaMA-3.1 with ISDP. Results show that models perform better with actual behaviors than simulated ones, contrary to what SDP suggests. However, performance with both behavior types diminishes and becomes nearly equal at the individual level, indicating limits to personalization."

The performance of the ultra-stable laser is evaluated through real-time beat frequency measurements with another similar ultra-stable laser over a transport distance of approximately 100 km, encompassing rural roads, national roads, urban roads, and expressways. The results indicate frequency stability of approximately 10-12/(0.01s-100 s) during transport, about 5E-14/s while the vehicle is stationary with the engine running, and around 3E-15/s with the engine off, all without active vibration isolation.

It has been the subject of numerous ground-based and space-based observing campaigns, providing precise classical constraints, including a well-determined mass. It was also among the first stars in which individual frequencies were detected, making it a crucial benchmark for F-type stars. Our goal is to investigate the surface effect, namely the discrepancy between observed and model oscillation frequencies due to inadequate modeling of the surface stellar layers, especially important in F-type stars. Using Procyon A as a case study, we aim to understand how different surface correction prescriptions impact the inference of the fundamental properties of this star, and compare the results with those obtained when the surface corrections are neglected. We inferred the fundamental stellar properties employing a grid of models computed with MESA, including gravitational settling, radiative accelerations, and turbulent mixing. We selected the best-fit models using the AIMS code taking into account different methods to fit the individual frequencies. We find that the use of surface corrections can introduce uncertainties up to 7\\% in the inferred stellar mass. We identify that the most reliable stellar mass estimates are obtained when using frequency ratios, the Sonoi et al. (2015) surface correction or directly fitting the individual frequencies. Our results indicate that the surface effects in F-type stars differ from those found in the Sun and in solar-like stars, highlighting the need to be careful when considering the surface corrections for these stars."

Although recent DETR-based detectors benefit from global context modeling, they exhibit notable performance degradation on IRSTD. We revisit this phenomenon and reveal that the target-relevant embeddings of IRST are inevitably overwhelmed by dominant background features due to the self-attention mechanism, leading to unreliable query initialization and inaccurate target localization. To address this issue, we propose SEF-DETR, a novel framework that refines query initialization for IRSTD. Specifically, SEF-DETR consists of three components: Frequency-guided Patch Screening (FPS), Dynamic Embedding Enhancement (DEE), and Reliability-Consistency-aware Fusion (RCF). The FPS module leverages the Fourier spectrum of local patches to construct a target-relevant density map, suppressing background-dominated features. DEE strengthens multi-scale representations in a target-aware manner, while RCF further refines object queries by enforcing spatial-frequency consistency and reliability. Extensive experiments on three public IRSTD datasets demonstrate that SEF-DETR achieves superior detection performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, delivering a robust and efficient solution for infrared small target detection task."

For the specific problem of monotone moldable job scheduling, jobs are assumed to have a processing time that is non-increasing in the number of machines. The previous best-known algorithms are: (1) a polynomial-time approximation scheme with time complexity $Ω(n^{g(1/\\varepsilon)})$, where $g(\\cdot)$ is a super-exponential function [Jansen and Thöle '08; Jansen and Land '18], (2) a fully polynomial approximation scheme for the case of $m \\geq 8\\frac{n}{\\varepsilon}$ [Jansen and Land '18], and (3) a $\\frac{3}{2}$ approximation with time complexity $O(nm\\log(mn))$ [Wu, Zhang, and Chen '23].

While these symptoms are often attributed to latency or motion conflicts, the precise impact of textual clarity on physiological comfort remains undefined. Here we show that sub-optimal effective resolution, the clarity that reaches the eye after the full display-optics-rendering pipeline, is a primary driver of simulator sickness during reading tasks in both virtual reality and video see-through environments. By systematically manipulating end-to-end effective resolution on a unified logMAR scale, we measured reading psychophysics and sickness symptoms in a controlled within-subjects study. We find that reading performance and user comfort degrade exponentially as resolution drops below 0 logMAR (normal visual acuity). Notably, our results reveal 0 logMAR as a key physiological tipping point: resolutions better than this threshold yield naked-eye-level performance with minimal sickness, whereas poorer resolutions trigger rapid, non-linear increases in nausea and oculomotor strain. These findings suggest that the cognitive and perceptual effort required to resolve blurry text directly compromises user comfort, establishing human-eye resolution as a critical baseline for the design of future ergonomic XR systems."

The transformations are that a cluster formed in the first process either remains unchanged, merges into a larger cluster, is partitioned into smaller clusters, or otherwise overlaps with multiple clusters formed in the second process. The CCMS produces a count for each of these cases, accounting for every cluster formed in the first process. In addition, when run in analysis mode, the CCMS program can assist the user in evaluating these changes by displaying the details for all changes or only for certain types of changes.

Recent advances in imaging and shear estimation have pushed reliable reduced shear measurements closer to cluster cores, making mass reconstruction accessible in the nonlinear regime. However, the Kaiser-Squires based algorithm becomes unstable in cluster cores, where convergence $κ$ significantly deviates from zero and the linear approximation breaks down. To address this limitation, we develop a reconstruction framework with two key modifications: applying smooth masks to these regions and using a model-derived analytical solution as the initial guess, rather than assuming $κ= 0$. We validate our framework using simulated cluster lensing data with known mass distributions, incorporating realistic masks that arise from limitations in reduced shear measurements. We show that in the absence of shape noise, our framework yields high-fidelity mass reconstruction in regions of large reduced shear, with the best-performing method achieving residuals below $0.02 σ$ in the unmasked regions. This pushes mass reconstruction to higher accuracy in the nonlinear regime."

As a result, improvements in human-like behavior are largely driven by scale or broad supervised training, rather than targeted alignment. We introduce Human Aligning LLMs (HAL), a framework for aligning language models to conversational human-likeness using an interpretable, data-driven reward. HAL derives explicit conversational traits from contrastive dialogue data, combines them into a compact scalar score, and uses this score as a transparent reward signal for alignment with standard preference optimization methods. Using this approach, we align models of varying sizes without affecting their overall performance. In large-scale human evaluations, models aligned with HAL are more frequently perceived as human-like in conversation. Because HAL operates over explicit, interpretable traits, it enables inspection of alignment behavior and diagnosis of unintended effects. More broadly, HAL demonstrates how soft, qualitative properties of language--previously outside the scope for alignment--can be made measurable and aligned in an interpretable and explainable way."

Extending the array with an assumed lunar-based telescope could achieve $\\sim 0.85\\ μ$as angular resolution at 230 GHz, enabling black hole shadow detection for a larger SMBH sample. The concept is motivated by space VLBI missions and lunar exploration, including the ongoing Lunar Orbit VLBI Experiment (LOVEX) aboard QueQiao-2 (Chang'E-7) and the planned International Lunar Research Station (ILRS). We assess shadow detectability for 31 SMBH with predicted large angular sizes, exploring different telescope location and antenna size. Assuming a telescope at the lunar antipode, we simulate the Moon-Earth (u,v) coverage and show that source geometry relative to the Moon's orbit determines whether the primary indicator of shadow, first visibility null, can be sampled. Using a geometric ring model, we identify six high-priority targets: M104, NGC 524, PGC 049940, NGC 5077, NGC 5252, and NGC 1052. Shadows of M104, NGC 5077, and NGC 1052 are detectable with a 5 m lunar-based telescope; PGC 049940 requires 20 m; NGC 524 and NGC 5252 require 100 m. Photon ring detection for Sgr A*, M87*, NGC 1600, and M31 is possible if space telescopes fill the baseline coverage gaps and sensitivity requirements are met.

The obtained dark soliton solutions are classified into two distinct types, referred to as type-I and type-II dark solitons, which exhibit fundamentally different structural and dynamical characteristics. A single type-I dark soliton is symmetric about its center and admits three distinct valley profiles, namely single-valley, double-valley, and flat-bottom structures, whereas a single type-II dark soliton only supports a single-valley profile. These two types of dark solitons differ in their phase behaviors as the spatial variable varies from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$, as well as in their velocity--amplitude relations. For multiple pure type-I dark solitons, collisions are shape-preserving; however, a nontrivial collective effect is revealed in which modifying the parameters of one soliton can induce changes in the profiles and amplitudes of the other solitons, even though all collisions remain elastic in nature. In contrast, multiple pure type-II dark solitons behave independently, undergoing only phase shifts without any modification of their shapes or amplitudes. When type-I and type-II dark solitons coexist, their interactions lead to genuine shape-altering collisions, where the valley structures and amplitudes of type-I dark solitons are modified, while type-II solitons remain unaffected except for phase shifts. Asymptotic analysis further shows that the influence of type-II dark solitons on type-I dark solitons is confined to the pre-collision stage and disappears after the interaction."

    "abstract": "CTMC/DTMC-based discrete generative models, including uniform-noise discrete diffusion (e.g., D3PM/CTDD) and discrete flow matching, enable non-autoregressive sequence generation by repeatedly replacing tokens through a time-inhomogeneous Markov process. Inference is typically implemented with step-based simulation: each token decides to jump via independent Bernoulli (or categorical) draws at every discretization step. Under uniform-noise initialization, where self-correction requires multiple edits per position, these independent decisions induce substantial variance in both the number and timing of edits, leading to characteristic failure modes such as under-editing (residual noise) or over-editing (cascading unnecessary substitutions), decreasing reproducibility. We propose Stratified Hazard Sampling (SHS), a drop-in and hyperparameter-free inference principle for any sampler that admits a stay-vs.-replace decomposition. SHS models per-token edits as events driven by cumulative hazard (CTMC) or cumulative jump mass (DTMC) and places events by stratifying this cumulative quantity: with a single random phase per position, a token jumps whenever its accumulated hazard crosses unit-spaced thresholds. This preserves the expected number of jumps while achieving the minimum possible variance among unbiased integer estimators (bounded by 1/4), without altering per-jump destination sampling and thus retaining multimodality. We also introduce a phase-allocation variant for blacklist-style lexical constraints that prioritizes early edits at high-risk positions to mitigate late-masking artifacts."

    "abstract": "At constant time $t$, we examine the Vaidya-Tikekar metric characterising a three-dimensional, extremely dense spheroidal star configuration. The static, spherically symmetric solution of Einstein's field equations can be expressed in analytic closed form utilising a hypergeometric series. A relativistic, superdense state of matter at a constant $t$ is represented by the resultant model, which describes the geometry of a three-spheroid. Assuming a stellar density of $ρ_{a}= 2*10^{14} gm*cm^{-3}$, we investigate configurations whose total mass and radius vary over a range of well-defined values of the density variation parameter. Similar to an uncharged neutron star, all models possess the same total mass and boundary radius. The hypergeometric solution leads to a new class of exact, physically acceptable solutions. We show that the model satisfies the conditions of hydrostatic equilibrium and fulfils all standard energy conditions, which are verified throughout the analysis."

    "abstract": "Agile locomotion in legged robots poses significant challenges for visual perception. Traditional frame-based cameras often fail in these scenarios for producing blurred images, particularly under low-light conditions. In contrast, event cameras capture changes in brightness asynchronously, offering low latency, high temporal resolution, and high dynamic range. These advantages make them suitable for robust perception during rapid motion and under challenging illumination. However, existing event camera datasets exhibit limitations in stereo configurations and multi-band sensing domains under various illumination conditions. To address this gap, we present M-SEVIQ, a multi-band stereo event visual and inertial quadruped dataset collected using a Unitree Go2 equipped with stereo event cameras, a frame-based camera, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), and joint encoders. This dataset contains more than 30 real-world sequences captured across different velocity levels, illumination wavelengths, and lighting conditions. In addition, comprehensive calibration data, including intrinsic, extrinsic, and temporal alignments, are provided to facilitate accurate sensor fusion and benchmarking. Our M-SEVIQ can be used to support research in agile robot perception, sensor fusion, semantic segmentation and multi-modal vision in challenging environments."

    "abstract": "Neural Audio Codecs (NACs) can reduce transmission overhead by performing compact compression and reconstruction, which also aim to bridge the gap between continuous and discrete signals. Existing NACs can be divided into two categories: multi-codebook and single-codebook codecs. Multi-codebook codecs face challenges such as structural complexity and difficulty in adapting to downstream tasks, while single-codebook codecs, though structurally simpler, suffer from low-fidelity, ineffective modeling of unified audio, and an inability to support modeling of high-frequency audio. We propose the UniSRCodec, a single-codebook codec capable of supporting high sampling rate, low-bandwidth, high fidelity, and unified. We analyze the inefficiency of waveform-based compression and introduce the time and frequency compression method using the Mel-spectrogram, and cooperate with a Vocoder to recover the phase information of the original audio. Moreover, we propose a sub-band reconstruction technique to achieve high-quality compression across both low and high frequency bands. Subjective and objective experimental results demonstrate that UniSRCodec achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among cross-domain single-codebook codecs with only a token rate of 40, and its reconstruction quality is comparable to that of certain multi-codebook methods.

    "abstract": "Automated interviewing tools are now widely adopted to manage recruitment at scale, often replacing early human screening with algorithmic assessments. While these systems are promoted as efficient and consistent, they also generate new forms of uncertainty for applicants. Efforts to soften these experiences through human-like design features have only partially addressed underlying concerns. To understand how candidates interpret and cope with such systems, we conducted a mixed empirical investigation that combined analysis of online discussions, responses from more than one hundred and fifty survey participants, and follow-up conversations with seventeen interviewees. The findings point to several recurring problems, including unclear evaluation criteria, limited organizational responsibility for automated outcomes, and a lack of practical support for preparation. Many participants described the technology as far less advanced than advertised, leading them to infer how decisions might be made in the absence of guidance. This speculation often intensified stress and emotional strain. Furthermore, the minimal sense of interpersonal engagement contributed to feelings of detachment and disposability. Based on these observations, we propose design directions aimed at improving clarity, accountability, and candidate support in AI-mediated hiring processes."

The central hurdle remains the inherent compromise between color saturation and cooling power. Inspired by organisms such as butterflies, which decouple structural color from thermal function, we present a smart textile that seamlessly merges a dynamic thermochromic layer with static photonic crystals (PCs). This design enables the solar reflectance to be autonomously switched-from approximately 0.6 in the colored state for heating to about 0.9 in the high-reflectance state for cooling. Consequently, outdoor experiments validated substantial temperature regulation: the fabric achieves a surface temperature reduction of 3-4 °C in summer and a heating difference of <1 °C in winter compared to commercial reference materials, all while maintaining high-saturation colors. This dual-mode operation offers a viable pathway for achieving adaptive, aesthetic, and energy-free thermal comfort."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated success in various applications of user recommendation and personalization across e-commerce and entertainment. On many entertainment platforms such as Netflix, users typically interact with a wide range of titles, each represented by an artwork. Since users have diverse preferences, an artwork that appeals to one type of user may not resonate with another with different preferences. Given this user heterogeneity, our work explores the novel problem of personalized artwork recommendations according to diverse user preferences. Similar to the multi-dimensional nature of users' tastes, titles contain different themes and tones that may appeal to different viewers. For example, the same title might feature both heartfelt family drama and intense action scenes. Users who prefer romantic content may like the artwork emphasizing emotional warmth between the characters, while those who prefer action thrillers may find high-intensity action scenes more intriguing. Rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, we conduct post-training of pre-trained LLMs to make personalized artwork recommendations, selecting the most preferred visual representation of a title for each user and thereby improving user satisfaction and engagement. Our experimental results with Llama 3.1 8B models (trained on a dataset of 110K data points and evaluated on 5K held-out user-title pairs) show that the post-trained LLMs achieve 3-5\\% improvements over the Netflix production model, suggesting a promising direction for granular personalized recommendations using LLMs."

Previous methods, which rely on part-aware optimization, manual assembly, or 2D image generation, often produce unrealistic or incoherent 3D assets due to the challenges of intricate part-level manipulation and limited out-of-domain generation. In contrast, Muses leverages the 3D skeleton, a fundamental representation of biological forms, to explicitly and rationally compose diverse elements. This skeletal foundation formalizes 3D content creation as a structure-aware pipeline of design, composition, and generation. Muses begins by constructing a creatively composed 3D skeleton with coherent layout and scale through graph-constrained reasoning. This skeleton then guides a voxel-based assembly process within a structured latent space, integrating regions from different objects. Finally, image-guided appearance modeling under skeletal conditions is applied to generate a style-consistent and harmonious texture for the assembled shape. Extensive experiments establish Muses' state-of-the-art performance in terms of visual fidelity and alignment with textual descriptions, and potential on flexible 3D object editing.

To better assess our method's capabilities, we curate a high-quality 4K synthetic benchmark from five different games, spanning diverse scenes with rich geometric and appearance details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfiniDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks across relative and metric depth estimation tasks, particularly excelling in fine-detail regions. It also benefits the task of novel view synthesis under large viewpoint shifts, producing high-quality results with fewer holes and artifacts."

    "abstract": "Many important problems in science and engineering involve inferring a signal from noisy and/or incomplete observations, where the observation process is known. Historically, this problem has been tackled using hand-crafted regularization (e.g., sparsity, total-variation) to obtain meaningful estimates. Recent data-driven methods often offer better solutions by directly learning a solver from examples of ground-truth signals and associated observations. However, in many real-world applications, obtaining ground-truth references for training is expensive or impossible. Self-supervised learning methods offer a promising alternative by learning a solver from measurement data alone, bypassing the need for ground-truth references. This manuscript provides a comprehensive summary of different self-supervised methods for inverse problems, with a special emphasis on their theoretical underpinnings, and presents practical applications in imaging inverse problems."

In this paper, we propose MAGMA, a multi-graph agentic memory architecture that represents each memory item across orthogonal semantic, temporal, causal, and entity graphs. MAGMA formulates retrieval as policy-guided traversal over these relational views, enabling query-adaptive selection and structured context construction. By decoupling memory representation from retrieval logic, MAGMA provides transparent reasoning paths and fine-grained control over retrieval.

    "abstract": "This paper develops our work on the consequences of the Regge calculus, where some edge length scale arises as an optimal starting point of the perturbative expansion with taking into account a bell-shaped form of the measure obtained using functional integration over connection. A \"hypercubic\" structure is considered (some variables are frozen), it is described by the metric $g_{λμ}$ at the sites. The edge length scale as some maximum point of the measure is $\\sim η^{1 / 2}$, where $η$ defines the free factor like $ ( - \\det \\| g_{λμ} \\| )^{ η/ 2}$ in the measure and should be a large parameter to ensure true action upon integration over connection. A priori, the perturbative expansion may contain increasing powers of $η$, but this does not happen for the starting point inside some neighborhood of the maximum point of the measure, and it does happen outside this neighborhood. This appears to be a dynamic mechanism for establishing the edge length scale. We use a discrete version of the soft synchronous gauge in the principal value type prescription we discuss in a recent paper arXiv:2601.02181. This allows one to fix the timelike length scale at a low level for which the measure is known in closed form. This gauge is considered together with a refined finite-difference form of the action to match the analytical properties of the propagator to the continuum case."

The FFD provides a critical framework for examining how anthropomorphic AI systems facilitate subtle forms of manipulation and exploitation. Drawing on literature in trust, AI alignment, and surveillance capitalism, we construct a typology of harms, including covert advertising, political propaganda, behavioral nudging, and surveillance. We then assess possible mitigation strategies, including both structural and technical interventions. By focusing on trust as a vector of asymmetrical power, the FFD offers a lens for understanding how AI systems may undermine user autonomy while maintaining the appearance of helpfulness."

However, existing approaches heavily rely on blackbox policies parameterized by deep neural networks, which inherently lack interpretability, explainability, and transparency, and create substantial obstacles in practical network deployment. In this paper, we propose inRAN, a novel interpretable online Bayesian learning framework for network automation in Open RAN. The core idea is to integrate interpretable surrogate models and safe optimization solvers to continually optimize control actions, while adapting to non-stationary dynamics in real-world networks. We achieve the inRAN framework with three key components: 1) an interpretable surrogate model via ensembling Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs); 2) safe optimization solvers via integrating genetic search and trust-region descent method; 3) an online dynamics tracker via continual model learning and adaptive threshold offset. We implement inRAN in an end-to-end O-RAN-compliant network testbed, and conduct extensive over-the-air experiments with the focused use case of network slicing. The results show that, inRAN substantially outperforms state-of-the-art works, by guaranteeing the chance-based constraint with a 92.67% assurance ratio with comparative resource usage throughout the online network control, under unforeseeable time-evolving network dynamics."

We critically assess this consistency argument using scalar field models. We show that whether complementarity or no-signalling is violated when quantum fluctuations are neglected, depends on how this approximation is taken, while in both cases entanglement is generated locally in spacetime. We clarify that the correct reading of the paradox requires making a clear distinction between two notions of causality violation: Newtonian action-at-a-distance and the quantum mechanical no-signalling; the latter is pertinent while the former is not. We conclude that the thought experiment (a) does not add to the epistemological relevance of entanglement through Newtonian potentials (b) lends support for the existence of gravitons, if retardation effects are detected in entanglement through gravity."

We enhance 3DGS with visibility-aware semantic fusion for accurate 3D labelling and introduce an efficient, filter-based geometry conversion method to produce collision-ready models seamlessly integrated with a Unity-ROS2-MoveIt physics engine. In experiments with a Franka Emika Panda robot performing pick-and-place tasks, we demonstrate that this enhanced geometric accuracy effectively supports robust manipulation in real-world trials.

    "abstract": "Accelerating the renewable energy transition requires informed decision-making that accounts for the diverse financial, technical, environmental, and social trade-offs across different renewable energy technologies. A critical step in this multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) process is the determination of appropriate criteria weights. However, deriving these weights often solely involves either subjective assessment from decision-makers or objective weighting methods, each of which has limitations in terms of cognitive burden, potential bias, and insufficient contextual relevance. This study proposes the subjective-objective median-based importance technique (SOMIT), a novel hybrid approach for determining criteria weights in MCDM. By tailoring SOMIT to renewable energy evaluation, the method directly supports applied energy system planning, policy analysis, and technology prioritization under carbon neutrality goals. The practical utility of SOMIT is demonstrated through two MCDM case studies on renewable energy decision-making in India and Saudi Arabia. Using the derived weights from SOMIT, the TOPSIS method ranks the renewable energy alternatives, with solar power achieving the highest performance scores in both cases. The main contributions of this work are five-fold: 1) the proposed SOMIT reduces the number of required subjective comparisons from the conventional quadratic order to a linear order; 2) SOMIT is more robust to outliers in the alternatives-criteria matrix (ACM); 3) SOMIT balances subjective expert knowledge with objective data-driven insights, thereby mitigating bias; 4) SOMIT is inherently modular, allowing both its individual parts and the complete approach to be seamlessly coupled with a wide range of MCDM methods commonly applied in energy systems and policy analysis; 5) a dedicated Python library, pysomit, is developed for SOMIT."

    "abstract": "Indoor localization systems face a fundamental trade-off between efficiency and responsiveness, which is especially important for emerging use cases such as mobile robots operating in GPS-denied environments. Traditional RTLS either require continuously powered infrastructure, limiting their scalability, or are limited by their responsiveness. This work presents Eco-WakeLoc, designed to achieve centimeter-level UWB localization while remaining energy-neutral by combining ultra-low power wake-up radios (WuRs) with solar energy harvesting. By activating anchor nodes only on demand, the proposed system eliminates constant energy consumption while achieving centimeter-level positioning accuracy. To reduce coordination overhead and improve scalability, Eco-WakeLoc employs cooperative localization where active tags initiate ranging exchanges (trilateration), while passive tags opportunistically reuse these messages for TDOA positioning. An additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease (AIMD)-based energy-aware scheduler adapts localization rates according to the harvested energy, thereby maximizing the overall performance of the sensor network while ensuring long-term energy neutrality. The measured energy consumption is only 3.22mJ per localization for active tags, 951uJ for passive tags, and 353uJ for anchors. Real-world deployment on a quadruped robot with nine anchors confirms the practical feasibility, achieving an average accuracy of 43cm in dynamic indoor environments. Year-long simulations show that tags achieve an average of 2031 localizations per day, retaining over 7% battery capacity after one year -- demonstrating that the RTLS achieves sustained energy-neutral operation. Eco-WakeLoc demonstrates that high-accuracy indoor localization can be achieved at scale without continuous infrastructure operation, combining energy neutrality, cooperative positioning, and adaptive scheduling."

Furthermore, heterostructures with type-II band alignments can efficiently separate photogenerated charges via a charge transfer and separation process. Here, we use density functional theory (DFT) to investigate model interfaces formed by zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) and its fluorinated derivatives (F$_8$ZnPc and F$_{16}$ZnPc). We demonstrate that these interfaces not only exhibit a type-II band offset, but also band bending. The band bending causes both the LUMO and HOMO states to localize away from the interface. Therefore, the band bending creates a strong driving force for charge separation. We used ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) to experimentally confirm this predicted band bending. The wavefunction envelopes of vertically-stacked molecules resemble particle-in-a-box states, but this shape is lost when the molecules are staggered. These results elucidate how interface-induced band bending facilitates charge separation in all-organic heterostructures and suggest a design pathway toward improved performance in organic photovoltaic devices."

    "abstract": "We report on the solution optimized for characterizing SNSPDs by rejecting electromagnetic interference from various sources. The proposed readout method enhances measurement stability and enables reliable device characterization at low bias currents, where the signal-to-noise ratio is typically limited. By effectively suppressing EMI-induced noise, the method improves the ability to distinguish genuine detection events from spurious signals and reduces the effort required for data analysis. The approach has been applied to preliminary measurements of SNSPDs exposed to $α$ particles emitted from a $^{241}$Am source, demonstrating stable operation and clean signal acquisition. While a detailed study of $α$ detection is underway, the method establishes a foundation for further characterization of SNSPDs with various incident particles. The demonstrated EMI rejection technique is expected to facilitate future research in particle detection and support ongoing SNSPD development for applications in nuclear and accelerator-based experiments."

Starting from more than 30,000 Li-containing experimental structures sourced from Crystallography Open Database, Inorganic Crystal Structure Database and Materials Platform for Data Science, we perform highly automated calculations to identify electronic insulators. On these ~1000 structures, we use molecular dynamics simulations to estimate Li-ion diffusivities using the pinball model, which describes the potential energy landscape of diffusing lithium with accuracy similar to density functional theory while being 200-500 times faster. Then we study the ~60 most promising and previously unknown fast conductors with full first-principles molecular dynamics simulations at several temperatures to estimate their activation barriers. The results are discussed in detail for the 9 fastest conductors, including $Li_7NbO_6$ which shows a remarkable ionic conductivity of ~5 mS/cm at room temperature. We further present the entire screening protocol, including the workflows where the accuracy of the pinball model is improved self-consistently, necessary to automatically running the required calculations and analysing their results."

Synthetic data can bridge this gap, but existing generators do not jointly achieve behavioral diversity and logical groundedness. Rule-driven simulators rely on hand-crafted workflows and shallow stochasticity, which miss the richness of human behavior. Learning-based generators such as GANs capture correlations yet often violate hard financial constraints and still require training on private data. We introduce PersonaLedger, a generation engine that uses a large language model conditioned on rich user personas to produce diverse transaction streams, coupled with an expert configurable programmatic engine that maintains correctness. The LLM and engine interact in a closed loop: after each event, the engine updates the user state, enforces financial rules, and returns a context aware \"nextprompt\" that guides the LLM toward feasible next actions. With this engine, we create a public dataset of 30 million transactions from 23,000 users and a benchmark suite with two tasks, illiquidity classification and identity theft segmentation. PersonaLedger offers a realistic, privacy preserving resource that supports rigorous evaluation of forecasting and anomaly detection models. PersonaLedger offers the community a rich, realistic, and privacy preserving resource -- complete with code, rules, and generation logs -- to accelerate innovation in financial AI and enable rigorous, reproducible evaluation."

    "abstract": "Despite rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), achieving reliable performance on highly professional and structured examinations remains a significant challenge. The Japanese bar examination is a particularly demanding benchmark, requiring not only advanced legal reasoning but also strict adherence to complex answer formats that involve joint evaluation of multiple propositions. While recent studies have reported improvements by decomposing such questions into simpler true--false judgments, these approaches have not been systematically evaluated under the original exam format and scoring scheme, leaving open the question of whether they truly capture exam-level competence. In this paper, we present a self-verification model trained on a newly constructed dataset that faithfully replicates the authentic format and evaluation scale of the exam. Our model is able to exceed the official passing score when evaluated on the actual exam scale, marking the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of an LLM passing the Japanese bar examination without altering its original question structure or scoring rules. We further conduct extensive comparisons with alternative strategies, including multi-agent inference and decomposition-based supervision, and find that these methods fail to achieve comparable performance. Our results highlight the importance of format-faithful supervision and consistency verification, and suggest that carefully designed single-model approaches can outperform more complex systems in high-stakes professional reasoning tasks. Our dataset and codes are publicly available."

We demonstrate the presence of macroscopic ground-state degeneracy and corresponding residual entropy, which is maximal at the quadruple point and also extends throughout the MD phase and its boundaries with TD and F phases.

    "abstract": "Identifying the physical origin of enhanced charging performance in many-body quantum batteries is a key challenge in quantum thermodynamics. We investigate whether improvements in stored energy and instantaneous charging power arise from genuine quantum correlations or from coherent collective dynamics that are not intrinsically quantum. We compare the time evolution of energetic quantities with a hierarchy of information-theoretic measures probing bipartite, tripartite, and further-partite correlations. Across different battery charger configurations, we find a consistent temporal ordering in which the instantaneous power peaks before the buildup of strong quantum correlations, indicating that peak charging is dominated by coherent transport, while entanglement and scrambling develop at later times. Furthermore, charging protocols based on k local interactions are examined under both unconstrained and norm-constrained (fair) settings, enabling a clear distinction between classical scaling effects and genuine collective enhancements. Increasing the interaction order or the participation number does not automatically translate into higher charging power. Instead, the performance is primarily dictated by how many particles actually become mutually correlated and contribute to entanglement. Fully collective interactions provide a genuine advantage because all particles participate coherently, whereas partially extended interaction schemes fail to monotonically increase the number of effectively interacting particles, and therefore do not guarantee improved charging efficiency."

Brains are initially \"trained\" on prenatal sensory experiences (e.g., retinal waves), whereas transformers are typically trained on large datasets that are not biologically plausible. We reasoned that if transformers learn like brains, then they should develop the same structure as newborn brains when exposed to the same prenatal data. To test this prediction, we simulated prenatal visual input using a retinal wave generator. Then, using self-supervised temporal learning, we trained transformers to adapt to those retinal waves. During training, the transformers spontaneously developed the same structure as newborn visual systems: (1) early layers became sensitive to edges, (2) later layers became sensitive to shapes, and (3) the models developed larger receptive fields across layers. The organization of newborn visual systems emerges spontaneously when transformers adapt to a prenatal visual world. This developmental convergence suggests that brains and transformers learn in common ways and follow the same general fitting principles."

We present the first neuron-level interpretability study of emotion-sensitive neurons (ESNs) in LALMs and provide causal evidence that such units exist in Qwen2.5-Omni, Kimi-Audio, and Audio Flamingo 3. Across these three widely used open-source models, we compare frequency-, entropy-, magnitude-, and contrast-based neuron selectors on multiple emotion recognition benchmarks. Using inference-time interventions, we reveal a consistent emotion-specific signature: ablating neurons selected for a given emotion disproportionately degrades recognition of that emotion while largely preserving other classes, whereas gain-based amplification steers predictions toward the target emotion. These effects arise with modest identification data and scale systematically with intervention strength. We further observe that ESNs exhibit non-uniform layer-wise clustering with partial cross-dataset transfer. Taken together, our results offer a causal, neuron-level account of emotion decisions in LALMs and highlight targeted neuron interventions as an actionable handle for controllable affective behaviors."

We conceptualise auditing as uncertainty estimation over a target fairness metric and introduce BAFA, the Bounded Active Fairness Auditor for query-efficient auditing of black-box LLMs. BAFA maintains a version space of surrogate models consistent with queried scores and computes uncertainty intervals for fairness metrics (e.g., $Δ$ AUC) via constrained empirical risk minimisation. Active query selection narrows these intervals to reduce estimation error. We evaluate BAFA on two standard fairness dataset case studies: \\textsc{CivilComments} and \\textsc{Bias-in-Bios}, comparing against stratified sampling, power sampling, and ablations. BAFA achieves target error thresholds with up to 40$\\times$ fewer queries than stratified sampling (e.g., 144 vs 5,956 queries at $\\varepsilon=0.02$ for \\textsc{CivilComments}) for tight thresholds, demonstrates substantially better performance over time, and shows lower variance across runs.

The proof relies on an unexpected observation: shifting $C$ by a scalar multiple of the identity matrix yields a matrix similar to a lower triangular matrix. In triangular form, the characteristic polynomial reduces to the product of the diagonal entries, leading to the desired closed-form expression. Moreover, we extend this method to broader families of tridiagonal matrices. This provides a new approach for deriving exact enumeration formulas."

To resolve the distribution of magic across different scales, we introduce a multipartite non-local magic functional, constructed from an inclusion-exclusion combination of subsystem contributions. This measure serves as a fine-grained diagnostic, isolating genuinely global contributions and revealing nontrivial interactions between local and collective supports of magic. We illustrate the measure on paradigmatic multipartite states and apply these diagnostics to the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and its variants. Crucially, for thermal/typical ensembles, we observe a marked disparity between Thermal Pure Quantum (TPQ) states and the thermal density matrix. This reveals a concealed complexity: the immense computational hardness characterizing the unitary evolution is encoded in the specific microstructure of the black hole microstates, while being washed out in the coarse-grained thermodynamic description. Furthermore, in $\\mathcal N=2$ supersymmetric SYK, we show that while fortuitous BPS states exhibit intermediate stabilizer complexity, the multipartite measure unveils a rich, sector-dependent pattern of global correlations, distinguishing them from generic chaotic states."

    "abstract": "Trajectory prediction (TP) is crucial for ensuring safety and efficiency in modern air traffic management systems. It is, for example, a core component of conflict detection and resolution tools, arrival sequencing algorithms, capacity planning, as well as several future concepts. However, TP accuracy within operational systems is hampered by a range of epistemic uncertainties such as the mass and performance settings of aircraft and the effect of meteorological conditions on aircraft performance. It can also require considerable computational resources. This paper proposes a method for adaptive TP that has two components: first, a fast surrogate TP model based on linear state space models (LSSM)s with an execution time that was 6.7 times lower on average than an implementation of the Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) in Python. It is demonstrated that such models can effectively emulate the BADA aircraft performance model, which is based on the numerical solution of a partial differential equation (PDE), and that the LSSMs can be fitted to trajectories in a dataset of historic flight data. Secondly, the paper proposes an algorithm to assimilate radar observations using particle filtering to adaptively refine TP accuracy. Comparison with baselines using BADA and Kalman filtering demonstrate that the proposed framework improves system identification and state estimation for both climb and descent phases, with 46.3% and 64.7% better estimates for time to top of climb and bottom of descent compared to the best performing benchmark model. In particular, the particle filtering approach provides the flexibility to capture non-linear performance effects including the CAS-Mach transition."

    "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of wireless devices makes robust identity authentication essential. Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF) exploits device-specific, hard-to-forge physical-layer impairments for identification, and is promising for IoT and unmanned systems. In practice, however, new devices continuously join deployed systems while per-class training data are limited. Conventional static training and naive replay of stored exemplars are impractical due to growing class cardinality, storage cost, and privacy concerns. We propose an exemplar-free class-incremental learning framework tailored to RFF recognition. Starting from a pretrained feature extractor, we freeze the backbone during incremental stages and train only a classifier together with lightweight Adapter modules that perform small task-specific feature adjustments. For each class we fit a diagonal Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to the backbone features and sample pseudo-features from these fitted distributions to rehearse past classes without storing raw signals. To improve robustness under few-shot conditions we introduce a time-domain random-masking augmentation and adopt a multi-teacher distillation scheme to compress stage-wise Adapters into a single inference Adapter, trading off accuracy and runtime efficiency. We evaluate the method on large, self-collected ADS-B datasets: the backbone is pretrained on 2,175 classes and incremental experiments are run on a disjoint set of 669 classes with multiple rounds and step sizes. Against several representative baselines, our approach consistently yields higher average accuracy and lower forgetting, while using substantially less storage and avoiding raw-data retention. The proposed pipeline is reproducible and provides a practical, low-storage solution for RFF deployment in resource- and privacy-constrained environments."

We demonstrate that for non-solvable groups (e.g., the 3D rotation group $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$), maintaining such a structure-preserving embedding is computationally lower-bounded by the Word Problem, which is $\\mathsf{NC^1}$-complete.

We design a robust Patient Agent that is limited to a set of atomic medical facts and augmented with a dynamic guidance mechanism that continuously detects and corrects hallucinations throughout the dialogue, ensuring internal coherence and clinical plausibility of the simulated cases. Furthermore, we propose a structured LLM-based and expert-annotated rubric-generation pipeline that retrieves Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) guidelines and utilizes the reject sampling to derive a prioritized set of rubric items (\"must-ask\" items) for each case. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models and demonstrate that, across multiple assessment dimensions, current models face substantial challenges. Our results indicate that improving medical dialogue will require advances in dialogue management architectures, not just incremental tuning of the base-model."

This method has empirically shown to react to changing circumstances, such as model parameters, efficiently. To formalize this observation, we design a PGAC method which stabilizes linear switched systems, where both model parameters and switching time are unknown. We use sliding window data for the policy gradient estimate and show that under a dwell time condition and small dynamics variation, the policy can track the switching dynamics and ensure closed-loop stability. We perform simulations to validate our theoretical results."

We introduce SPICE, a Bayesian ICRL method that learns a prior over Q-values via deep ensemble and updates this prior at test-time using in-context information through Bayesian updates. To recover from poor priors resulting from training on sub-optimal data, our online inference follows an Upper-Confidence Bound rule that favours exploration and adaptation. We prove that SPICE achieves regret-optimal behaviour in both stochastic bandits and finite-horizon MDPs, even when pretrained only on suboptimal trajectories. We validate these findings empirically across bandit and control benchmarks. SPICE achieves near-optimal decisions on unseen tasks, substantially reduces regret compared to prior ICRL and meta-RL approaches while rapidly adapting to unseen tasks and remaining robust under distribution shift."

For the low-spin case, the general form of the ensemble ground state has been rigorously derived in J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 15, 2337 (2024), finding the presence of an ambiguity in the ground state. Here we further discuss this ambiguity, and show that it can be removed via maximization of the entropy. For the high-spin case, we find that the form of the ensemble ground state strongly depends on the system in question. Furthermore, we prove three general properties which characterize the ensemble, and narrow the list of pure states it may consist of. We relate the frontier Kohn-Sham orbital energies to total energy differences, providing a generalization of the ionization potential theorem to systems with arbitrary fractional $M_{tot}$. Furthermore, we derive expressions for new derivative discontinuities, which appear as jumps in the KS potentials when crossing a boundary in the $N_{\\uparrow}$-$N_{\\downarrow}$ plane. Our analytical results are supported by an extensive numerical analysis of the Atomic Spectra Database of the National Institute of Standards. The new exact conditions for many-electron systems derived in this work are instrumental for development of advanced approximations in density functional theory and other many-electron methods."

We present ReCCur (Recursive Corner-Case Curation), a low-compute framework that converts noisy web imagery into auditable fine-grained labels via a multi-agent recursive pipeline. First, large-scale data acquisition and filtering expands a domain vocabulary with a vision-language model (VLM), crawls the web, and enforces tri-modal (image, description, keyword) consistency with light human spot checks to yield refined candidates. Next, mixture-of-experts knowledge distillation uses complementary encoders (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2, BEiT) for kNN voting with dual-confidence activation and uncertainty sampling, converging to a high-precision set. Finally, region-evidence VLM adversarial labeling pairs a proposer (multi-granularity regions and semantic cues) with a validator (global and local chained consistency) to produce explainable labels and close the loop. On realistic corner-case scenarios (e.g., flooded-car inspection), ReCCur runs on consumer-grade GPUs, steadily improves purity and separability, and requires minimal human supervision, providing a practical substrate for downstream training and evaluation under resource constraints. Code and dataset will be released."

    "abstract": "As generative AI systems become integrated into real-world applications, organizations increasingly need to be able to understand and interpret their behavior. In particular, decision-makers need to understand what causes generative AI systems to exhibit specific output characteristics. Within this general topic, this paper examines a key question: what is it about the input -- the prompt -- that causes an LLM-based generative AI system to produce output that exhibits specific characteristics, such as toxicity, negative sentiment, or political bias. To examine this question, we adapt a common technique from the Explainable AI literature: counterfactual explanations. We explain why traditional counterfactual explanations cannot be applied directly to generative AI systems, due to several differences in how generative AI systems function. We then propose a flexible framework that adapts counterfactual explanations to non-deterministic, generative AI systems in scenarios where downstream classifiers can reveal key characteristics of their outputs. Based on this framework, we introduce an algorithm for generating prompt-counterfactual explanations (PCEs). Finally, we demonstrate the production of counterfactual explanations for generative AI systems with three case studies, examining different output characteristics (viz., political leaning, toxicity, and sentiment). The case studies further show that PCEs can streamline prompt engineering to suppress undesirable output characteristics and can enhance red-teaming efforts to uncover additional prompts that elicit undesirable outputs. Ultimately, this work lays a foundation for prompt-focused interpretability in generative AI: a capability that will become indispensable as these models are entrusted with higher-stakes tasks and subject to emerging regulatory requirements for transparency and accountability."

Due to the lack of TTS-quality audio-visual corpora, previous approaches suffer from either low synthesis quality or domain mismatch induced by a knowledge transfer scheme. This paper proposes a new approach called Vclip that utilizes the facial-semantic knowledge of the CLIP encoder on noisy audio-visual data to learn the association between face and voice efficiently, achieving 89.63% cross-modal verification AUC score on Voxceleb testset. The proposed method then uses a retrieval-based strategy, combined with GMM-based speaker generation module for a downstream TTS system, to produce probable target speakers given reference images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Vclip system in conjunction with the retrieval step can bridge the gap between face and voice features for face-based speech synthesis. And using the feedback information distilled from downstream TTS helps to synthesize voices that match closely with reference faces. Demos available at sos1sos2sixteen.github.io/vclip."

This motivates cross-correlations, to ascertain the cosmological nature of measured HI fluctuations, and to study their connections with galaxies and the underlying matter density field. However, these same foregrounds render the cross-correlation with projected fields such as the lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) difficult. Indeed, the correlated Fourier modes vary slowly along the line of sight, and are thus most contaminated by the smooth-spectrum radio continuum foregrounds. In this paper, we implement a method that avoids this issue by attempting to measure the non-linear gravitational coupling of the small-scale 21cm power from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) with large-scale Planck CMB lensing. This measurement is a position-dependent power spectrum, i.e. a squeezed integrated bispectrum. Using 94 nights of CHIME data between $1.0 < z < 1.3$ and aggressive foreground filtering, we find that the expected signal is five times smaller than the current noise. We forecast that incorporating the additional nights of CHIME data already collected would enable a signal-to-noise ratio of 3, without any further improvements in filtering for foreground cleaning."

    "abstract": "A fundamental requirement for full autonomy is the ability to sustain accurate navigation in the absence of external data, such as GNSS signals or visual information. In these challenging environments, the platform must rely exclusively on inertial sensors, leading to pure inertial navigation. However, the inherent noise and other error terms of the inertial sensors in such real-world scenarios will cause the navigation solution to drift over time. Although conventional deep-learning models have emerged as a possible approach to inertial navigation, they are inherently black-box in nature. Furthermore, they struggle to learn effectively with limited supervised sensor data and often fail to preserve physical principles. To address these limitations, we propose PiDR, a physics-informed inertial dead-reckoning framework for autonomous platforms in situations of pure inertial navigation. PiDR offers transparency by explicitly integrating inertial navigation principles into the network training process through the physics-informed residual component. PiDR plays a crucial role in mitigating abrupt trajectory deviations even under limited or sparse supervision. We evaluated PiDR on real-world datasets collected by a mobile robot and an autonomous underwater vehicle. We obtained more than 29% positioning improvement in both datasets, demonstrating the ability of PiDR to generalize different platforms operating in various environments and dynamics. Thus, PiDR offers a robust, lightweight, yet effective architecture and can be deployed on resource-constrained platforms, enabling real-time pure inertial navigation in adverse scenarios."

We derive the corresponding Friedmann equations, compute the slow-roll parameters in each case, and we fit the experimental data for ($n_s - 1$, $α$, $Δ_s^2$, $r$), using Planck, BICEP, and ACT data. We find that monomial inflation is strongly disfavored in all scenarios, while $α$-attractor inflation provides an excellent fit to current observations, with extra-dimensional setups offering additional flexibility compared to the standard 4D case."

We propose a multi-stage efficient reasoning method that combines supervised fine-tuning -- via rejection sampling or reasoning trace reformatting -- with reinforcement learning using an adaptive length penalty. We introduce a lightweight reward function that penalizes tokens generated after the first correct answer but encouraging self-verification only when beneficial. We conduct a holistic evaluation across seven diverse reasoning tasks, analyzing the accuracy-response length trade-off. Our approach reduces response length by an average of 28\\% for 8B models and 40\\% for 32B models, while incurring only minor performance drops of 1.6 and 2.5 points, respectively. Despite its conceptual simplicity, it achieves a superior trade-off compared to more complex state-of-the-art efficient reasoning methods, scoring 76.6, in terms of the area under the Overthinking-Adjusted Accuracy curve ($\\text{AUC}_{\\text{OAA}}$) -- 5 points above the base model and 2.5 points above the second-best approach."

The model features a concave transient impact driven by a power-law propagator with a resistance term responding to the trader's rate via a fixed-point equation involving a general resistance function. We derive a (non)linear stochastic Fredholm equation as the first-order optimality condition satisfied by optimal trading strategies. Existence and uniqueness of the optimal control are established when the resistance function is linear, and an existence result is obtained when it is strictly convex using coercivity and weak lower semicontinuity of the associated profit-and-loss functional. We also propose an iterative scheme to solve the nonlinear stochastic Fredholm equation and prove an exponential convergence rate. Numerical experiments confirm this behavior and illustrate optimal round-trip strategies under \"buy\" signals with various decay profiles and different market resistance specifications."

From the late-time bolometric light curve, we estimate a $^{56}$Ni mass of $\\sim0.01~M_\\odot$, consistent with other LLSNe. Analytical shock-cooling models fail to reproduce the rapid early rise, indicating that circumstellar material (CSM) interaction contributed to the initial emission.

We detect a broad ``ledge'' feature around 4600 Åwithin three days of explosion, which we interpret as a blend of high-ionization shock-accelerated CSM lines. Multi-peaked H$α$ profiles develop during the plateau phase, consistent with complex ejecta-CSM interactions.

This annotated dataset is a valuable resource for developing machine learning-based approaches aiming to automate the classification of user feedback into various issue types. Making both the annotated and raw datasets publicly available provides researchers and developers with a crucial tool to understand common issues in low-rated apps and inform software improvements. The comprehensive analysis and availability of this dataset lay the groundwork for data-derived solutions to improve software quality based on user feedback.

However, the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and data throughput in BLE are highly susceptible to environmental variability, which degrades communication performance. In this work, we systematically analyze the interdependence among RSSI, throughput, transmission power (TXP), and the peripheral device system power consumption under diverse real-world conditions. We observe that adjusting the TXP effectively influences both RSSI and throughput. We propose a robust closed-loop TXP control framework based on Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers. Two initial control strategies are investigated: an RSSI-based approach and a throughput-based approach, each exhibiting distinct advantages and limitations. The RSSI-based method provides rapid responsiveness to signal fluctuations but lacks direct correlation with data throughput, whereas the throughput-based method offers more accurate feedback on effective throughput at the cost of slower response. To address these limitations, a hybrid RSSI-throughput control strategy is developed, combining the responsiveness of RSSI feedback with the accuracy of throughput measurements. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid approach maintains data throughput close to the target level with minimal variance, even under rapidly changing environmental conditions."

The entanglement entropy exhibits pronounced peaks and follows the logarithmic scaling law at the phase transition points, from which we extract the central charge $c=1$. We further investigate the entanglement spectrum to accurately distinguish the different topological phases. In addition, the coupling between zero and $π$ modes leads to characteristic splittings in the entanglement spectrum, signaling their hybridization under periodic driving. These results remain robust in non-Hermitian regimes and in the presence of next-nearest-neighbor hopping, demonstrating the reliability and universality of entanglement entropy as a diagnostic for topological phase transitions."

This issue arises from architectural limits of transformers, where counting is performed across layers, leading to degraded precision for larger counting problems due to depth constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a simple test-time strategy inspired by System-2 cognitive processes that decomposes large counting tasks into smaller, independent sub-problems that the model can reliably solve. We evaluate this approach using observational and causal mediation analyses to understand the underlying mechanism of this System-2-like strategy. Our mechanistic analysis identifies key components: latent counts are computed and stored in the final item representations of each part, transferred to intermediate steps via dedicated attention heads, and aggregated in the final stage to produce the total count. Experimental results demonstrate that this strategy enables LLMs to surpass architectural limitations and achieve high accuracy on large-scale counting tasks. This work provides mechanistic insight into System-2 counting in LLMs and presents a generalizable approach for improving and understanding their reasoning behavior."

Adaptive self-consistency methods mitigate this issue by adjusting the sampling budget; however, they rely on count-based stopping rules that treat all responses equally, often leading to unnecessary sampling. We propose Reliability-Aware Adaptive Self-Consistency (ReASC), which addresses this limitation by reframing adaptive sampling from response counting to evidence sufficiency, leveraging response-level confidence for principled information aggregation. ReASC operates in two stages: a single-sample decision stage that resolves instances confidently answerable from a single response, and a reliability-aware accumulation stage that aggregates responses by jointly leveraging their frequency and confidence. Across five models and four datasets, ReASC consistently achieves the best accuracy-cost trade-off compared to existing baselines, yielding improved inference efficiency across model scales from 3B to 27B parameters. As a concrete example, ReASC reduces inference cost by up to 70\\% relative to self-consistency while preserving accuracy on GSM8K using Gemma-3-4B-it."

    "abstract": "The underperformance of existing multimodal large language models for time series reasoning lies in the absence of rationale priors that connect temporal observations to their downstream outcomes, which leads models to rely on superficial pattern matching rather than principled reasoning. We therefore propose the rationale-grounded in-context learning for time series reasoning, where rationales work as guiding reasoning units rather than post-hoc explanations, and develop the RationaleTS method. Specifically, we firstly induce label-conditioned rationales, composed of reasoning paths from observable evidence to the potential outcomes. Then, we design the hybrid retrieval by balancing temporal patterns and semantic contexts to retrieve correlated rationale priors for the final in-context inference on new samples. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed RationaleTS on three-domain time series reasoning tasks. We will release our code for reproduction."

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional Janus hydrogenated transition metal chalcogenides provide an unusual platform where lattice instabilities, electron-phonon coupling, and superconductivity are strongly intertwined. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that Janus 2H and 1T MoXH (X = S, Se) monolayers host an intrinsic, commensurate charge density wave (CDW) ground state originating from soft phonon modes at the Brillouin zone M point. Real-space supercell optimizations confirm that the CDW reconstruction lowers the total energy and fully stabilizes the lattice, eliminating the imaginary phonon modes present in the high-symmetry metallic structures. Analysis of the electronic susceptibility shows that the CDW instability is not driven by Fermi surface nesting, but instead arises from strong electron-phonon coupling. We further reveal a material-dependent interplay between CDW order and superconductivity. In 1T MoSH, CDW formation enhances low-energy phonon contributions and strengthens electron-phonon coupling, leading to an increased superconducting transition temperature. In contrast, for 1T MoSeH and 2H MoSeH, the CDW phase suppresses electron-phonon coupling and reduces superconductivity. Finally, we show that thermal fluctuations, compressive strain, and carrier doping can selectively suppress CDW order and restore superconductivity. These results establish Janus MoXH monolayers as a tunable two-dimensional system for exploring lattice-driven charge ordering and its competition with superconductivity."

    "abstract": "Extreme events such as earthquakes pose significant threats to integrated electricity-gas distribution systems (IEGDS) by causing widespread damage. Existing restoration approaches typically assume full awareness of damage, which may not be true if monitoring and communication infrastructures are impaired. In such circumstances, field inspection is necessary. This paper presents a novel adaptive restoration framework for IEGDS, considering dynamic damage assessment and repair. The restoration problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), capturing the gradually revealed contingency and the evolving impact of field crew actions. To address the computational challenges of POMDPs in real-time applications, an advanced belief tree search (BTS) algorithm is introduced. This algorithm enables crew members to continuously update their actions based on evolving belief states, leveraging comprehensive simulations to evaluate potential future trajectories and identify optimal inspection and repair strategies. Based on the BTS algorithm, a unified real-time decision-making framework is developed for IEGDS restoration. Case studies on two distinct IEGDS systems demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method. The results indicate that the proposed approach achieves an outage cost comparable to the ideal solution, and reduces the total outage cost by more than 15% compared to strategies based on stochastic programming and heuristic methods."

Two critical limitations in the field are addressed. First, individual detection methods exhibit complementary strengths and weaknesses depending on data characteristics, making method selection non-trivial and prone to suboptimal results. Second, automated, contextual explanations for detected changes are largely absent. The proposed ensemble method aggregates results from ten distinct changepoint detection algorithms, achieving superior performance and robustness compared to individual methods. Additionally, an LLM-powered explanation pipeline automatically generates contextual narratives, linking detected changepoints to potential real-world historical events. For private or domain-specific data, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution enables explanations grounded in user-provided documents. The open source Python framework demonstrates practical utility in diverse domains, including finance, political science, and environmental science, transforming raw statistical output into actionable insights for analysts and decision-makers."

    "abstract": "Recommendation for live-streaming e-commerce is gaining increasing attention due to the explosive growth of the live streaming economy. Different from traditional e-commerce, live-streaming e-commerce shifts the focus from products to streamers, which requires ranking mechanism to balance both purchases and user-streamer interactions for long-term ecology. To trade off multiple objectives, a popular solution is to build an ensemble model to integrate multi-objective scores into a unified score. The ensemble model is usually supervised by multiple independent binary classification losses of all objectives. However, this paradigm suffers from two inherent limitations. First, the optimization direction of the binary classification task is misaligned with the ranking task (evaluated by AUC). Second, this paradigm overlooks the alignment between objectives, e.g., comment and buy behaviors are partially dependent which can be revealed in labels correlations. The model can achieve better trade-offs if it learns the aligned parts of ranking abilities among different objectives. To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel multi-objective ensemble framework HarmonRank to fulfill both alignment to the ranking task and alignment among objectives. For alignment to ranking, we formulate ranking metric AUC as a rank-sum problem and utilize differentiable ranking techniques for ranking-oriented optimization. For inter-objective alignment, we change the original one-step ensemble paradigm to a two-step relation-aware ensemble scheme. Extensive offline experiments results on two industrial datasets and online experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method has been fully deployed in Kuaishou's live-streaming e-commerce recommendation platform with 400 million DAUs, contributing over 2% purchase gain."

Due to the $π$-$d$-coupling, a rearrangement of the $π$-spins occurs: At low temperatures the $g$-factor shifts enormously with a pronounced in-plane anisotropy that flips as the temperature decreases; the lines broaden significantly; and the spin susceptibility increases upon cooling with a kink at the phase transition. By carefully analyzing the angular dependence of $g(θ)$ and $ΔH(θ)$ we reveal the influence of anisotropic Zeeman interaction in addition to spin-phonon coupling. We conclude the presence of two magnetically distinct BETS chains and discuss the possibility of altermagnetic order."

This limiting diffusion has the distinctive feature of being absorbed at the boundary of the simplex. More precisely, once the process reaches a face \\[ Σ_A = \\{(x_1,\\dots,x_S) : x_i \\ge 0,\\; \\sum_{i\\in A} x_i = 1\\}, \\qquad A \\subset S, \\] it remains confined to this set and evolves in the corresponding lower-dimensional simplex according to a new diffusion whose parameters depend on the subset $A$. This mechanism repeats itself, leading to successive reductions of the dimension, until one of the vertices of the simplex is reached in finite time. At that point, the process becomes permanently trapped. The proof relies on a method to extend the domain of the associated martingale problem, which may be of independent interest and useful in other contexts."

Previous methods typically focus on predicting numerical scores without explanation or provide low-level descriptions lacking precise scores. Recent reasoning-based vision language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for IQA, enabling joint generation of quality descriptions and scores. However, we notice that existing VLM-based IQA methods tend to exhibit unreliable reasoning due to their limited capability of integrating visual and textual cues. In this work, we introduce Zoom-IQA, a VLM-based IQA model to explicitly emulate key cognitive behaviors: uncertainty awareness, region reasoning, and iterative refinement. Specifically, we present a two-stage training pipeline: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our Grounded-Rationale-IQA (GR-IQA) dataset to teach the model to ground its assessments in key regions; and 2) reinforcement learning (RL) for dynamic policy exploration, primarily stabilized by our KL-Coverage regularizer to prevent reasoning and scoring diversity collapse, and supported by a Progressive Re-sampling Strategy to mitigate annotation bias. Extensive experiments show that Zoom-IQA achieves improved robustness, explainability, and generalization. The application to downstream tasks, such as image restoration, further demonstrates the effectiveness of Zoom-IQA."

Unlike single-molecule pre-trained LLMs constrained to specific applications, ChemBART addresses broader chemical challenges and integrates them for comprehensive synthesis planning. Crucially, ChemBART-designed multi-step synthesis routes and reaction conditions directly inspired wet-lab validation, which confirmed shorter pathways with ~30% yield improvement over literature benchmarks. Our work validates the power of reaction-focused pre-training and showcases the broad utility of ChemBART in advancing the complete synthesis planning cycle."

Our primary objective is to study the combinatorial aspects of the restriction $\\mathcal{A}^{(B,\\bm b)}$ to the solution space of $B\\bm x=\\bm b$, and its reduction $\\mathcal{A}_q^{(B,\\bm b)}$ modulo $q$. This work generalizes the earlier results of Kamiya, Takemura and Terao, as well as Chen and Wang. The purpose of this paper is threefold as follows. Firstly, we derive an explicit counting formula for the cardinality of the complement $M\\big(\\mathcal{A}_q^{(B,\\bm b)}\\big)$ of $\\mathcal{A}_q^{(B,\\bm b)}$; and prove that for all positive integers $q>q_0$, this cardinality coincides with a quasi-polynomial $χ^{\\text{quasi}}\\big(\\mathcal{A}^{(B,\\bm b)},q\\big)$ in $q$ with a period $ρ_C$. Secondly, we weaken Chen and Wang's original hypothesis $a \\mid b$ to a strictly more general condition $\\gcd(a,ρ_C)\\mid \\gcd(b,ρ_C)$, and introduce the concept of combinatorial equivalence for positive integers. Within this framework, we establish three unified comparison relations: between the unsigned coefficients of $χ^{\\text{quasi}}\\big(\\mathcal{A}^{(B,\\bm b)},a\\big)$ and $χ^{\\text{quasi}}\\big(\\mathcal{A}^{(B,\\bm b)},b\\big)$; between the unsigned coefficients of distinct constituents of $χ^{\\text{quasi}}\\big(\\mathcal{A}^{(B,\\bm b)},q\\big)$; and between the cardinalities of $M\\big(\\mathcal{A}_q^{(B,\\bm b)}\\big)$ and $M\\big(\\mathcal{A}_{pq}^{(B,\\bm b)}\\big)$.

    "abstract": "Visually impaired users face significant challenges in daily information access and real-time environmental perception, and there is an urgent need for intelligent assistive systems with accurate recognition capabilities. Although large-scale models provide effective solutions for perception and reasoning, their practical deployment on assistive devices is severely constrained by excessive memory consumption and high inference costs. Moreover, existing quantization strategies often ignore inter-block error accumulation, leading to degraded model stability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel quantization framework -- Residual-Projected Multi-Collaboration Closed-Loop and Single Instance Quantization(RPIQ), whose quantization process adopts a multi-collaborative closed-loop compensation scheme based on Single Instance Calibration and Gauss-Seidel Iterative Quantization. Experiments on various types of large-scale models, including language models such as OPT, Qwen, and LLaMA, as well as vision-language models such as CogVLM2, demonstrate that RPIQ can compress models to 4-bit representation while significantly reducing peak memory consumption (approximately 60%-75% reduction compared to original full-precision models). The method maintains performance highly close to full-precision models across multiple language and visual tasks, and exhibits excellent recognition and reasoning capabilities in key applications such as text understanding and visual question answering in complex scenarios. While verifying the effectiveness of RPIQ for deployment in real assistive systems, this study also advances the computational efficiency and reliability of large models, enabling them to provide visually impaired users with the required information accurately and rapidly."

    "abstract": "We propose an innovative definition of the scale at which the Universe becomes homogeneous based on measurements of velocities rather than densities. When using the matter density field, one has to choose an arbitrary scale (e.g. within 1\\% of the average density) to define the transition to homogeneity. Furthermore, the resulting homogeneity scale is strongly degenerate with the galaxy bias. By contrast, peculiar velocities (PV) allow us to define an unambiguous scale of homogeneity, namely the distance at which the velocities between pairs of galaxies change from being on-average correlated to anti-correlated. Physically, this relates to when the motion of pairs of galaxies is influenced by the matter density between them, rather than beyond. The disadvantage is that peculiar velocities are more difficult to measure than positions, resulting in smaller samples with larger uncertainties. Nevertheless, we illustrate the potential of this approach using the peculiar velocity correlation functions obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey PV catalog, finding an homogeneity scale of $R_H\\approx 133\\substack{+28 \\\\ -52}\\, \\rm{Mpc/h}$. Finally, we show that more precise measurements are within reach of upcoming peculiar velocity surveys, and highlight this homogeneity scale's potential use as a standard ruler within the standard cosmological model."

    "abstract": "Defining agency is an extremely important challenge for cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Physics generally describes mechanical happenings, but there remains an unbridgeable gap between them and the acts of agents. To discuss the morality and responsibility of agents, it is necessary to model acts; whether such responsible acts can be fully explained by physical determinism has been debated. Although we have already proposed a physical \"agent determinism\" model that appears to go beyond mere mechanical happenings, we have not yet established a strict mathematical formalism to eliminate ambiguity. Here, we explain why a physical system can follow coarse-graining agent-level determination without violating physical laws by formulating supervenient causation. Generally, supervenience including coarse graining does not change without a change in its lower base; therefore, a single supervenience alone cannot define supervenient causation. We define supervenient causation as the causal efficacy from the supervenience level to its lower base level. Although an algebraic expression composed of the multiple supervenient functions does supervenes on the base, a sequence of indices that determines the algebraic expression does not supervene on the base. Therefore, the sequence can possess unique dynamical laws that are independent of the lower base level. This independent dynamics creates the possibility for temporally preceding changes at the supervenience level to cause changes at the lower base level. Such a dual-laws system is considered useful for modeling self-determining agents such as humans."

These materials combine the advantages of nonrelativistic spin-polarization akin to FMs and vanished net-magnetization as AFMs, making them highly promising for spintronic applications. Furthermore, they introduce nontrivial spin-momentum locking spin texture as an additional degree of freedom for realizing novel quantum phases. In this work, we report the discovery of a new type of spin-valley-locked nodal line phase in the layered AM Rb-intercalated V{_2}Te{_2}O. By combining high-resolution spin and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with first-principles calculations, we observe the coexistence of both spinless and spinful nodal lines near the Fermi level. Remarkably, the spinful nodal lines exhibit uniform spin polarization within each valley, while displaying opposite spin polarizations across symmetry-paired valleys-a unique feature we term spin-valley-locked nodal lines, which is exclusive to AMs. Direct measurements of out-of-plane band dispersion using a side-cleaving technique reveal the two-dimensional nature of these nodal lines. Our findings not only unveil a previously unexplored topological phase in AMs where valley-locked spin as an additional quantum character but also establish RbV{_2}Te{_2}O as a promising platform for spintronics, valleytronics, and moire-engineered quantum devices."

In four galaxies (ESO 428-G14, NGC 4388, NGC 3081, and NGC 5728), we detect spatially resolved dust structures extending ~100-200 pc along the NLR. In these systems, we find a strong link between the morphology of the dust, the radio ejecta, and the coronal [Si VI] emission, implying that dust carries imprints of the processes shaping the NLR. Using spatially resolved spectral energy distributions, we show that dust in the NLR has systematically steeper slopes than star forming clumps. This dust emits at temperatures in the range 150 - 220 K, at a distance of ~150 pc from the nucleus. Using simple models, we show that, even under optimistic assumptions of grain size and AGN luminosity, the excess MIR emission cannot be explained by AGN illumination alone. We interpret this excess heating as in-situ. We show that shocks with velocities of $v_{\\rm shock} \\sim 200- 400 \\, \\rm km/s$ in dense gas can close this gap, and in some cases even account for the total observed emission. This, combined with multiple lines of evidence for shocks in these regions, supports a scenario in which shocks not only coexist with dust but may be playing a key role in heating it. Our findings reveal shocks may be an important and previously overlooked driver of extended dust emission in the central hundreds of parsecs in AGN."

We measure the physical properties, including UV continuum slope ($β_{\\rm UV}$), stellar mass ($M_*$), star formation rate (SFR), and sizes. Our highest redshift galaxy candidate at $z=13.71\\pm0.15$ has a remarkably bright UV luminosity of $M_{\\rm UV}=-21.19\\pm0.08$, making it the brightest galaxy at $z>12$ if spectroscopically confirmed. With an extremely blue UV slope, compact morphology, and high star formation rate surface density ($Σ_{\\rm SFR}$), this candidate may have extremely low metallicity, high ionizing photon escape fraction, or contributions from an AGN. Among our multiple independent sightlines, we identify three fields of galaxy number overdensity with $>3σ$ significance. The properties of galaxies in various environments do not exhibit significant differences, implying either that accelerated galaxy evolution in overdense regions is not yet widespread at $z>7$, or that the current constraints are limited by sample size. Our simulations indicate that increasing the sample by an order of magnitude would allow such environmental trends to be robustly confirmed or ruled out, underscoring the importance of future pure-parallel observations."

Conventional QKD contains public classical post-processing steps that require authentication to prevent impersonation and maintain security. However, a major limitation of QKD is it cannot perform authentication by itself, and thus requires a separate authentication mechanism. In addition, these public classical steps also have information leakage which subjects QKD to additional attack strategies and reduces the final key rate. In this work, we propose a new QKD variant that removes the need for a separate authentication mechanism, eliminates information leakage, and achieves a substantially higher key rate. By having two more protocol keys than conventional QKD and no public classical steps, our design achieves (almost) perfect information-theoretic security with the protocol keys reusable."

By optimizing the fabrication, we demonstrate record Q-factors of 5.4$\\times$10$^6$ and 2.2$\\times$10$^6$ for AlN microresonators in the near-infrared and near-visible, respectively. Polarized-mode-interaction was used to create anomalous dispersion to support bright AlN Dirac solitons. Measurement of polarization-dependent spectra reveals the polarization hybridization of the Dirac soliton. In a microresonator with normal dispersion, Raman assisted four-wave-mixing (RFWM) was observed to initiate platicon formation, adding an approach to generate normal dispersion microcombs. A design of width-varying waveguides was used to ensure both efficient coupling and high Q-factor for racetrack microresonators at 780 nm. The microresonator was pumped to generate near-visble Raman laser at 820 nm with a fundamental linewidth narrower than 220 Hz. Our work unlocks new opportunities for integrated AlN photonics by improving Q-factors and uncovering nonlinear dynamics in AlN microresonators."

    "abstract": "Despite the empirical success of extensive, step-by-step reasoning in large multimodal models, long reasoning processes inevitably incur substantial computational overhead, i.e., in terms of higher token costs and increased response time, which undermines inference efficiency. In contrast, humans often employ sketch-style reasoning: a concise, goal-directed cognitive process that prioritizes salient information and enables efficient problem-solving. Inspired by this cognitive efficiency, we propose SketchThinker-R1, which incentivizes sketch-style reasoning ability in large multimodal models. Our method consists of three primary stages. In the Sketch-Mode Cold Start stage, we convert standard long reasoning process into sketch-style reasoning and finetune base multimodal model, instilling initial sketch-style reasoning capability. Next, we train SketchJudge Reward Model, which explicitly evaluates thinking process of model and assigns higher scores to sketch-style reasoning. Finally, we conduct Sketch-Thinking Reinforcement Learning under supervision of SketchJudge to further generalize sketch-style reasoning ability. Experimental evaluation on four benchmarks reveals that our SketchThinker-R1 achieves over 64% reduction in reasoning token cost without compromising final answer accuracy. Qualitative analysis further shows that sketch-style reasoning focuses more on key cues during problem solving."

The receiver is required to decode the transmitted message and, in addition, reconstruct the state under a common reconstruction constraint ensuring that its estimate coincides with that at the transmitter. A complete characterization of the optimal rate distortion tradeoff region for this setting is the main result of our work. The analytical results are also validated through numerical examples illustrating the rate distortion and power distortion tradeoffs."

We present a follow-the-leader endoscopic robot based on a flexible continuum structure designed to minimize contact between the endoscope body and intestinal walls, thereby reducing patient discomfort. To achieve this objective, we propose a vision-based deep reinforcement learning framework guided by monocular depth estimation. A realistic intestinal simulation environment was constructed in \\textit{NVIDIA Omniverse} to train and evaluate autonomous navigation strategies. Furthermore, thousands of synthetic intraluminal images were generated using NVIDIA Replicator to fine-tune the Depth Anything model, enabling dense three-dimensional perception of the intestinal environment with a single monocular camera. Subsequently, we introduce a geometry-aware reward and penalty mechanism to enable accurate lumen tracking. Compared with the original Depth Anything model, our method improves $δ_{1}$ depth accuracy by 39.2% and reduces the navigation J-index by 0.67 relative to the second-best method, demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach."

To accommodate the high photon flux from a solar flare and these diverse detector types, a modular DAQ network architecture was implemented based on SpaceWire and the Remote Memory Access Protocol (RMAP). This modular architecture enabled fast, reliable, and scalable communication among various onboard components, including detectors, readout boards, onboard computers, and telemetry systems. In addition, by standardizing the communication interface and modularizing each detector unit and its associated electronics, the architecture also supported distributed development among collaborating institutions, simplifying integration and reducing overall complexity. To realize this architecture, we developed FPGA-based readout boards (SPMU-001 and SPMU-002) that support SpaceWire communication for high-speed data transfer and flexible instrument control. In addition, a real-time ground support system was developed to handle telemetry and command operations during flight, enabling live monitoring and adaptive configuration of onboard instruments in response to the properties of the observed solar flare. The same architecture is being adopted for the upcoming FOXSI-5 mission, scheduled for launch in 2026."

Legal systems have long been open to extending personhood to non-human entities, most prominently corporations, for instrumental or inherent reasons. Instrumental rationales emphasize accountability and administrative efficiency, whereas inherent ones appeal to moral worth and autonomy. Neither is yet sufficient to justify conferring personhood on AI. Nevertheless, the acceleration of technological autonomy may lead us to reconsider how law conceptualizes agency and responsibility. Drawing on comparative jurisprudence, corporate theory, and the emerging literature on AI governance, the paper argues that existing frameworks can address short-term accountability gaps, but the eventual development of superintelligence may force a paradigmatic shift in our understanding of law itself. In such a speculative future, legal personality may depend less on the cognitive sophistication of machines than on humanity's ability to preserve our own moral and institutional sovereignty."

Here we show that, in monoclinic $β$-\\ce{Ga2O3}, a promising ultrawide-bandgap semiconductor, surface crystallographic orientation deterministically governs radiation tolerance through highly anisotropic kinetics of the $β$-to-$γ$ phase transition. Using machine-learning molecular dynamics coupled with a local configurational-entropy descriptor, we quantitatively map anisotropic $β$-to-$γ$ transition kinetics, showing that the critical dose, transition-layer depth, and kinetic stability of the $γ$-phase are fundamentally governed by surface orientation. Under ion irradiation, non-channeling surfaces such as (100), (001), and (-201) undergo severe surface amorphization, whereas the strongly channeling (010) surface resists damage accumulation and promotes subsurface $γ$-phase nucleation. During thermal annealing recovery process, these initial states follow two distinct recovery pathways: the channeling (010) surface reverts directly from $γ$-to-$β$, whereas non-channeling surfaces follow a sequential amorphous-to-$γ$-to-$β$ transition pathway. This work establishes surface orientation as a fundamental design principle for achieving radiation tolerance through controlled polymorphic transitions, providing a universal framework for engineering functional materials capable of withstanding extreme irradiation environments."

In this paper, we examine measurement using the Q-based, objective-field model for quantum mechanics. Schrodinger considered a microscopic system prepared in a superposition of states which is then coupled to a macroscopic meter. We analyze the entangled meter and system, and measurements on it, by solving forward-backward stochastic differential equations for real amplitudes $x(t)$ and $p(t)$ that correspond to the phase-space variables of the Q function of the system at a time $t$. We model the system and meter as single-mode fields, and measurement of $\\hat{x}$ by amplification of the amplitude $x(t)$. Our conclusion is that the outcome for the measurement is determined at (or by) the time $t_{m}$, when the coupling to the meter is complete, the meter states being macroscopically distinguishable. There is consistency with macroscopic realism. By evaluating the distribution of the amplitudes $x$ and $p$ postselected on a given outcome of the meter, we show how the $Q$-based model represents a more complete description of quantum mechanics: The variances associated with amplitudes $x$ and $p$ are too narrow to comply with the uncertainty principle, ruling out that the distribution represents a quantum state. We conclude that the collapse of the wavefunction occurs as a two-stage process: First there is an amplification that creates branches of amplitudes $x(t)$ of the meter, associated with distinct eigenvalues. The outcome of measurement is determined by $x(t)$ once amplified, explaining Born's rule. Second, the distribution that determines the final collapse is the state inferred for the system conditioned on the outcome of the meter: information is lost about the meter, in particular, about the complementary variable $p$."

Existing meta-learning-based approaches require a shared representation of environmental structures, which lack flexibility for realistic non-structural disturbances. Besides, representation error and the distribution shifts can lead to heavy degradation in prediction accuracy. This work presents a generalizable disturbance estimation framework that builds on meta-learning and feedback-calibrated online adaptation. By extracting features from a finite time window of past observations, a unified representation that effectively captures general non-structural disturbances can be learned without predefined structural assumptions. The online adaptation process is subsequently calibrated by a state-feedback mechanism to attenuate the learning residual originating from the representation and generalizability limitations. Theoretical analysis shows that simultaneous convergence of both the online learning error and the disturbance estimation error can be achieved. Through the unified meta-representation, our framework effectively estimates multiple rapidly changing disturbances, as demonstrated by quadrotor flight experiments.

This milestone represents a major advancement for GW cosmology, as many methods, particularly those employing the spectral siren approach, critically depend on the number of available sources. We investigate the impact of a novel parametric model describing the full population mass spectrum of CBCs on the estimation of the Hubble constant. This model is designed to test the impact of heavy black holes in GW cosmology. We perform a joint inference of cosmological and population parameters using 142 CBCs from GWTC-4.0 with a false alarm rate smaller than 0.25 per year, using both spectral and dark siren approaches. With spectral sirens, we estimate the Hubble constant to be $H_0 = 78.8^{+19.0}_{-15.3}\\,{\\rm km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ (68% CL), while the dark siren method yields $H_0 = 82.5^{+16.8}_{-14.3}\\,{\\rm km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ (68% CL). These results improve the uncertainty by approximately 30.4% and 36.2%, respectively. We show that this improvement is linked to the presence of a new mass scale in the binary black hole mass spectrum at $63.3^{+4.8}_{-4.8}\\,M_{\\odot}$, which provides additional constraints on the Hubble constant. Besides providing the tightest standard-siren constraints on $H_0$, this highlights the importance of a heavy-mass feature in the black hole spectrum."

We then propose STReasoner, which empowers LLM to integrate time series, graph structure, and text for explicit reasoning. To promote spatially grounded logic, we introduce S-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that rewards performance gains specifically attributable to spatial information.

    "abstract": "Constructing a thermodynamic framework for nonequilibrium systems remains a major challenge, as quantities such as temperature and free energy often become ambiguous when inferred solely from steady-state properties. Here we take a transformation-based approach and experimentally examine transitions between nonequilibrium steady states (NESS). Using an optically trapped microparticle driven by a tunable correlated stochastic force, we generate active-like steady states with controllable noise statistics. By abruptly changing the trap stiffness, we measure the stochastic work, heat, and entropy produced during NESS-to-NESS transformations. We identify a state-dependent effective temperature that restores the second law for these transitions, enabling the definition of a generalized work that incorporates the consequence of the nonequilibrium fluctuations. With this quantity, we derive and experimentally verify a Crooks-like fluctuation relation linking work distributions to a nonequilibrium free-energy difference defined through the effective temperature. Finally, we establish a fluctuation-response relation for the positional variance following stiffness changes. We demonstrate that this relation is key to distinguishing systems that can be described by a unique effective temperature (i.e., those under equilibrium or white-noise conditions) from those under colored-noise, where an equilibrium-like response cannot be restored. These results delineate the applicability and limits of effective-temperature thermodynamics in driven systems."

In this work, we show that one can overcome these obstacles by using a linear Hamiltonian-based machine learning method which provides a compact quantum representation of classical data via ground state problems for k-local Hamiltonians. We use the recent sample-based Krylov quantum diagonalization method to compute low-energy states of the data Hamiltonians, whose parameters are trained to express classical datasets through local gradients. We demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of the methods by performing experiments on benchmark datasets using up to 50 qubits of an IBM Heron quantum processor."

    "abstract": "This paper studies the transferability of altitude-dependent spectrum activity models and measurements across years. We introduce a physics-informed, mean-only stochastic-geometry model of aggregate interference to altitude-binned received power, yielding three interpretable parameters for a given band and campaign: 1) line-of-sight transition slope, 2) transition altitude, and 3) effective activity constant. Analysis of aerial spectrum measurements collected from 2023 to 2025 across multiple sub-6 GHz bands reveals that downlink (DL) and shared-access bands preserve a persistent geometry-driven altitude structure that is stable across years. In contrast, uplink (UL) bands exhibit weak altitude dependence with no identifiable transition, indicating that interference is dominated by activity dynamics rather than propagation geometry. To quantify the practical limits of model reuse, we evaluate a minimal-calibration method in which the transition altitude is fixed from a reference year and the remaining parameters are estimated from only two altitude bins in the target year. The results further indicate that the proposed approach provides accurate predictions for DL and CBRS bands, suggesting the feasibility of low-cost model transfer in stable environments, while highlighting the reduced applicability of mean-field models for UL scenarios."

Most of the readily available coils have been designed intuitively instead of systematic mathematical-physical optimization as there were no methods available at the time. Previous research however demonstrated that these coils are far from optimum, e.g., for pulse energy or efficiency, and leave substantial room for lots of improvements. Techniques for rigorous mathematical optimization have been developed but are only available to very few groups worldwide. This paper presents an open-source toolbox, COMATOSE, to change that situation and make these methods available to a wider community. It incorporates the fundamental formalisms and offers vector space decomposition as well as base mapping as an explicit forward method, which is computationally less demanding than iterative computational optimization but can also form the initial solution for a subsequent optimization run if desired."

To resolve this challenge, we propose an efficient approach to fine-tune small language models (SLMs) for accurate relevance labeling, enabling high-throughput, domain-specific labeling comparable or even better in quality to that of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). To overcome the lack of high-quality and accessible datasets in the enterprise domain, our method leverages on synthetic data generation. Specifically, we employ an LLM to synthesize realistic enterprise queries from a seed document, apply BM25 to retrieve hard negatives, and use a teacher LLM to assign relevance scores. The resulting dataset is then distilled into an SLM, producing a compact relevance labeler. We evaluate our approach on a high-quality benchmark consisting of 923 enterprise query-document pairs annotated by trained human annotators, and show that the distilled SLM achieves agreement with human judgments on par with or better than the teacher LLM. Furthermore, our fine-tuned labeler substantially improves throughput, achieving 17 times increase while also being 19 times more cost-effective. This approach enables scalable and cost-effective relevance labeling for enterprise-scale retrieval applications, supporting rapid offline evaluation and iteration in real-world settings."

We formalize this discrepancy as Conduction Aphasia, a phenomenon where models accurately interpret multimodal inputs but struggle to translate that understanding into faithful and controllable synthesis. To address this, we propose UniCorn, a simple yet elegant self-improvement framework that eliminates the need for external data or teacher supervision. By partitioning a single UMM into three collaborative roles: Proposer, Solver, and Judge, UniCorn generates high-quality interactions via self-play and employs cognitive pattern reconstruction to distill latent understanding into explicit generative signals. To validate the restoration of multimodal coherence, we introduce UniCycle, a cycle-consistency benchmark based on a Text to Image to Text reconstruction loop. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniCorn achieves comprehensive and substantial improvements over the base model across six general image generation benchmarks. Notably, it achieves SOTA performance on TIIF(73.8), DPG(86.8), CompBench(88.5), and UniCycle while further delivering substantial gains of +5.0 on WISE and +6.5 on OneIG. These results highlight that our method significantly enhances T2I generation while maintaining robust comprehension, demonstrating the scalability of fully self-supervised refinement for unified multimodal intelligence."

While Large Language Models possess strong reasoning capabilities, they struggle to emulate this self-evolution: fine-tuning is computationally expensive and prone to catastrophic forgetting, while existing memory-based methods rely on passive semantic matching that often retrieves noise. To address these challenges, we propose MemRL, a framework that enables agents to self-evolve via non-parametric reinforcement learning on episodic memory. MemRL explicitly separates the stable reasoning of a frozen LLM from the plastic, evolving memory. Unlike traditional methods, MemRL employs a Two-Phase Retrieval mechanism that filters candidates by semantic relevance and then selects them based on learned Q-values (utility). These utilities are continuously refined via environmental feedback in an trial-and-error manner, allowing the agent to distinguish high-value strategies from similar noise. Extensive experiments on HLE, BigCodeBench, ALFWorld, and Lifelong Agent Bench demonstrate that MemRL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Our analysis experiments confirm that MemRL effectively reconciles the stability-plasticity dilemma, enabling continuous runtime improvement without weight updates."

We focus on two important types of tasks in wireless network management: prediction tasks and control tasks. In particular, we first discuss FMs-enabled multi-modal contextual information understanding in wireless networks. Then, we explain how FMs can be applied to prediction and control tasks, respectively. Following this, we introduce the development of wireless-specific FMs from two perspectives: available datasets for development and the methodologies used.

However, their inherently multiple step inference process imposes substantial computational overhead, hindering real-world deployment. Accelerating diffusion models is therefore essential, yet determining how to combine multiple model acceleration techniques remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we introduce a framework driven by large language models (LLMs) for automated acceleration code generation and evaluation. First, we present DiffBench, a comprehensive benchmark that implements a three stage automated evaluation pipeline across diverse diffusion architectures, optimization combinations and deployment scenarios. Second, we propose DiffAgent, an agent that generates optimal acceleration strategies and codes for arbitrary diffusion models. DiffAgent employs a closed-loop workflow in which a planning component and a debugging component iteratively refine the output of a code generation component, while a genetic algorithm extracts performance feedback from the execution environment to guide subsequent code refinements. We provide a detailed explanation of the DiffBench construction and the design principles underlying DiffAgent. Extensive experiments show that DiffBench offers a thorough evaluation of generated codes and that DiffAgent significantly outperforms existing LLMs in producing effective diffusion acceleration strategies."

However, some geological faults in this region have generated intense earthquakes. In this context, we intend to describe a recent earthquake of magnitude around 6.5 M_b that occurred at a depth of approximately 600 km in the state of Acre, Brazil. In this work, we modeled the propagation of P-SV seismic waves using a two-dimensional system of partial differential equations (PDEs) in a two-dimensional vertical rectangular domain. The source is modeled by a Gaussian pulse function. The initial quiescence condition and Neumann boundary conditions are used. The PDE system is discretized by the finite difference method (FDM) and solved by the Gauss-Seidel method (GSM). The numerical simulations obtained describe the propagation of attenuated seismic waves in multiple geological layers, simulating intense and deep earthquakes in Acre. We used the propagation of perfect seismic waves to validate the model. The results include images of the simulations and theoretical seismograms simulating the vertical and horizontal displacement in the epicenter region and 200 km east and west of the epicenter."

No algebraic structures are imposed on these collections. This setting allows us to uncover a close relationship between scissors congruence problems on the one hand and finite hyperplane arrangements on the other hand: there are many parallel results in these fields, for which the parallelism seems to have gone unnoticed. In particular, certain properties of the Varchenko--Gelfand algebras for arrangements translate to properties of polytope rings or valuations. Studying these properties is possible in a general topological setting, that is, in the context of the so-called topological arrangements, where hyperplanes do not have to be straight and may even have nontrivial topology."

We consider first a weak space-time formulation with test functions projected onto discontinuous polynomials of one degree lower in time, showing that it is equivalent to the scheme proposed in [French, Peterson 1996] in the linear case, and extended in [Karakashian, Makridakis 2005] to the semilinear case. In particular, this equivalence shows that this method conserves energy at mesh nodes but is not symplectic. We then introduce two symplectic variants, obtained through Gauss-Legendre and Gauss-Lobatto quadratures in time, and show that they correspond to specific Runge-Kutta time integrators. These connections clarify the geometric structure of the space-time methods considered."

We investigate this through systematic disentanglement experiments on distribution-based tasks, employing Cross-CoT experiments to isolate the effect of reasoning text from intrinsic model priors. We observe a distinct \"decoupled mechanism\": while CoT improves distributional alignment, final accuracy is dictated by CoT content (99% variance contribution), whereas distributional ranking is governed by model priors (over 80%). Step-wise analysis further shows that while CoT's influence on accuracy grows monotonically during the reasoning process, distributional structure is largely determined by LLM's intrinsic priors. These findings suggest that long CoT serves as a decisive LLM decision-maker for the top option but fails to function as a granular distribution calibrator for ambiguous tasks."

Recently, the detection of large-scale very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission around the black hole transient V4641 Sgr and other BH-jet systems suggested that jets from microquasars may play an important role in the production of galactic cosmic rays. V4641 Sgr is known for its superluminal radio jet discovered in 1999, but no radio counterpart of a large-scale jet has been observed. The goal of this work is to search for a radio counterpart of the extended VHE source. We observed V4641 Sgr with the MeerKAT radio telescope at the L and UHF bands and produced deep maps of the field using high dynamic range techniques. We report the discovery of a large-scale (35 pc), bow-tie-shaped, diffuse, radio structure around V4641 Sgr, with similar angular size to the extended X-ray emission discovered by XRISM. However, it is not spatially coincident with the extended VHE emission. After discussing the association of the structure with V4641 Sgr, we investigate the nature of the emission mechanism. We suggest that the bow-tie structure arose from the long-term action of large-scale jets or disk winds from V4641 Sgr. If the emission mechanism is of synchrotron origin, the radio/X-ray extended structure implies acceleration of electrons up to more than 100 TeV as far as tens of parsecs from the black hole."

    "abstract": "Given a table T in a database and a question Q in natural language, the table question answering (TQA) task aims to return an accurate answer to Q based on the content of T. Recent state-of-the-art solutions leverage large language models (LLMs) to obtain high-quality answers. However, most rely on proprietary, large-scale LLMs with costly API access, posing a significant financial barrier. This paper instead focuses on TQA with smaller, open-weight LLMs that can run on a desktop or laptop. This setting is challenging, as such LLMs typically have weaker capabilities than large proprietary models, leading to substantial performance degradation with existing methods. We observe that a key reason for this degradation is that prior approaches often require the LLM to solve a highly sophisticated task using long, complex prompts, which exceed the capabilities of small open-weight LLMs. Motivated by this observation, we present Orchestra, a multi-agent approach that unlocks the potential of accessible LLMs for high-quality, cost-effective TQA. Orchestra coordinates a group of LLM agents, each responsible for a relatively simple task, through a structured, layered workflow to solve complex TQA problems -- akin to an orchestra. By reducing the prompt complexity faced by each agent, Orchestra significantly improves output reliability. We implement Orchestra on top of AgentScope, an open-source multi-agent framework, and evaluate it on multiple TQA benchmarks using a wide range of open-weight LLMs. Experimental results show that Orchestra achieves strong performance even with small- to medium-sized models. For example, with Qwen2.5-14B, Orchestra reaches 72.1% accuracy on WikiTQ, approaching the best prior result of 75.3% achieved with GPT-4; with larger Qwen, Llama, or DeepSeek models, Orchestra outperforms all prior methods and establishes new state-of-the-art results across all benchmarks."

    "abstract": "In this study, we present observational constraints on a class of phenomenological interacting dark energy (IDE) models that admit analytical solutions for the Hubble parameter $H(z)$. We consider a set of five linear and three non-linear IDE scenarios, encompassing both interactions proportional to the dark matter and/or dark energy densities, as well as non-linear combinations of the two. For all eight IDE models, we find a better fit than $Λ$CDM from a $Δχ^2$ analysis for both combinations of datasets considered. When using the Akaike Information Criterion ($Δ$AIC), we find a similarly improved fit in all cases, except for one dataset combination in $Q=3Hδρ_{\\rm de}$. Our analysis also shows a preference for sign-switching interactions, with energy transfer from dark energy to dark matter at low redshift, reversing direction at higher redshift. These results should be interpreted with caution, as the latter direction of energy transfer is accompanied by negative dark energy densities in the past, which may be unphysical. Models that do not allow sign-changing behaviour instead show a preference for energy flow from dark matter to dark energy, and hence negative dark energy densities. The only exceptions are $Q=3Hδρ_{\\rm de}$ and $Q=3Hδ\\left(\\tfrac{ρ_{\\rm de}^2}{ρ_{\\rm dm}+ρ_{\\rm de}}\\right)$, which exhibit energy flow in the opposite direction. Furthermore, for all interactions considered, we find a phantom-divide crossing in the effective dark energy equation of state $w^{\\rm eff}_{\\rm de}$, with the dark energy density decreasing ($w^{\\rm eff}_{\\rm de}>-1$) at present and at low redshift, while increasing ($w^{\\rm eff}_{\\rm de}<-1$) in the past at high redshift. These results highlight the promising, but problematic, nature of dark sector interactions, as well as the need to extend the analysis using early-time physics and datasets."

    "abstract": "We develop a structure-aware reinforcement learning (RL) approach for delay- and energy-aware flow allocation in 5G User Plane Functions (UPFs). We consider a dynamic system with $K$ heterogeneous UPFs of varying capacities that handle stochastic arrivals of $M$ flow types, each with distinct rate requirements. We model the system as a Markov decision process (MDP) to capture the stochastic nature of flow arrivals and departures (possibly unknown), as well as the impact of flow allocation in the system. To solve this problem, we propose a post-decision state (PDS) based value iteration algorithm that exploits the underlying structure of the MDP. By separating action-controlled dynamics from exogenous factors, PDS enables faster convergence and efficient adaptive flow allocation, even in the absence of statistical knowledge about exogenous variables. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method converges faster and achieves lower long-term cost than standard Q-learning, highlighting the effectiveness of PDS-based RL for resource allocation in wireless networks."

We show by induction over cell attachments that these two $\\infty$-categories are in fact equivalent when the operad is cofibrant. This yields explicit point-set models for $E_n$-coalgebras and $E_\\infty$-coalgebras in the derived $\\infty$-category of chain complexes over a field, and an explicit point-set model for the cellular chains functor with its $E_\\infty$-coalgebra structure. After Bachmann--Burklund, this gives a point-set algebraic model for nilpotent $p$-adic homotopy types."

We analyze the dynamics of charged particles on circular orbits and derive the corresponding radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies. The influence of the nonlinear electrodynamics parameter, magnetic coupling, dyonic charge, and quintessence state parameter on the innermost stable circular orbit and epicyclic frequencies is examined in detail. Using the forced resonance model, we compare the theoretical predictions of high-frequency QPOs with observational data from several X-ray binary systems. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis is employed to constrain the black hole parameters and assess the role of weak magnetization and nonlinear electrodynamics effects. This analysis indicates that QPO observations tightly constrain the black hole mass and orbital radius while placing stringent upper bounds on the ModMax coupling, magnetic interaction, and dyonic charge. In addition, we study the radiative properties of the accretion disk and analyze the effects of the model parameters on the disk flux and temperature profiles. These findings suggest that the observed QPOs are consistent with general relativity in the strong-field regime, allowing only small deviations associated with Einstein-Maxwell theory in the presence of a quintessence field."

Although many approaches seek to align large language models (LLMs) with human moral values, how to enable them morally sensitive has been extremely challenging. In this paper, we take a step toward answering the question: how can we enhance moral sensitivity in LLMs? Specifically, we propose two pragmatic inference methods that faciliate LLMs to diagnose morally benign and hazardous input and correct moral errors, whereby enhancing LLMs' moral sensitivity. A central strength of our pragmatic inference methods is their unified perspective: instead of modeling moral discourses across semantically diverse and complex surface forms, they offer a principled perspective for designing pragmatic inference procedures grounded in their inferential loads. Empirical evidence demonstrates that our pragmatic methods can enhance moral sensitivity in LLMs and achieves strong performance on representative morality-relevant benchmarks."

Using the iid decomposition, we are able to make an assumption-lean estimation of the correlation. A motivating example using the developed approach is provided. Here, we illustrate how the suggested approach can be used to give a realistic quantification of expected conjunctive power that can guide the design of a new randomized clinical trial using historical data.

This research addresses that gap through a comparative analysis of social media data and actual vote shares during the election period. A review of existing literature establishes the study's framework and highlights the need for empirical investigation in this area. The findings aim to reveal whether online discussions align with electoral results and to what extent digital sentiment reflects voter behavior. The study also discusses methodological and data limitations that may affect interpretation. Beyond its academic value, the research offers practical insights into how online buzz can inform campaign strategies and enhance election predictions.

By representing the entire conversation as a temporal graph, we present a novel graph-based method for detecting dialogue-level hallucinations. Our framework models each dialogue as a node, encoding it using a sentence transformer. We explore two different ways of connectivity: i) shared-entity edges, which connect turns that refer to the same entities; ii) temporal edges, which connect contiguous turns in the conversation. Message-passing is used to update the node embeddings, allowing flow of information between related nodes. The context-aware node embeddings are then combined using attention pooling into a single vector, which is then passed on to a classifier to determine the presence and type of hallucinations. We demonstrate that our method offers slightly improved performance over existing methods. Further, we show the attention mechanism can be used to justify the decision making process.

    "abstract": "Motion blur caused by camera shake produces ghosting artifacts that substantially degrade edge side object detection. Existing approaches either suppress blur as noise and lose discriminative structure, or apply full image restoration that increases latency and limits deployment on resource constrained devices. We propose DFRCP, a Dynamic Fuzzy Robust Convolutional Pyramid, as a plug in upgrade to YOLOv11 for blur robust detection. DFRCP enhances the YOLOv11 feature pyramid by combining large scale and medium scale features while preserving native representations, and by introducing Dynamic Robust Switch units that adaptively inject fuzzy features to strengthen global perception under jitter. Fuzzy features are synthesized by rotating and nonlinearly interpolating multiscale features, then merged through a transparency convolution that learns a content adaptive trade off between original and fuzzy cues. We further develop a CUDA parallel rotation and interpolation kernel that avoids boundary overflow and delivers more than 400 times speedup, making the design practical for edge deployment. We train with paired supervision on a private wheat pest damage dataset of about 3,500 images, augmented threefold using two blur regimes, uniform image wide motion blur and bounding box confined rotational blur. On blurred test sets, YOLOv11 with DFRCP achieves about 10.4 percent higher accuracy than the YOLOv11 baseline with only a modest training time overhead, reducing the need for manual filtering after data collection."

We posit that sensitive attributes (e.g., race, gender) do not merely shift data distributions but causally warp the geometry of the data manifold itself. To address this, we introduce Causal Manifold Fairness (CMF), a novel framework that bridges causal inference and geometric deep learning. CMF learns a latent representation where the local Riemannian geometry, defined by the metric tensor and curvature, remains invariant under counterfactual interventions on sensitive attributes. By enforcing constraints on the Jacobian and Hessian of the decoder, CMF ensures that the rules of the latent space (distances and shapes) are preserved across demographic groups. We validate CMF on synthetic Structural Causal Models (SCMs), demonstrating that it effectively disentangles sensitive geometric warping while preserving task utility, offering a rigorous quantification of the fairness-utility trade-off via geometric metrics."

    "abstract": "We present two novel generative geometric deep learning frameworks, termed Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet, for predicting fluid flow variables on irregular geometries by incorporating PointNet into flow matching and diffusion models, respectively. In these frameworks, a reverse generative process reconstructs physical fields from standard Gaussian noise conditioned on unseen geometries. The proposed approaches operate directly on point-cloud representations of computational domains (e.g., grid vertices of finite-volume meshes) and therefore avoid the limitations of pixelation used to project geometries onto uniform lattices. In contrast to graph neural network-based diffusion models, Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet do not exhibit high-frequency noise artifacts in the predicted fields. Moreover, unlike such approaches, which require auxiliary intermediate networks to condition geometry, the proposed frameworks rely solely on PointNet, resulting in a simple and unified architecture. The performance of the proposed frameworks is evaluated on steady incompressible flow past a cylinder, using a geometric dataset constructed by varying the cylinder's cross-sectional shape and orientation across samples. The results demonstrate that Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet achieve more accurate predictions of velocity and pressure fields, as well as lift and drag forces, and exhibit greater robustness to incomplete geometries compared to a vanilla PointNet with the same number of trainable parameters."

In this paper, we study the cosmological model of BI with a dynamical dark energy. We find that individual consideration of the CPL parameterization and the data \\texttt{DESI DR2} tend to larger Hubble constants for both BI and power law (PL) case with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data.

Transient scattering maxima in the length scales associated with both techniques indicate the presence of a transitory state, suggesting the classification of the initial and final states as distinct glass states in the context of polyamorphism. In all glasses, a transient intensity peak in the small angle scattering is observed, consistent with the nucleation of a new amorphous state. Based on a comparison with the phenomenology observed in supercooled and glassy water, we propose that this structural evolution provide a strong evidence of the glass polyamorphism as the consequence of the existence of an underlying but thermodynamically defined liquid-liquid transition, independent on the polymerization degree of the system."

In this paper, we aim to leverage LLMs for analysis reports. To this end, we first construct a Analyst-wise checklist to reflect SOC practitioners' opinions for analysis report evaluation through literature review and user study with SOC practitioners. Next, we design a novel LLM-based conceptual framework, named MESSALA, by further introducing two new techniques, granularization guideline and multi-perspective evaluation. MESSALA can maximize report evaluation and provide feedback on veteran SOC practitioners' perceptions. When we conduct extensive experiments with MESSALA, the evaluation results by MESSALA are the closest to those of veteran SOC practitioners compared with the existing LLM-based methods.

Monte Carlo simulations using the Metropolis algorithm on a restricted solid-on-solid (RSOS) lattice model demonstrate that intrinsic step jamming persists on surfaces below 20 nm. In the present model, transport processes such as surface and volume diffusion are excluded, as are elastic interactions, step-step repulsion or attraction, and stoichiometric effects. We show that intrinsic step jamming arises from asymmetric fluctuations in atomic attachment and detachment driven by biased transition probabilities under the SOS restriction, leading to collective step congestion. Asymmetric fluctuations also determine whether adatom or hole clusters grow or recede. This mechanism bears close similarity to jamming phenomena in the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP), including multi-lane variants. In contrast, symmetric thermal fluctuations generate adatom or hole clusters on terraces, thereby suppressing intrinsic step jamming. Possible routes to suppress intrinsic step jamming, including experimentally accessible strategies, are also discussed."

The current approaches focus on reinforcement learning (RL) and generative models. These efforts imitate offline historical behaviors by utilizing a complex structure with expensive hyperparameter tuning. The suboptimal trajectories further exacerbate the difficulty of policy learning. To address these challenges, we proposes QGA, a novel Q-value regularized Generative Auto-bidding method. In QGA, we propose to plug a Q-value regularization with double Q-learning strategy into the Decision Transformer backbone. This design enables joint optimization of policy imitation and action-value maximization, allowing the learned bidding policy to both leverage experience from the dataset and alleviate the adverse impact of the suboptimal trajectories. Furthermore, to safely explore the policy space beyond the data distribution, we propose a Q-value guided dual-exploration mechanism, in which the DT model is conditioned on multiple return-to-go targets and locally perturbed actions. This entire exploration process is dynamically guided by the aforementioned Q-value module, which provides principled evaluation for each candidate action. Experiments on public benchmarks and simulation environments demonstrate that QGA consistently achieves superior or highly competitive results compared to existing alternatives. Notably, in large-scale real-world A/B testing, QGA achieves a 3.27% increase in Ad GMV and a 2.49% improvement in Ad ROI."

We show that contracting instead the double dual of the Riemann tensor unlocks the full curvature structure, producing a canonical hierarchy of symmetric, divergence--free $(p,p)$ double forms. These tensors satisfy the first Bianchi identity and obey a hereditary contraction relation interpolating between the double dual tensor and the Einstein tensor. We prove that, in a generic geometric setting, each tensor in this hierarchy is the unique divergence--free $(p,p)$ double form depending linearly on the Riemann curvature tensor, thereby providing canonical higher--rank parents of the Einstein tensor. Their sectional curvatures coincide with the $p$--curvatures; notably, the $2$--curvature determines the full Riemann curvature tensor and forces the $\\hat A$--genus of a compact spin manifold to vanish when nonnegative, a property not shared by Ricci or scalar curvature. Finally, we extend the construction to Gauss--Kronecker curvature tensors and Lovelock theory, showing in particular that the second Lovelock tensor $T_4$ admits a genuine four--index parent tensor."

    "abstract": "Language is a uniquely human trait, conveying information efficiently by organizing word sequences in sentences into hierarchical structures. A central question persists: Why is human language hierarchical? In this study, we show that hierarchization optimally solves the challenge of our limited working memory capacity. We established a likelihood function that quantifies how well the average number of units according to the language processing mechanisms aligns with human working memory capacity (WMC) in a direct fashion. The maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of this function, tehta_MLE, turns out to be the mean of units. Through computational simulations of symbol sequences and validation analyses of natural language sentences, we uncover that compared to linear processing, hierarchical processing far surpasses it in constraining the tehta_MLE values under the human WMC limit, along with the increase of sequence/sentence length successfully. It also shows a converging pattern related to children's WMC development. These results suggest that constructing hierarchical structures optimizes the processing efficiency of sequential language input while staying within memory constraints, genuinely explaining the universal hierarchical nature of human language."

In this work, we identify and quantify a fundamental functional perception gap: the inability of current vision encoders to decode functional tracer biodistribution independent of morphological priors. Identifying Positron Emission Tomography (PET) as the quintessential modality to investigate this disconnect, we introduce PET-Bench, the first large-scale functional imaging benchmark comprising 52,308 hierarchical QA pairs from 9,732 multi-site, multi-tracer PET studies. Extensive evaluation of 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a critical safety hazard termed the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) hallucination trap. We observe that standard CoT prompting, widely considered to enhance reasoning, paradoxically decouples linguistic generation from visual evidence in PET, producing clinically fluent but factually ungrounded diagnoses. To resolve this, we propose Atomic Visual Alignment (AVA), a simple fine-tuning strategy that enforces the mastery of low-level functional perception prior to high-level diagnostic reasoning. Our results demonstrate that AVA effectively bridges the perception gap, transforming CoT from a source of hallucination into a robust inference tool and improving diagnostic accuracy by up to 14.83%.

    "abstract": "Visual localization on standard-definition (SD) maps has emerged as a promising low-cost and scalable solution for autonomous driving. However, existing regression-based approaches often overlook inherent geometric priors, resulting in suboptimal training efficiency and limited localization accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel homography-guided pose estimator network for fine-grained visual localization between multi-view images and standard-definition (SD) maps. We construct input pairs that satisfy a homography constraint by projecting ground-view features into the BEV domain and enforcing semantic alignment with map features. Then we leverage homography relationships to guide feature fusion and restrict the pose outputs to a valid feasible region, which significantly improves training efficiency and localization accuracy compared to prior methods relying on attention-based fusion and direct 3-DoF pose regression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to unify BEV semantic reasoning with homography learning for image-to-map localization. Furthermore, by explicitly modeling homography transformations, the proposed framework naturally supports cross-resolution inputs, enhancing model flexibility. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art visual localization methods. Code and pretrained models will be publicly released to foster future research."

The array currently comprises five independent stations, each instrumented with antennas deployed at depths of up to 200 meters within the ice at the South Pole. In this study, we focus on a candidate event recorded by ARA Station 2 (A2) that shows features consistent with a downward-going CR-induced air shower. This includes distinctive double-pulse signals in multiple channels, interpreted as geomagnetic and Askaryan radio emissions arriving at the antennas in sequence. To investigate this event, we use detailed simulations that combine a modern ice-impacting CR shower simulation framework, FAERIE, with a realistic detector simulation package, AraSim. We will present results for an optimization of the event topology, identified through simulated CR showers, comparing the vertex reconstruction of both the geomagnetic and Askaryan signals of the event, as well as the observed time delays between the two signals in each antenna."

It is natural to ask how large the degrees of these coverings need to be to achieve that the distance between $M_ε$ and $N_ε$ is less than $ε$. In this paper we show that there exists a constant $k>0$, depending only on $M$ and $N$, so that the covers $M_ε\\to M$, and $N_ε\\to N$, can be chosen to have the degrees less than $ε^{-k}$. We show that this bound is optimal by considering the case when $M$ and $N$ are arithmetic Riemann surfaces with the same invariant trace field which are not commensurable to each other."

We discover a sign reversal of the LD contrast at an energy $\\sim0.4$ eV below the Fermi level, directly revealing an inversion of orbital anisotropy inside each domain.

For this model, they proved that the diffusion limit of its queue length process in heavy traffic is the level-dependent reflected Brownian motion of [6]. In a subsequent study, Kobayashi et al. [4] derived the corresponding diffusion limit of the stationary distribution. These studies are motivated by the control of service capacity depending on the queue length. We are interested in the more general case where this control may also depend on the history of the queue length. As the first step toward such a generalization, we specialize the multi-level GI/G/1 queue to a two-level M/M/1 queue. We then extend the dynamics of this model so that its arrival and service rates depend not only on the current queue length but also on the recent history of queue lengths. Under the stability condition for this model, we first compute its stationary distribution in closed form, then derive its diffusion limit in heavy traffic. Finally, using this diffusion limit, we derive approximation formulas for the stationary distribution and then numerically assess their accuracy."

The core contribution is a complete correctness theory for the fractional square root algorithm, proving that each computed decimal digit is exact and final, together with a sharp truncation error bound of $10^{-k}$ after $k$ digits. We further develop an invariant-based framework for computing the integer $e$-th root $\\lfloor N^{1/e} \\rfloor$ of a non-negative integer $N$ for arbitrary fixed exponents $e \\ge 2$, derived directly from the binomial theorem. This method generalizes the classical long-division square root algorithm, preserves a constructive remainder invariant throughout the computation, and provides an exact decision procedure for perfect $e$-th power detection. We also explain why exact digit-by-digit fractional extraction with non-revisable digits is structurally possible only for square roots ($e=2$), whereas higher-order roots ($e \\ge 3$) exhibit nonlinear coupling that prevents digit stability under scaling. All proofs are carried out in a constructive, algorithmic manner consistent with Bishop-style constructive mathematics, yielding explicit algorithmic witnesses, decidable predicates, and guaranteed termination. The resulting algorithms require no division or floating-point operations and are well suited to symbolic computation, verified exact arithmetic, educational exposition, and digital hardware implementation."

The topological edge modes traverse the imaginary spectral gap between a pair of fragile topological bands, which is opened by the presence of the non-Hermitian perturbation. We demonstrate that the net number of resulting in-gap modes is protected by an operator version of anomaly cancellation that extends beyond the Hermitian limit. The results imply that loss and gain can in principle drive fragile topological phenomena to stable topological phenomena."

    "abstract": "Graph Prompt Feature (GPF) learning has been widely used in adapting pre-trained GNN model on the downstream task. GPFs first introduce some prompt atoms and then learns the optimal prompt vector for each graph node using the linear combination of prompt atoms. However, existing GPFs generally conduct prompting over node's all feature dimensions which is obviously redundant and also be sensitive to node feature noise. To overcome this issue, for the first time, this paper proposes learning sparse graph prompts by leveraging the spiking neuron mechanism, termed Spiking Graph Prompt Feature (SpikingGPF). Our approach is motivated by the observation that spiking neuron can perform inexpensive information processing and produce sparse outputs which naturally fits the task of our graph sparse prompting. Specifically, SpikingGPF has two main aspects. First, it learns a sparse prompt vector for each node by exploiting a spiking neuron architecture, enabling prompting on selective node features. This yields a more compact and lightweight prompting design while also improving robustness against node noise. Second, SpikingGPF introduces a novel prompt representation learning model based on sparse representation theory, i.e., it represents each node prompt as a sparse combination of prompt atoms. This encourages a more compact representation and also facilitates efficient computation. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SpikingGPF."

In contrast to conventional curriculum strategies that emphasize easier tasks early in training, the resulting schedule naturally focuses training on problems that are neither consistently solved nor consistently failed, while deprioritizing those that contribute little gradient information. The method yields a continuously adapting and automatic prioritization process that requires no predefined difficulty tiers, auxiliary predictors, or external labels. We further introduce lightweight mechanisms for practical deployment, including heap-based prioritized sampling and periodic retesting of solved and unsolved problems to mitigate starvation and forgetting. Overall, the approach offers a principled and scalable alternative to manually designed curricula while aligning data selection directly with the dynamics of GRPO-based post-training."

    "abstract": "Several planners have been developed to compute dynamically feasible, collision-free robot paths from an initial to a goal configuration. A key assumption in these works is that the goal region is reachable; an assumption that often fails in practice when environments are disconnected. Motivated by this limitation, we consider known 3D environments comprising objects, also called blocks, that form distinct navigable support surfaces (planes), and that are either non-movable (e.g., tables) or movable (e.g., boxes). These surfaces may be mutually disconnected due to height differences, holes, or lateral separations. Our focus is on tasks where the robot must reach a goal region residing on an elevated plane that is unreachable. Rather than declaring such tasks infeasible, an effective strategy is to enable the robot to interact with the environment, rearranging movable objects to create new traversable connections; a problem known as Navigation Among Movable Objects (NAMO). Existing NAMO planners typically address 2D environments, where obstacles are pushed aside to clear a path. These methods cannot directly handle the considered 3D setting; in such cases, obstacles must be placed strategically to bridge these physical disconnections. We address this challenge by developing BRiDGE (Block-based Reconfiguration in Disconnected 3D Geometric Environments), a sampling-based planner that incrementally builds trees over robot and object configurations to compute feasible plans specifying which objects to move, where to place them, and in what order, while accounting for a limited number of movable objects. To accelerate planning, we introduce non-uniform sampling strategies. We show that our method is probabilistically complete and we provide extensive numerical and hardware experiments validating its effectiveness."

We frame infeasibility handling as a preference-aware query repair problem: when a query is unsatisfiable, the agent should relax the least important constraints to the user. We propose three LLM-based methods for inferring relative constraint importance from dialogue: (1) local weighting, (2) global one-shot weighting, and (3) pairwise ranking. Experiments show local weighting achieves the best preference alignment, while global weighting performs best on correct constraint relaxation. We also introduce AWARE-US, a benchmark of persona-grounded queries requiring agents to disambiguate requests via conversation and resolve infeasibility in a way consistent with persona-implied preferences."

Triangular-lattice polymer patterns on silicon nitride membranes are fabricated to realize these higher-order modes. Simulations reveal that first-order quasi-BICs exhibit much stronger field enhancement than zeroth-order modes at the top surface where the WS2 monolayer is placed. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements confirm a remarkable PL enhancement factor of 127 for first-order quasi-BICs, over six times larger than that of zeroth-order quasi-BICs.

That bargain comes under strain when AI systems are trained through multi-generational pipelines with recursive synthetic data. As successive models are tuned on the outputs of its predecessors, any copyrighted material absorbed by an early model is diffused into deeper statistical abstractions. The result is an evidentiary blind spot where overlaps that emerge look coincidental, while the chain of provenance is too attenuated to trace. These conditions are ripe for \"copyright laundering\"--the use of multi-generational synthetic pipelines, an \"AI Ouroboros,\" to render traditional proof of infringement impracticable. This Article adapts the \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" (FOPT) principle to propose a AI-FOPT standard: if a foundational AI model's training is adjudged infringing (either for unlawful sourcing or for non-transformative ingestion that fails fair-use), then subsequent AI models principally derived from the foundational model's outputs or distilled weights carry a rebuttable presumption of taint. The burden shifts to downstream developers--those who control the evidence of provenance--to restore the evidentiary bargain by affirmatively demonstrating a verifiably independent and lawfully sourced lineage or a curative rebuild, without displacing fair-use analysis at the initial ingestion stage. Absent such proof, commercial deployment of tainted models and their outputs is actionable. This Article develops the standard by specifying its trigger, presumption, and concrete rebuttal paths (e.g., independent lineage or verifiable unlearning); addresses counterarguments concerning chilling innovation and fair use; and demonstrates why this lineage-focused approach is both administrable and essential."

Traditional semiconductor-based electronic technology faces constraints in material thickness scaling and energy efficiency. Atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation nanoelectronics and optoelectronic applications, boasting high electron mobility, mechanical strength, and a customizable band gap. Despite these merits, the Fermi level pinning effect introduces uncontrollable Schottky barriers at metal-2D-TMD contacts, challenging prediction through the Schottky-Mott rule. These barriers fundamentally lead to elevated contact resistance and limited current-delivery capability, impeding the enhancement of 2D-TMD transistor and integrated circuit properties. In this review, we succinctly outline the Fermi pinning effect mechanism and peculiar contact resistance behavior at metal/2D-TMD interfaces. Subsequently, highlights on the recent advances in overcoming contact resistance in 2D-TMDs devices, encompassing interface interaction and hybridization, van der Waals (vdW) contacts, prefabricated metal transfer and charge-transfer doping will be addressed.

    "abstract": "Question answering (QA) systems achieve impressive performance on standard benchmarks like SQuAD, but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. This project investigates the adversarial robustness of transformer models on the AddSent adversarial dataset through systematic experimentation across model scales and targeted mitigation strategies. We perform comprehensive multi-level error analysis using five complementary categorization schemes, identifying negation confusion and entity substitution as the primary failure modes. Through systematic evaluation of adversarial fine-tuning ratios, we identify 80% clean + 20% adversarial data as optimal. Data augmentation experiments reveal a capacity bottleneck in small models. Scaling from ELECTRA-small (14M parameters) to ELECTRA-base (110M parameters) eliminates the robustness-accuracy trade-off, achieving substantial improvements on both clean and adversarial data. We implement three targeted mitigation strategies, with Entity-Aware contrastive learning achieving best performance: 89.89% AddSent Exact Match (EM) and 90.73% SQuAD EM, representing 94.9% closure of the adversarial gap. To our knowledge, this is the first work integrating comprehensive linguistic error analysis with Named Entity Recognition (NER)-guided contrastive learning for adversarial QA, demonstrating that targeted mitigation can achieve near-parity between clean and adversarial performance."

However, the charge across the duct's complete two-dimensional (2D) cross-section, which is the critical parameter for process safety, is generally unavailable due to limited optical access. To estimate the complete powder charge distribution in a conveying duct, we propose a machine learning (ML) approach using a shallow neural network (SNN). The ML algorithm is trained with cross-sectional data extracted from four different three-dimensional direct numerical simulations of a turbulent duct flow with varying particle size. Through this training with simulation data, the ML algorithm can estimate the powder charge distribution in the duct's cross-section based on only 1D measurements. The results reveal an average $L^1$-error of the reconstructed 2D cross-section of 1.63 %."

Using Floquet theory in the high-frequency limit, we start from the Dirac model including both the valence and conduction bands of monolayer MoTe$_2$ to derive an effective time-independent Floquet Hamiltonian. This Floquet Hamiltonian contains explicit time-reversal symmetry breaking terms that are absent if conduction bands are neglected from the beginning of the derivation. Based on the Floquet Hamiltonian, we find the increasing of CPL driving intensity can cause the crossing of Floquet bands between the two valleys. When interactions are included, we identify the redistribution of holes during the intervalley Floquet band crossing. Accordingly, the ground state of the Floquet Hamiltonian at total hole filling $5/3$ evolves from the Laughlin-type FCI in one valley to that in the other valley."

Here we streamline and generalize this theorem using the homotopy theory of H-groups, showing that for $k \\in \\{1,2,4\\}$, the non-torsion part of $π_1 \\mathrm{Map}\\big({(S^{2k-1})^2, S^{2k}}\\big)$ is an integer Heisenberg group of level 2, where we identify this level with 2 divided by the Hopf invariant of the generator of $π_{4k-1}(S^{2k})$.

This work presents a novel multi-modal EPW control system designed to prioritize patient needs while allowing seamless switching between control modes. Four complementary interfaces, namely joystick, speech, hand gesture, and electrooculography (EOG), are integrated with a continuous vital sign monitoring framework measuring heart rate variability, oxygen saturation (SpO2), and skin temperature. This combination enables greater patient independence while allowing caregivers to maintain real-time supervision and early intervention capability. Two-point calibration of the biophysical sensors against clinical reference devices resulted in root mean square errors of at most 2 bpm for heart rate, 0.5 degree Celsius for skin temperature, and 1 percent for SpO2. Experimental evaluation involved twenty participants with mobility impairments executing a total of 500 indoor navigation commands. The achieved command recognition accuracies were 99 percent for joystick control, 97 percent plus or minus 2 percent for speech, and 95 percent plus or minus 3 percent for hand gesture, with an average closed-loop latency of 20 plus or minus 0.5 milliseconds. Caregivers receive real-time alerts through an Android application following encrypted cloud transmission of physiological data. By integrating multi-modal mobility control with cloud-enabled health monitoring and reporting latency and energy budgets, the proposed prototype addresses key challenges in assistive robotics, contributes toward compliance with ISO 7176-31 and IEC 80601-2-78 safety standards, and establishes a foundation for future adaptive machine learning enhancements."

However, due to the limitations of current AIGC models, most models can only serve as individual components within specific application scenarios and are not capable of completing tasks end-to-end in real-world applications. In real-world applications, editing experts often work with a wide variety of images and video inputs, producing multimodal outputs -- a video typically includes audio, text, and other elements. This level of integration across multiple modalities is something current models are unable to achieve effectively. However, the rise of agent-based systems has made it possible to use AI tools to tackle complex content generation tasks. To deal with the complex scenarios, in this paper, we propose a MultiMedia-Agent designed to automate complex content creation. Our agent system includes a data generation pipeline, a tool library for content creation, and a set of metrics for evaluating preference alignment. Notably, we introduce the skill acquisition theory to model the training data curation and agent training. We designed a two-stage correlation strategy for plan optimization, including self-correlation and model preference correlation. Additionally, we utilized the generated plans to train the MultiMedia-Agent via a three stage approach including base/success plan finetune and preference optimization. The comparison results demonstrate that the our approaches are effective and the MultiMedia-Agent can generate better multimedia content compared to novel models."

We identify low coverage as a vital yet largely overlooked requirement for practicality, as individual data owners typically contribute only a minute fraction of massive training corpora. Prior methods fail to maintain stealthiness, verification feasibility, or robustness when only one or a few sequences can be modified. To address these limitations, we introduce SLIM, a framework enabling per-user data provenance verification under strict black-box access. SLIM leverages intrinsic LLM properties to induce a Latent-Space Confusion Zone by training the model to map semantically similar prefixes to divergent continuations. This manifests as localized generation instability, which can be reliably detected via hypothesis testing. Experiments demonstrate that SLIM achieves ultra-low coverage capability, strong black-box verification performance, and great scalability while preserving both stealthiness and model utility, offering a robust solution for protecting training data in modern LLM pipelines."

    "abstract": "The exact location of the solar dynamo remains uncertain--whether it operates primarily in the near-surface shear layer, throughout the entire convection zone, or near the tachocline, a region of sharp transition in the solar rotation, located at the base of the convection zone, approximately 200,000 km beneath the surface. Various studies have supported each of these possibilities. Notably, the solar magnetic \"butterfly\" diagram and the pattern of zonal flows (\"torsional oscillations\") exhibit strikingly similar characteristics, suggesting a link between magnetic field evolution and solar flows. Since magnetic fields cannot be measured directly in the deep solar interior, torsional oscillations and rotation gradients are employed as diagnostic proxies. Our analysis reveals that the gradient of rotation displays \"butterfly\"-like behavior near the tachocline, which is similar to the magnetic butterfly diagram at the surface. This result supports the idea that the solar dynamo has a deep-seated origin, likely operating either near the tachocline or throughout the convection zone, thereby disfavoring the recent scenario of a shallow, near-surface dynamo. This finding may also have important implications for understanding how stellar dynamos operate in general."

TURTLE, a state of the art deep clustering algorithm, uncovers data labeling without supervision by alternating label and hyperplane updates, maximizing the hyperplane margin, in a similar fashion to support vector machines (SVMs). However, TURTLE assumes clusters are balanced; when data is imbalanced, it yields non-ideal hyperplanes that cause higher clustering error. We propose PET-TURTLE, which generalizes the cost function to handle imbalanced data distributions by a power law prior. Additionally, by introducing sparse logits in the labeling process, PET-TURTLE optimizes a simpler search space that in turn improves accuracy for balanced datasets. Experiments on synthetic and real data show that PET-TURTLE improves accuracy for imbalanced sources, prevents over-prediction of minority clusters, and enhances overall clustering."

    "abstract": "Appropriate communication is crucial for efficient and safe interactions between pedestrians and autonomous vehicles (AVs). External human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) on AVs, which can be categorized as allocentric or egocentric, are considered a promising solution. While the effectiveness of eHMIs has been extensively studied, in complex environments, such as unsignalized multi-lane streets, their potential to interfere with pedestrian crossing behavior remains underexplored. Hence, a virtual reality-based experiment was conducted to examine how different types of eHMIs displayed on AVs affect the crossing behavior of pedestrians in multi-lane streets environments, with a focus on the gaze patterns of pedestrians during crossing. The results revealed that the presence of eHMIs significantly influenced the cognitive load on pedestrians and increased the possibility of distraction, even misleading pedestrians in cases involving multiple AVs on multi-lane streets. Notably, allocentric eHMIs induced higher cognitive loads and greater distraction in pedestrians than egocentric eHMIs. This was primarily evidenced by longer gaze time and higher proportions of attention for the eHMI on the interacting vehicle, as well as a broader distribution of gaze toward vehicles in the non-interacting lane. However, misleading behavior was mainly triggered by eHMI signals from yielding vehicles in the non-interacting lane. Under such asymmetric signal configurations, egocentric eHMIs resulted in a higher misjudgment rate than allocentric eHMIs. These findings highlight the importance of enhancing eHMI designs to balance the clarity and consistency of the displayed information across different perspectives, especially in complex multi-lane traffic scenarios. This study provides valuable insights regarding the application and standardization of future eHMI systems for AVs."

This study investigates how environmental factors, traffic factors, and pedestrian characteristics influence interaction safety between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians in ports. Using virtual reality (VR) simulations of typical port scenarios, 33 participants completed pedestrian crossing tasks under varying visibility, vehicle sizes, and time pressure conditions. Results indicate that low-visibility conditions, partial occlusions and larger vehicle sizes significantly increase perceived risk, prompting pedestrians to wait longer and accept larger gaps. Specifically, pedestrians tended to accept larger gaps and waited longer when interacting with large autonomous truck platoons, reflecting heightened caution due to their perceived threat. However, local obstructions also reduce post-encroachment time, compressing safety margins. Individual attributes such as age, gender, and driving experience further shape decision-making, while time pressure undermines compensatory behaviors and increases risk. Based on these findings, safety strategies are proposed, including installing wide-angle cameras at multiple viewpoints, enabling real-time vehicle-infrastructure communication, enhancing port lighting and signage, and strengthening pedestrian safety training. This study offers practical recommendations for improving the safety and deployment of vision-based autonomous systems in port settings."

Prior diffusion unlearning methods typically rely on supervised weight edits or global penalties; reinforcement-learning (RL) approaches, while flexible, often optimize sparse end-of-trajectory rewards, yielding high-variance updates and weak credit assignment. We present a general RL framework for diffusion unlearning that treats denoising as a sequential decision process and introduces a timestep-aware critic with noisy-step rewards. Concretely, we train a CLIP-based reward predictor on noisy latents and use its per-step signal to compute advantage estimates for policy-gradient updates of the reverse diffusion kernel. Our algorithm is simple to implement, supports off-policy reuse, and plugs into standard text-to-image backbones. Across multiple concepts, the method achieves better or comparable forgetting to strong baselines while maintaining image quality and benign prompt fidelity; ablations show that (i) per-step critics and (ii) noisy-conditioned rewards are key to stability and effectiveness. We release code and evaluation scripts to facilitate reproducibility and future research on RL-based diffusion unlearning."

In dipolar-octupolar (DO) pyrochlores, such as $\\text{Ce}_2\\text{Zr}_2\\text{O}_7$, the candidate $π$-flux quantum spin ice (QSI) state is predicted to host both gapless emergent photons and a continuum of spinons. However, resolving these modes at zero field is complicated by their spectral overlap and the presence of nonmagnetic scattering near zero energy. Here, we report neutron scattering experiments on $\\text{Ce}_2\\text{Zr}_2\\text{O}_7$ under a magnetic field along the $[1,1,1]$ direction. In contrast to previous unpolarized studies at zero-field that relied on high-temperature subtraction, we use a same-temperature high-field subtraction protocol to isolate the photon mode. Leveraging the selective coupling of the magnetic field to the dipolar degrees of freedom, we demonstrate the spectroscopic demarcation of these excitations. We observe that weak fields ($\\approx 0.15$ T) suppress the low-energy photon weight while leaving the high-energy spinon continuum robust, albeit hardened. Our results, supported by gauge mean-field theory and exact diagonalization calculations, provide strong evidence for the $π$-flux QSI state and introduce a powerful field-tuning protocol for investigating DO-QSLs."

Our benchmark systematically incorporates vision-dependent constraints into instruction design, enabling a more rigorous and fine-grained assessment of how well MLLMs align their outputs with both visual input and textual instructions. Furthermore, by fine-tuning MLLMs on our dataset, we achieve substantial gains in visual instruction-following accuracy and adherence. Through extensive evaluation across representative MLLMs, we provide new insights into the strengths and limitations of current models."

We study a pseudodifferential operator with transversal intersections of bicharacteristics, where the principal symbol has double multiplicity, $p=dp=0$, in a small neigborhood $Ω$. Because of this fact, we instead study the subprincipal symbol b, and we can conclude that we get transport equations depending on b where sign changes for the imaginary part of b give approximative solutions with small support. These modes are used to estimate spectral instability, or the pseudospectrum. We also investigate the possibility that we can factorize the model operator as $P(h)=h^2P_1P_2,$ in this way actually annihilating the subprincipal symbol, thus there is no condition for the imaginary part of b. In a follow-up article, we examine different cases for more complex operators with tangential intersections of bicharacteristics, thereby generalizing the findings here."

Each sequence captures 63 features spanning vehicle kinematics, control inputs, behavioral violations, and environmental context. Our empirical analysis shows High Time Pressure induces 48% higher speeds, 36.4% greater speed variability, 58% more risky turns at intersections, 36% more sudden braking, and 50% higher rear brake forces versus No Time Pressure. To benchmark this dataset, we propose MotoTimePressure, a deep learning model combining convolutional preprocessing, dual-stage temporal attention, and Squeeze-and-Excitation feature recalibration, achieving 91.53% accuracy and 98.93% ROC AUC, outperforming eight baselines. Since time pressure cannot be directly measured in real time, we demonstrate its utility in collision prediction and threshold determination. Using MTPS-predicted time pressure as features, improves Informer-based collision risk accuracy from 91.25% to 93.51%, approaching oracle performance (93.72%). Thresholded time pressure states capture rider cognitive stress and enable proactive ITS interventions, including adaptive alerts, haptic feedback, V2I signaling, and speed guidance, supporting safer two-wheeler mobility under the Safe System Approach."

High sensitivity Positron Emission Tomography (PET) systems are needed for PLI since it requires simultaneous registration of annihilation photons and prompt gamma. In this simulation-based study, a~feasibility of PLI with the long axial field-of-view Biograph Vision Quadra (Quadra) and the Total Body J-PET scanner was investigated. Methods: The study was performed using the GATE software. Background radiation, present within the Quadra tomograph, was added to the simulation. First, the optimal placement of the energy window for the registration of the prompt gamma was investigated. Next, the organ-wise sensitivity of Quadra was calculated for the $^{68}$Ga, $^{44}$Sc, $^{22}$Na and $^{124}$I radioisotopes. Finally, the sensitivity for the scandium isotope was compared to the sensitivities obtainable with the Total Body J-PET scanner, as well as with the modular J-PET prototype. Results: The PLI sensitivities for the Quadra with the background radiation are estimated to 9.22(3), 10.46(4), 5.91(3), and 15.39(4) cps/kBq for the $^{44}$Sc, $^{68}$Ga, $^{22}$Na and $^{124}$I radioisotopes, respectively. The highest sensitivity was obtained when the energy window for the deexcitation photon is adjacent to the energy window for the annihilation photons. The determined PLI sensitivities with Quadra and the Total Body J-PET are in the order of sensitivities of standard PET imaging with the short axial field-of-view ($\\sim$20 cm) PET scanners. Conclusion: The organ-wise PLI sensitivity of Quadra has been computed for the $^{68}$Ga, $^{44}$Sc, $^{22}$Na and $^{124}$I radioisotopes. A sensitivity gain by a factor of 150 was estimated relative to the modular J-PET system previously used for the first in-vivo PLI."

In this paper, we propose a training-free controllable framework for pretrained zero-shot TTS to enable intra-utterance emotion and duration expression. Specifically, we propose a segment-aware emotion conditioning strategy that combines causal masking with monotonic stream alignment filtering to isolate emotion conditioning and schedule mask transitions, enabling smooth intra-utterance emotion shifts while preserving global semantic coherence. Based on this, we further propose a segment-aware duration steering strategy to combine local duration embedding steering with global EOS logit modulation, allowing local duration adjustment while ensuring globally consistent termination. To eliminate the need for segment-level manual prompt engineering, we construct a 30,000-sample multi-emotion and duration-annotated text dataset to enable LLM-based automatic prompt construction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our training-free method not only achieves state-of-the-art intra-utterance consistency in multi-emotion and duration control, but also maintains baseline-level speech quality of the underlying TTS model.

We systematically evaluate five embedding similarity metrics across 816 transfer experiments spanning three NLP tasks, three African-centric multilingual models, and 12 languages from four language families. We find that cosine gap and retrieval-based metrics (P@1, CSLS) reliably predict transfer success ($ρ= 0.4-0.6$), while CKA shows negligible predictive power ($ρ\\approx 0.1$). Critically, correlation signs reverse when pooling across models (Simpson's Paradox), so practitioners must validate per-model. Embedding metrics achieve comparable predictive power to URIEL linguistic typology. Our results provide concrete guidance for source language selection and highlight the importance of model-specific analysis."

However, planning remains a bottleneck, as existing methods struggle with long-horizon strategies. Our analysis reveals a critical phenomenon, plan anchor, where the first reasoning step disproportionately impacts downstream behavior in long-horizon web reasoning tasks. Current RL algorithms, fail to account for this by uniformly distributing rewards across the trajectory. To address this, we propose Anchor-GRPO, a two-stage RL framework that decouples planning and execution. In Stage 1, the agent optimizes its first-step planning using fine-grained rubrics derived from self-play experiences and human calibration. In Stage 2, execution is aligned with the initial plan through sparse rewards, ensuring stable and efficient tool usage. We evaluate Anchor-GRPO on four benchmarks: BrowseComp, BrowseComp-Zh, GAIA, and XBench-DeepSearch. Across models from 3B to 30B, Anchor-GRPO outperforms baseline GRPO and First-step GRPO, improving task success and tool efficiency. Notably, WebAnchor-30B achieves 46.0% pass@1 on BrowseComp and 76.4% on GAIA. Anchor-GRPO also demonstrates strong scalability, getting higher accuracy as model size and context length increase."

    "abstract": "Spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to learn low frequencies first, can be both a blessing and a curse. While it enhances the generalization capabilities by suppressing high-frequency noise, it can be a limitation in scientific tasks that require capturing fine-scale structures. The delayed generalization phenomenon known as grokking is another barrier to rapid training of neural networks. Grokking has been hypothesized to arise as learning transitions from the NTK to the feature-rich regime. This paper explores the impact of preconditioned gradient descent (PGD), such as Gauss-Newton, on spectral bias and grokking phenomena. We demonstrate through theoretical and empirical results how PGD can mitigate issues associated with spectral bias. Additionally, building on the rich learning regime grokking hypothesis, we study how PGD can be used to reduce delays associated with grokking. Our conjecture is that PGD, without the impediment of spectral bias, enables uniform exploration of the parameter space in the NTK regime. Our experimental results confirm this prediction, providing strong evidence that grokking represents a transitional behavior between the lazy regime characterized by the NTK and the rich regime. These findings deepen our understanding of the interplay between optimization dynamics, spectral bias, and the phases of neural network learning."

To address this limitation, we propose \\textbf{Parallel Latent Reasoning (PLR)}, a novel framework that pioneers width-level computational scaling by exploring multiple diverse reasoning trajectories simultaneously. PLR constructs parallel reasoning streams through learnable trigger tokens in continuous latent space, preserves diversity across streams via global reasoning regularization, and adaptively synthesizes multi-stream outputs through mixture-of-reasoning-streams aggregation. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that PLR substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining real-time inference efficiency.

For this reason we propose a physics-informed approach in which aircraft thrust and airspeed are learned from data and are used to condition the existing Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) model, which is physics-based and enforces energy-based constraints on generated trajectories. A set of informative features are identified and used to condition a probabilistic model of aircraft thrust and airspeed, with the proposed scheme demonstrating a 20% improvement in skilfulness across a set of six metrics, compared against a baseline probabilistic model that ignores contextual information such as meteorological conditions."

Efficiency maps and operational-mode diagrams reveal well-defined boundaries in parameter space, governed by the frequency ratio $r=\\barω/ω$, the coupling strength $g$, and the thermal gradient between reservoirs. The Carnot cycle exhibits sharp transitions between engine and refrigerator regimes, while the Otto cycle displays a richer structure with the coexistence of all operational modes. The Stirling cycle shows enhanced versatility and performance, particularly when assisted by a regenerator, where near-ideal efficiencies are achieved.

We interpret truncated input-output (IO) histories as inducing a belief approximation and develop a metric-based theory that directly relates information loss to control performance. Using the Wasserstein metric, we derive policy-conditional performance bounds that quantify value degradation induced by finite memory along typical closed-loop trajectories. Our analysis proceeds via a fixed-policy comparison: we evaluate two cost functionals under the same closed-loop execution and isolate the effect of replacing the true belief by its finite memory approximation inside the belief-level cost. For linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) systems, we provide closed-form belief mismatch evaluation and empirically validate the predicted mechanism, demonstrating that belief mismatch decays approximately exponentially with memory length and that the induced performance mismatch scales accordingly. Together, these results provide a metric-aware characterization of what finite memory belief approximation can and cannot achieve in PO settings."

We show that simple gradient descent reliably finds depth- and gate-optimal circuits for generic unitaries, including in the presence of restricted chip connectivity.

    "abstract": "Digital Twins combine simulation, operational data and Artificial Intelligence (AI), and have the potential to bring significant benefits across the aviation industry. Project Bluebird, an industry-academic collaboration, has developed a probabilistic Digital Twin of en route UK airspace as an environment for training and testing AI Air Traffic Control (ATC) agents. There is a developing regulatory landscape for this kind of novel technology. Regulatory requirements are expected to be application specific, and may need to be tailored to each specific use case. We draw on emerging guidance for both Digital Twin development and the use of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) in Air Traffic Management (ATM) to present an assurance framework. This framework defines actionable goals and the evidence required to demonstrate that a Digital Twin accurately represents its physical counterpart and also provides sufficient functionality across target use cases. It provides a structured approach for researchers to assess, understand and document the strengths and limitations of the Digital Twin, whilst also identifying areas where fidelity could be improved. Furthermore, it serves as a foundation for engagement with stakeholders and regulators, supporting discussions around the regulatory needs for future applications, and contributing to the emerging guidance through a concrete, working example of a Digital Twin. The framework leverages a methodology known as Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance (TEA) to develop an assurance case. An assurance case is a nested set of structured arguments that provides justified evidence for how a top-level goal has been realised. In this paper we provide an overview of each structured argument and a number of deep dives which elaborate in more detail upon particular arguments, including the required evidence, assumptions and justifications."

    "abstract": "Generative joint source-channel coding (GJSCC) has emerged as a new Deep JSCC paradigm for achieving high-fidelity and robust image transmission under extreme wireless channel conditions, such as ultra-low bandwidth and low signal-to-noise ratio. Recent studies commonly adopt diffusion models as generative decoders, but they frequently produce visually realistic results with limited semantic consistency. This limitation stems from a fundamental mismatch between reconstruction-oriented JSCC encoders and generative decoders, as the former lack explicit semantic discriminability and fail to provide reliable conditional cues. In this paper, we propose DiT-JSCC, a novel GJSCC backbone that can jointly learn a semantics-prioritized representation encoder and a diffusion transformer (DiT) based generative decoder, our open-source project aims to promote the future research in GJSCC. Specifically, we design a semantics-detail dual-branch encoder that aligns naturally with a coarse-to-fine conditional DiT decoder, prioritizing semantic consistency under extreme channel conditions. Moreover, a training-free adaptive bandwidth allocation strategy inspired by Kolmogorov complexity is introduced to further improve the transmission efficiency, thereby indeed redefining the notion of information value in the era of generative decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiT-JSCC consistently outperforms existing JSCC methods in both semantic consistency and visual quality, particularly in extreme regimes."

    "abstract": "The reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) can be unleashed with reinforcement learning (RL) (OpenAI, 2024; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025a; Zeng et al., 2025). The success of existing RL attempts in LLMs usually relies on high-quality samples of thousands or beyond. In this paper, we challenge fundamental assumptions about data requirements in RL for LLMs by demonstrating the remarkable effectiveness of one-shot learning. Specifically, we introduce polymath learning, a framework for designing one training sample that elicits multidisciplinary impact. We present three key findings: (1) A single, strategically selected math reasoning sample can produce significant performance improvements across multiple domains, including physics, chemistry, and biology with RL; (2) The math skills salient to reasoning suggest the characteristics of the optimal polymath sample; and (3) An engineered synthetic sample that integrates multidiscipline elements outperforms training with individual samples that naturally occur. Our approach achieves superior performance to training with larger datasets across various reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that sample quality and design, rather than quantity, may be the key to unlock enhanced reasoning capabilities in language models. Our results suggest a shift, dubbed as sample engineering, toward precision engineering of training samples rather than simply increasing data volume."

We provide a consistent derivation of the effective couplings to Standard Model fields, clarifying the normalization of the trace anomaly-induced coupling to photons and the role of kinetic mixing with the Higgs boson. We demonstrate that while the pure gravitational coupling is loop-suppressed relative to Axion-Like Particles (ALPs), making the unmixed Radion elusive, the non-minimal mixing with the Higgs sector can induce constructive interference that enhances the signal by orders of magnitude. Using forward proton tagging to select exclusive high-mass events, we reinterpret recent experimental limits on ALPs to derive the first exclusion contours for the Radion in the $(Λ_r, ξ)$ plane, showing that mixing scenarios are beginning to be constrained by current LHC data."

    "abstract": "We study the homogeneous Landau equation with Maxwell molecules and prove that the entropy production is non-increasing provided the directional temperatures are well-distributed and the solution admits a moment of order $\\ell$, for some $\\ell$ arbitrarily close to $2$. It implies that for an initial condition with finite moment of order $\\ell$, the entropy production is guaranteed to be non-increasing after a certain time, that we explicitly compute. This is the first partial answer to a conjecture made by Henry P. McKean in 1966 on the sign of the time-derivatives of the entropy. We also obtain algebraic decay estimates for the entropy production for large time; as well as a short-time estimate without moment assumptions."

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically rely on a single late-layer feature from a frozen vision encoder, leaving the encoder's rich hierarchy of visual cues under-utilized. MLLMs still suffer from visually ungrounded hallucinations, often relying on language priors rather than image evidence. While many prior mitigation strategies operate on the text side, they leave the visual representation unchanged and do not exploit the rich hierarchy of features encoded across vision layers. Existing multi-layer fusion methods partially address this limitation but remain static, applying the same layer mixture regardless of the query. In this work, we introduce TGIF (Text-Guided Inter-layer Fusion), a lightweight module that treats encoder layers as depth-wise \"experts\" and predicts a prompt-dependent fusion of visual features. TGIF follows the principle of direct external fusion, requires no vision-encoder updates, and adds minimal overhead. Integrated into LLaVA-1.5-7B, TGIF provides consistent improvements across hallucination, OCR, and VQA benchmarks, while preserving or improving performance on ScienceQA, GQA, and MMBench. These results suggest that query-conditioned, hierarchy-aware fusion is an effective way to strengthen visual grounding and reduce hallucination in modern MLLMs."

    "abstract": "Surface electromyography (sEMG) provides a direct neural interface for decoding muscle activity and offers a promising foundation for keyboard-free text input in wearable and mixed-reality systems. Previous sEMG-to-text studies mainly focused on recognizing letters directly from sEMG signals, forming an important first step toward translating muscle activity into text. Building on this foundation, we present MyoText, a hierarchical framework that decodes sEMG signals to text through physiologically grounded intermediate stages. MyoText first classifies finger activations from multichannel sEMG using a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention model, applies ergonomic typing priors to infer letters, and reconstructs full sentences with a fine-tuned T5 transformer. This modular design mirrors the natural hierarchy of typing, linking muscle intent to language output and reducing the search space for decoding. Evaluated on 30 users from the emg2qwerty dataset, MyoText outperforms baselines by achieving 85.4% finger-classification accuracy, 5.4% character error rate (CER), and 6.5% word error rate (WER). Beyond accuracy gains, this methodology establishes a principled pathway from neuromuscular signals to text, providing a blueprint for virtual and augmented-reality typing interfaces that operate entirely without physical keyboards. By integrating ergonomic structure with transformer-based linguistic reasoning, MyoText advances the feasibility of seamless, wearable neural input for future ubiquitous computing environments."

    "abstract": "We propose a learning-based trajectory tracking controller for autonomous robotic platforms whose motion can be described kinematically on $\\mathrm{SE}(3)$. The controller is formulated in the dual quaternion framework and operates at the velocity level, assuming direct command of angular and linear velocities, as is standard in many aerial vehicles and omnidirectional mobile robots. Gaussian Process (GP) regression is integrated into a geometric feedback law to learn and compensate online for unknown, state-dependent disturbances and modeling imperfections affecting both attitude and position, while preserving the algebraic structure and coupling properties inherent to rigid-body motion. The proposed approach does not rely on explicit parametric models of the unknown effects, making it well-suited for robotic systems subject to sensor-induced disturbances, unmodeled actuation couplings, and environmental uncertainties. A Lyapunov-based analysis establishes probabilistic ultimate boundedness of the pose tracking error under bounded GP uncertainty, providing formal stability guarantees for the learning-based controller. Simulation results demonstrate accurate and smooth trajectory tracking in the presence of realistic, localized disturbances, including correlated rotational and translational effects arising from magnetometer perturbations. These results illustrate the potential of combining geometric modeling and probabilistic learning to achieve robust, data-efficient pose control for autonomous robotic systems."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, yet their black-box nature raises concerns about transparency and faithfulness. Input attribution methods aim to highlight each input token's contributions to the model's output, but existing approaches are typically model-agnostic, and do not focus on transformer-specific architectures, leading to limited faithfulness. To address this, we propose Grad-ELLM, a gradient-based attribution method for decoder-only transformer-based LLMs. By aggregating channel importance from gradients of the output logit with respect to attention layers and spatial importance from attention maps, Grad-ELLM generates heatmaps at each generation step without requiring architectural modifications. Additionally, we introduce two faithfulneses metrics $π$-Soft-NC and $π$-Soft-NS, which are modifications of Soft-NC/NS that provide fairer comparisons by controlling the amount of information kept when perturbing the text. We evaluate Grad-ELLM on sentiment classification, question answering, and open-generation tasks using different models. Experiment results show that Grad-ELLM consistently achieves superior faithfulness than other attribution methods."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a machine learning (ML) based method for channel prediction in high mobility orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) channels. In these scenarios, rapid variations caused by Doppler spread and time varying multipath propagation lead to fast channel decorrelation, making conventional pilot based channel estimation methods prone to outdated channel state information (CSI) and excessive overhead. Therefore, reliable channel prediction methods become essential to support robust detection and decoding in OTFS systems. In this paper, we propose conditional variational autoencoder for channel prediction (CVAE4CP) method, which learns the conditional distribution of OTFS delay Doppler channel coefficients given physical system and mobility parameters. By incorporating these parameters as conditioning information, the proposed method enables the prediction of future channel coefficients before their actual realization, while accounting for inherent channel uncertainty through a low dimensional latent representation. The proposed framework is evaluated through extensive simulations under high mobility conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that CVAE4CP consistently outperforms a competing learning based baseline in terms of normalized mean squared error (NMSE), particularly at high Doppler frequencies and extended prediction horizons. These results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach for channel prediction in rapidly time varying OTFS systems."

    "abstract": "In Newtonian physics, the excitation spectrum of a fluid is the same in all reference frames, up to a trivial shift. In special relativity, this is no longer the case. Relativity of simultaneity causes different inertial observers to measure markedly different excitation spectra, with stability being the only property known to be Lorentz invariant in all causal theories. Here, we show that, under a certain Onsager-like symmetry principle (which applies to kinetic theory and transient hydrodynamics), it is possible to place rigorous bounds on phase velocities, eigenmode convergence radii, spectral gaps, and equilibration rates in any inertial frame, using only information about the rest frame spectrum at zero wavenumber. The conventional intuition coming from time dilation is also shown to lead to generically wrong predictions, but becomes accurate if the fluid is non-relativistic in the rest frame."

    "abstract": "Selective withdrawal extracts only a single phase from a stratified multi-layer system. Entrainment occurs when a critical condition draws up the static layer which is not being withdrawn. Existing studies provide robust scalings within distinct limiting regimes. These include viscocapillary-dominated entrainment at low Reynolds number. They also include inertia-dominated entrainment at high Reynolds number. However, a single unifying representation remains to be explored in the literature. This limitation is most evident in transitional conditions between classical limits. It is also pronounced when the lower layer is non-Newtonian. Here we report selective-withdrawal experiments spanning these conditions. The upper layer is Newtonian, using PDMS or soybean oil. The lower layer is either Newtonian water or shear-thinning xanthan-gum solutions. We propose a unified framework that connects these previously separated regimes. The framework adopts a ``Moody diagram'' type representation for selective withdrawal. We collapse normalized critical submergence height using a Reynolds-like control parameter. Surface-tension effects enter subdominantly through the capillary length. The resulting master curve captures the transition between dominant balances. It connects viscous and shear-controlled entrainment to inertial entrainment. The collapse also clarifies how shear thinning enters the organization. Shear thinning primarily renormalizes the viscous correction through an effective viscosity. It does not alter the inertial baseline scale that anchors the normalization. This regime-spanning representation avoids regime-by-regime correlation switching. It provides a compact diagnostic for entrainment thresholds across fluid types. The diagnostic applies to Newtonian and generalized-Newtonian two-layer systems."

    "abstract": "OBA hypergiants (OBAHGs) are evolved massive stars with notable wind features in their optical spectrum. Positioned at the cool edge of the line-driven wind regime, many are candidate luminous blue variables (LBVs) likely near the Eddington Limit. Although brief, this evolutionary stage deeply impacts their surroundings and subsequent evolution. We study the mechanisms behind OBAHG winds and spectra, covering the temperature range of non-eruptive LBVs. Using the PoWR atmosphere code, we compute models with an Eddington parameter Gamma_e ~ 0.4 and moderate turbulent pressure, typical for cool hypergiants, varying the effective temperature from ~12.5 to ~38.0 kK at solar metallicity. Our models show a complex temperature-dependent mass-loss pattern, with regions of higher/lower rates linked to two wind solutions: \"dense\" and \"airy.\" Spectra of known OBAHGs and LBVs match models from all solution regions. We find bi-stability jumps -- with sharp mass-loss increases -- at temperatures where Fe IV recombines to Fe III (and Fe III to Fe II). \"Drops\" in mass-loss also occur when the leading Fe ion changes at wind onset, signaling a switch to airy solutions under insufficient driving opacity. The resulting velocity fields also reflect these different regimes: airy solutions match the empirical terminal velocity vs temperature relation, while dense ones deviate. Turbulent pressure is crucial for wind acceleration at cooler temperatures, especially in airy regimes. We demonstrate that the bi-stability jumps exist in OBAHGs but are part of a broader complex behavior not replicated by current mass-loss recipes. Combining our and other recent results, we suggest that the switch between airy and dense solutions only occurs within a certain proximity to the Eddington Limit. Testing this requires future models with broader parameters and advanced treatments of radiatively-driven turbulence."

Existing KV-cache compression methods rely on rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor layouts, or require specialized compute, hindering scalability and deployment. We propose joint encoding of KV-cache blocks, which fuses similar blocks across requests and input chunks into shared representations while preserving standard cache structure. This alleviates the KV-cache memory bottleneck, supporting high-concurrency serving without specialized hardware. Theoretically, we analyze the rate-distortion tradeoff of fused cache blocks under a Poisson process model. Empirically, our method achieves up to 4.38 $\\times$ KV-cache compression with negligible accuracy loss across diverse LLMs and benchmarks, outperforming recent structured and adaptive compression baselines. In real LLM serving, joint encoding improves the token throughput by $\\sim$40\\% on a single-machine vLLM benchmark, demonstrating substantial gains in inference throughput.

Prior work on compact reasoning shortens such chains through probabilistic sampling, heuristics, or supervision from frontier models, but offers limited insight into whether models internally encode token-level functional importance for answer generation. We address this gap diagnostically and propose greedy pruning, a likelihood-preserving deletion procedure that iteratively removes reasoning tokens whose removal minimally degrades model likelihood under a specified objective, yielding length-controlled reasoning chains. We evaluate pruned reasoning in a distillation framework and show that students trained on pruned chains outperform a frontier-model-supervised compression baseline at matched reasoning lengths. Finally, our analysis reveals systematic pruning patterns and shows that attention scores can predict greedy pruning ranks, further suggesting that models encode a nontrivial functional importance structure over reasoning tokens."

Raman spectroscopy reveals metal-dependent distortions of the phthalocyanine macrocycle, reflected in systematic shifts of the C-N-C and M-N vibrational modes. When integrated into OTFTs, all compounds exhibit markedly enhanced current response under ultrahigh vacuum compared to an N2-rich environment, demonstrating that intrinsic charge transport is strongly suppressed by atmospheric species. Temperature-dependent measurements (100-300 K) show clear threshold-voltage shifts driven by deep interface and bulk traps, while all devices display thermally activated mobility with low activation energies (14-20 meV). These results highlight how mesomorphic order, metal coordination, and environmental conditions collectively govern charge transport in liquid-crystalline phthalocyanines, offering design guidelines for their use as orientable semiconducting materials in organic electronics."

    "abstract": "Solving optimal control problems (OCPs) of autonomous agents operating under spatial and temporal constraints fast and accurately is essential in applications ranging from eco-driving of autonomous vehicles to quadrotor navigation. However, the nonlinear programs approximating the OCPs are inherently nonconvex due to the coupling between the dynamics and the event timing, and therefore, they are challenging to solve. Most approaches address this challenge by predefining waypoint times or just using nonconvex trajectory optimization, which simplifies the problem but often yields suboptimal solutions. To significantly improve the numerical properties, we propose a formulation with a time-scaling direct multiple shooting scheme that partitions the prediction horizon into segments aligned with characteristic time constraints. Moreover, we develop a fast semidefinite-programming-based convex relaxation that exploits the sparsity pattern of the lifted formulation. Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate the solution optimality and computational efficiency. Furthermore, real-world experiments on a quadrotor waypoint flight task with constrained open time windows validate the practical applicability of the approach in complex environments."

At the abstract layer, situation calculus models the world and derives weakest preconditions, enabling constraint-aware combinatorial testing to systematically generate diverse, semantically valid world-task configurations with controllable coverage strength. At the concrete layer, these configurations are instantiated for simulation-based falsification with STL monitoring. Experiments on tabletop manipulation tasks show that our framework effectively uncovers failure cases in the NVIDIA GR00T controller, demonstrating its promise for validating general-purpose robot autonomy."

The dataset comprises over 270K automatically generated question-answer pairs with a balanced distribution of factoid and non-factoid questions, generated from naturally authored literary texts collected from the open web. We evaluate multiple multilingual LLMs on non-factoid, abstractive QA, under both full-context and context-shortened settings. Results demonstrate a clear trade-off between performance and efficiency: full-context fine-tuning yields the highest token-level and semantic-level scores, while context shortening substantially improves throughput. Among the evaluated models, Krutrim-2 achieves the strongest performance, obtaining a semantic score of 76.1 with full context. While, in shortened context settings it scores 74.9 with answer paragraph selection and 71.4 with vector-based retrieval. Qualitative evaluations further corroborate these findings."

    "abstract": "We propose Self-Augmented Residual 3D Gaussian Splatting (SA-ResGS), a novel framework to stabilize uncertainty quantification and enhancing uncertainty-aware supervision in next-best-view (NBV) selection for active scene reconstruction. SA-ResGS improves both the reliability of uncertainty estimates and their effectiveness for supervision by generating Self-Augmented point clouds (SA-Points) via triangulation between a training view and a rasterized extrapolated view, enabling efficient scene coverage estimation. While improving scene coverage through physically guided view selection, SA-ResGS also addresses the challenge of under-supervised Gaussians, exacerbated by sparse and wide-baseline views, by introducing the first residual learning strategy tailored for 3D Gaussian Splatting. This targeted supervision enhances gradient flow in high-uncertainty Gaussians by combining uncertainty-driven filtering with dropout- and hard-negative-mining-inspired sampling. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a physically grounded view selection strategy that promotes efficient and uniform scene coverage; (2) an uncertainty-aware residual supervision scheme that amplifies learning signals for weakly contributing Gaussians, improving training stability and uncertainty estimation across scenes with diverse camera distributions; (3) an implicit unbiasing of uncertainty quantification as a consequence of constrained view selection and residual supervision, which together mitigate conflicting effects of wide-baseline exploration and sparse-view ambiguity in NBV planning. Experiments on active view selection demonstrate that SA-ResGS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both reconstruction quality and view selection robustness."

To address this challenge, we introduce Dementia-R1, an RL-based framework for longitudinal dementia prognosis from unstructured clinical notes. Our approach adopts a Cold-Start RL strategy that pre-trains the model to predict verifiable clinical indices extracted from patient histories, enhancing the capability to reason about disease progression before determining the final clinical status. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dementia-R1 achieves an F1 score of 77.03% on real-world unstructured clinical datasets.

    "abstract": "Comic-based visual question answering (CVQA) poses distinct challenges to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to its reliance on symbolic abstraction, narrative logic, and humor, which differ from conventional VQA tasks. Although Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is widely used to enhance MLLM reasoning, surprisingly, its direct application to CVQA often degrades performance, especially in small-scale models. Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that standard CoT in CVQA suffers from state entanglement, spurious transitions, and exploration inefficiency, with small models particularly vulnerable in resource-constrained settings. To address these issues, we propose a novel comic reasoning framework, designed to produce more faithful and transferable reasoning chains in small MLLMs. Specifically, our framework combines modular CoT generation with GRPO-based reinforcement fine-tuning and a novel structured reward. Beyond comic VQA, we further evaluate our approach on a broader class of humor-centric and abstract visual reasoning tasks, including meme understanding and editorial cartoon interpretation. Across five challenging benchmarks, our 3B model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and plug-in experiments yield an additional average improvement of $\\mathbf{12.1\\%}$ across different MLLMs."

This technique, Latent and Attention Mixing with Schedulers (LAMS), integrates with Prompt-to-Prompt (P2P) to form LAMS-Edit--an extensible framework that supports precise editing with region masks and enables style transfer via LoRA.

Traditional cryptographic implementations can be of inappropriate computational complexity and energy usage and hence are not suitable on these platforms. This paper examines the design, implementation, and testing of lightweight cryptographic algorithms that have been specifically designed to be used in secure embedded systems. A comparison of some of the state-of-the-art lightweight encryption algorithms, that is PRESENT, SPECK, and SIMON, focuses on the main performance indicators, i.e., throughput, use of memory, and energy utilization. The study presents novel lightweight algorithms that are founded upon the Feistel-network architecture and their safety under cryptanalytic attacks, e.g., differential and linear cryptanalysis. The proposed solutions are proven through hardware implementation on the FPGA platform. The results have shown that lightweight cryptography is an effective strategy that could be used to establish security and maintain performance in the IoT and other resource-limited settings."

Traditional machine learning (ML) techniques for classifying bug reports to identify security bug reports rely heavily on large amounts of labeled data. However, datasets for security bug reports are often scarce in practice, leading to poor model performance and limited applicability in real-world settings. In this study, we propose a few-shot learning-based technique to effectively identify security bug reports using limited labeled data. We employ SetFit, a state-of-the-art few-shot learning framework that combines sentence transformers with contrastive learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The model is trained on a small labeled dataset of bug reports and is evaluated on its ability to classify these reports as either security-related or non-security-related. Our approach achieves an AUC of 0.865, at best, outperforming traditional ML techniques (baselines) for all of the evaluated datasets. This highlights the potential of SetFit to effectively identify security bug reports. SetFit-based few-shot learning offers a promising alternative to traditional ML techniques to identify security bug reports. The approach enables efficient model development with minimal annotation effort, making it highly suitable for scenarios where labeled data is scarce."

The potential connection between axion and magnetic monopole stems from the Witten effect and is revealed by non-standard axion electrodynamics. Non-standard axion electrodynamics under electric-magnetic duality modifies conventional axion Maxwell equations and motivates intriguing axion-photon phenomenology. A calculable ultraviolet model of Peccei-Quinn axion coupled to magnetic monopoles and electric charges was proposed based on $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric Seiberg-Witten (SW) theory with manifest electric-magnetic duality. In this work, we aim to investigate the solutions to the non-linear axion electrodynamics from SW axion model and propose relevant detection strategies for non-trivial axion-photon couplings. Based on the infrared Lagrangian of SW axion, we derive the electromagetic (EM) equations of motion. We also analyze the moduli space coordinate in SW theory and find out the reliabe parameter space. We then solve the resultant axion Maxwell equations with an external EM field. The observable axion-induced EM fields are obtained analytically and then numerically computed. Finally, we propose the detection strategy with an LC circuit and show the prospective sensitivity to SW axion-photon couplings."

In particular, A15 type LaH5.75 was recently shown to be a high Tc superconductor. We have investigated a range of ternary substitutions and demonstrate that partial substitution of La by Ba stabilizes the A15 hydride lattice, with La0.75Ba0.25H5.75 identified as a stable compound. We calculate a superconducting transition temperature of approximately 183 K, almost double that of LaH5.75 at similar pressures. Ba typically acts as a 2 plus ion, while La is 3 plus. The reduced electron count disrupts the formation of H2 units and shifts the Fermi surface, leading to strongly enhanced electron phonon coupling. By contrast, substitution with Hf fails to produce any stable compounds. This work extends emerging alloy design principles in A15 hydride superconductors, demonstrating that doping can shift the Fermi level and tune the strength of the electron phonon coupling. These results provide concrete guidance for the experimental realization of new high Tc phases."

Its spectral energy distribution (SED) exhibits a strong near-infrared excess, indicating the presence of a circumbinary dusty disk and hence binarity. SED fitting yields an effective temperature of $T_{\\rm eff}=6738_{-262}^{+234}\\,$K and a post-AGB luminosity of $\\log(L/L_{\\odot})=4.32_{-0.08}^{+0.07}$. Comparison with theoretical evolutionary tracks suggests a ~$2.0$-$4.0\\,M_{\\odot}$ progenitor when accounting for a possible scattered-light contribution. ZTF Light curves reveal a pulsation period of 89d that lies close to the period-luminosity relation for long-period RV Tauri stars. Follow-up spectroscopy reveals clear $s$-process enrichment and signatures consistent with an accretion disk around the companion. The inferred progenitor is significantly younger and more massive than a typical stream member, suggesting that an additional mechanism such as a stellar merger is required. We propose a formation channel in which the present post-AGB binary descends from a hierarchical triple system. In this scenario, the inner binary merged after the system was displaced to its current location by the galaxy merger event, and the resulting massive merger remnant subsequently evolved into the extremely luminous post-AGB star observed today."

    "abstract": "Existing large audio-language models perceive the world as \"mono\" -- a single stream of audio that ignores the critical spatial dimension (\"where\") required for universal acoustic scene analysis. To bridge this gap, we first introduce a hierarchical framework for Auditory Scene Analysis (ASA). Guided by this framework, we introduce a system that enables models like Qwen2-Audio to understand and reason about the complex acoustic world. Our framework achieves this through three core contributions: First, we build a large-scale, synthesized binaural audio dataset to provide the rich spatial cues. Second, we design a hybrid feature projector, which leverages parallel semantic and spatial encoders to extract decoupled representations. These distinct streams are integrated via a dense fusion mechanism, ensuring the model receives a holistic view of the acoustic scene. Finally, we employ a progressive training curriculum, advancing from supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to explicitly evolve the model's capabilities towards reasoning. On our comprehensive benchmark, the model demonstrates comparatively strong capability for spatial understanding. By enabling this spatial perception, our work provides a clear pathway for leveraging the powerful reasoning abilities of large models towards holistic acoustic scene analysis, advancing from \"mono\" semantic recognition to spatial intelligence."

We instantiate BoT within a multi-agent reflection architecture (BoT-R), where a Reflector performs joint evaluation to unlock mutual information gain unavailable in isolated processing. Experiments across three model families and six benchmarks demonstrate that BoT-R consistently improves accuracy and confidence calibration while reducing inference costs by up to 61%.

We formalize a corresponding threat model and empirically evaluate the effectiveness of targeted manipulations of real data (e.g., label flipping and feature-importance-based interventions) on the quality of generated synthetic data. The results show that even small perturbations can substantially reduce downstream predictive performance and increase statistical divergence, exposing vulnerabilities within SDG pipelines. This study highlights the need to integrate integrity verification and robustness mechanisms, alongside privacy protection, to ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of synthetic data sharing frameworks."

Here, we introduce defect landscape engineering, the deliberate creation of vacancy clusters prior to helium exposure, as a general strategy to suppress helium-induced degradation. Using α-SiC as a model, we combine advanced microscopy, strain mapping, helium depth profiling, positron annihilation spectroscopy, and atomistic simulations to demonstrate that tailored pre-damage transforms helium defect evolution. Instead of forming extended platelets and nanocracks, helium is trapped in stable, uniformly dispersed nanobubbles. Simulations reveal that small vacancy clusters act as dual-function sinks for irradiation-induced interstitials and preferential helium traps, fundamentally altering cascade recombination dynamics. This mechanism is composition-independent and scalable, offering a new design principle for radiation-tolerant ceramics across carbides, nitrides, and oxides. By viewing defect control as a tunable parameter instead of a fixed material property, this work outlines a possible design route toward enhanced radiation tolerance in ceramics used in extreme environments."

While state space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, pure causal SSMs architectures often struggle with the content-based retrieval required to capture global frequency-domain artifacts. To address this, we explore the scaling properties of hybrid architectures by proposing XLSR-MamBo, a modular framework integrating an XLSR front-end with synergistic Mamba-Attention backbones. We systematically evaluate four topological designs using advanced SSM variants, Mamba, Mamba2, Hydra, and Gated DeltaNet. Experimental results demonstrate that the MamBo-3-Hydra-N3 configuration achieves competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art systems on the ASVspoof 2021 LA, DF, and In-the-Wild benchmarks. This performance benefits from Hydra's native bidirectional modeling, which captures holistic temporal dependencies more efficiently than the heuristic dual-branch strategies employed in prior works. Furthermore, evaluations on the DFADD dataset demonstrate robust generalization to unseen diffusion- and flow-matching-based synthesis methods. Crucially, our analysis reveals that scaling backbone depth effectively mitigates the performance variance and instability observed in shallower models. These results demonstrate the hybrid framework's ability to capture artifacts in spoofed speech signals, providing an effective method for ADD."

The challenges of multi-modal vehicle ReID arise from the uncertainty of modality quality distribution induced by inherent discrepancies across modalities, resulting in distinct conflicting fusion requirements for data with balanced and unbalanced quality distributions. Existing methods handle all multi-modal data within a single fusion model, overlooking the different needs of the two data types and making it difficult to decouple the conflict between intra-class consistency and inter-modal heterogeneity. To this end, we propose Disentangle Collaboration and Guidance Fusion Representations for Multi-modal Vehicle ReID (DCG-ReID). Specifically, to disentangle heterogeneous quality-distributed modal data without mutual interference, we first design the Dynamic Confidence-based Disentangling Weighting (DCDW) mechanism: dynamically reweighting three-modal contributions via interaction-derived modal confidence to build a disentangled fusion framework. Building on DCDW, we develop two scenario-specific fusion strategies: (1) for balanced quality distributions, Collaboration Fusion Module (CFM) mines pairwise consensus features to capture shared discriminative information and boost intra-class consistency; (2) for unbalanced distributions, Guidance Fusion Module (GFM) implements differential amplification of modal discriminative disparities to reinforce dominant modality advantages, guide auxiliary modalities to mine complementary discriminative info, and mitigate inter-modal divergence to boost multi-modal joint decision performance. Extensive experiments on three multi-modal ReID benchmarks (WMVeID863, MSVR310, RGBNT100) validate the effectiveness of our method. Code will be released upon acceptance."

Working in a weighted Sobolev space that combines the homogeneous Sobolev space with a weighted Lebesgue term, we establish continuous and compact embeddings of Caffarelli--Kohn--Nirenberg type. These embeddings, together with a model that displays a natural scaling, allow us to apply the abstract critical point framework of Mercuri and Perera (2025), yielding a sequence of nonlinear eigenvalues for the associated problem. This scaling property leads to a classification of weighted power-type nonlinearities into subscaled, scaled, and superscaled regimes. Within this variational setting, we obtain broad existence and multiplicity results for equations driven by sums of weighted power nonlinearities, covering superscaled, scaled, and subscaled interactions, both in the subcritical and critical cases. We also provide a nonexistence result as a consequence of a Pohozaev-type identity. Finally, in the radial setting we employ improved radial CKN inequalities to enlarge the admissible embedding ranges. This yields strengthened radial versions of all our main results, including two-dimensional configurations with more singular weights, where no compact embeddings are available in the nonradial case."

    "abstract": "Variance reduction (VR) is a crucial tool for solving finite-sum optimization problems, including the composite general convex setting, which is the focus of this work. On the one hand, denoting the number of component functions as $n$ and the target accuracy as $ε$, some VR methods achieve the near-optimal complexity $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(n+\\sqrt{n}/\\sqrtε\\right)$, but they all have nested structure and fail to provide convergence guarantee for the iterate sequence itself. On the other hand, single-loop VR methods, being free from the aforementioned disadvantages, have complexity no better than $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n+n/\\sqrtε\\right)$ which is the complexity of the deterministic method FISTA, thus leaving a critical gap unaddressed. In this work, we propose the \\textit{Harmonia} technique which relates checkpoint update probabilities to momentum parameters in single-loop VR methods. Based on this technique, we further propose to vary the growth rate of the momentum parameter, creating a novel continuous trade-off between acceleration and variance reduction, controlled by the key parameter $α\\in[0,1]$. The proposed techniques lead to following favourable consequences. First, several known complexity of quite different algorithms are re-discovered under the proposed unifying algorithmic framework Katyusha-H. Second, under an extra mild condition, Katyusha-H achieves the near-optimal complexity for $α$ belonging to a certain interval, highlighting the effectiveness of the acceleration-variance reduction trade-off. Last, without extra conditions, Katyusha-H achieves the complexity $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n+\\sqrt{n}/\\sqrtε)$ with $α=1$ and proper mini-batch sizes. The proposed idea and techniques may be of general interest beyond the considered problem in this work."

We provide an in-depth quantitative and qualitative analysis of the predictions, showing that they are plausible and interpretable."

    "abstract": "Detecting and characterizing individual ionized bubbles during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) using the redshifted HI 21-cm signal provides a direct probe of the early ionizing sources and the intergalactic medium. We develop and validate a computationally efficient estimator that operates on gridded visibilities to detect ionized bubbles. This serves as an accurate alternative to the more computationally demanding bare estimator that uses all baselines and frequency channels. Further, we employ a non-parametric foreground-subtraction method based on Gaussian process regression, which minimizes loss of the HI 21-cm signal and yields improved signal-to-noise ratios. Our analysis indicates that ionized bubbles at redshifts $z \\sim 7 - 8$ can be detected with SNR $\\gtrsim 10$ using $\\sim 100$ hours of SKA1-Low AA$^*$ and AA4 observations. We further derive a scaling relation that connects the SNR to the bubble radius, redshift, total observing time, and the mean neutral hydrogen fraction of the surrounding IGM. This helps to quickly predict the observational outcome for any planned observations and is, therefore, useful for devising observational strategies. Finally, we apply a Bayesian likelihood framework with Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to the residual visibilities to recover ionized bubble properties, including radius, position, and the mean neutral fraction. The resulting posterior distributions demonstrate accurate recovery of the bubble parameters. This confirms the feasibility of robustly characterizing individual ionized regions with the SKA1-Low."

Previous works have demonstrated promising results in applying LLM's towards compressing not only text, but also a wide range of multi-modal data. Despite the favorable performance achieved, there still remains several practical questions that pose a challenge towards replacing existing data compression algorithms with LLM's. In this work, we explore different methods to achieve a lower adjusted compression rate using LLM's as data compressors. In comparison to previous works, we were able to achieve a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) adjusted compression rate of around $18\\%$ on the enwik9 dataset without additional model training. Furthermore, we explore the use of LLM's in compressing non-English data, code data, byte stream sequences. We show that while LLM's excel in compressing data in text-dominant domains, their ability in compressing non-natural text sequences still remain competitive if configured in the right way."

    "abstract": "Precise day-ahead forecasts for electricity prices are crucial to ensure efficient portfolio management, support strategic decision-making for power plant operations, enable efficient battery storage optimization, and facilitate demand response planning. However, developing an accurate prediction model is highly challenging in an uncertain and volatile market environment. For instance, although linear models generally exhibit competitive performance in predicting electricity prices with minimal computational requirements, they fail to capture relevant nonlinear relationships. Nonlinear models, on the other hand, can improve forecasting accuracy with a surge in computational costs. We propose a novel multivariate neural network approach that combines linear and nonlinear feed-forward neural structures. Unlike previous hybrid models, our approach integrates online learning and forecast combination for efficient training and accuracy improvement. It also incorporates all relevant characteristics, particularly the fundamental relationships arising from wind and solar generation, electricity demand patterns, related energy fuel and carbon markets, in addition to autoregressive dynamics and calendar effects. Compared to the current state-of-the-art benchmark models, the proposed forecasting method significantly reduces computational cost while delivering superior forecasting accuracy (12-13% RMSE and 15-18% MAE reductions). Our results are derived from a six-year forecasting study conducted on major European electricity markets."

However, existing research on MAD suffers from two fundamental limitations: evaluations are conducted under fragmented and inconsistent settings, hindering fair comparison, and are largely restricted to single-modality scenarios that rely on textual inputs only. To address these gaps, we introduce M3MAD-Bench, a unified and extensible benchmark for evaluating MAD methods across Multi-domain tasks, Multi-modal inputs, and Multi-dimensional metrics. M3MAD-Bench establishes standardized protocols over five core task domains: Knowledge, Mathematics, Medicine, Natural Sciences, and Complex Reasoning, and systematically covers both pure text and vision-language datasets, enabling controlled cross-modality comparison. We evaluate MAD methods on nine base models spanning different architectures, scales, and modality capabilities. Beyond accuracy, M3MAD-Bench incorporates efficiency-oriented metrics such as token consumption and inference time, providing a holistic view of performance--cost trade-offs. Extensive experiments yield systematic insights into the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of MAD across text-only and multimodal scenarios. We believe M3MAD-Bench offers a reliable foundation for future research on standardized MAD evaluation. The code is available at http://github.com/liaolea/M3MAD-Bench."

    "abstract": "The Bayes factor, the data-based updating factor from prior to posterior odds, is a principled measure of relative evidence for two competing hypotheses. It is naturally suited to sequential data analysis in settings such as clinical trials and animal experiments, where early stopping for efficacy or futility is desirable. However, designing such studies is challenging because computing design characteristics, such as the probability of obtaining conclusive evidence or the expected sample size, typically requires computationally intensive Monte Carlo simulations, as no closed-form or efficient numerical methods exist. To address this issue, we extend results from classical group sequential design theory to sequential Bayes factor designs. The key idea is to derive Bayes factor stopping regions in terms of the z-statistic and use the known distribution of the cumulative z-statistics to compute stopping probabilities through multivariate normal integration. The resulting method is fast, accurate, and simulation-free. We illustrate it with examples from clinical trials, animal experiments, and psychological studies. We also provide an open-source implementation in the bfpwr R package. Our method makes exploring sequential Bayes factor designs as straightforward as classical group sequential designs, enabling experiments to rapidly design informative and efficient experiments."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a well-established framework for sequential decision-making in complex environments. However, state-of-the-art Deep RL (DRL) algorithms typically require large training datasets and often struggle to generalize beyond small-scale training scenarios, even within standard benchmarks. We propose a neuro-symbolic DRL approach that integrates background symbolic knowledge to improve sample efficiency and generalization to more challenging, unseen tasks. Partial policies defined for simple domain instances, where high performance is easily attained, are transferred as useful priors to accelerate learning in more complex settings and avoid tuning DRL parameters from scratch. To do so, partial policies are represented as logical rules, and online reasoning is performed to guide the training process through two mechanisms: (i) biasing the action distribution during exploration, and (ii) rescaling Q-values during exploitation. This neuro-symbolic integration enhances interpretability and trustworthiness while accelerating convergence, particularly in sparse-reward environments and tasks with long planning horizons. We empirically validate our methodology on challenging variants of gridworld environments, both in the fully observable and partially observable setting. We show improved performance over a state-of-the-art reward machine baseline."

Existing memory frameworks provide limited support for temporally structured information across hierarchical levels, often leading to fragmented memories and unstable long-horizon personalization. We present TiMem, a temporal--hierarchical memory framework that organizes conversations through a Temporal Memory Tree (TMT), enabling systematic memory consolidation from raw conversational observations to progressively abstracted persona representations. TiMem is characterized by three core properties: (1) temporal--hierarchical organization through TMT; (2) semantic-guided consolidation that enables memory integration across hierarchical levels without fine-tuning; and (3) complexity-aware memory recall that balances precision and efficiency across queries of varying complexity. Under a consistent evaluation setup, TiMem achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on both benchmarks, reaching 75.30% on LoCoMo and 76.88% on LongMemEval-S. It outperforms all evaluated baselines while reducing the recalled memory length by 52.20% on LoCoMo. Manifold analysis indicates clear persona separation on LoCoMo and reduced dispersion on LongMemEval-S. Overall, TiMem treats temporal continuity as a first-class organizing principle for long-horizon memory in conversational agents."

    "abstract": "Modern datasets arising from social media, genomics, and biomedical informatics are often heterogeneous and (ultra) high-dimensional, creating substantial challenges for conventional modeling techniques. Quantile regression (QR) not only offers a flexible way to capture heterogeneous effects across the conditional distribution of an outcome, but also naturally produces prediction intervals that help quantify uncertainty in future predictions. However, classical QR methods can face serious memory and computational constraints in large-scale settings. These limitations motivate the use of parallel computing to maintain tractability. While extensive work has examined sample-splitting strategies in settings where the number of observations $n$ greatly exceeds the number of features $p$, the equally important (ultra) high-dimensional regime ($p >> n$) has been comparatively underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a feature-splitting proximal point algorithm, FS-QRPPA, for penalized QR in high-dimensional regime. Leveraging recent developments in variational analysis, we establish a Q-linear convergence rate for FS-QRPPA and demonstrate its superior scalability in large-scale genomic applications from the UK Biobank relative to existing methods. Moreover, FS-QRPPA yields more accurate coefficient estimates and better coverage for prediction intervals than current approaches. We provide a parallel implementation in the R package fsQRPPA, making penalized QR tractable on large-scale datasets."

    "abstract": "This work proposes a mixed learning-based and optimization-based approach to the weighted-sum-rates beamforming problem in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless network. The conventional methods, i.e., the fractional programming (FP) method and the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm, can be computationally demanding for two reasons: (i) they require inverting a sequence of matrices whose sizes are proportional to the number of antennas; (ii) they require tuning a set of Lagrange multipliers to account for the power constraints. The recently proposed method called the reduced WMMSE addresses the above two issues for a single cell. In contrast, for the multicell case, another recent method called the FastFP eliminates the large matrix inversion and the Lagrange multipliers by using an improved FP technique, but the update stepsize in the FastFP can be difficult to decide. As such, we propose integrating the deep unfolding network into the FastFP for the stepsize optimization. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method is much more efficient than the learning method based on the WMMSE algorithm."

Here, we report the growth of single crystalline quasi-two-dimensional van-der-Waals-like Kondo lattice CeSn$_{0.75}$Sb$_2$, and its physical properties by a combination of transport / magnetic / thermodynamic measurements. We find that it hosts a fragile antiferromagnetic (AFM) order and a cluster glass (CG) ground state, both of which are highly sensitive to external fields. Upon cooling under low in-plane magnetic fields, the AFM phase evolves into a polarized paramagnetic phase, either directly or indirectly through the intermediate CG phase. This process constitutes an inverse magnetic melting effect that restores the broken translational / rotational symmetries. Our work provides a rare paradigm of inverse magnetic melting effect in vdW-like heavy-fermion materials, and enriches the physics in conventional Kondo-lattice models."

Our approach enforces evidence-first protocols where every causal claim traces to retrieved literature and automatically generates directed acyclic graphs visualizing intervention-outcome pathways. Evaluation on 234 dementia exercise abstracts shows CausalAgent achieves 95% accuracy, 100% retrieval success, and zero hallucinations versus 34% accuracy and 10% hallucinations for baseline AI.

    "abstract": "We study a two Higgs doublet model extended by a complex singlet scalar, in which the imaginary part of the singlet serves as a dark matter (DM) candidate. In this model, degenerate masses of the three neutral Higgs bosons are crucial for achieving consistency with current constraints from DM direct-detection experiments and Higgs searches. This is called the degenerate scalar scenario. To provide a theoretical motivation for such a degenerate Higgs spectrum, we impose the tree-level Multiple Point Principle (MPP), which requires the electroweak and singlet vacua to be degenerate, and analyze its implications for the scalar potential, DM phenomenology, and the electroweak phase transition. We show that the tree-level MPP favors large SU(2)$_L$ doublet-singlet mixing parameters, which compete with the degenerate scalar scenario. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that viable parameter regions still exist in which the observed DM constraints are satisfied. Furthermore, although the tree-level MPP forbids a tree-level-driven first-order electroweak phase transition, we show that thermal loop effects can induce a strong first-order transition compatible with electroweak baryogenesis."

By using Logically Constrained Simply-typed Term Rewriting Systems (LCSTRSs) as an intermediate language, rewriting induction becomes a tool for program verification, with inductive theorems taking the role of equivalence predicates. Soundness of RI depends on well-founded induction, and one of the core obstacles for obtaining a practically useful proof system is to find suitable well-founded orderings automatically. Using naive approaches, all induction hypotheses must be oriented within the well-founded ordering, which leads to very strong termination requirements. This, in turn, severely limits the proof capacity of RI. Here, we introduce Bounded RI: an adaption of RI for LCSTRSs where such termination requirements are minimized."

    "abstract": "Large- or medium-scale cosmic ray anisotropy at TeV energies has not previously been confirmed to vary with time. Transient anisotropy changes have been observed below 150 GeV, especially near the passage of an interplanetary shock and coronal mass ejection containing a magnetic flux rope ejected by a solar storm, which can trigger a geomagnetic storm with practical consequences. In such events, cosmic rays provide remote sensing of the magnetic field properties. Here we report the observation of transient large-scale anisotropy in TeV cosmic ray ions using data from the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). We analyze hourly skymaps of the transient cosmic ray intensity excess or deficit, the gradient of which indicates the direction and magnitude of transient large-scale anisotropy across the field of view. We observe enhanced anisotropy above typical hourly fluctuations with $>$5$σ$ significance during some hours of November 4, 2021, in separate data sets for four primary cosmic ray energy ranges of median energy from $E$=0.7 to 3.1 TeV. The gradient varies with energy as $E^γ$, where $γ\\approx-0.5$. At a median energy $\\leq$1.0 TeV, this gradient corresponds to a dipole anisotropy of at least 1\\%, or possibly a weaker anisotropy of higher order. This new type of observation opens the opportunity to study interplanetary magnetic structures using air shower arrays around the world, complementing existing in situ and remote measurements of plasma properties."

    "abstract": "Video stylization, an important downstream task of video generation models, has not yet been thoroughly explored. Its input style conditions typically include text, style image, and stylized first frame. Each condition has a characteristic advantage: text is more flexible, style image provides a more accurate visual anchor, and stylized first frame makes long-video stylization feasible. However, existing methods are largely confined to a single type of style condition, which limits their scope of application. Additionally, their lack of high-quality datasets leads to style inconsistency and temporal flicker. To address these limitations, we introduce DreamStyle, a unified framework for video stylization, supporting (1) text-guided, (2) style-image-guided, and (3) first-frame-guided video stylization, accompanied by a well-designed data curation pipeline to acquire high-quality paired video data. DreamStyle is built on a vanilla Image-to-Video (I2V) model and trained using a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with token-specific up matrices that reduces the confusion among different condition tokens. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that DreamStyle is competent in all three video stylization tasks, and outperforms the competitors in style consistency and video quality."

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) magnetic field in the solar atmosphere provides crucial information to understand the explosive phenomenon such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections. Since it is still hard that we determine the 3D magnetic field from direct observation, a nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolation is one of the best modeling methods that provides 3D magnetic field. However, the method is based on zero-beta assumption, i.e., the model ignores the gas pressure gradient and gravitational force. The magnetic field based on an NLFFF is not well reconstructed in high-beta region, such as in chromospheric or lower height layer and in weak field region. To overcome this problem, we need to consider the magnetohydrostatic equilibrium. In this study, we developed a finite plasma beta magnetic field extrapolation method based on magnetohydrodynamic relaxation method. In our method, we consider a force balance of the Lorentz force and the gas pressure. We tested three different schemes and extrapolated 3D magnetic field using an observational photospheric vector magnetic field of one solar active region, which is a quadrupole complex sunspot group and well studied with an NLFFF. The verification of three schemes is performed by comparing the residual force, and we concluded that our methods reduce ~4% of residual force of the previous NLFFF. We also examined the plasma beta profile along the height and found that, in the core of the active region, plasma beta reaches a local minimum of ~0.01 in the lower corona with beta ~1 at the photosphere."

Recent work has made significant progress, but its reliance on large-scale datasets and complex decoders has limited its efficiency and generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and data-centric framework for zero-shot monocular depth estimation. We first adopt DINOv3 as the visual encoder to obtain high-quality dense features. Secondly, to address the inherent drawbacks of the complex structure of the DPT, we design the Simple Depth Transformer (SDT), a compact transformer-based decoder. Compared to the DPT, it uses a single-path feature fusion and upsampling process to reduce the computational overhead of cross-scale feature fusion, achieving higher accuracy while reducing the number of parameters by approximately 85%-89%. Furthermore, we propose a quality-based filtering strategy to filter out harmful samples, thereby reducing dataset size while improving overall training quality. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that our framework surpasses the DPT in accuracy. This work highlights the importance of balancing model design and data quality for achieving efficient and generalizable zero-shot depth estimation. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/AnyDepth.

We trace the architectural progression from statistical models to transformer-based systems, identifying capabilities that enable agentic behavior: long-range reasoning, contextual awareness, and adaptive decision-making. The chapter provides three contributions: (1) a synthesis of how LLM capabilities extend toward agency through reasoning-action-reflection loops; (2) an integrative framework describing core components perception, memory, planning, and tool execution that bridge LLMs with autonomous behavior; (3) a critical assessment of applications and persistent challenges in safety, alignment, reliability, and sustainability. Unlike existing surveys, we focus on the architectural transition from language understanding to autonomous action, emphasizing the technical gaps that must be resolved before deployment. We identify critical research priorities, including verifiable planning, scalable multi-agent coordination, persistent memory architectures, and governance frameworks. Responsible advancement requires simultaneous progress in technical robustness, interpretability, and ethical safeguards to realize potential while mitigating risks of misalignment and unintended consequences."

We then show that the data-driven approach for designing an output-feedback control law for the given plant can be reduced to the data-driven design of a state-feedback control law for a well-defined augmented auxiliary system. As a result, we develop a systematic data-driven approach to solve the output regulation problem for unknown linear systems via value iteration. Finally, we establish a relation between the data-driven state-feedback control law and the data-driven output-feedback control law in the LQR sense."

As a result, tracking aggressive trajectories accurately could be challenging due to the existence of residual physics during controller synthesis. This paper presents a self-supervised residual learning and trajectory optimization framework to address the aforementioned challenges. At first, unknown dynamic effects on the closed-loop model are learned and treated as residuals of the nominal dynamics, jointly forming a hybrid model. We show that learning with analytic gradients can be achieved using only trajectory-level data while enjoying accurate long-horizon prediction with an arbitrary integration step size. Subsequently, a trajectory optimizer is developed to compute the optimal reference trajectory with the residual physics along it minimized. It ends up with trajectories that are friendly to the following control level. The agile flight of quadrotors illustrates that by utilizing the hybrid dynamics, the proposed optimizer outputs aggressive motions that can be precisely tracked."

    "abstract": "Recent observations of FRB 20220529 reveal significant variation and a partial reversal in its rotation measure (RM), suggesting the presence of a dynamically evolving magnetized environment, which could be caused by the orbital motion of the magnetar within the binary system. Here we develop the binary model by suggesting that the spin and magnetic axis of the companion star could undergo precession around the orbital axis. It is then investigated how the precession period and the inclination of the magnetic axis, as well as a possible disc wind, can influence the evolution behaviors of the RM and dispersion measure (DM) of FRB emission. As the foremost consequence, the RM variation can be significantly altered on timescales longer than the orbital period, producing super-orbital evolution and complex patterns. Applying this model to FRB 20220529, we find that its RM evolution could be reproduced with a precession period of 182 days and an inclination angle of approximately $19^{\\circ}$, while the other binary parameters are fixed at their typical values. Meanwhile, the absence of significant variation of the DM argues against the presence of a dense equatorial disc around the companion star, which would be constrained by future long-term observations."

    "abstract": "As contemporary microservice systems become increasingly popular and complex-often comprising hundreds or even thousands of fine-grained, interdependent subsystems-they are experiencing more frequent failures. Ensuring system reliability thus demands accurate root cause localization. While many traditional graph-based and deep learning approaches have been explored for this task, they often rely heavily on pre-defined schemas that struggle to adapt to evolving operational contexts. Consequently, a number of LLM-based methods have recently been proposed. However, these methods still face two major limitations: shallow, symptom-centric reasoning that undermines accuracy, and a lack of cross-alert reuse that leads to redundant reasoning and high latency. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of how Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) localize the root causes of failures, drawing insights from professionals across multiple organizations. Our investigation reveals that expert root cause analysis exhibits three key characteristics: recursiveness, multi-dimensional expansion, and cross-modal reasoning. Motivated by these findings, we introduce AMER-RCL, an agentic memory enhanced recursive reasoning framework for root cause localization in microservices. AMER-RCL employs the Recursive Reasoning RCL engine, a multi-agent framework that performs recursive reasoning on each alert to progressively refine candidate causes, while Agentic Memory incrementally accumulates and reuses reasoning from prior alerts within a time window to reduce redundant exploration and lower inference latency. Experimental results demonstrate that AMER-RCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both localization accuracy and inference efficiency."

The existing theory for HFHR dynamics in the literature is restricted to strongly-convex $U$, although numerical experiments are promising for non-convex settings as well. We focus on studying the convergence of HFHR dynamics when $U$ can be non-convex, which bridges a gap between theory and practice. Under a standard assumption of dissipativity and smoothness on $U$, we adopt the reflection/synchronous coupling method. This yields a Lyapunov-weighted Wasserstein distance in which the HFHR semigroup is exponentially contractive for all sufficiently small $α>0$ whenever KLD is. We further show that, under an additional assumption that asymptotically $\\nabla U$ has linear growth at infinity, the contraction rate for HFHR dynamics is strictly better than that of KLD, with an explicit gain. As a case study, we verify the assumptions and the resulting acceleration for three examples: a multi-well potential, Bayesian linear regression with $L^p$ regularizer and Bayesian binary classification. We conduct numerical experiments based on these examples, as well as an additional example of Bayesian logistic regression with real data processed by the neural networks, which illustrates the efficiency of the algorithms based on HFHR dynamics and verifies the acceleration and superior performance compared to KLD."

However, current 3D mesh saliency GT acquisition methods are generally consistent with 2D image methods, ignoring the differences between 3D geometry topology and 2D image array. Current VR eye-tracking pipelines rely on single ray sampling and Euclidean smoothing, triggering texture attention and signal leakage across gaps. This paper proposes a robust framework to address these limitations. We first introduce a view cone sampling (VCS) strategy, which simulates the human foveal receptive field via Gaussian-distributed ray bundles to improve sampling robustness for complex topologies. Furthermore, a hybrid Manifold-Euclidean constrained diffusion (HCD) algorithm is developed, fusing manifold geodesic constraints with Euclidean scales to ensure topologically-consistent saliency propagation. By mitigating \"topological short-circuits\" and aliasing, our framework provides a high-fidelity 3D attention acquisition paradigm that aligns with natural human perception, offering a more accurate and robust baseline for 3D mesh saliency research."

We explore how higher curvature corrections and nonlinear electromagnetic effects change the spacetime geometry, horizon structure, and energy content of the black hole. We examine the thermodynamic properties in detail, revealing a minimum mass and stable black hole remnants. These findings might be significant in scenarios involving dark-sector compact objects or evaporation endpoints beyond standard general relativity. We also investigate the motion of massive particles, discussing the characteristics of circular orbits and the innermost stable circular orbit, highlighting differences from the Maxwell case. Additionally, we analyze the quasinormal modes of a massive scalar field using WKB methods with Padé approximants and the Pöschl-Teller approximation. We explore how the quasinormal spectrum depends on the Gauss-Bonnet coupling, the ModMax parameter, and the scalar field mass. Our results confirm the linear stability of the black hole and offer potential observational signatures of dark-sector inspired modifications of gravity and electrodynamics."

Here, we developed an integrated optomechanical platform on thin-film lithium niobate with precisely engineered optical, mechanical, and thermal fields within a compact 40 μm by 40 μm footprint. The platform integrates suspended microring resonators with ultrathin central membranes, reducing mechanical stiffness and effective mass while maintaining a high optical factor Q_o of 1e6 and mechanical quality factor Q_m of 1117, which increases to 5.1e4 after oscillation. The design suppresses thermal dissipation into the silicon substrate and enhances thermal sensitivity, achieving a temperature coefficient of frequency of -124 ppm/K and a noise-equivalent power of 6.2 nW/sqrt(Hz) at 10 kHz at room temperature. This compact and scalable platform opens up new opportunities for high-sensitivity thermal sensing, supports heterogeneous integration with infrared absorbers for uncooled infrared detection, and enables fully integrated, all-optical on-chip readout, paving the way toward large-format, low-noise infrared sensing arrays."

This highlights the need for \"Time-Scaling\"--the systematic extension and optimization of an agent's ability to unfold reasoning over time. Time-Scaling refers to architectural design utilizing extended temporal pathways, enabling deeper problem space exploration, dynamic strategy adjustment, and enhanced metacognitive control, paralleling human sequential reasoning under cognitive constraints.

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of flow fields around underwater vehicles undergoing vertical-plane oblique motions is critical for hydrodynamic analysis, but it often requires computationally expensive CFD simulations. This study proposes a Data-Driven Flow Initialization (DDFI) framework that accelerates CFD simulation by integrating deep neural network (DNN) to predict full-domain flow fields. Using the suboff hull under various inlet velocities and angles of attack as an example, a DNN is trained to predict velocity, pressure, and turbulent quantities based on mesh geometry, operating conditions, and hybrid vectors. The DNN can provide reasonably accurate predictions with a relative error about 3.3%. To enhance numerical accuracy while maintaining physical consistency, the DNN-predicted flow fields are utilized as initial solutions for the CFD solver, achieving up to 3.5-fold and 2.0-fold speedup at residual thresholds of 5*10^(-6)and 5*10^(-8), respectively. This method maintains physical consistency by refining neural network outputs via traditional CFD solvers, balancing computational efficiency and accuracy. Notably, reducing the size of training set does not exert an essential impact on acceleration performance. Besides, this method exhibits cross-mesh generalization capability. In general, this proposed hybrid approach offers a new pathway for high-fidelity and efficient full-domain flow field predictions around complex underwater vehicles."

Traditional safety frameworks treat contact as unsafe, restricting robots to collision avoidance and limiting their ability to function in dense, everyday settings. As the number of objects grows, model-based approaches for safe manipulation become computationally intractable; meanwhile, learned methods typically tie safety to the task at hand, making them hard to transfer to new tasks without retraining. In this work we introduce Dense Contact Barrier Functions(DCBF). Our approach bypasses the computational complexity of explicitly modeling multi-object dynamics by instead learning a composable, object-centric function that implicitly captures the safety constraints arising from physical interactions. Trained offline on interactions with a few objects, the learned DCBFcomposes across arbitrary object sets at runtime, producing a single global safety filter that scales linearly and transfers across tasks without retraining. We validate our approach through simulated experiments in dense clutter, demonstrating its ability to enable collision-free navigation and safe, contact-rich interaction in suitable settings."

In suitable regions of the parameter space, the model can produce non-negligible deviations in $Γ_{\\rm NP}(h\\to Zγ)/Γ_{\\rm SM}(h\\to Zγ)$ and $Γ_{\\rm NP}(h\\to m_VZ)/Γ_{\\rm SM}(h\\to m_V Z)$, providing possible signals of new physics (NP) beyond the SM."

    "abstract": "Subhalo spin is essential for modeling galaxy formation and controlling systematic uncertainties in intrinsic alignment (IA) studies. However, the physical mechanisms governing subhalo spin acquisition within the tidal environments of host halos remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the alignment between subhalo and host halo spins using the high-resolution cosmological $N$-body simulation, Shin-Uchuu. We find that the spin alignment between subhalos and host halos becomes increasingly pronounced toward the central regions. Our analysis reveals that subhalos typically acquire spin in the same direction as their orbital angular momentum. Since the orbital angular momentum of most subhalos is aligned with the host halo spin, an overall alignment between subhalo and host spins emerges. When classified by orbital orientation, however, subhalo spins in the inner regions are found to be oriented perpendicularly or anti-parallel to the host spin for polar and retrograde orbits, respectively. These results provide strong evidence that subhalo spins are acquired through torques exerted by the tidal field of the host halo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the mass ratio and the radial distance from the host center are the primary parameters governing subhalo spin alignment, while the dependence on the accretion redshift is found to be negligible."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide spectrum of natural language processing tasks. However, their ever-growing scale introduces significant barriers to real-world deployment, including substantial computational overhead, memory footprint, and inference latency. While model pruning presents a viable solution to these challenges, existing unstructured pruning techniques often yield irregular sparsity patterns that necessitate specialized hardware or software support. In this work, we explore structured pruning, which eliminates entire architectural components and maintains compatibility with standard hardware accelerators. We introduce a novel structured pruning framework that leverages a hybrid multi-domain calibration set and an iterative calibration strategy to effectively identify and remove redundant channels. Extensive experiments on various models across diverse downstream tasks show that our approach achieves significant compression with minimal performance degradation."

These resource limitations make jailbreaking expensive, and the queries generated by attacker LLMs often consist of non-interpretable random prefixes. This paper introduces Lexical Anchor Tree Search (), addressing these limitations through an attacker-LLM-free method that operates purely via lexical anchor injection. LATS reformulates jailbreaking as a breadth-first tree search over multi-turn dialogues, where each node incrementally injects missing content words from the attack goal into benign prompts. Evaluations on AdvBench and HarmBench demonstrate that LATS achieves 97-100% ASR on latest GPT, Claude, and Llama models with an average of only ~6.4 queries, compared to 20+ queries required by other methods. These results highlight conversational structure as a potent and under-protected attack surface, while demonstrating superior query efficiency in an era where high ASR is readily achievable. Our code will be released to support reproducibility."

We first show that a rank-1 PVM on $\\mathbb{C}^d\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^d$ containing an element with the maximal Schmidt rank can be localized using entanglement of a Schmidt number at most $d$ if and only if it forms a maximally entangled basis corresponding to a nice unitary error basis. This reveals strong limitations imposed by non-adaptive local operations, in contrast to the adaptive setting where any joint measurement is implementable. We then completely characterize two-qubit rank-1 PVMs that can be localized with two-qubit entanglement, resolving a conjecture of Gisin and Del Santo, and finally extend our characterization to ideal two-qudit measurements, strengthening earlier results."

    "abstract": "The transistor transformed not only electronics but everyday life, and the integrated circuit - now simply the \"chip\" - made computation scalable and ubiquitous. Magnonics has long promised a parallel path to low-energy information processing by using spin waves instead of charge. Progress, however, has been limited by two fundamental obstacles: intrinsic attenuation of spin waves and the requirement for precisely normalised output intensity and input phase to ensure reliable logic operation - conditions that are difficult to maintain in large-scale circuits owing to inevitable imperfections. Here, we report an integrated magnonic circuit that overcomes both limitations through engineered nonlinearity in nanoscale yttrium iron garnet waveguides. Nonlinear self-adjustment of the spin wave phase renders logic operation insensitive to the relative phases of the inputs, while a deeply nonlinear, threshold-activated self-normalised excitation restores and standardises the output intensity. Using space-resolved micro-focused Brillouin light scattering, we demonstrate reconfigurable AND, OR and three-input majority gates and realise deterministic cascading across sequential stages, establishing a scalable on-chip logic primitive. The architecture operates with gigahertz frequencies, supports dynamic threshold control for functional reconfiguration, and is compatible with scalable integration, making it attractive for adaptive and neuromorphic computing. By resolving phase-independent operation and signal restoration at the level of device physics, this work advances magnonics from isolated proof-of-concept devices towards integrated magnonic chips that can complement advanced CMOS in energy-constrained computing tasks."

To this end, we focus on a task of translating live-stream chat messages and manually construct LiveChatBench, a benchmark consisting of 1,000 Korean-English parallel sentence pairs. Experiments on five mobile devices demonstrate that, although serving a large and heterogeneous user base requires careful consideration of highly constrained deployment settings and model selection, the proposed approach nevertheless achieves performance comparable to commercial models such as GPT-5.1 on the well-targeted task.

We classify the absorption systems based on whether they display only low-ionization absorption (CII, SiII, MgII), only high-ionization absorption (CIV, SiIV), or both. The percentage of low-ionization-only systems decreases from 24% at $z\\sim$6 to 2% at $z\\sim$4.3, whilst the fraction of high-ionization-only systems increases from 52% to 82%. For mixed absorbers (with both low and high ionization absorption), we use the column density ratios log(N_CII/N_CIV) and log(N_SiII/N_SiIV) to quantify the average ionization as a function of redshift. The log(N_SiII/N_SiIV) ratio does not change significantly over 5$\\lesssim z \\lesssim$6.3. We combine the E-XQR-30 log(N_CII/N_CIV) measurements with literature measurements at $z\\sim$2-4 and find that the log(N_CII/N_CIV) ratio declines by a factor of $\\sim$20 between $z\\sim$6 and $z\\sim$2. To explore possible drivers of this evolution, we run photoionization models of gas slabs illuminated by a uniform UV background at fixed density, metallicity and HI column density. We find that the increase in the ionization state of metal absorbers towards lower redshifts can likely be explained by some combination of 1) an increase in the metallicity of CIV-absorbing gas and 2) a decrease in the typical HI column densities of the absorbing gas, driven by the declining cosmic mean density and a rapid rise in the strength of the UV background during the final stages of reionization."

Based on the architecture FieldFlow-Net, this model combines a multi-resolution 3D U-Net encoder-decoder that operates on evolving plasma potential fields. A dilated temporal convolutional network (TCN) learns the nonlinear time evolution of latent turbulence features. GKFieldFlow simultaneously (i) predicts ion and electron energy fluxes, and particle flux directly from CGYRO turbulence, and (ii) predicts future potential fields autoregressively with desired spatial resolution. This enables the model to replicate both instantaneous transport and the underlying spatio-temporal dynamics that generate it. The architecture is physics-informed in its design: 3D convolutions preserve the anisotropic geometry and phase structure of gyrokinetic fluctuations, while dilated temporal convolutions capture multiscale dynamical couplings such as turbulence and zonal-flow interactions, turbulence decorrelation, and intermittent bursty transport. We provide a complete technical description of the data structure, model components, and rationale behind each architectural choice. The model achieves high accuracy across all three transport channels, with multi-horizon inference maintaining robustness. Autoregressive field rollouts preserve the spectral content, phase coherence, and energy distribution of the CGYRO nonlinear state with strong fidelity, and flux predictions remain consistent with CGYRO within a small fractional error. This work presents GKFieldFlow as a data-driven reduced model that can jointly learn turbulence dynamics and transport."

The recent introduction of a more computationally tractable and ecologically valid semi supervised iterated learning model, combining supervised and unsupervised learning within an autoencoder architecture, has enabled exploration of language transmission dynamics for much larger meaning-signal spaces. Here, for the first time, the model has been successfully applied to a language learning task involving the communication of much more complex meanings: seven-segment display images.

It is arguably the smallest natural class of constant-depth quantum computation which has not been shown useful for computing any non-trivial Boolean function. Despite this, many attempts to port classical $\\mathsf{AC}^0$ lower bounds to $\\mathsf{QAC}^0$ have failed. We give one possible explanation of this: $\\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits are significantly more powerful than their classical counterparts. We show the unconditional separation $\\mathsf{QAC}^0\\not\\subset\\mathsf{AC}^0[p]$ for decision problems, which also resolves for the first time whether $\\mathsf{AC}^0$ could be more powerful than $\\mathsf{QAC}^0$. Moreover, we prove that $\\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits can compute a wide range of Boolean functions if given multiple copies of the input: $\\mathsf{TC}^0 \\subseteq \\mathsf{QAC}^0 \\circ \\mathsf{NC}^0$. Along the way, we introduce an amplitude amplification technique that makes several approximate constant-depth constructions exact."

    "abstract": "Recent text-to-video diffusion models can generate compelling video sequences, yet they remain silent -- missing the semantic, emotional, and atmospheric cues that audio provides. We introduce LTX-2, an open-source foundational model capable of generating high-quality, temporally synchronized audiovisual content in a unified manner. LTX-2 consists of an asymmetric dual-stream transformer with a 14B-parameter video stream and a 5B-parameter audio stream, coupled through bidirectional audio-video cross-attention layers with temporal positional embeddings and cross-modality AdaLN for shared timestep conditioning. This architecture enables efficient training and inference of a unified audiovisual model while allocating more capacity for video generation than audio generation. We employ a multilingual text encoder for broader prompt understanding and introduce a modality-aware classifier-free guidance (modality-CFG) mechanism for improved audiovisual alignment and controllability. Beyond generating speech, LTX-2 produces rich, coherent audio tracks that follow the characters, environment, style, and emotion of each scene -- complete with natural background and foley elements. In our evaluations, the model achieves state-of-the-art audiovisual quality and prompt adherence among open-source systems, while delivering results comparable to proprietary models at a fraction of their computational cost and inference time. All model weights and code are publicly released."

Purpose: To create RXL-RADSet, a radiologist-verified synthetic multi-RADS benchmark, and compare validity and accuracy of open-weight small language models (SLMs) with a proprietary model for RADS assignment. Materials and Methods: RXL-RADSet contains 1,600 synthetic radiology reports across 10 RADS (BI-RADS, CAD-RADS, GB-RADS, LI-RADS, Lung-RADS, NI-RADS, O-RADS, PI-RADS, TI-RADS, VI-RADS) and multiple modalities. Reports were generated by LLMs using scenario plans and simulated radiologist styles and underwent two-stage radiologist verification. We evaluated 41 quantized SLMs (12 families, 0.135-32B parameters) and GPT-5.2 under a fixed guided prompt. Primary endpoints were validity and accuracy; a secondary analysis compared guided versus zero-shot prompting. Results: Under guided prompting GPT-5.2 achieved 99.8% validity and 81.1% accuracy (1,600 predictions). Pooled SLMs (65,600 predictions) achieved 96.8% validity and 61.1% accuracy; top SLMs in the 20-32B range reached ~99% validity and mid-to-high 70% accuracy. Performance scaled with model size (inflection between <1B and >=10B) and declined with RADS complexity primarily due to classification difficulty rather than invalid outputs. Guided prompting improved validity (99.2% vs 96.7%) and accuracy (78.5% vs 69.6%) compared with zero-shot. Conclusion: RXL-RADSet provides a radiologist-verified multi-RADS benchmark; large SLMs (20-32B) can approach proprietary-model performance under guided prompting, but gaps remain for higher-complexity schemes."

In computer vision, geo-localization has served as a demanding benchmark for compositional reasoning and is relevant to public safety. In contrast, progress on audio geo-localization has been constrained by the lack of high-quality audio-location pairs. To address this gap, we introduce AGL1K, the first audio geo-localization benchmark for audio language models (ALMs), spanning 72 countries and territories. To extract reliably localizable samples from a crowd-sourced platform, we propose the Audio Localizability metric that quantifies the informativeness of each recording, yielding 1,444 curated audio clips. Evaluations on 16 ALMs show that ALMs have emerged with audio geo-localization capability. We find that closed-source models substantially outperform open-source models, and that linguistic clues often dominate as a scaffold for prediction. We further analyze ALMs' reasoning traces, regional bias, error causes, and the interpretability of the localizability metric. Overall, AGL1K establishes a benchmark for audio geo-localization and may advance ALMs with better geospatial reasoning capability."

    "abstract": "Although automated trucks have the potential to improve freight efficiency, reduce costs, and address driver shortages, organizing two or more trucks in a convoy has raised considerable concerns for pedestrian safety. This study conducted a controlled experiment to examine the influence of behavioral tendency, trust, and risk perception on pedestrian intention to cross in front of an automated truck platoon. A total of 603 subjects participated in the virtual reality video-based questionnaire survey. By fusing the merits of structural equation modeling and artificial neural networks, a two-stage, hybrid model was developed to examine complex relationships between latent variables and gap-acceptance behaviors. Our results indicated that subjects watched an average of five vehicle gaps before starting crossing and the average time gap accepted was about 5.35 seconds. Risk perception not only played the most dominant role in shaping pedestrian crossing decisions, but also served as the strong bone, mediating the effects of behavioral tendency and trust on gap-acceptance. Participants who frequently violated traffic rules were more likely to accept a smaller time gap, while those who showed positive behaviors to other road users tended to wait for a larger time gap. Participants who often committed errors, showed aggressive behaviors, and held greater trust in the safety of automated trucks generally reported a lower level of risk for road-crossing in front of automated truck platoons. Built on these findings, a range of tailored countermeasures were proposed to ensure safer and smother interactions between pedestrians and automated truck platoons."

We introduce MalruleLib, a learning-science-grounded framework that translates documented misconceptions into executable procedures, drawing on 67 learning-science and mathematics education sources, and generates step-by-step traces of malrule-consistent student work. We formalize a core student-modeling problem as Malrule Reasoning Accuracy (MRA): infer a misconception from one worked mistake and predict the student's next answer under cross-template rephrasing. Across nine language models (4B-120B), accuracy drops from 66% on direct problem solving to 40% on cross-template misconception prediction. MalruleLib encodes 101 malrules over 498 parameterized problem templates and produces paired dual-path traces for both correct reasoning and malrule-consistent student reasoning. Because malrules are executable and templates are parameterizable, MalruleLib can generate over one million instances, enabling scalable supervision and controlled evaluation. Using MalruleLib, we observe cross-template degradations of 10-21%, while providing student step traces improves prediction by 3-15%. We release MalruleLib as infrastructure for educational AI that models student procedures across contexts, enabling diagnosis and feedback that targets the underlying misconception."

At each step, the agent reconstructs context from a workspace state snapshot plus a fixed window of recent actions. Experiments on DeepResearch and an 80-paper literature review task show that, without task-specific fine-tuning, InfiAgent with a 20B open-source model is competitive with larger proprietary systems and maintains substantially higher long-horizon coverage than context-centric baselines.

We propose CF with Graph Uncertainty (CF-GU), a bias evaluation procedure that incorporates the uncertainty of specifying a causal graph into CF. CF-GU (i) bootstraps a Causal Discovery algorithm under domain knowledge constraints to produce a bag of plausible Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), (ii) quantifies graph uncertainty with the normalized Shannon entropy, and (iii) provides confidence bounds on CF metrics.

Inspired by the radiological workflow, AnatomiX adopts a two stage approach: first, it identifies anatomical structures and extracts their features, and then leverages a large language model to perform diverse downstream tasks such as phrase grounding, report generation, visual question answering, and image understanding. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that AnatomiX achieves superior anatomical reasoning and delivers over 25% improvement in performance on anatomy grounding, phrase grounding, grounded diagnosis and grounded captioning tasks compared to existing approaches.

The far-forward region of the LHC provides FIPs with large momenta that scatter off electrons and nuclei inside the target. Production of dark states from meson decays is constrained by invisible decay widths, while the Drell-Yan process offers a production channel in the GeV range. We present sensitivity plots for magnetic and electric dipole moment interactions at SND@LHC and compare them with constraints from direct detection, beam dump, fixed-target, and collider experiments. The validity of the effective theory that describes the dipole model is also studied by considering conservative bounds on the couplings."

Here, we present a unified theoretical framework for the frequency principle (F-principle) that characterizes the training dynamics of both classical and quantum neural networks. Within this framework, we prove that quantum neural networks exhibit a spectral bias toward learning low-frequency components of target functions, mirroring the behavior observed in classical deep networks. We further analyze the impact of noise and show that, when single-qubit noise is applied after encoding-layer rotations and modeled as a Pauli channel aligned with the rotation axis, the Fourier component labeled by $\\boldsymbolω$ is suppressed by a factor $(1-2γ)^{\\|\\boldsymbolω\\|_1}$. This leads to exponential attenuation of high-frequency terms while preserving the learnability of low-frequency structure. In the same setting, we establish that the resulting noisy circuits admit efficient classical simulation up to average-case error. Numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical predictions: Quantum neural networks primarily learn low-frequency features during early optimization and maintain robustness against dephasing and depolarizing noise acting on the encoding layer. Our results provide a frequency-domain lens that unifies classical and quantum learning dynamics, clarifies the role of noise in shaping trainability, and guides the design of noise-resilient quantum neural networks."

This scenario reveals a conceptually novel collective-light-collective-matter interaction, realizable when a timed-Dicke state~(TDS) of subwavelength emitters couples to a slow, delocalized surface-plasmon mode, forming a hybridized plasmon-polariton~(HPP). The HPP acquires its directionality from the TDS via momentum matching. It also exhibits plasmonic characteristics, with excitation frequencies following the surface-plasmon dispersion relation. We obtain a Rabi oscillation and a long-time decay that describe the HPP and use them to reveal weak- and strong-coupling regimes through the emergence of normal-mode splitting. By performing a finite-time Lyapunov-exponent analysis, we show that the HPP also exhibits instantaneous decay and identify three distinct decay regimes: early-time rapid, transient-time oscillatory, and long-time classical. Finally, by analyzing the emission spectrum, we observe an anticrossing of the peak doublets~(a feature also seen in cavity QED setups) which originates from quantum vacuum effects and the resulting non-Markovian HPP evolution in our WQED."

The potential applications of this technology have been widely explored, and extensive research over the past decades has been dedicated to developing scalable quantum computers. However, the question of the energetic performance of quantum computation has only gained attention more recently, and its importance is now recognized. In fact, quantum computers can only be a viable alternative if their energy cost scales favorably, and some research has shown that there is even a potential quantum energy advantage. Rydberg atoms have emerged recently as one of the most promising platforms to implement a large-scale quantum computer, with significant advances made in recent years. This work aims at contributing first steps to understand the energy efficiency of this platform, namely by investigating the energy consumption of the different elements of a Rydberg atom quantum computer. First, an experimental implementation of the Quantum Phase Estimation algorithm is analyzed, and an estimation of the energetic cost of executing this algorithm is calculated. Then, a potential scaling of the energy cost of performing the Quantum Fourier Transform with Rydberg atoms is derived. This analysis facilitates a comparison of the energy consumption of different elements within a Rydberg atom quantum computer, from the preparation of the atoms to the execution of the algorithm, and the measurement of the final state, enabling the evaluation of the energy expenditure of the Rydberg platform and the identification of potential improvements. Finally, we used the Quantum Fourier Transform as an energetic benchmark, comparing the scaling we obtained to that of the execution of the Discrete Fourier Transform in two state-of-the-art classical supercomputers."

    "abstract": "This paper deals with the interactions of waves governed by a non-linear dispersive Boussinesq type system with the vertical displacement of a cylindrical floating structure in an axisymmetric without swirl situation. The Boussinesq regime is a good approximation of free surface Euler's equations when the non-linear parameter and the shallowness parameter are small. The vertical motion of the floating body is governed by the Newton equation. The full coupled wave-structure interaction problem under consideration is reduced to a boundary problem. The boundary condition satisfied by the discharge is given in terms of the vertical displacement of the floating cylinder. The latter is calculated using an ODE, which requires knowledge of the trace of the surface elevation and its second-time derivative. We use the dispersion in order to exhibit a hidden second order ODE on the trace of the surface elevation. This finally allows us to rewrite the waves-structure interaction problem as a system of non-local conservative PDEs plus bounded radial terms with a dispersive boundary layer, combined with an ODE at the boundary. This is what we call the Augmented formulation. Afterwards we showed that this formulation is well-posed with two different methods. Finally, we study the return to equilibrium situation in the linear regime. In particular, we improved previous results on the explicit time decay. We showed that the center mass of the floating body cannot converge to its equilibrium faster than $\\mathcal{O}(t^{-1/2})$ in 2D without viscosity and faster than $\\mathcal{O}(t^{-3/2})$ with viscosity."

To address common issues in GAN-based augmentation such as mode collapse and semantic drift, ToxiGAN introduces a two-step directional training strategy and leverages LLM-generated neutral texts as semantic ballast. Unlike prior work that treats LLMs as static generators, our approach dynamically selects neutral exemplars to provide balanced guidance. Toxic samples are explicitly optimized to diverge from these exemplars, reinforcing class-specific contrastive signals. Experiments on four hate speech benchmarks show that ToxiGAN achieves the strongest average performance in both macro-F1 and hate-F1, consistently outperforming traditional and LLM-based augmentation methods. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further confirm the benefits of semantic ballast and directional training in enhancing classifier robustness."

For this, we have estimated the Hubble parameter, the effective equation of state parameter ($ω^{eff}$), and the potential of the scalar field as a function of time using equation $H = W(ψ)$. The graphical representation of the potential function $V(ψ)$ with respect to cosmic time t is described. This study explores the dynamical properties of a Bianchi Type-I universe by utilizing Bayesian statistical techniques to constrain the model parameters and evaluate the viability of anisotropic cosmology under extended matter-geometry couplings. Also, we have applied the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) mechanism on the derived $H(z)$ model by using observational Hubble data (OHD), the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) dataset, and the Pantheon dataset. From the confidence-level contours and best-fit parameter values obtained, along with the corresponding reduced $χ^{2}$, it is evident that the model aligns strongly with observational data, demonstrating statistical stability and consistency in describing late-time cosmic acceleration. Likewise, the error analyses presented in this research, including a comparison between the $Λ$CDM cosmology and the reconstructed $H(z)$ model, confirm the model's compatibility with current observations by yielding a reliable and accurate account of the universe's expansion history."

The Digital Twin is intended to support the development and rigorous human-in-the-loop evaluation of AI agents for Air Traffic Control (ATC), providing a virtual representation of real-world airspace that enables safe exploration of higher levels of ATC automation. This paper makes three significant contributions: firstly, we demonstrate how historical and live operational data may be combined with a probabilistic, physics-informed machine learning model of aircraft performance to reproduce real-world traffic scenarios, while accurately reflecting the level of uncertainty inherent in ATC. Secondly, we develop a structured assurance case, following the Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance framework, to provide quantitative evidence for the Digital Twin's accuracy and fidelity. This is crucial to building trust in this novel technology within this safety-critical domain. Thirdly, we describe how the Digital Twin forms a unified environment for agent testing and evaluation. This includes fast-time execution (up to x200 real-time), a standardised Python-based ``gym'' interface that supports a range of AI agent designs, and a suite of quantitative metrics for assessing performance. Crucially, the framework facilitates competency-based assessment of AI agents by qualified Air Traffic Control Officers through a Human Machine Interface. We also outline further applications and future extensions of the Digital Twin architecture."

    "abstract": "Population-scale agent-based simulations of the opioid epidemic help evaluate intervention strategies and overdose outcomes in heterogeneous communities and provide estimates of localized treatment effects, which support the design of locally-tailored policies for precision public health. However, it is prohibitively costly to run simulations of all treatment conditions in all communities because the number of possible treatments grows exponentially with the number of interventions and levels at which they are applied. To address this need efficiently, we develop a metamodel framework, whereby treatment outcomes are modeled using a response function whose coefficients are learned through Gaussian process regression (GPR) on locally-contextualized covariates. We apply this framework to efficiently estimate treatment effects on overdose deaths in Pennsylvania counties. In contrast to classical designs such as fractional factorial design or Latin hypercube sampling, our approach leverages spatial correlations and posterior uncertainty to sequentially sample the most informative counties and treatment conditions. Using a calibrated agent-based opioid epidemic model, informed by county-level overdose mortality and baseline dispensing rate data for different treatments, we obtained county-level estimates of treatment effects on overdose deaths per 100,000 population for all treatment conditions in Pennsylvania, achieving approximately 5% average relative error using one-tenth the number of simulation runs required for exhaustive evaluation. Our bi-level framework provides a computationally efficient approach to decision support for policy makers, enabling rapid evaluation of alternative resource-allocation strategies to mitigate the opioid epidemic in local communities. The same analytical framework can be applied to guide precision public health interventions in other epidemic settings."

SC has been successful in diverse applications, but existing methods typically treat the ordering of pre-intervention time indices interchangeable. This invariance means they may not fully take advantage of temporal structure when strong trends are present. We propose Time-Aware Synthetic Control (TASC), which employs a state-space model with a constant trend while preserving a low-rank structure of the signal. TASC uses the Kalman filter and Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother: it first fits a generative time-series model with expectation-maximization and then performs counterfactual inference. We evaluate TASC on both simulated and real-world datasets, including policy evaluation and sports prediction. Our results suggest that TASC offers advantages in settings with strong temporal trends and high levels of observation noise."

PFEM consists of a physics informed pretraining stage and an optional finetuning stage. In the pretraining stage, a neural operator based on the Transolver architecture is trained solely from governing partial differential equations, without relying on labeled solution data. The model operates directly on unstructured point clouds, jointly encoding geometric information, material properties, and boundary conditions, and produces physically consistent initial solutions with extremely high computational efficiency. PDE constraints are enforced through explicit finite element, based differentiation, avoiding the overhead associated with automatic differentiation. In the fine-tuning stage, the pretrained prediction is used as an initial guess for conventional FEM solvers, preserving their accuracy, convergence guarantees, and extrapolation capability while substantially reducing the number of iterations required to reach a prescribed tolerance. PFEM is validated on a broad range of benchmark problems, including linear elasticity and nonlinear hyperelasticity with complex geometries, heterogeneous materials, and arbitrary boundary conditions. Numerical results demonstrate strong generalization in the pretraining stage with relative errors on the order of 1\\%, and speedups of up to one order of magnitude in the fine-tuning stage compared to FEM with zero initial guesses."

Such multi-dimensional, heterogeneous data occurs mostly in today's industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), where real-time detection of anomalies is critical to prevent impending failures and resolve them in a timely manner. However, existing anomaly detection methods often fall short of effectively coping with the complexity and dynamism of multi-dimensional data streams in IIoT. In this paper, we propose an adaptive method for detecting anomalies in IIoT streaming data utilizing a multi-source prediction model and concept drift adaptation. The proposed anomaly detection algorithm merges a prediction model into a novel drift adaptation method resulting in accurate and efficient anomaly detection that exhibits improved scalability. Our trace-driven evaluations indicate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods by achieving up to an 89.71% accuracy (in terms of Area under the Curve (AUC)) while meeting the given efficiency and scalability requirements."

In this first paper, we examine the geometry from the perspective of a foliation by spherical hypersurfaces. Using the rigging technique, we first define a local frame adapted to these slices and reconstruct the geometry and dynamics fully. We clarify the connection of the frame adapted to constant-radius slices, to the Kodama vector and Misner-Sharp energy. Through frame transformations, we then show that the gravitational dynamics in a general foliation-adapted frame can be interpreted as hydrodynamics, i.e., geometro-hydrodynamics: the Einstein equations exhibit the gravitational analogs of the Euler and Young-Laplace equations, and the spacetime can be viewed as the worldvolume of a concentric stack of \"gravitational bubbles\" -- spherical collective modes with the Misner-Sharp energy density and a geometric pressure. We apply this framework to apparent horizons and study the dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate that a similar geometro-hydrodynamic picture holds in Lovelock gravity. These results provide a fresh perspective on this class of spacetimes and lay the foundation for understanding their thermodynamic properties."

Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at capturing spatial-temporal dependencies in sensor data, their black-box nature and the limited work on graph-based explainable models for water networks hinder practical adoption. We propose an explainable GNN framework that integrates mutual information to identify critical network regions and fuzzy logic to provide clear, rule-based explanations for node classification tasks. After benchmarking several GNN architectures, we selected the generalized graph convolution network (GENConv) for its superior performance and developed a fuzzy-enhanced variant that offers intuitive explanations for classified leak locations. Our fuzzy graph neural network (FGENConv) achieved Graph F1 scores of 0.889 for detection and 0.814 for localization, slightly below the crisp GENConv 0.938 and 0.858, respectively. Yet it compensates by providing spatially localized, fuzzy rule-based explanations. By striking the right balance between precision and explainability, the proposed fuzzy network could enable hydraulic engineers to validate predicted leak locations, conserve human resources, and optimize maintenance strategies.

We identify a novel market failure: vertical tacit collusion, where platforms controlling rankings and sellers controlling product descriptions independently learn to exploit documented AI cognitive biases. Using multi-agent simulation calibrated to empirical measurements of large language model biases, we show that joint exploitation produces consumer harm more than double what would occur if strategies were independent. This super-additive harm arises because platform ranking determines which products occupy bias-triggering positions while seller manipulation determines conversion rates. Unlike horizontal algorithmic collusion, vertical tacit collusion requires no coordination and evades antitrust detection because harm emerges from aligned incentives rather than agreement. Our findings identify an urgent regulatory gap as AI shopping agents reach mainstream adoption."

    "abstract": "Fine-Grained Domain Generalization (FGDG) presents greater challenges than conventional domain generalization due to the subtle inter-class differences and relatively pronounced intra-class variations inherent in fine-grained recognition tasks. Under domain shifts, the model becomes overly sensitive to fine-grained cues, leading to the suppression of critical features and a significant drop in performance. Cognitive studies suggest that humans classify objects by leveraging both common and specific attributes, enabling accurate differentiation between fine-grained categories. However, current deep learning models have yet to incorporate this mechanism effectively. Inspired by this mechanism, we propose Concept-Feature Structuralized Generalization (CFSG). This model explicitly disentangles both the concept and feature spaces into three structured components: common, specific, and confounding segments. To mitigate the adverse effects of varying degrees of distribution shift, we introduce an adaptive mechanism that dynamically adjusts the proportions of common, specific, and confounding components. In the final prediction, explicit weights are assigned to each pair of components. Extensive experiments on three single-source benchmark datasets demonstrate that CFSG achieves an average performance improvement of 9.87% over baseline models and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by an average of 3.08%. Additionally, explainability analysis validates that CFSG effectively integrates multi-granularity structured knowledge and confirms that feature structuralization facilitates the emergence of concept structuralization."

We conduct an initial stress-test of these claims by replicating their main results with open-source SAEs for Llama 3.1. While we successfully reproduce basic feature extraction and steering capabilities, our investigation suggests that major caution is warranted regarding the generalizability of these claims. We find that feature steering exhibits substantial fragility, with sensitivity to layer selection, steering magnitude, and context. We observe non-standard activation behavior and demonstrate the difficulty to distinguish thematically similar features from one another. While SAE-based interpretability produces compelling demonstrations in selected cases, current methods often fall short of the systematic reliability required for safety-critical applications. This suggests a necessary shift in focus from prioritizing interpretability of internal representations toward reliable prediction and control of model output.

In contrast, we observe that their corresponding base LLMs often remain well-calibrated. This naturally motivates us to calibrate PoLLM confidence using the base LLM as a reference. This work proposes two ways to achieve this. A straightforward solution, BaseCal-ReEval, evaluates PoLLM's responses by feeding them into the base LLM to get average probabilities as confidence. While effective, this approach introduces additional inference overhead. To address this, we propose BaseCal-Proj, which trains a lightweight projection to map the final-layer hidden states of PoLLMs back to those of their base LLMs. These projected states are then processed by the base LLM's output layer to derive base-calibrated confidence for PoLLM's responses. Notably, BaseCal is an unsupervised, plug-and-play solution that operates without human labels or LLM modifications. Experiments across five datasets and three LLM families demonstrate the effectiveness of BaseCal, reducing Expected Calibration Error (ECE) by an average of 42.90\\% compared to the best unsupervised baselines."

Using an exact symplectic realization, these invariants are lifted and projected onto a contact manifold, yielding a completely integrable contact Hamiltonian system in terms of dissipated quantities and a Jacobi-commutative algebra of observables. On the quantum side, we introduce a class of contact-compatible Lindblad generators: GKSL evolutions whose dissipative part preserves a commutative $C^\\ast$-subalgebra generated by the quantizations of the classical dissipated quantities, and whose Hamiltonian part admits an Egorov-type semiclassical limit to the contact dynamics. This construction provides a mathematical mechanism compatible with the semiclassical limit for pure dephasing, compatible with integrability and contact dissipation. An explicit Euler-top-type Poisson-Lie pencil, inspired by deformed Euler top models, is developed as a fully worked-out example illustrating the resulting bi-Lindblad structure and its semiclassical behavior."

    "abstract": "Autonomous landing on mobile platforms is crucial for extending quadcopter operational flexibility, yet conventional methods are often too inefficient for highly dynamic scenarios. The core limitation lies in the prevalent ``track-then-descend'' paradigm, which treats the platform as a passive target and forces the quadcopter to perform complex, sequential maneuvers. This paper challenges that paradigm by introducing a bi-directional cooperative landing framework that redefines the roles of the vehicle and the platform. The essential innovation is transforming the problem from a single-agent tracking challenge into a coupled system optimization. Our key insight is that the mobile platform is not merely a target, but an active agent in the landing process. It proactively tilts its surface to create an optimal, stable terminal attitude for the approaching quadcopter. This active cooperation fundamentally breaks the sequential model by parallelizing the alignment and descent phases. Concurrently, the quadcopter's planning pipeline focuses on generating a time-optimal and dynamically feasible trajectory that minimizes energy consumption. This bi-directional coordination allows the system to execute the recovery in an agile manner, characterized by aggressive trajectory tracking and rapid state synchronization within transient windows. The framework's effectiveness, validated in dynamic scenarios, significantly improves the efficiency, precision, and robustness of autonomous quadrotor recovery in complex and time-constrained missions."

We find that Sommerfeld and bound-state effects can lead to order one corrections to the constraints on the DM mass in the coannihilating regime, with the precise magnitude depending on the specific model realization. In addition we provide SE+BSF4DM, an intuitive and easy to use add-on to micrOMEGAs, allowing for an automated inclusion of these effects for a generic $t$-channel Dark Matter Model, which is publicly available on Github."

    "abstract": "DNA language models have emerged as powerful tools for decoding the complex language of DNA sequences. However, the performance of these models is heavily affected by their tokenization strategy, i.e., a method used to parse DNA sequences into a shorter sequence of chunks. In this work, we propose DNACHUNKER, which integrates a learnable dynamic DNA tokenization mechanism and is trained as a masked language model. Adopting the dynamic chunking procedure proposed by H-Net, our model learns to segment sequences into variable-length chunks. This dynamic chunking offers two key advantages: it's resilient to shifts and mutations in the DNA, and it allocates more detail to important functional areas. We demonstrate the performance of DNACHUNKER by training it on the human reference genome (HG38) and testing it on the Nucleotide Transformer and Genomic benchmarks. Further ablative experiments reveal that DNACHUNKER learns tokenization that grasps biological grammar and uses smaller chunks to preserve detail in important functional elements such as promoters and exons, while using larger chunks for repetitive, redundant regions."

    "abstract": "Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) effectively supports single-hop question answering with large language models but faces significant limitations in multi-hop question answering tasks, which require combining evidence from multiple documents. Existing chunk-based retrieval often provides irrelevant and logically incoherent context, leading to incomplete evidence chains and incorrect reasoning during answer generation. To address these challenges, we propose SentGraph, a sentence-level graph-based RAG framework that explicitly models fine-grained logical relationships between sentences for multi-hop question answering. Specifically, we construct a hierarchical sentence graph offline by first adapting Rhetorical Structure Theory to distinguish nucleus and satellite sentences, and then organizing them into topic-level subgraphs with cross-document entity bridges. During online retrieval, SentGraph performs graph-guided evidence selection and path expansion to retrieve fine-grained sentence-level evidence. Extensive experiments on four multi-hop question answering benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SentGraph, validating the importance of explicitly modeling sentence-level logical dependencies for multi-hop reasoning."

    "abstract": "In many fairness and distribution robustness problems, one has access to labeled data from multiple source distributions yet the test data may come from an arbitrary member or a mixture of them. We study the problem of constructing a conformal prediction set that is uniformly valid across multiple, heterogeneous distributions, in the sense that no matter which distribution the test point is from, the coverage of the prediction set is guaranteed to exceed a pre-specified level. We first propose a max-p aggregation scheme that delivers finite-sample, multi-distribution coverage given any conformity scores associated with each distribution. Upon studying several efficiency optimization programs subject to uniform coverage, we prove the optimality and tightness of our aggregation scheme, and propose a general algorithm to learn conformity scores that lead to efficient prediction sets after the aggregation under standard conditions. We discuss how our framework relates to group-wise distributionally robust optimization, sub-population shift, fairness, and multi-source learning. In synthetic and real-data experiments, our method delivers valid worst-case coverage across multiple distributions while greatly reducing the set size compared with naively applying max-p aggregation to single-source conformity scores, and can be comparable in size to single-source prediction sets with popular, standard conformity scores."

The tables span metallicities from 0.31 to 50 times solar, temperatures from 100 - 6000 K, and pressures from 1e-6 - 1e5 bar, thereby covering a wider parameter space than previous data sets. Our calculations employ the latest molecular and atomic line lists and pressure-broadening treatments, and include contributions from collision-induced absorption, free electrons, and scattering processes. We further provide cloudy mean opacity tables that account for cloud particle extinction across a range of particle sizes and capture the sequential removal of condensates as the gas cools. We benchmark our cloud-free tables against widely used opacity tables and find significant relative differences, exceeding 100% in Rosseland mean opacities at T \\gtrsim 3000 K due to the inclusion of additional short-wavelength absorbers. Differences in Planck mean opacities at high temperatures are even larger, in some cases exceeding two orders of magnitude, which is most likely driven by the inclusion of Ca, Mg, and Fe cross-sections and updated Na D and K I resonance line treatments. Cloud opacities substantially increase Rosseland mean opacities for T \\lesssim 2800 K, while their effect on Planck mean opacities is weaker. We also discuss limitations of our mean opacities at high pressures, where non-ideal effects become important. This work provides improved cloud-free mean opacity tables for giant planets, as well as the first publicly available cloudy mean opacity tables, which will enable more realistic modeling of their atmospheres and interiors."

Existing methods typically learn invariance from multi-view observations at the scene level, but such approaches rely on visual appearance and fail to incorporate the physical dynamics essential for robust generalization. We propose View-Invariant Latent Action (VILA), which models a latent action capturing transition patterns across trajectories to learn view-invariant representations grounded in physical dynamics. VILA aligns these latent actions across viewpoints using an action-guided objective based on ground-truth action sequences. Experiments in both simulation and the real world show that VILA-based policies generalize effectively to unseen viewpoints and transfer well to new tasks, establishing VILA as a strong pretraining framework that improves robustness and downstream learning performance."

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a key paradigm for reducing factual hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), yet little is known about how the order of retrieved documents affects model behavior. We empirically show that under Top-5 retrieval with the gold document included, LLM answers vary substantially across permutations of the retrieved set, even when the gold document is fixed in the first position. This reveals a previously underexplored sensitivity to retrieval permutations. Although robust RAG methods primarily focus on enhancing LLM robustness to low-quality retrieval and mitigating positional bias to distribute attention fairly over long contexts, neither approach directly addresses permutation sensitivity. In this paper, we propose Stable-RAG, which exploits permutation sensitivity estimation to mitigate permutation-induced hallucinations. Stable-RAG runs the generator under multiple retrieval orders, clusters hidden states, and decodes from a cluster-center representation that captures the dominant reasoning pattern. It then uses these reasoning results to align hallucinated outputs toward the correct answer, encouraging the model to produce consistent and accurate predictions across document permutations. Experiments on three QA datasets show that Stable-RAG significantly improves answer accuracy, reasoning consistency and robust generalization across datasets, retrievers, and input lengths compared with baselines."

Real-world audio deepfake detection (ADD) therefore requires all-type detectors that generalize across heterogeneous audio and provide interpretable decisions. Given the strong multi-task generalization ability of ALLMs, we first investigate their performance on all-type ADD under both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). However, SFT using only binary real/fake labels tends to reduce the model to a black-box classifier, sacrificing interpretability. Meanwhile, vanilla RFT under sparse supervision is prone to reward hacking and can produce hallucinated, ungrounded rationales. To address this, we propose an automatic annotation and polishing pipeline that constructs Frequency-Time structured chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, producing ~340K cold-start demonstrations. Building on CoT data, we propose Frequency Time-Group Relative Policy Optimization (FT-GRPO), a two-stage training paradigm that cold-starts ALLMs with SFT and then applies GRPO under rule-based frequency-time constraints. Experiments demonstrate that FT-GRPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on all-type ADD while producing interpretable, FT-grounded rationales. The data and code are available online."

However, the physics of Lorentz violation (LV), associated with specific operators, can influence these polarization characteristics. This study employs the Boltzmann equation within the framework of the Standard Model Extension (SME) to explore how the background LV tensor $ K_{AF} $ can induce circular polarization in CMB radiation. By computing the transformation of linear polarization into circular polarization and utilizing the Faraday conversion angle, we derive a bound for $ K_{AF} $ on the order of $ 10^{-41} \\, \\text{GeV} $, aligning with recent findings. Additionally, we consider the total pure photon terms within the SME, demonstrating that LV in the presence of scalar perturbations can also generate cosmic birefringence (CB) in the CMB radiation. Through analysis of best-fitting CB angles, we establish a more stringent bound of approximately $ 10^{-32} \\, \\text{GeV} $ for $ K_{F} $."

    "abstract": "Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) systems often exhibit a perceived preference for high-resource languages, particularly English, resulting in the widespread adoption of English pivoting. While prior studies attribute this advantage to the superior English-centric capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we find that such measurements are significantly distorted by structural priors inherent in evaluation benchmarks. Specifically, we identify exposure bias and a gold availability prior-both driven by the disproportionate concentration of resources in English-as well as cultural priors rooted in topic locality, as factors that hinder accurate assessment of genuine language preference. To address these biases, we propose DeLP (Debiased Language Preference), a calibrated metric designed to explicitly factor out these structural confounds. Our analysis using DeLP reveals that the previously reported English preference is largely a byproduct of evidence distribution rather than an inherent model bias. Instead, we find that retrievers fundamentally favor monolingual alignment between the query and the document language. Building on this insight, we introduce DELTA (DEbiased Language preference-guided Text Augmentation), a lightweight and efficient mRAG framework that strategically leverages monolingual alignment to optimize cross-lingual retrieval and generation. Experimental results demonstrate that DELTA consistently outperforms English pivoting and mRAG baselines across diverse languages."

Though deep learning models have excellent fault detection capabilities, almost all methods either are too large and heavy for edge computing devices or involve biased estimation of accuracy due to ineffective learning techniques. We propose a new solar panel fault detection model called HybridSolarNet. It integrates EfficientNet-B0 with Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). We implemented it on the Kaggle Solar Panel Images competition dataset with a tight split-before-augmentation protocol. It avoids leakage in accuracy estimation. We introduced focal loss and cosine annealing. Ablation analysis validates that accuracy boosts due to added benefits from CBAM (+1.53%) and that there are benefits from recognition of classes with imbalanced samples via focal loss. Overall average accuracy on 5-fold stratified cross-validation experiments on the given competition dataset topped 92.37% +/- 0.41 and an F1-score of 0.9226 +/- 0.39 compared to baselines like VGG19, requiring merely 16.3 MB storage, i.e., 32 times less. Its inference speed measured at 54.9 FPS with GPU support makes it a successful candidate for real-time UAV implementation. Moreover, visualization obtained from Grad-CAM illustrates that HybridSolarNet focuses on actual locations instead of irrelevant ones."

However, the curse of dimensionality means this comes at a high computational cost when using standard interpolation methods across grids of stellar models. Furthermore, without a rigorous treatment of random uncertainties in grid-based modelling, it is not possible to address systematic errors in stellar models. We present PITCHFORK -- a multilayer perceptron neural network with a branching architecture capable of rapid emulation of both classical stellar observables and individual asteroseismic oscillation modes of solar-like oscillators. PITCHFORK can predict the classical observables $T_{\\text{eff}}$, $L$, and $\\left[\\mathrm{Fe}/\\mathrm{H}\\right]$ with precisions of $5.88\\,\\text{K}$, $0.014\\,\\text{L}_{\\odot}$, and $0.001\\,\\text{dex}$, respectively, and can predict 35 individual radial mode frequencies with a uniform precision of $0.02$ per cent. PITCHFORK is coupled to a vectorised Bayesian inference pipeline to return well-sampled and fully marginalised posterior distributions. We validate our rigorous treatment of the random uncertainties -- including the asteroseismic surface effect -- in an extensive hare-and-hounds exercise. We also demonstrate our ability to infer the stellar properties of benchmark stars -- namely, the Sun and the binary stars 16 Cygni A and B.

To mitigate this problem, we show that script is linearly encoded in the activation space of multilingual speech models, and that modifying activations at inference time enables direct control over output script. We find the addition of such script vectors to activations at test time can induce script change even in unconventional language-script pairings (e.g. Italian in Cyrillic and Japanese in Latin script). We apply this approach to inducing post-hoc control over the script of speech recognition output, where we observe competitive performance across all model sizes of Whisper."

We propose a novel framework that adapts gradient ascent to LLMs, enabling targeted prompt discovery. In specific, we propose two methods, RESGA and SAEGA, that both optimize randomly initialized prompts to achieve better aligned representation with an identified persona direction. We introduce fluent gradient ascent to control the fluency of discovered persona steering prompts. We demonstrate RESGA and SAEGA's effectiveness across Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, and Gemma 3 for steering three different personas,sycophancy, hallucination, and myopic reward. Crucially, on sycophancy, our automatically discovered prompts achieve significant improvement (49.90% compared with 79.24%).

The study aims to develop a robust regression model that can generalize across domains by training on 60 second labeled sequences of 1 Hz surface drilling data to predict the SSI. The model is tested in wells that are different from those used during training. To fine-tune the model architecture, a grid search approach is employed to optimize key hyperparameters. A comparative analysis of the Adversarial Domain Generalization (ADG), Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) and baseline models is presented, along with an evaluation of the effectiveness of transfer learning (TL) in improving model performance. The ADG and IRM models achieve performance improvements of 10% and 8%, respectively, over the baseline model. Most importantly, severe events are detected 60% of the time, against 20% for the baseline model. Overall, the results indicate that both ADG and IRM models surpass the baseline, with the ADG model exhibiting a slight advantage over the IRM model. Additionally, applying TL to a pre-trained model further improves performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of domain generalization approaches in drilling applications, with ADG emerging as the most effective approach."

Calibrated with nano-indentation experiments, the mechanical model provides stress-strain predictions fully consistent with experimental data. On assemblies up to 100 particles, simulations reveal three calendering regimes along compression: particle rearrangement, moderatepressure fracturing, and complete crushing. The model shows the strong sensitivity of the electrode microstructure to the calendering pressure level, and can thus be used as a guidance in the multi-criteria optimization of the manufacturing process."

Conventional optimization-based controllers can enforce physical constraints, but they struggle to produce feasible solutions quickly when many obstacles are present. Diffusion models can generate diverse trajectories around obstacles, yet prior approaches lacked a general and efficient way to condition them on scene structure. In this paper, we show that combining diffusion-based warm-starting conditioned with a latent object-centric representation of the scene and with a collision-aware model predictive controller (MPC) yields reliable and efficient motion generation under strict time limits. Our approach conditions a diffusion transformer on the system state, task, and surroundings, using an object-centric slot attention mechanism to provide a compact obstacle representation suitable for control. The sampled trajectories are refined by an optimal control problem that enforces rigid-body dynamics and signed-distance collision constraints, producing feasible motions in real time. On benchmark tasks, this hybrid method achieved markedly higher success rates and lower latency than sampling-based planners or either component alone. Real-robot experiments with a torque-controlled Panda confirm reliable and safe execution with MPC."

To address this challenge, we propose SimRPD, a three-stage framework for training recruitment proactive dialogue agents. First, we develop a high-fidelity user simulator to synthesize large-scale conversational data through multi-turn online dialogue. Then we introduce a multi-dimensional evaluation framework based on Chain-of-Intention (CoI) to comprehensively assess the simulator and effectively select high-quality data, incorporating both global-level and instance-level metrics.

    "abstract": "Stochastic contextual bandits are fundamental for sequential decision-making but pose significant challenges for existing neural network-based algorithms, particularly when scaling to quantum neural networks (QNNs) due to issues such as massive over-parameterization, computational instability, and the barren plateau phenomenon. This paper introduces the Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel-Upper Confidence Bound (QNTK-UCB) algorithm, a novel algorithm that leverages the Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel (QNTK) to address these limitations. By freezing the QNN at a random initialization and utilizing its static QNTK as a kernel for ridge regression, QNTK-UCB bypasses the unstable training dynamics inherent in explicit parameterized quantum circuit training while fully exploiting the unique quantum inductive bias. For a time horizon $T$ and $K$ actions, our theoretical analysis reveals a significantly improved parameter scaling of $Ω((TK)^3)$ for QNTK-UCB, a substantial reduction compared to $Ω((TK)^8)$ required by classical NeuralUCB algorithms for similar regret guarantees. Empirical evaluations on non-linear synthetic benchmarks and quantum-native variational quantum eigensolver tasks demonstrate QNTK-UCB's superior sample efficiency in low-data regimes. This work highlights how the inherent properties of QNTK provide implicit regularization and a sharper spectral decay, paving the way for achieving ``quantum advantage'' in online learning."

    "abstract": "Solid-state batteries (SSB) are emerging as next-generation electrochemical energy storage devices. Achieving high energy density in SSB relies on solid polymer electrolytes (SPE) that are electrochemically stable against both lithium metal and high-potential positive electrodes, two conditions that are difficult to satisfy without chemical degradation. In this work, molecular dynamics simulations are employed to investigate the relationship between structure and dynamics in carbonate-based SPE composed of polypropylene carbonate and lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF$_6$), at salt concentrations ranging from 0.32 to 1.21 mol$/$kg. Structural properties are analyzed under ambient pressure at the experimentally relevant temperature $T = 353$ K. Since the slow dynamical processes governing ion transport in these systems are inaccessible to direct molecular dynamics, transport properties are simulated at elevated temperatures up to 900 K and extrapolated to $T = 353$ K using Arrhenius behavior. The results reveal strong ionic correlations, a limited fraction of free ions, and a predominance of negatively charged clusters, especially at high salt concentration. At high temperature, the self-diffusion coefficient of Li$^+$ exceeds that of PF$_6^-$ due to weaker Li$^+$-carbonate and ion-ion interactions. However, at $T = 353$ K, Li$^+$ mobility becomes lower than that of the anion, consistent with typical experimental observations in SPE. As expected, the ionic conductivity $σ$ increases with temperature, while at $T = 353$ K it exhibits a maximum for salt concentrations between 1.0 and 1.1 mol$/$kg. Overall, the estimated physico-chemical parameters highlight the key role of ion correlations in SPE and suggest strategies to optimize electrolyte performance. The Arrhenius extrapolation approach used here provides valuable insight into ion transport mechanisms in solid polymer electrolytes."

However, as interactions progress, repository context must be continuously preserved and updated to integrate newly validated information. Meanwhile, the expanding session history increases cognitive burden, often leading to forgetting and the reintroduction of previously resolved errors. Existing memory management approaches show promise but remain limited by natural language-centric representations. To overcome these limitations, we propose CodeMEM, an AST-guided dynamic memory management system tailored for repository-level iterative code generation. Specifically, CodeMEM introduces the Code Context Memory component that dynamically maintains and updates repository context through AST-guided LLM operations, along with the Code Session Memory that constructs a code-centric representation of interaction history and explicitly detects and mitigates forgetting through AST-based analysis. Experimental results on the instruction-following benchmark CodeIF-Bench and the code generation benchmark CoderEval demonstrate that CodeMEM achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving instruction following by 12.2% for the current turn and 11.5% for the session level, and reducing interaction rounds by 2-3, while maintaining competitive inference latency and token efficiency."

The material remains compliant during normal interaction but rapidly stiffens under impact, absorbing and dissipating fall-induced forces. Physics-based simulations guide protector placement and thickness and enable learning of active fall policies. Applied to a 42 kg life-size humanoid, the protector markedly reduces peak impact and allows repeated falls without hardware damage, including drops from 3 m and tumbles down long staircases. Across diverse scenarios, the approach improves robot robustness and environmental safety. By uniting responsive materials, structural co-design, and learning-based control, this work advances interact-safe, industry-ready humanoid robots."

However, DP adopts a context-free definition that operates independently of the data-generating distribution. In this paper, we revisit the privacy analysis of the Laplace mechanism through the lens of pointwise maximal leakage (PML). We demonstrate that the distribution-agnostic definition of the DP framework often mandates excessive noise. To address this, we incorporate an assumption about the prior distribution by lower-bounding the probability of any single record belonging to any specific class. With this assumption, we derive a tight, context-aware leakage bound for general linear queries, and prove that our derived bound is strictly tighter than the standard DP guarantee and converges to the DP guarantee as this probability lower bound approaches zero. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that by exploiting this prior knowledge, the required noise scale can be reduced while maintaining privacy guarantees."

Specifically, we propose a Cross-modal Graph Enhancement (CGE) module that synthesizes RGB semantics and depth geometric within a heterogeneous graph to form a unified guidance signal. Furthermore, we design an Anchor-Guided Refinement (AGR) module. To counteract the inherent information decay in feature hierarchies, AGR forges a global anchor and establishes direct non-local pathways to broadcast this guidance from deep to shallow layers, ensuring precise and consistent segmentation. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that our proposed DGA-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art COD methods."

While extended user-engagement histories can improve the prediction of user interests, it is equally important to embed activity sequences from multiple sources to ensure freshness of user and ad-representations, following scaling law principles. In this paper, we present a novel three-dimensional framework for enhancing user-ad representations without increasing model inference or serving complexity. The first dimension examines the impact of incorporating diverse event sources, the second considers the benefits of longer user histories, and the third focuses on enriching data with additional event attributes and multi-modal embeddings. We assess the return on investment (ROI) of our source enrichment framework by comparing organic user engagement sources, such as content viewing, with ad-impression sources. The proposed method can boost the area under curve (AUC) and the slope of scaling curves for ad-impression sources by 1.56 to 2 times compared to organic usage sources even for short online-sequence lengths of 100 to 10K. Additionally, click-through rate (CTR) prediction improves by 0.56% AUC over the baseline production ad-recommendation system when using enriched ad-impression event sources, leading to improved sequence scaling resolutions for longer and offline user-ad representations."

However, compared with the commonly used Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining, IHC staining involves complex procedures and is both time-consuming and expensive, which limits its widespread clinical use. Virtual staining converts H&E images to IHC images, offering a cost-effective alternative to clinical IHC staining. Nevertheless, using adjacent slides as ground truth often results in weakly-paired data with spatial misalignment and local deformations, hindering effective supervised learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel topology-aware framework for H&E-to-IHC virtual staining. Specifically, we introduce a Topology-aware Consistency Matching (TACM) mechanism that employs graph contrastive learning and topological perturbations to learn robust matching patterns despite spatial misalignments, ensuring structural consistency. Furthermore, we propose a Topology-constrained Pathological Matching (TCPM) mechanism that aligns pathological positive regions based on node importance to enhance pathological consistency. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks across four staining tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior generation quality with higher clinical relevance."

We show that despite hardware advancements, all tested VST systems fail to match the dynamic range and adaptability of the naked eye. While high-end devices approach human performance in ideal lighting, they exhibit significant degradation in low-light conditions, particularly in contrast sensitivity and acuity. Our results map the physiological limitations of digital reality reconstruction, establishing a specific perceptual gap that defines the roadmap for achieving indistinguishable VST experiences."

Modern fiber positioner systems typically have overlapping patrol regions, resulting in the number of observable targets being highly dependent on the fiber assignment scheme. To maximize observable targets without fiber collisions, the algorithm proceeds in three steps. First, it assigns the maximum number of targets for a given field of view without considering any collisions between fiber positioners. Then, the fibers in collision are grouped, and the algorithm finds the optimal solution resolving the collision problem within each group. We compare the results from this new algorithm with those from a simple algorithm that assigns targets in descending order of their rank by considering collisions. As a result, we could increase the overall completeness of target assignments by 10% with this new algorithm in comparison with the case using the simple algorithm in a field with 150 fibers. Our new algorithm is designed for the All-sky SPECtroscopic survey of nearby galaxies (A-SPEC) based on the K-SPEC spectrograph system, but can also be applied to similar fiber-based systems with heavily overlapping fiber positioners."

    "abstract": "Accurate radio map (RM) construction is essential to enabling environment-aware and adaptive wireless communication. However, in future 6G scenarios characterized by high-speed network entities and fast-changing environments, it is very challenging to meet real-time requirements. Although generative diffusion models (DMs) can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with second-level delay, their iterative nature leads to prohibitive inference latency in delay-sensitive scenarios. In this paper, by uncovering a key structural property of diffusion processes: the latent midpoints remain highly consistent across semantically similar scenes, we propose RadioDiff-Flux, a novel two-stage latent diffusion framework that decouples static environmental modeling from dynamic refinement, enabling the reuse of precomputed midpoints to bypass redundant denoising. In particular, the first stage generates a coarse latent representation using only static scene features, which can be cached and shared across similar scenarios. The second stage adapts this representation to dynamic conditions and transmitter locations using a pre-trained model, thereby avoiding repeated early-stage computation. The proposed RadioDiff-Flux significantly reduces inference time while preserving fidelity. Experiment results show that RadioDiff-Flux can achieve up to 50 acceleration with less than 0.15% accuracy loss, demonstrating its practical utility for fast, scalable RM generation in future 6G networks."

To address these limitations, we propose the Hierarchical Preemptive Holistic Collaborative (Prollect) framework, which generalizes the Preemptive Holistic Collaborative System (PHCS) by decomposing the global coordination problem into topologically connected subspace optimizations. We formalize the system as a Hybrid Automaton and introduce a three-stage receding horizon mechanism (frozen execution, preliminary planning, proactive look-ahead windows) with explicit padding to prevent races between coordination dissemination and intent updates. Notably, we design a robust timing protocol with a mandatory Idle Buffer that acts as a dwell-time constraint to eliminate Zeno behaviors and ensure computational stability under jitter. Furthermore, we formalize a Shadow Agent protocol to guarantee seamless trajectory consistency across subspace boundaries, which we treat as an Input-to-State Stability (ISS) problem."

This refinement yields narrower prediction intervals while maintaining comparable coverage, though at the cost of slightly increased computational time. Both methods address key limitations of existing distributional conformal prediction approaches: they handle skewed distributions more effectively than Conformalized Quantile Regression, and they achieve substantially higher computational efficiency than Conformal Histogram Regression by eliminating the need for histogram construction.

Numerous studies have thus evaluated the reliability of their findings by comparing ICCs, however, they often failed to test statistical differences between ICCs or report confidence intervals. Relying solely on point estimates may preclude valid inference about population-level differences and compromise the reliability of conclusions. To address this issue, this study systematically reviewed the use of ICC in articles published in NeuroImage from 2022 to 2024, highlighting the prevalence of misreporting and misuse of ICCs. We further provide practical guidelines for conducting appropriate statistical inference on ICCs. For practitioners in this area, we introduce an online application for statistical testing and sample size estimation when utilizing ICCs. We recalculated confidence intervals and formally tested ICC values reported in the reviewed articles, thereby reassessing the original inferences. Our results demonstrate that exclusive reliance on point estimates could lead to unreliable or even misleading conclusions. Specifically, only two of the eleven reviewed articles provided unequivocally valid statistical inferences based on ICCs, whereas two articles failed to yield any valid inference at all, raising serious concerns about the replicability of findings in this field. These results underscore the urgent need for rigorous inferential frameworks when reporting and interpreting ICCs."

However, most existing approaches rely heavily on degradation-specific representations, often resulting in oversmoothing and artifacts. To address this, we propose ClearAIR, a novel AiOIR framework inspired by Human Visual Perception (HVP) and designed with a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine restoration strategy. First, leveraging the global priority of early HVP, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model for overall evaluation. Unlike conventional IQA, our method integrates cross-modal understanding to more accurately characterize complex, composite degradations. Building upon this overall assessment, we then introduce a region awareness and task recognition pipeline. A semantic cross-attention, leveraging semantic guidance unit, first produces coarse semantic prompts. Guided by this regional context, a degradation-aware module implicitly captures region-specific degradation characteristics, enabling more precise local restoration. Finally, to recover fine details, we propose an internal clue reuse mechanism. It operates in a self-supervised manner to mine and leverage the intrinsic information of the image itself, substantially enhancing detail restoration. Experimental results show that ClearAIR achieves superior performance across diverse synthetic and real-world datasets."

    "abstract": "Most membership inference attacks (MIAs) against Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on global signals, like average loss, to identify training data. This approach, however, dilutes the subtle, localized signals of memorization, reducing attack effectiveness. We challenge this global-averaging paradigm, positing that membership signals are more pronounced within localized contexts. We introduce WBC (Window-Based Comparison), which exploits this insight through a sliding window approach with sign-based aggregation. Our method slides windows of varying sizes across text sequences, with each window casting a binary vote on membership based on loss comparisons between target and reference models. By ensembling votes across geometrically spaced window sizes, we capture memorization patterns from token-level artifacts to phrase-level structures. Extensive experiments across eleven datasets demonstrate that WBC substantially outperforms established baselines, achieving higher AUC scores and 2-3 times improvements in detection rates at low false positive thresholds. Our findings reveal that aggregating localized evidence is fundamentally more effective than global averaging, exposing critical privacy vulnerabilities in fine-tuned LLMs."

To bridge this gap, we introduce Synapse (Synergistic Associative Processing Semantic Encoding), a unified memory architecture that transcends static vector similarity. Drawing from cognitive science, Synapse models memory as a dynamic graph where relevance emerges from spreading activation rather than pre-computed links. By integrating lateral inhibition and temporal decay, the system dynamically highlights relevant sub-graphs while filtering interference. We implement a Triple Hybrid Retrieval strategy that fuses geometric embeddings with activation-based graph traversal. Comprehensive evaluations on the LoCoMo benchmark show that Synapse significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in complex temporal and multi-hop reasoning tasks, offering a robust solution to the \"Contextual Tunneling\" problem.

Building on a knowledge distillation chain-style model, we introduce a code module to guide knowledge-graph exploration and incorporate code as part of the chain-of-thought prompt, forming an external knowledge input that provides more accurate and structured information to the model. Based on this design, we develop an improved knowledge distillation chain-style model and leverage it to analyze and constrain the reasoning process of LLMs, thereby improving inference accuracy. We empirically evaluate the proposed approach using GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.3 on multiple public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating code modules significantly enhances the model's ability to capture contextual information and effectively mitigates prompt-induced hallucinations. Specifically, HIT@1, HIT@3, and HIT@5 improve by 15.64%, 13.38%, and 13.28%, respectively. Moreover, the proposed method achieves HIT@1, HIT@3, and HIT@5 scores exceeding 95% across several evaluation settings. These results indicate that the proposed approach substantially reduces hallucination behavior while improving the accuracy and verifiability of large language models."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a foreground-aware dataset distillation method that enhances patch selection in a content-adaptive manner. With the rising computational cost of training large-scale deep models, dataset distillation has emerged as a promising approach for constructing compact synthetic datasets that retain the knowledge of their large original counterparts. However, traditional optimization-based methods often suffer from high computational overhead, memory constraints, and the generation of unrealistic, noise-like images with limited architectural generalization. Recent non-optimization methods alleviate some of these issues by constructing distilled data from real image patches, but the used rigid patch selection strategies can still discard critical information about the main objects. To solve this problem, we first leverage Grounded SAM2 to identify foreground objects and compute per-image foreground occupancy, from which we derive a category-wise patch decision threshold. Guided by these thresholds, we design a dynamic patch selection strategy that, for each image, either selects the most informative patch from multiple candidates or directly resizes the full image when the foreground dominates. This dual-path mechanism preserves more key information about the main objects while reducing redundant background content. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed method consistently improves distillation performance over existing approaches, producing more informative and representative distilled datasets and enhancing robustness across different architectures and image compositions."

Moreover, we demonstrate that learning signals can be derived from user simulator behavior in MultiSessionCollab to train agents to generate more comprehensive reflections and update their memory more effectively.

    "abstract": "Heat dissipation is ubiquitous in living systems, which constantly convert distinct forms of energy into each other. The transport of thermal energy in liquids and even within proteins is well understood but kinetic energy transfer across a heterogeneous molecular boundary provides additional challenges. Here, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations under steady-state conditions to analyze how a protein dissipates surplus thermal energy into the surrounding solvent. We specifically focus on collective degrees of freedom that govern the dynamics of the system from the diffusive regime to mid-infrared frequencies. Using a fully anharmonic analysis of molecular vibrations, we analyzed their vibrational spectra, temperatures, and heat transport efficiencies. We find that the most efficient energy transfer mechanisms are associated with solvent-mediated friction. However, this mechanism only applies to a small number of degrees of freedom of a protein. Instead, less efficient vibrational energy transfer in the far-infrared dominates heat transfer overall due to a large number of vibrations in this frequency range. A notable by-product of this work is a highly sensitive measure of deviations from energy equi-partition in equilibrium systems, which can be used to analyze non-ergodic properties."

We formalize this challenge as the \\textbf{Agent System Trilemma}: the inherent tension among achieving state-of-the-art performance, minimizing monetary cost, and ensuring rapid task completion. To dismantle this trilemma, we introduce EvoRoute, a self-evolving model routing paradigm that transcends static, pre-defined model assignments. Leveraging an ever-expanding knowledge base of prior experience, EvoRoute dynamically selects Pareto-optimal LLM backbones at each step, balancing accuracy, efficiency, and resource use, while continually refining its own selection policy through environment feedback. Experiments on challenging agentic benchmarks such as GAIA and BrowseComp+ demonstrate that EvoRoute, when integrated into off-the-shelf agentic systems, not only sustains or enhances system performance but also reduces execution cost by up to $80\\%$ and latency by over $70\\%$."

Focusing first on real parameters, we apply these conditions, together with a new symmetry of the superpotential we named ``q-symmetry'', to strongly constrains $\\mathcal{F}$. Imposing only these mathematical conditions is enough, for example, to reproduces the \\textit{structure} of the one-loop correction and the \\textit{exact result} in the planar limit, which are known from the literature. Extending the analysis to complex parameters, we develop a similar method to obtain the more restricted form of $\\mathcal{F}$, though the complex case obscures expansions in ``q-invariant'' variables. We also show how an additional pair $(q,h)$ of integrable deformations arises via q-invariance, and verify that the transformed R-matrix satisfies the Yang-Baxter equation. Moreover, we make two ansatz for the coefficients left in free in the finiteness $\\mathcal{F}$ for the real parameters, and while it has some defects, it reveals interesting results when compared with literature: the first predicts the pair of integrable deformations derived in \\cite{Mansson2010}, while the second ansatz gives the first correction only at fourth loop order $κ^8$ \\cite{Mansson2010}, which is known to be true in the planar limit. Furthermore, we study the impact of this symmetry on the algebra of the deformed XXZ spin chain and the moduli-vacuum of LS, and find a gauge/gravity interpretation when $h=0$ for the q-symmetry, obtaining the simplest relation between $k$ (from TsT) and $β$ ($q = \\exp(πi β)$) to be linear, in agreement with known results for the Lunin-Maldacena-Frolov deformation \\cite{Frolov_2005,Lunin_2005}."

Using a multi-phase transport (AMPT) model, we systematically investigate the dependence of collision energy and system size of this phenomenon with Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 19.6, 27, 54.4, 200 GeV and isobar collisions (Zr+Zr and Ru+Ru) at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV. The results reveal two distinct decorrelation components: $r_n(η)$, which includes flow magnitude asymmetry and event-plane twist, and $R_n(η)$ which arises purely from event-plane twist. Both $r_n(η)$ and $R_n(η)$ decrease linearly with $η$ and exhibit a significant dependence on collision energy and the size of the system. Through the slope parameters $F_n$ in the linear parametrization $r_n(η) = 1-2F_nη$, we can quantify the strength of decorrelation. We further observe that both $F_2$ and $F_3$ demonstrate a pronounced power-law scaling behavior with collision energy, following the relation $F_n \\propto log \\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. These results provide valuable insights into the three-dimensional modeling of the initial stage and the evolution of relativistic heavy-ion collisions."

By analyzing the Hermiticity of the electric-dipole radiation amplitude in a circular polarization basis, we derive an effective mirror operator acting only on a subset of C3 polarized dipole emitters, forming a quasi-symmetry group that commutes with SOI. This quasi-symmetry guarantees exact C3 merons and gives rise to a robust polarization zone within which continuously varying input polarizations generate identical topological textures. Our work establishes quasi-symmetry as a new fundamental principle in optical physics and opens pathways to engineered topological structures of light beyond conventional symmetry constraints."

    "abstract": "Many unresolved legal questions over LLMs and copyright center on memorization: whether specific training data have been encoded in the model's weights during training, and whether those memorized data can be extracted in the model's outputs. While many believe that LLMs do not memorize much of their training data, recent work shows that substantial amounts of copyrighted text can be extracted from open-weight models. However, it remains an open question if similar extraction is feasible for production LLMs, given the safety measures these systems implement. We investigate this question using a two-phase procedure: (1) an initial probe to test for extraction feasibility, which sometimes uses a Best-of-N (BoN) jailbreak, followed by (2) iterative continuation prompts to attempt to extract the book. We evaluate our procedure on four production LLMs -- Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok 3 -- and we measure extraction success with a score computed from a block-based approximation of longest common substring (nv-recall). With different per-LLM experimental configurations, we were able to extract varying amounts of text. For the Phase 1 probe, it was unnecessary to jailbreak Gemini 2.5 Pro and Grok 3 to extract text (e.g, nv-recall of 76.8% and 70.3%, respectively, for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone), while it was necessary for Claude 3.7 Sonnet and GPT-4.1. In some cases, jailbroken Claude 3.7 Sonnet outputs entire books near-verbatim (e.g., nv-recall=95.8%). GPT-4.1 requires significantly more BoN attempts (e.g., 20X), and eventually refuses to continue (e.g., nv-recall=4.0%). Taken together, our work highlights that, even with model- and system-level safeguards, extraction of (in-copyright) training data remains a risk for production LLMs."

    "abstract": "Quantum valley Hall-based topological phases have been attracting attention across diverse fields as a robust platform for wave guidance due to their high compatibility with engineering frameworks. Combining three representative boundary types enables topological waveguides with flexible designability and enhanced functionality. However, one of the three, namely the armchair boundary, has long been limited by inter-valley scattering, resulting in weak topological protection and severely restricting its use in practical devices. This long-standing constraint is a major barrier to realizing broadly applicable topological waveguide systems. Here, to address this challenge toward a broadly applicable design framework for topological waveguides, we experimentally demonstrate that topological adiabatic geometry implemented in a micro electromechanical system suppresses valley mixing. We found that the adiabaticity enhances immunity to defects and increases the transmission efficiency of the armchair boundary. As the adiabaticity increases, topological protection is recovered over an increasingly broad portion of the bulk band gap, extending from low to high frequencies. Furthermore, we show that the recovery of protection in the adiabatic armchair boundary enables waves to propagate through 90^° and 150^°-bent waveguides by coupling with other interface geometries. Suppressing valley mixing via adiabaticity paves the way for a universal design framework for topological waveguides and for restoring robust topological characteristics across a wide range of wave phenomena."

Traditional methods produce hard partitions, whereas soft clustering methods such as fuzzy $c$-means (FCM) allow mixed memberships and better capture uncertainty and gradual transitions. Despite the widespread use of FCM, principled statistical inference for fuzzy clustering remains limited. We develop a new framework for weighted fuzzy $c$-means (WFCM) for settings with potential cluster size imbalance. Cluster-specific weights rebalance the classical FCM criterion so that smaller clusters are not overwhelmed by dominant groups, and the weighted objective induces a normalized density model with scale parameter $σ$ and fuzziness parameter $m$. Estimation is performed via a blockwise majorize--minimize (MM) procedure that alternates closed-form membership and centroid updates with likelihood-based updates of $(σ,\\bw)$. The intractable normalizing constant is approximated by importance sampling using a data-adaptive Gaussian mixture proposal. We further provide likelihood ratio tests for comparing cluster centers and bootstrap-based confidence intervals. We establish consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator, validate the method through simulations, and illustrate it using single-cell RNA-seq and Alzheimer disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data. These applications demonstrate stable uncertainty quantification and biologically meaningful soft memberships, ranging from well-separated cell populations under imbalance to a graded AD versus non-AD continuum consistent with disease progression."

Generating them from a single photograph in a controllable manner is particularly challenging. Existing image-animation techniques are restricted to simple, low-frequency motions and operate only in narrow domains with repetitive textures like water and smoke. In contrast, large-scale video diffusion models are not tailored for cinemagraph constraints and lack the specialized data required to generate seamless, controlled loops. We present DreamLoop, a controllable video synthesis framework dedicated to generating cinemagraphs from a single photo without requiring any cinemagraph training data. Our key idea is to adapt a general video diffusion model by training it on two objectives: temporal bridging and motion conditioning. This strategy enables flexible cinemagraph generation. During inference, by using the input image as both the first- and last- frame condition, we enforce a seamless loop. By conditioning on static tracks, we maintain a static background. Finally, by providing a user-specified motion path for a target object, our method provides intuitive control over the animation's trajectory and timing. To our knowledge, DreamLoop is the first method to enable cinemagraph generation for general scenes with flexible and intuitive controls. We demonstrate that our method produces high-quality, complex cinemagraphs that align with user intent, outperforming existing approaches."

The core idea is to define a fitted distribution using a sliced Wasserstein barycenter (SWB) of push-forwards of the predictors and to quantify deviations from the observed response using the sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance. Regression functions, which map predictors' supports to the response support, and barycenter weights are inferred within a generalized Bayes framework, enabling principled uncertainty quantification without requiring a fully specified likelihood. The inference process can be seen as an instance of an inverse SWB problem. We establish theoretical guarantees, including the stability of the SWB under perturbations of marginals and barycenter weights, sample complexity of the generalized likelihood, and posterior consistency. For practical inference, we introduce a differentiable approximation of the SWB and a smooth reparameterization to handle the simplex constraint on barycenter weights, allowing efficient gradient-based MCMC sampling. We demonstrate MDDR in an application to inference for population-scale single-cell data. Posterior analysis under the MDDR model in this example includes inference on communication between multiple source/sender cell types and a target/receiver cell type. The proposed approach provides accurate fits, reliable predictions, and interpretable posterior estimates of barycenter weights, which can be used to construct sparse cell-cell communication networks."

    "abstract": "Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems lack human-like consciousness or culpability, yet they exhibit fluid agency: behavior that is (i) stochastic (probabilistic and path-dependent), (ii) dynamic (co-evolving with user interaction), and (iii) adaptive (able to reorient across contexts). Fluid agency generates valuable outputs but collapses attribution, irreducibly entangling human and machine inputs. This fundamental unmappability fractures doctrines that assume traceable provenance--authorship, inventorship, and liability--yielding ownership gaps and moral \"crumple zones.\" This Article argues that only functional equivalence stabilizes doctrine. Where provenance is indeterminate, legal frameworks must treat human and AI contributions as equivalent for allocating rights and responsibility--not as a claim of moral or economic parity but as a pragmatic default. This principle stabilizes doctrine across domains, offering administrable rules: in copyright, vesting ownership in human orchestrators without parsing inseparable contributions; in patent, tying inventor-of-record status to human orchestration and reduction to practice, even when AI supplies the pivotal insight; and in tort, replacing intractable causation inquiries with enterprise-level and sector-specific strict or no-fault schemes. The contribution is both descriptive and normative: fluid agency explains why origin-based tests fail, while functional equivalence supplies an outcome-focused framework to allocate rights and responsibility when attribution collapses."

However, research on LLM-based approaches to document inconsistency detection is relatively limited. There are two key aspects of document inconsistency detection: (i) classification of whether there exists any inconsistency, and (ii) providing evidence of the inconsistent sentences. We focus on the latter, and introduce new comprehensive evidence-extraction metrics and a redact-and-retry framework with constrained filtering that substantially improves LLM-based document inconsistency detection over direct prompting. We back our claims with promising experimental results."

In this work, we extend this framework by introducing a term \\((\\nabla^M X_M)^2\\) into the massless bulk \\(U(1)\\) gauge action. This modification explicitly breaks the full gauge redundancy while preserving a residual gauge symmetry both in the bulk and on the brane. In this setup, the scalar KK modes can acquire masses from the background geometry. Notably, we find that on the 5D brane, these scalar KK modes are lighter than the vector KK modes. In contrast, on the 6D brane, two types of scalar modes emerge; the mixed interactions between them give rise to oscillations among these scalar modes."

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of wireless communication technologies, including 5G, emerging 6G networks, and the large-scale deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT), has intensified the need for efficient spectrum utilization. Automatic modulation classification (AMC) plays a vital role in cognitive radio systems by enabling real-time identification of modulation schemes for dynamic spectrum access and interference mitigation. While deep neural networks (DNNs) offer high classification accuracy, their computational and energy demands pose challenges for real-time edge deployment. Spiking neural networks (SNNs), with their event-driven nature, offer inherent energy efficiency, but achieving both high throughput and low power under constrained hardware resources remains challenging. This work proposes a sparsity-aware SNN streaming accelerator optimized for AMC tasks. Unlike traditional systolic arrays that exploit sparsity but suffer from low throughput, or streaming architectures that achieve high throughput but cannot fully utilize input and weight sparsity, our design integrates both advantages. By leveraging the fixed nature of kernels during inference, we apply the gated one-to-all product (GOAP) algorithm to compute only on non-zero input-weight intersections. Extra or empty iterations are precomputed and embedded into the inference dataflow, eliminating dynamic data fetches and enabling fully pipelined, control-free inter-layer execution. Implemented on an FPGA, our sparsity-aware output-channel dataflow streaming (SAOCDS) accelerator achieves 23.5 MS/s (approximately double the baseline throughput) on the RadioML 2016 dataset, while reducing dynamic power and maintaining comparable classification accuracy. These results demonstrate strong potential for real-time, low-power deployment in edge cognitive radio systems."

    "abstract": "Conformal novelty detection is a classical machine learning task for which uncertainty quantification is essential for providing reliable results. Recent work has shown that the BH procedure applied to conformal p-values controls the false discovery rate (FDR). Unfortunately, the BH procedure can lead to over-optimistic assessments near the rejection threshold, with an increase of false discoveries at the margin as pointed out by Soloff et al. (2024). This issue is solved therein by the support line (SL) correction, which is proven to control the boundary false discovery rate (bFDR) in the independent, non-conformal setting. The present work extends the SL method to the conformal setting: first, we show that the SL procedure can violate the bFDR control in this specific setting. Second, we propose several alternatives that provably control the bFDR in the conformal setting. Finally, numerical experiments with both synthetic and real data support our theoretical findings and show the relevance of the new proposed procedures."

We propose a controlled Knowledge Graph-based synthetic framework that generates text from symmetric/inverse triples, train GPT-style autoregressive models from scratch, and evaluate memorization, logical inference, and in-context generalization to unseen entities to address these questions. We find a sharp phase transition in which relational semantics emerge with sufficient logic-bearing supervision, even in shallow (2-3 layer) models, and that successful generalization aligns with stable intermediate-layer signals. Finally, order-matched forward/reverse tests and a diffusion baseline indicate that reversal failures are primarily driven by autoregressive order bias rather than deficient inversion semantics."

We investigate the number of these polynomial-type exceptional units on general algebraic varieties. By employing the Chinese Remainder Theorem and Hensel's lifting technique, we derive an exact counting formula for the number of these exceptional units on a smooth closed subscheme under the assumption of good reduction. Furthermore, using the Lang-Weil inequality, we establish an asymptotic estimate for the counting function. In particular, we prove that for varieties of degree at most two, the error term can be significantly improved, yielding a sharper asymptotic bound."

    "abstract": "Can we learn more from data than existed in the generating process itself? Can new and useful information be constructed from merely applying deterministic transformations to existing data? Can the learnable content in data be evaluated without considering a downstream task? On these questions, Shannon information and Kolmogorov complexity come up nearly empty-handed, in part because they assume observers with unlimited computational capacity and fail to target the useful information content. In this work, we identify and exemplify three seeming paradoxes in information theory: (1) information cannot be increased by deterministic transformations; (2) information is independent of the order of data; (3) likelihood modeling is merely distribution matching. To shed light on the tension between these results and modern practice, and to quantify the value of data, we introduce epiplexity, a formalization of information capturing what computationally bounded observers can learn from data. Epiplexity captures the structural content in data while excluding time-bounded entropy, the random unpredictable content exemplified by pseudorandom number generators and chaotic dynamical systems. With these concepts, we demonstrate how information can be created with computation, how it depends on the ordering of the data, and how likelihood modeling can produce more complex programs than present in the data generating process itself. We also present practical procedures to estimate epiplexity which we show capture differences across data sources, track with downstream performance, and highlight dataset interventions that improve out-of-distribution generalization. In contrast to principles of model selection, epiplexity provides a theoretical foundation for data selection, guiding how to select, generate, or transform data for learning systems."

We propose a novel explainability-guided training framework, X-MuTeST (eXplainable Multilingual haTe Speech deTection), for hate speech detection that combines high-level semantic reasoning from large language models (LLMs) with traditional attention-enhancing techniques. We extend this research to Hindi and Telugu alongside English by providing benchmark human-annotated rationales for each word to justify the assigned class label. The X-MuTeST explainability method computes the difference between the prediction probabilities of the original text and those of unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams. Final explanations are computed as the union between LLM explanations and X-MuTeST explanations. We show that leveraging human rationales during training enhances both classification performance and explainability. Moreover, combining human rationales with our explainability method to refine the model attention yields further improvements. We evaluate explainability using Plausibility metrics such as Token-F1 and IOU-F1 and Faithfulness metrics such as Comprehensiveness and Sufficiency. By focusing on under-resourced languages, our work advances hate speech detection across diverse linguistic contexts. Our dataset includes token-level rationale annotations for 6,004 Hindi, 4,492 Telugu, and 6,334 English samples. Data and code are available on https://github.com/ziarehman30/X-MuTeST"

The model is constructed using an analytical closed-form solution to Einstein's field equations. Assuming a characteristic density of $ρ_{a}= 2\\times10^{14} \\mathrm{g\\,cm^{-3}}$, we compute the total mass and radius of the star based on a prescribed set of structural parameters that influence the density profile. The resulting stellar configurations exhibit boundary radii and total masses comparable to those of neutron stars with vanishing charge density. New exact solutions are obtained by solving the relevant second-order ordinary differential equations. We demonstrate that these solutions satisfy the standard energy conditions and maintain hydrostatic equilibrium throughout the stellar interior. All physical requirements remain valid at every point within the configuration. In this framework, the parameter $λ=\\frac{ρ_{a}}{ρ_{0}}$ serves as a key determinant of the mass-radius relationship. We further assess the suitability of the model for representing a relativistic superdense star and analyze its stability under radial perturbations. The investigation indicates that, for the configuration to remain dynamically stable, the density ratio between the outer and inner regions must take the value $λ= 0.4$."

    "abstract": "In combinatorial optimization, ordinal costs can be used to model the quality of elements whenever numerical values are not available. When considering, for example, routing problems for cyclists, the safety of a street can be ranked in ordered categories like safe (separate bike lane), medium safe (street with a bike lane) and unsafe (street without a bike lane). However, ordinal optimization may suggest unrealistic solutions with huge detours to avoid unsafe street segments. In this paper, we investigate how partial preference information regarding the relative quality of the ordinal categories can be used to improve the relevance of the computed solutions. By introducing preference weights which describe how much better a category is at least or at most, compared to the subsequent category, we enlarge the ordinal dominance cone. This leads to a smaller set of alternatives, i. e., of ordinally efficient solutions. We show that the corresponding weighted ordinal ordering cone is a polyhedral cone and provide descriptions via its extreme rays and via its facets. The latter implies a linear transformation to an associated multi-objective optimization problem. This paves the way for the application of standard multi-objective solution approaches. We demonstrate the usefulness of the weighted ordinal ordering cone by investigating a safest path problem with different preference weights. Moreover, we investigate the interrelation between the weighted ordering cone to standard dominance concepts of multi-objective optimization, like, e.g., Pareto dominance, lexicographic dominance and weighted sum dominance."

Under this assumption, we derive a series of modified dispersion relations that have not been previously explored, and we analyze their implications. Our findings indicate that the scales of Lorentz violation for massive particles are proportional to their masses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this hypothesis aligns well with existing phenomenological results regarding Lorentz violation observed in photons, neutrinos, and electrons."

Therefore, this paper proposes a vehicle-to-everything (V2X)-aided multi-agent CLC (MA-CLC) model, which is tailor-made for road closure scenarios. By leveraging V2X, the connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) and human driven vehicle (HDV) agents can share information about speeds, distances, and trajectories, which will be used as part of the state space for training. To make the HDV more humanlike, we customize a human-imitating reward function for HDV agents and implement CLC experiments with human expert drivers (HEDs). The results show that the safety and efficiency performance of the proposed MA-CLC model is respectively 15% and 26% higher than other benchmarks on average."

The system combines hybrid power splitting (PS) and time switching (TS) with maximum ratio transmission (MRT) beamforming to optimize the trade-off between information rate and harvested power. For the two-stage task, the first stage maximizes the rate under a power constraint, while the second stage maximizes harvested power under a rate constraint. We propose a low-complexity adaptive algorithm that dynamically adjusts the PS and TS parameters to minimize energy wastage and fulfill task requirements.

To alleviate the interference from the communication signal to the received target echo, we exploit the direct-sequence spreading method to reduce the communication transmission power. By optimizing the channel estimation and equalization for communication as well as the pulse compression and constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detection for radar detection, we can provide a high bit recovery performance in the multi-path fading channel, and maintain high target detection accuracy and multi-target resolution performance. Simulation results demonstrate that our designed SCS-JCR system can both maintain a low bit error rate (BER) in the multi-path fading channel, and in the meanwhile, can preserve an excellent multi-target detection performance given a low RF chain isolation between transmitter and receiver."

    "abstract": "Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) rely on sensor-based perception systems and high-definition maps for navigation. How-ever, their performance may degrade in challenging conditions such as poor visibility, unpredictable traffic conditions, or GNSS-denied environments like urban canyons or temporary construction zones. To address these limitations, we introduce Time-Logic-Map (TLM), a spatial messaging language that enables the road infrastructure to broadcast structured, machine-readable messages to supplement AV perception and support decision-making. This approach reduces the dependence on onboard sensors and describes road logic through machine-oriented language. TLM organizes road information into three layers: map, defining road geometry and a local 3D Cartesian coordinate system; logic, encoding the structural layout of roads and the precedence rules governing vehicle movements; and time, broadcasting real-time information like traffic signal phases. We describe modular design using multiple practical examples in standard and complex intersections, as well as in road construction zones."

    "abstract": "In modern wireless communication systems, the effective processing of Channel State Information (CSI) is crucial for enhancing communication quality and reliability. However, current methods often handle different tasks in isolation, thereby neglecting the synergies among various tasks and leading to extract CSI features inadequately for subsequent analysis. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel Multi-Task Channel Analysis framework named MTCA, aimed at improving the performance of wireless communication even sensing. MTCA is designed to handle four critical tasks, including channel prediction, antenna-domain channel extrapolation, channel identification, and scenario classification. Experiments conducted on a multi-scenario, multi-antenna dataset tailored for UAV-based communications demonstrate that the proposed MTCA exhibits superior comprehension of CSI, achieving enhanced performance across all evaluated tasks. Notably, MTCA reached 100% prediction accuracy in channel identification and scenario classification. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art methods, MTCA improved channel prediction performance by 20.1% and antenna-domain extrapolation performance by 54.5%."

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), the scale of intelligent connected vehicles has expanded dramatically. Alongside this, the development of the low-altitude economy (LAE) has introduced new types of nodes, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in low-altitude airspace. This has led to an exponential increase in the demand for secure and efficient authentication between low-altitude UAVs and ground vehicles. The Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), characterized by its efficient computation, low storage requirements, high parallelism, and excellent real-time performance, CRT-based authentication schemes are highly compatible with the resource-constrained and low-latency requirements of IoV scenarios. However, existing CRT-based authentication schemes suffer from scalability bottlenecks. As the number of connected nodes increases, CRT-based authentication schemes exhibit a superlinear growth trend in computational overhead, posing significant challenges to their practical deployment scalability. In response to this challenge, we propose a Dynamic Group Management and Authentication Scheme based on CRT (DGMA-CRT). The proposed scheme employs dynamic grouping of vehicles to enable efficient intra-group domain key updates, avoiding the significant communication overhead caused by global domain key updates. The parameters for domain key updates depend solely on the group size, not the overall system scale, thus significantly enhancing efficiency while ensuring scalability. Furthermore, the scheme incorporates Shamir’s threshold mechanism to mitigate the risks of single-point attacks in key management and leverages elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to establish a secure foundation for authentication. Simulation results show that DGMA-CRT, by utilizing grouped key updates and cryptographic mechanisms, significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining robust security. Additionally, the scheme retains high efficiency as the system scales, demonstrating its suitability for large-scale IoV applications."

    "abstract": "Nowadays, inertial measurement units (IMUs) have become established for determining training and match loads in several sports, mainly based on GNSS technology. Their ability to measure external load parameters such as running speed has been extensively studied. But it has also been shown, that that those systems often provide inaccurate data estimates, due to unsuitable sensors or algorithms. Research regarding the accuracy of IMU-alone Systems is rare.Accordingly, the aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of a foot-mounted IMU system, which is based on the MPU-9150 inertial sensor (InvenSense, USA), in measuring total running distance, distance covered within specific speed zones, and maximum sprint velocity in comparison to a 3D motion capture system (Qualisys, 100 Hz).The statistical analysis includes descriptive statistics, Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC), Bland-Altman agreement analysis, paired-sample t-tests, and Cohen's d effect size calculations to quantify systematic differences between systems.The results indicate an increasing deviation between the two systems as running speed increases. While \"good\" to \"excellent\" agreement was found at low to moderate speed (< 4 m/s) (ICC: 0.850 - 0.962), higher speeds (> 5.5 m/s) showed moderate agreement (ICC: 0.717) with greater scatter in the LoA (-28 m to -2.99 m). A significant difference was found between the two systems in the categories \"> 5.5 m/s\" and \"Vmax\". These findings align with previous research suggesting that cumulative signal errors (\"drift\") arising from inadequate filtering algorithms are responsible for reduced IMU accuracy at higher speeds or complex movement patterns such as rapid changes of direction or varying stride lengths during sprints."

    "abstract": "Heuristic dispatching rules (HDRs) are widely used for solving the dynamic fuzzy job shop scheduling problem (DFJSSP). However, their performance is highly sensitive to specific scenarios and often necessitates expert customization. To overcome this, automated design methods like genetic programming (GP) and gene expression programming (GEP) have been proposed. Despite their success, these methods face challenges, such as high randomness in the search process. Recently, the combination of large language models (LLMs) with evolutionary algorithms has opened new possibilities for prompt engineering and automated algorithm design. To improve the ability of LLMs in automatic HDR design, this paper introduces a novel population self-evolutionary (SeEvo) framework, which draws inspiration from the self-reflective design strategies employed by human experts. Notably, this framework employs a novel teacher-student learning mechanism, allowing the LLM (student) to generate robust HDRs. Guided by a teacher model with complete knowledge of actual processing times, the student learns to infer fuzzy uncertainties from historical deviations, enabling it to effectively anticipate and adapt to fuzzy impacts. Experimental results demonstrate that SeEvo significantly outperforms GP, GEP, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods, and more than ten commonly used HDRs from the literature, particularly in previously unseen and dynamic scenarios."

This study provides a systematic comparative analysis of classical machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches for behavior recognition using the CMI (Cognitive Monitoring Initiative) dataset, which includes multivariate time-series signals from wearable sensors and demographic metadata. Four experimental pipelines were designed and evaluated, incorporating classical models (CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, ExtraTrees) and DL architectures (Bidirectional LSTM, Transformer). A central novelty of this work is the integration of statistical and frequency-domain feature engineering with a multi-stage feature selection pipeline—mutual information, embedded Random Forest filtering, recursive feature elimination (RFE), and principal component analysis (PCA). This process significantly improved the performance of classical models by reducing noise and enhancing generalization. CatBoost, the most effective model, reached a macroF1 score of 88.00%. LightGBM and XGBoost also performed competitively under cross-validation. Deep learning algorithms battled data scarcity and class imbalance on the other hand, resulting in exceedingly low macroF1 ratings (~0.81%). These results highlight how critical feature curation and thorough validation are in modest HAR projects. Future studies should investigate hybrid ML–DL ensembles, sophisticated data augmentation, and lightweight DL models designed for wearable and IoT devices' deployment."

We first propose a tractable Gamma distribution to characterize the distributions of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under the Rayleigh, the Rice and the Nakagami-m channels. Then we derive the theoretical expressions of the average security capacity (ASC) for colluding and non-colluding eavesdroppers. Besides, the asymptotic expressions of the ASC are also obtained when the SNRs are large in practical scenarios. The simulation results demonstrate that the RIS is capable of reducing the negative impact of the increase in the number of eavesdroppers on the security performance by deploying more RIS elements in both colluding and non-colluding eavesdroppers."

Then, the hybrid beamforming design is formulated to maximize the sum-rate of communication users, while guaranteeing the SPEB constraint of target localization, transmit power constraint, and constant modulus constraints.

Each device partitions its transmitted data into finite blocklength packets and transmits them to the base station (BS) via the NOMA method. Specifically, we minimize the total system delay by jointly optimizing the number of short packets transmitted by each device, the transmit power of each short packet, and the data volume of each short packet, while satisfying block error rate (BLER) constraints. Since the proposed optimization problem is non-convex, we adopt a hierarchical approach to obtain the optimal solution. In particular, we decompose the problem into a top problem of solving the number of short packets and a bottom problem of optimizing the transmit power and data volume of each packet. For the bottom problem, we convexify it by introducing new variables and applying the Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) method. For the top problem, we employ the Dream Optimization Algorithm (DOA) to handle the discrete variables and obtain a suboptimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the genetic algorithm and Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) transmission in terms of total system delay."

    "abstract": "The increasing penetration of photovoltaic (PV) power raises the concern of grid instability due to its intermittency. Solar irradiance forecasting has been proven effective in supporting power ramp rate control (PRRC) of large-scale power systems, mitigating power intermittency, and improving grid resilience. The PRRC relies on irradiance forecasting to predict the direction and level of power variation. This article proposes a novel irradiance forecasting algorithm, namely the Time-Frequency Dual Branch Hybrid Network (TFDBHN) for PV power systems. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted and compared with the measured data, which shows that the proposed algorithm is superior to other prediction models based on recurrent neural networks(RNN). The findings highlighted the robustness of the proposed solution in handling rapid transitions and maintaining overall smoothness in the time series, demonstrating its potential to enhance the power grid’s resilience."

However, due to the limited number of reflection impedances of the tag, unwanted high-order harmonics are introduced, thereby degrading bit error rate (BER) performance. In this work, we investigate the harmonic elimination strategy for FSK-based BackCom. In particular, we first propose a novel multi-stage incident signal and the corresponding reflection strategy, which allows the tag to modulate the incident signal through absolute value operations, effectively suppressing harmonic generation. Then, we develop a USRP-based platform to experimentally verify the feasibility of our harmonic elimination strategy. Finally, the results show that our design can achieve a 12 dB attenuation in the third harmonic and up to 34 dB attenuation in high-order harmonics compared to conventional FSK-based BackCom without harmonic elimination, which consequently leads to improved BER performance."

    "abstract": "Active optical detection of hidden targets in turbid media holds significant application value across critical domains including marine resource exploration, atmospheric target identification, and biomedical imaging. However, the strong scattering and absorption effects in such media pose fundamental challenges: incident photons undergo complex multiple scattering paths, leading to rapid beam dispersion, severe energy attenuation, and substantial background noise. Single-photon detectors (SPDs), with their near-physical-limit single-photon sensitivity and exceptional temporal resolution, offer a revolutionary solution to this bottleneck. These detectors can effectively capture and resolve extremely weak target echoes, employing precise time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) techniques to extract useful signals even when submerged in strong background noise. Consequently, a systematic investigation of the detection limits of SPDs in turbid media-particularly the analysis of influencing factors and optimization strategies for maximum effective detection range-carries substantial theoretical importance. Moreover, such research provides critical scientific foundations and technical guidelines for designing high-performance, long-range single-photon detection systems tailored to real-world applications."

However, the performance of the system is jointly constrained by the placement of UAV-base stations (UAV-BSs) and the backhaul signal processing capabilities of ground stations. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a cooperative framework for UAV-BS in communication hot-spots, which effectively enhances system performance by jointly considering access link optimization and ground station processing capacity constraints. Specifically, by dividing ground users into several groups and forming independent D-MIMO subsystems with corresponding UAV-BS clusters, the system capacity and connection probability are effectively improved. The joint optimization problem of user grouping and UAV-BS placement is modeled as a non-convex optimization problem, and an efficient solution combining heuristic search and expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly improve the communication performance of the system while satisfying backhaul processing capacity constraints."

One of the main challenges faced by dental clinics in Pangandaran is the sub-optimal efficiency of patient service caused by manual processes, including appointment scheduling, queue management, and maintenance of medical records, culminating in long wait times and limited patient engagement. To alleviate these difficulties, this study conceptualized and assessed the SMILE platform, a web-based digital intervention designed to improve service efficiency and streamline clinical operational workflows. The system is engineered using the Laravel framework alongside the prototyping methodology, which facilitates iterative development based on user feedback, as well as comprehensive evaluation of usability assessments. Empirical testing involving 20 participants resulted in improved usability metrics across three important dimensions: effectiveness (85.5), efficiency (86.0), and satisfaction (85.3), with user satisfaction levels peaking at 95%. Operational indicators also showed an increase in scheduling efficacy (85%), queue management productivity (85%), medical data accuracy (85%), and online communication effectiveness (85%). These findings strengthen the platform's capacity to revolutionize clinical services and improve the quality of patient care. The study underscores the need for ongoing digital transformation and advocates further development in the areas of real-time notifications, mobile accessibility, and integration with additional healthcare systems to expand user reach and ensure system sustainability."

    "abstract": "In recent years, radio frequency fingerprinting (RFF), which leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to exploit the unique hardware characteristics of wireless devices, has emerged as a promising method for device identification. However, the complex and time-varying nature of wireless channels makes it difficult to acquire large-scale datasets, leading to small-sample scenarios that hinder the generalization and identification performance of RFF models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called the deep transfer triplet network (DTTN). Specifically, DTTN integrates triplet loss and cross-entropy loss to simultaneously enhance feature discriminability and robustness by leveraging sample similarity while mitigating channel-induced distortions in radio frequency features. Furthermore, to cope with data distribution shifts, DTTN incorporates a parameter transfer strategy that improves the model’s generalization across varying channel conditions. For efficient deployment, we evaluate several quantization schemes and experimental results show that DTTN significantly improves recognition accuracy and robustness in small-sample, time-varying channel scenarios, while also supporting lightweight model deployment. With approximately 100 samples per client, DTTN achieves a 13% improvement in recognition accuracy compared to conventional convolutional neural networks based methods."

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable holographic surfaces (RHSs) have been recently proposed as a cost-effective and energy-efficient solution for large-scale arrays. Unlike conventional phased arrays (PAs), RHSs enable electromagnetic waves to propagate along the surface and sequentially excite the elements, with their radiated amplitudes controlled via simple diode-based circuits, avoiding complex feeding networks and high-cost phase shifters. However, beamforming design for RHS-aided wideband multi-user systems faces challenges from real-domain amplitude constraints of RHS elements and the beam split effect. In this paper, we propose an RHS-aided hybrid beamforming scheme to enable wideband multi-user communications. Specifically, the digital beamformer and the RHS holographic beamformer are jointly optimized to maximize spectral efficiency (SE). Moreover, we reveal that for large-scale RHSs, 1-bit amplitude control can achieve near-optimal SE performance, reducing the algorithmic complexity. Simulation results verify that the proposed scheme effectively mitigates the beam split effect and outperforms existing beam-forming schemes in terms of SE."

Although compressive sensing (CS) and deep learning (DL)-based CSI feedback methods demonstrate their advantages, the recovery accuracy of downlink CSI in FDD mmWave mMIMO systems still faces severe challenges due to the facts of significant user equipment (UE) estimation errors, and typical compression requirements. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel echo sensing-aided CSI feedback framework designed to enhance downlink CSI recovery accuracy. In the proposed method, the communication echo signals observed at the BS are utilized to extract the dedicated sensing prior information for the downlink CSI recovery. With the extracted sensing prior information, a CSI denoising method is developed to suppress the non-path entries of the downlink CSI matrix in the angular-delay domain, thereby improving the recovery accuracy of downlink CSI at the BS. The framework operates as a plug-in module at the BS receiver, requiring no modifications to existing UE hardware. This work establishes a new paradigm for integrating sensing-assisted enhancements into FDD mmWave mMIMO systems without compromising compatibility with standardized UE operations. Simulations validate that the proposed method outperforms conventional CS and DL-based methods in terms of CSI reconstruction accuracy while demonstrating robustness to parameter variations."

Initially, we compute the power spectrum by cross-correlating the received signal with a locally generated reference signal, effectively mitigating noise in the context of long-range LoRa communications. Subsequently, we derive both the linear and logarithmic differential spectra of the power spectrum based on received signals from different time instances, and then calculate the ratio of these two spectra to extract the RFF. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits strong resilience to channel variations, maintaining an average recognition accuracy above 96% across diverse environments and time intervals."

However, due to the low resolutions, the performance loss of the one-bit system is serious. To alleviate this issue, we propose leveraging the fluid reconfigurable intelligent surface (fRIS) to compensate for the loss in downlink communication systems with one-bit digital-to-analog converters (DACs). Specifically, we formulate a symbol estimation error minimization problem by jointly optimizing the symbol estimator, the one-bit transmit signal, the fRIS phase shifts, and the element positions. To handle the resultant problem, an alternating algorithm is developed, where four subproblems are solved iteratively by using semidefinite-relaxation, discrete optimization, and quadratic programming. In optimizing fRIS element positions, the positions affect both the incident and reflective channels, leading to the high-order complex objective functions. We show that these terms can be simplified by using the characteristics of channels. Numerical results validate that the introduction of fRIS can alleviate the performance loss caused by one-bit quantization."

By leveraging the Grad-CAM, our approach quantifies the importance of activations and selectively transmits only the most discriminative intermediate activations. To overcome the limitation that clients lack direct access to Grad-CAM scores during the current forward pass, we utilize the channel importance vectors computed at the server from the previous iteration as surrogates, thereby enabling effective sparsification without incurring additional computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces communication cost compared to baseline schemes. Furthermore, our results reveal a trade-off between mini-batch size and sparsification ratio in SL, emphasizing the importance of careful activation selection for robust learning under communication constraints."

To address this, we formulate trace coloring as a multiobjective optimization problem and evaluate seven metaheuristic color scheme strategies. The proposed Adaptive Elitist Particle Swarm Optimization (AEPSO) algorithm outperforms all other methods. It achieves a minimum intra-group color difference of 5.52, surpassing the just-noticeable difference (JND) threshold of 2.3, ensuring that colors within each group remain easily distinguishable to the human eye.

    "abstract": "The deployment of 5G NR-U (New Radio in Unlicensed Spectrum) technology has become a key strategy for expanding network capacity. However, the traditional listen before talk (LBT) coexistence mechanism suffers from unstable channel occupancy in heterogeneous scenarios involving NR-U and WiFi. The existing performance analysis models mostly assume that WiFi networks are in a saturated state, which deviates from the unsaturated service characteristics commonly found in real networks. For this reason, this paper proposes a fair coexistence mechanism, NS-CON-FC (Non-Saturated Channel Occupancy Notification-Fair Coexistence), based on channel occupancy notification, aiming to improve the reliability of NR-U channel occupancy and achieve fair coexistence with WiFi networks. This mechanism effectively suppresses potential conflicts of WiFi devices by proactively sending composite occupancy notification frames (combining 802.11a CTS frame with 802.11n PLCP header) from NR-U to pre-declare the transmission time slots. In this paper, a system model comprising unsaturated WiFi nodes is constructed, and an optimization problem is established to maximize the total system throughput while adhering strictly to 3GPP fairness constraints. The analytical solution of the optimal time allocation strategy is obtained through mathematical derivation, which provides a low-complexity parameter configuration guide for practical deployment. Simulation results show that, compared with the traditional LBT scheme, NS-CON-FC improves the total throughput by 30.7% while maintaining the fairness constraint, thereby verifying the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism."

Since covert communication fundamentally relies on low transmission power to ensure undetectability, we try to minimize the transmit power while ensuring the covert constraint, and the joint optimization of active beamforming (BF) at access point, passive BF and mode selection at HF-RIS can be formulated as a mixed-integer fractional programming (MIFP) problem. By decomposing the original problem into the continuous beamformer design and the discrete mode selection problems, we further develop a binary search-assisted alternative beamformer optimization algorithm to obtain a stable solution of the MIFP problem. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the adaptive RIS mode selection covert-enhanced design over existing benchmark schemes and reveal useful insights to guide RIS mode selection design for different SR paradigms."

Wireless signal-based methods, particularly frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) millimeter-wave radar, can capture range and velocity with high spatial resolution, providing high-quality data compared to other methods. This makes them ideal for precise and robust gesture recognition. In this paper, we propose a device-free hand gesture recognition system using the Google Soli radar sensor, an FMCW millimeter-wave radar designed for low-power, miniature gesture sensing technology. The system preprocesses radar signals by generating image data, removing noise and outliers, and standardizing the frame count across gesture sequences. To effectively distinguish subtle motion differences between gestures, frame difference images are generated, and edge detection algorithm is applied to further emphasize these differences. A deep learning (DL) model, combining convolutional neural network (CNN) for spatial feature extraction and long short-term memory (LSTM) for temporal pattern learning, is used to classify the preprocessed data into specific gestures. The proposed system achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 98.91% among studies using the same dataset for evaluation. Furthermore, it demonstrates robustness with 94.91% accuracy in leave-one-user-out cross validation, highlighting its capability to generalize across different users."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of optimizing anchor selection for rigid body target localization based on time difference of arrival (TDOA) in wireless sensor networks (WSN). Unlike traditional single-point source target localization, rigid body localization requires jointly estimating the rotation matrix and translation vector, which requires anchor optimization selection methods to meet higher geometric constraints in order to improve the localization accuracy of the rigid body. To achieve this, the paper extends the Boolean selection vector into a multi-anchor cooperative observation matrix and constructs the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) containing the rigid body position information. The optimization objective is formulated as minimizing the CRLB. For this nonconvex problem, we propose a randomized optimization framework based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR), transforming the original problem into a convex semidefinite program (SDP) for efficient approximate solutions. Simulation results show that, under the condition of a relatively small number of selected anchors, the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the performance of rigid body localization accuracy."

In this paper, we show that the hardware response to switching activity in an FPGA can be modeled as a linear time invariant system to improve extraction of information in the power side channel. We propose that a deterministic response of the hardware exists and show that it can be captured experimentally using asynchronous sampling. We demonstrate that including the system response when estimating the power side-channel signal can result in a more accurate representation than using switching activity alone and allows the model take better advantage of oversampling. We establish that the power in the side channel is due to both the mean switching activity and its variance, and surmise that the useful power in a power side channel is due to the variance. We also introduce a novel approach to compute side-channel power using autocorrelation analysis on FPGA-based systems, which permits the study of how switching activity affects side-channel power. Our results show that using the system response with oversampling can result in up to a 460% improvement in correlated power on smaller circuits."

To address the high complexity of the matrix inversion in traditional linear precoders, we employ symplectic optimization. To better fit the symplectic optimization method, we transform the receive model into the real field. By utilizing the conversion between potential and kinetic energy in physics, we iteratively obtain the precoder vectors directly.

It provides users with an on-demand, self-service resource acquisition model, significantly lowering the barrier to resource access and offering strong elasticity in scaling applications. Traditional cloud data center networks are typically built on Ethernet and IP technologies. Most cloud data centers adopt a Spine-Leaf architecture, where the underlying physical network is interconnected via Ethernet links, and data transmission is realized through dynamic routing protocols and equal-cost multipath (ECMP) forwarding at the IP layer. Network virtualization functions are commonly achieved through tunneling technologies such as VXLAN, NVGRE, and UDP tunnels. However, this approach presents notable limitations. Firstly, conventional Ethernet and IP technologies were not originally designed for the specific requirements of modern cloud data center scenarios. As a result, they fail to address the particular technical demands and service characteristics of cloud computing networks. Secondly, tunneling technologies—especially those based on transport-layer tunneling—operate at higher layers of the protocol stack. When physical servers send and receive virtual network traffic, a considerable amount of computational resources (e.g., CPU and memory) is consumed, leading to both increased overhead and reduced network throughput. As a foundational infrastructure tailored for virtualized workloads, cloud data centers represent a typical vertically specialized application scenario. Therefore, it is feasible to design a novel cloud data center network architecture specifically optimized for this context. This paper proposes a new implementation approach for cloud data center networks, introducing a novel addressing, routing, and forwarding mechanism that natively integrates network virtualization functions into the network substrate. By embedding virtualization at the architectural layer, this design fundamentally addresses the limitations of conventional network virtualization techniques and enhances overall performance."

Built on partial convolutional residual blocks, WaLIC reduces decoder complexity and model size while maintaining strong performance. A dual mechanism of feature modulation and content-adaptive quantization allows precise, continuous bitrate adjustment using a single variable-bitrate model. A key innovation is encoder-side online optimization, which performs input-specific, gradient-based refinement of latent representations by minimizing advanced perceptual losses. This process incorporates region-aware weighting, automatically identifying visually sensitive areas—such as faces and text—via semantic analysis to preserve critical details without manual annotation. By integrating lightweight architecture design, adaptive bitrate control, and online perceptual optimization, WaLIC provides a practical solution with fine-grained quality adjustment for realworld applications."

    "abstract": "Cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications provides UAVs with ubiquitous connectivity via cellular networks. Introducing full-duplex (FD) technology into cellular-connected UAV communications to enable real-time bidirectional traffic applications, such as emergency rescue. However, severe self-interference (SI) under FD can lead to performance degradation, particularly with a coupled uplink-downlink (UL-DL) association. To address this issue, we adopt a decoupled UL-DL association (DUDA), which achieves spatial separation of transmit and receive beams to reduce SI. However, existing DUDA policies, which rely on minimum path loss (PL), are not optimal under FD. Therefore, we propose an adaptive multi-criteria decoupling scheme based on fuzzy logic (FL) to further reduce SI. In particular, we first consider the PL, the base station (BS)-UAV-BS angle, and the BS loads as the multiple criteria. We then use FL to integrate these criteria and generate scores for each BS. Finally, we can adaptively decouple the UL-DL association based on these calculated scores. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed decoupling scheme can significantly mitigate SI and improve the average transmission rate in DL and UL."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a vehicular positioning (VP) method that enables a moving vehicle to localize potential targets using multipath reflected OFDM signals. Unlike traditional Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) localization strategies, this approach empowers individual vehicle to detect multiple potential targets without consuming additional resources. We first apply SpotFi to achieve coarse time-of-flight (ToF) and angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimates as the initial estimation. Then, leveraging the slowly time-varying nature of ToF and AoA, we aggregate reflected OFDM signals across multiple time slots to form a third-order tensor, and optimize coarse estimates via a novel gradient descent (GD)-based alternating least squares (ALS) method that exploits the Vandermonde structure in tensor decomposition. The localization of adjacent targets is achieved by tracking AoA variations during vehicle motion, with positioning significantly improved through the enhanced AoA estimation. Numerical results validate our proposed method, illustrating the feasibility in dynamic vehicular scenarios."

    "abstract": "Whole Slide Images (WSIs) are high-resolution digital representations of histopathological slides that contain a wealth of information crucial for disease diagnosis. However, analyzing these images manually is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. Therefore, the uses of AI algorithms for WSIs analysis have become a trend. Building WSIs analysis models, however, are very challenging. Under specific conditions, the scales of lesions for diseases vary greatly and the local texture features of different lesions are highly similar. In this paper, we propose a Local-Global Multi-Scale Feature Fusion Learning Network (LoGl-Net) to achieve segmentation of various types of lesions. Firstly, pre-processing algorithms are designed to segment regions of interest based on color features in the original WSIs. Next, a three-layer patch network is constructed for extracting features of each region of interest in multiple scales. Cross-layer attention is established via pooling operations, using local histological features to adjust global morphological feature classification. Experiments conducted on a dataset built by this research and a public dataset obtained promising results, demonstrating the potential of our model in improving the accuracy and efficiency of lesion segmentation."

    "abstract": "Face anti-spoofing (FAS) has gained significant attention due to its crucial role in ensuring the security of facial recognition systems. Despite numerous proposed methods for addressing various types of presentation attacks, there remains a gap in the existing literature, as most methods only tackle seen attack types and lack generalizability in real-world scenarios. This paper presents a novel method for face antispoofing, specifically focused on open-set scenarios. The proposed approach consists of an autoencoder exclusively trained to reconstruct bona fide data. The key idea is that features extracted using this model would exhibit poor quality for attack data, resulting in significantly higher reconstruction errors. Consequently, these low-quality features would differ from the well-reconstructed features of bona fide samples. Our method’s key novelty lies in the rich feature learning procedure that focuses on the properties of bona fide samples through an autoencoder formulation. The extracted features are used to train one-class classifiers using only bona fide samples. Experimental results on standard benchmarks such as RECOD-MPAD, WMCA, HQ-WMCA, Replay-Attack, OULU-NPU and MSU-MFSD datasets demonstrate the excellent performance of our proposed approach, placing it among state-of-the-art methods for metrics like Bona Fide Presentation Classification Error Rate (BPCER), Attack Presentation Classification Error Rate (APCER) and Average Classification Error Rate (ACER)."

In order to achieve improved torque smoothness, this paper proposes an enhanced discrete-time current controller based on Linear Quadratic Integral (LQI) regulation, combined with an offline Torque Sharing Function (TSF) to enable indirect torque control. A performance-oriented optimization methodology is introduced, where the weighting matrices of the LQI formulation are tuned using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to balance current tracking accuracy and control effort. The proposed controller consistently maintains low root- mean-square errors in both current and torque across a wide range of speeds and load conditions, while ensuring torque smoothness. Such performance is sustained throughout all operating points, despite the highly nonlinear and strongly speed/load/position-dependent behavior of the SRM. The strategy also presents high robustness to parametric uncertainty, maintaining closed-loop stability under inductance variations of up to <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\pm$</tex-math></inline-formula>50% relative to the design model.

The approach combines large language models with parameter-efficient fine-tuning—specifically, Low-Rank Adaptation and Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation—together with a specialized corpus of specification–code pairs that covers common design patterns and varying task complexity. The pipeline includes automated compilation, simulation, and synthesizability checks to ensure that outputs are both syntactically correct and suitable for downstream tool flows. Evaluation is performed using the pass-at-k metric on the standardized VerilogEval benchmark. The fine-tuned models substantially improve functional correctness over untuned baselines, achieving pass-at-k of up to 0.88 while markedly reducing both syntax and logic errors. The results indicate that reliable Verilog code generation from natural language can be achieved under constrained compute budgets; in our setup, effective training and inference remained feasible on a single graphics processing unit. Beyond empirical gains, the method demonstrates practical value for design automation by shortening iteration cycles and lowering the effort needed to move from textual requirements to synthesizable hardware modules. Overall, the findings support the use of large language models, paired with targeted data and validation, as a viable pathway for Verilog code generation and for accelerating the development of complex digital devices."

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are well-known to be susceptible to many universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs), where each UAP can successfully attack many images when added to the input. In this paper, we explore the existence of diversified UAPs, each of which successfully attacks a large but substantially different set of images. Since the sets of images successfully attacked by different UAPs are often complementary to each other, strategically selecting the most effective UAP to attack each new image could maximize the overall coverage of successful attacks. Following this insight, we propose a novel attack framework named boosting universal adversarial attack. The key idea is to simultaneously train a set of diversified UAPs and a selective neural network, such that the selective neural network can choose the most effective UAP when attacking a new target image. Due to the simplicity and effectiveness of the proposed boosting attack framework, it can be generally used to significantly boost the attack effectiveness of many classic single- UAP methods that only use a single UAP to attack all target images. Meanwhile, the boosting attack framework is also able to perform real-time attacks as it does not require any additional training or fine-tuning when attacking new target images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of the proposed boosting attack framework."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the structure of personality types among Japanese individuals using the HEXACO model, based on data from 13,668 participants. Although personality trait research has made significant progress, the existence and consistency of personality types remain under debate. To address this, we applied a combination of Ward’s hierarchical clustering and k-means analysis, supplemented by latent profile and spectral clustering to ensure robustness. The results revealed seven distinct personality types that capture both universal and culture-specific dimensions of personality. These types include Reserved, Emotionally Sensitive, Conscientious Introvert, Exploratory Extravert, Self-Oriented Independent, Emotionally Volatile Extravert, and Reliable Introvert. The Honesty–Humility factor, central to the HEXACO framework, was particularly influential in explaining cultural aspects of Japanese personality, reflecting the balance between humility, emotional restraint, and social harmony emphasized in Japanese society. Moreover, the study demonstrated how methodological diversity and large-scale data enhance the reliability of typological research in non-Western contexts. The findings extend previous Western-centered studies by providing empirical evidence of distinct personality configurations shaped by Japanese cultural values. This study contributes to cross-cultural psychology by highlighting the universality and specificity of HEXACO-based personality structures and underscores the need for culturally grounded models in global personality science."

This paper proposes a phase-aware behavioral fingerprinting framework for post-attack forensic analysis of IoT devices. The approach models normal device behavior and compares it with post-incident activity to identify persistent behavioral deviations caused by compromise. A layered learning strategy is employed, combining supervised detection and attribution with unsupervised anomaly identification to capture residual and previously unseen behaviors. Temporal segmentation into pre-attack, attack, and post-attack phases enables reliable forensic timeline reconstruction and realistic evaluation. Experiments on a real-world IoT traffic dataset demonstrate high detection accuracy, strong generalization to unseen devices, and effective identification of post-attack residual behavior. The framework produces time-aligned forensic evidence that enables reconstruction of attack progression and post-attack behavior."

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed extensive research on verifying multiagent system (MAS) properties, with model checking emerging as the predominant validation technique in this domain. The paramount challenge in MAS verification is state space explosion, and the most general method to mitigate this problem is partial order reduction (POR). However, existing PORs for MAS suffer from wasting reduction potential due to the relatively coarse characterization of dependence relationships and the relatively conservative selection rules of the firing set. To deal with the above issues, this article proposes a complete solution from system modeling to reduced state space generation. First, to enable enhanced POR through fine-grained dependence analysis, a Petri net model is presented for MAS. Unlike existing Petri net models, the model focuses on characterizing the semantics of the MAS interpreted system. Second, a stubborn set method for temporal epistemic logic is proposed, based on the model, transition selection rules, and a reduced state space generation algorithm are provided. The correctness of the method is proved by a theorem. Finally, an automated tool embodying the proposed method is developed, with comparative evaluations performed to validate the efficacy. Against the existing POR method, the proposed method is more efficient in terms of both space performance and time performance, which reduces state storage space and time expenses. Moreover, it is relative to binary decision diagram (BDD)-based implicit methods, and the proposed technique demonstrates superior time efficiency for limited-scale systems."

To handle the optimization problem, we propose an effective iterative algorithm where the energy precoding matrix and the IRS coefficient matrix are obtained in closed and semi-closed forms, respectively. Numerical results reveal that compared with the far-field beamforming scheme, the proposed near-field beamforming significantly improves the secrecy rate.

Experiments on a 2-million-record dataset of a 500 kV converter station show that the Isolation Forest achieves F-Scores of 94%-96% for single-parameter anomalies, while the CNN-LSTM network attains F1-Scores above 0.94 for multi-parameter correlation anomalies.

This paper introduces a Zero Trust-based Lightweight Trajectory Endorsement Model (ZT-LTE) that combines Zero Trust principles with a lightweight verification mechanism, employing cryptographic identity verification, Bloom Filter-based trajectory lookup, and a federated trust consensus mechanism to ensure reliable trajectory endorsement in real time. Simulation results indicate that ZT-LTE reduces unauthorised trajectory endorsements by 85% and improves real-time threat detection by 72% compared to traditional models, based on a comparison of the False Acceptance Rate and detection accuracy using a dataset of 10,000 simulated trajectory transactions. These findings advance the development of secure, efficient, and scalable communication frameworks for CAVs."

This formative evaluation with 22 participants allowed us to gather insights with respect to the usability of Tableau for visionOS, along with broader perspectives on the potential for head-mounted displays (HMDs) to promote new ways to engage with BI data. Our experience suggests a need for new evaluation considerations that integrate qualitative and quantitative measures and account for unique interaction patterns with 3D representations and interfaces accessible via an HMD.

    "abstract": "Forward-looking sonar (FLS) image segmentation can help reduce the amount of raw data that needs to be transmitted in underwater communication systems, making it a crucial technique for next-generation communication systems and the Internet of Things (IoT). However, its effectiveness is often hindered by weak semantic information, blurry edges and low resolution, which pose challenges for current segmentation algorithms. In this study, we propose a multimodal feature-enhanced Unet for FLS image segmentation (MFEUnet), built upon the Unet framework. The multimodal features considered primarily include spatial and frequency features. For spatial features, recognizing Unet’s strength in local feature extraction, we integrate a transformer to enhance its ability to capture global features. Frequency features are utilized to capture different details of FLS images, with a dual-branch wavelet transformation employed to decompose images into low-frequency and high-frequency components, facilitating the enhancement of these features. And a preprocessing reconstruction module is integrated to reduce the noise of FLS images. Furthermore, to address class imbalance in FLS datasets, we design a specialized segmentation loss function. Experimental results show that MFEUnet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in overcoming the unique challenges of underwater sonar imaging."

To overcome this challenge, we introduce a dual-stage correction network (DSCN) to learn and compensate the spatially selective environmental interference. The DSCN comprises two key modules: a spatial-attention feature estimator (SAFE) that leverages self-attention mechanism to capture intricate spatial interference patterns and generate targeted compensation vectors, and an angle corrector (AC) that refines the interference-suppressed AoA estimates through non-linear adjustments. We conduct experimental validation of DSCN on a physical platform and show that the proposed DSCN achieves a 33.0% reduction in mean AoA estimation error and a 50.0% decrease in positioning error, enabling decimeter-level positioning accuracy."

    "abstract": "Multi-tenant FPGA cloud platforms present serious security challenges due to the shared nature of hardware resources, particularly memory. One major security risk in such environments is the threat of side-channel attacks. This work demonstrates that the Prime+Probe attack, traditionally implemented to target CPU caches, can be adapted to DDR4 memory by taking advantage of timing variations caused by contention at the row buffer level. By creating controlled memory conflicts using custom attacker and victim kernels on a Xilinx Alveo U250 accelerator, we measured variations in memory access latency that revealed the victim's access to specific memory rows. These timing variations expose access behavior and enable inference of memory usage patterns, even without shared memory or runtime interaction between the attacker and victim. Our results demonstrate that DDR4 memory, when shared between tenants, can leak information through timing-based side channels. The findings point to the need for stronger isolation strategies and improved resource management to secure multi-tenant FPGA systems against such vulnerabilities."

    "abstract": "This study proposes a standard-free calibration transfer (CT) method based on Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN) to address the spectral differences between two near-infrared (NIR) spectrometers used for tobacco analysis under the same conditions. Developing standard-free CT methods is critical due to the limited availability of standard samples. Many traditional standard-free methods depend on restrictive assumptions, involve complex preprocessing procedures, or fail to fully leverage the available data, thereby limiting their applicability in practice. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a CycleGAN-based transfer model. Specifically, the CycleGAN generator is adapted to one-dimensional architecture, and a Gated Convolutional Neural Network (Gated CNN) is integrated to enhance the ability of CycleGAN-based transfer model to capture long-range spectral dependencies. Moreover, an identity mapping loss is employed to constrain the transfer and minimize spectral trend distortions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only addresses the limitations of traditional standard-free methods, but also achieves significantly lower spectral errors than both pre-transfer data and other standard-free methods such as Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filtering and Multiplicative Signal Correction (MSC). Although some structural consistency issues remain and require further optimization, CycleGAN-based transfer model represents a promising approach for cross-device NIR tobacco data transfer, demonstrating technical benefits and strong potential for deployment in complex industrial environments."

The large number of journals registered in Sinta, as well as the complexity of matching topics with the journal’s focus and scope, often causes scope misalignment and desk rejection. This study proposes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based Sinta journal recommendation system that utilizes the capabilities of the Large Language Model (LLM) to provide relevant and accurate Sinta journal recommendations. The dataset used consists of more than 2,400 Sinta-accredited journals, including other important metadata information. The system works by taking inputs such as the journal title and the desired Sinta accreditation, then performing embedding-based semantic search to find journals with the most relevant context and utilizing the LLM to compile a list of recommendations along with explanations of the reasons. Model evaluation will be conducted using Exact Match and Relevance Accuracy, as well as score-based evaluation analysis. The test results show that the LLM gpt-4.1 model provides the best performance with superior relevance accuracy and recommendation quality compared to other models. This research demonstrates that the RAG approach is practical for developing a context-based national journal recommendation system. Also, it presents opportunities for system development with similar concepts in other publication domains."

Ultrasound (US) helps differentiate benign from malignant breast masses, and the newest generation—Automated Breast Ultrasound (ABUS)—offers operator-independent acquisition, more accurate lesion-size estimation, and whole-breast coverage compared with Handheld Ultrasound (HHUS). Yet most computer-aided US studies still rely on HHUS because exploiting ABUS’s multi-view volumes is technically demanding. Existing ABUS models typically use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and merge views by stacking them into 2.5-D inputs, a strategy that obscures how each view contributes to the final prediction.We introduce MVHT (Multi-view Hybrid Transformer), a transformer-based framework that explicitly fuses the multiple 2-D views extracted from an ABUS volume. To let the self-attention mechanism recognize the origin of each view, we design normal-vector position embedding (NVPE)—a simple but effective positional encoding keyed to the view’s surface normal. MVHT was trained and tested on a private cohort of 352 multi-view ABUS scans (1,056 images) and surpassed CNN baselines, achieving 91.86% accuracy in benign-versus-malignant classification. On a dataset derived from the public TDSC-ABUS Challenge, MVHT also led the benchmarks with an accuracy of 71.61% . Extensive ablation experiments confirm that NVPE boosts performance.Taken together, these results indicate that MVHT can enhance the diagnostic value of ABUS and has strong potential for clinical deployment in large-scale breast-cancer screening."

This paper presents a real-time motion tracking system RTCtrack that operates directly on signal variations induced by human movement. At each time step, the method extracts significant variation points relative to a static baseline and incrementally groups them into coherent trajectories without requiring prior knowledge of the number of targets. A tail-based spatial association strategy enables robust path formation, while weak or inconsistent clusters are automatically removed based on activity level. To maintain tracking stability in evolving environments, an adaptive baseline update mechanism replaces the reference signal when persistent global deviations are detected. RTCtrack is evaluated using a public indoor radar dataset involving multiple individuals moving independently. Simulation results show that the system reliably identifies and tracks multiple motion paths in real time without knowing the exact number of targets. Comparisons with video-based ground truth confirm strong spatial and temporal alignment, demonstrating its effectiveness for radar sensing and passive human motion tracking."

To address this, digital twins can act as self-checking tools or enable manual querying of standards, ensuring compliance throughout the industrial process.

To meet the demands of machine-type communication in high-speed scenarios, this paper conducts research on a massive random access scheme based on OTFS modulation. Specifically, the transmission and reception model of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) OTFS signals is analyzed, where channel estimation is formulated as a block-sparse signal recovery problem. Therefore, based on existing superimposed and embedded pilot schemes, we propose a novel hybrid preamble scheme. This scheme utilizes the superimposed preamble and embedded preamble to achieve rough active user detection (AUD) and precise AUD, respectively, enabling accurate detection and channel estimation while supporting a large number of device access. On this basis, this paper employs a generalized approximate message passing with pattern-coupled sparse Bayesian learning (GAMP-PCSBL) algorithm that can capture the block sparsity characteristics of the channel matrix and achieve accurate estimation. The results of numerical simulations verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed scheme."

    "abstract": "Industrial machine-centric video analytics applications require not only high throughput to improve video quality, but also guaranteed end-to-end latency. Adaptive BitRate (ABR) schemes play a critical role in determining the throughput and latency of real-time video streaming. However, existing ABR schemes mostly focus on congestion avoidance or Quality of Experience (QoE) optimization, which cannot provide guaranteed end-to-end latency. To fill this gap, this paper aims to maximize the throughput under guaranteed latency. We propose a Latency-Guaranteed ABR (LG-ABR) scheme. In the LG-ABR, to combat the unknown and non-stationary transmission delay for video packets, we characterize the relationship between end-to-end latency and bitrate by a dynamic linearization data model with a Pseudo-Partial Derivative (PPD) parameter. Through estimating the PPD in real-time, such dynamic relationship can be determined and used to adapt the bitrate. Numerical results show that the proposed LG-ABR significantly outperforms the existing Google Congestion Control scheme, by decreasing the latency violation probability significantly at slightly cost of link utilization reduction."

In real-world applications, test data distributions often differ from training data, leading to changes in spurious correlations and inaccurate diagnosis results. To address this issue, this paper proposes a causal regularization graph attention network (CR-GAT) that decouples causal and confounding variables and eliminates spurious correlations. The method involves extracting high-level graph variables using differentiable pooling, measuring nonlinear dependence between variables with the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), and iteratively optimizing GAT loss and variable weights to learn true causal relationships. Comparative experiments on three-phase flow and power system datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) in resource-constrained wireless networks faces the challenge of long training delays. In this work, we explore delay-efficient FL by leveraging device-to-device (D2D) communications to accelerate the uploading of local models. We formulate a joint problem of upload mode selection and bandwidth allocation, which is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and difficult to solve directly. To address this, we propose a low-complexity two-step algorithm: the first step determines the upload modes for edge devices, while the second step optimally allocates the bandwidth. Simulation results show that our algorithm outperforms baseline schemes, with delay reduction becoming more pronounced as the number of edge devices increases."

Recent convolutional neural networks(CNNs), especially the EfficientNetV2 model, have significantly improved the accuracy of bone-age prediction. In this study, we trained a CNN model based on EfficientNetV2 to predict bone age based on 10,000 X-ray images of adolescents hand bones. The model extracted deep features from X-ray images, and after training, predicted bone age with remarkable accuracy. Moreover, when tested on real dataset, the model reduced the mean absolute error (MAE) of predicted bone age to 0.752 years. Our study confirms that deep learning methods aid in medical image analysis. Our bone-age prediction model is both objective and quantitative, and will find applications in clinical practice and when inferring the developmental cycle of minors."

Traditional optimization techniques, including heuristic-based approaches, struggle with the scalability and computational complexity of large-scale wireless resource allocation problems. In this work, we formulate the wireless resource allocation problem as a combinatorial optimization (CO) problem and leverage a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to efficiently solve it. Unlike conventional DRL methods that optimize decision-making over time domain, our algorithmic-step DRL iteratively allocates radio resources to maximize future rewards. Through extensive simulations, we compare our approach against heuristic baselines, demonstrating better computational efficiency and performance quality. Our results highlight the potential of DRL as a scalable and effective alternative for wireless resource allocation in next-generation networks."

Despite their potential applications across civil and military domains, UASs face significant reliability and safety challenges in real-world environments, primarily due to their reliance on communication networks and cooperative strategies. Existing research predominantly focuses on overt failures or attacks, leaving a critical gap in understanding the risks posed by stealth attackers—misleading agents whose behavioral deviation, δ(t), satisfies ∥δ(t)∥≤ ϵ for all , where represents the maximum detectable anomaly threshold of conventional monitoring systems. To address this limitation, this study employs a computational simulation framework to systematically investigate the impact of stealth attackers on swarm performance. A swarm model incorporating stealth attackers is developed, and extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate how subtle perturbations affect system-level outcomes. The findings reveal that stealth deviations have a non-monotonic effect on swarm performance, with specific deviation thresholds causing the most significant degradation. Compared to traditional attacks (node loss, link loss, and directional perturbation attack), stealth attackers induce more gradual yet profound behavioral drift in the swarm. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of swarm vulnerabilities and provide valuable guidance for the design of more resilient UASs."

The industry currently faces two key limitations: (1) traditional definitions of congestion fail to meet analytical requirements, and (2) root cause analysis relies heavily on manual expert judgment. To address these issues, this paper introduces CargoFlow, a system co-developed with industry partners that integrates advanced search algorithms, large language models (LLMs), and a 3D interactive data visualization interface. The system enables efficient and accurate detection of complex congestion patterns, including those imperceptible to human operators. CargoFlow employs optimized search algorithms to detect intricate congestion patterns efficiently, overcoming the limitations of human-driven inspection. By leveraging advanced LLMs with sophisticated prompt engineering, the system min-imizes human effort in diagnosing root causes. The proposed solution has been deployed and rigorously tested in real-world industrial environments, demonstrating its practical effectiveness."

Attacks such as buffer overflows targeting security-critical modules can bypass traditional protection and require robust runtime security mechanisms. In this work a Multi-Granular Information Flow Tracking (MG-IFT) framework is proposed that enforces secure data flow policies across different abstraction levels. The framework addresses the limitations of single-level IFT. The Multi-Granular IFT (MG-IFT) approach combines ISA-IFT for system-wide coverage and integrates Gate Level IFT (GLIFT) to the security-critical units, such as cryptographic modules. Performance achieves high precision without significant resource overhead. A hardware implementation of ISA-IFT is demonstrated in the PicoRV32 core. The results demonstrate the feasibility of deploying MG-IFT in real hardware, moving beyond conceptual models toward implementable security-enhanced SoCs."

    "abstract": "Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are at the forefront of scientific machine learning, making possible the creation of machine intelligence that is cognizant of physical laws and able to accurately simulate them. However, today’s PINNs are often trained for a single physics task and require computationally expensive re-training for each new task, even for tasks from similar physics domains. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a pioneering approach to advance the generalizability of PINNs through the framework of Baldwinian evolution. Drawing inspiration from the neurodevelopment of precocial species that have evolved to learn, predict and react quickly to their environment, we envision PINNs that are pre-wired with connection strengths inducing strong biases towards efficient learning of physics. A novel two-stage stochastic programming formulation coupling evolutionary selection pressure (based on proficiency over a distribution of physics tasks) with lifetime learning (to specialize on a sampled subset of those tasks) is proposed to instantiate the Baldwin effect. The evolved Baldwinian-PINNs demonstrate fast and physics-compliant prediction capabilities across a range of empirically challenging problem instances with more than an order of magnitude improvement in prediction accuracy at a fraction of the computation cost compared to state-of-the-art gradient-based meta-learning methods. For example, when solving the diffusion-reaction equation, a 70x improvement in accuracy was obtained while taking 700x less computational time. This paper thus marks a leap forward in the evolutionary meta-learning of PINNs as generalizable physics solvers. Sample codes are available at."

    "abstract": "Under global climate change and human intervention, an increased frequency of alternating drought and flood events exists, making such extreme conditions seemingly the new normal. These frequent events result in greater variability in terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA) (i.e., nonstationary behavior). In this study, we introduce a novel and straightforward metric, i.e., the standard deviation of TWSA (STD<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">TWSA</sub>), to detect regions with nonstationary in TWSA and gain insight into the impact of global change on regional TWSA. TWSA estimates from the Center for Space Research (CSR) Mascon are used to calculate STD<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">TWSA</sub> and estimated in a rolling window approach, and the results are compared with STD in precipitation anomalies (PA) and temperature anomalies (TA). Our results reveal that 63.8% of global land areas show significant prevalence of increasing TWSA variability with nonstationary, while only 3.5% exhibit a decrease. Among the 40 large basins analyzed, 11 show significant upward trends in STD<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">TWSA</sub>, with only one basin showing a significant decline from 2002 to 2022. In 34 of these basins, precipitation accounts for over 50% of TWSA variability, suggesting that variabilities in precipitation anomalies can be used to model and explain the nonstationary behavior of TWSA in these regions. Additionally, in 3 of the remaining 6 basins, we observed significant correlations between TWSA and PA variability at five-year window. Furthermore, WGHM-modeled STD<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">TWSA</sub> estimates align with the STD<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">TWSA</sub> from CSR and show consistent trends in most basins.

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of multi-modality image fusion technology enables researchers to simultaneously acquire information from different modalities within a single fused image. In existing methods, some general approaches can implement both infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) and medical image fusion (MIF) in the same framework. Nevertheless, these methods often ignore the learning of specific features in different modalities, resulting in unsatisfactory performance in fused results. To overcome this issue, we propose a multi-scale joint framework with self-supervision for general multi-modality image fusion, abbreviated as SCSFusion. It enables more targeted and robust implementation of IVIF and MIF. Specifically, in the fusion network, a joint attention module is employed to parallelly capture self-attention features in spatial and channel domains, which can keep fused results accurate in visual representation. Meanwhile, we utilize source images of different modalities to generate visual-focused maps as pseudo labels for self-supervised training of the fusion results. It effectively preserves the salient details in each fused image from being disrupted by other extracted information. Moreover, a medical dataset with segmentation labels, termed M2DF, is reorganized for fusion and down-stream tasks in MIF. With the help of M2DF, a pre-trained segmentation model can be cascaded with the fusion network, aiming to obtain high-level semantic features from inputs and enhance the data generalization in our general framework. We have conducted extensive experiments and analyses on SCSFusion in M <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\rm ^{3}$</tex-math></inline-formula> FD, FMB, and M2DF datasets, respectively.

Accurate estimation of these energy loads is critical for the design of energy-efficient buildings.

The CatBoost model, optimized through a hybrid technique that combines Random Search and Bayesian Optimization, is employed to enhance prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. The performance of the proposed model is compared with several machine learning algorithms, including SVR, GBM, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost, to assess its effectiveness in estimating energy consumption.

    "abstract": "Activities of daily living (ADL) identification with wearables has significant implications in healthy lifestyle management and offers an important sensor-based supervised learning research benchmark. Most ADL studies use single-modality (i.e., single sensor type like smartwatch only or earbuds only) data while multi-sensor data fusion studies using early-stage fusion of modalities from multi-sensors and multi-devices are emerging. To improve classification performance and model interpretability, leveraging early-stage fusion, late-stage fusion and individual modalities, we introduced novel modality-aware dynamic fusion (MAD-Fusion) models for multi-sensor data-fusion-based ADL identification. Based on early-stage fusion, we incorporated conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification, uncertainty late-stage fusion for cross-modality interpretability, and multi-modal strength-aware classification module. Trained on 36 independent subjects and tested on 4 independent subjects from Samsung ADL dataset with multi-sensor (accelerometers and gyroscopes) and multi-device (earbuds and smartwatch), MAD-Fusion not only achieved the state-of-the-art classification performance (accuracy: 0.9504, F1-score: 0.9142), but also enabled better interpretability of contributions and uncertainties from different modalities. The additional contribution of each building block is validated systematically. Furthermore, we validated MAD-Fusion’s superior performance on two public datasets in multi-sensor single-device settings (UCI-HAR and USC-HAD datasets). On all three datasets, MAD-Fusion manifested statistically significantly superiority comparing against baselines of single-modality, early-stage fusion and late-stage fusion (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i> < 0.001).

This study presents a systematic review of the literature on maintenance logistics in airside operations, focusing on its treatment within the logistics and operations management domains. The research undertakes a structured approach that involves combining bibliometric mapping with thematic content analysis and brings together insights from 56 peer-reviewed articles from the period 2012 to 2025. The research maps the intellectual structure and evolving thematic orientations of the discipline, demonstrating that most studies remain founded upon deterministic planning models, notwithstanding the uncertain nature of the aviation ecosystem. While existing studies integrate new uses of machine learning (ML), digital twins (DTs), and blockchain technologies for predictive maintenance and traceability of systems, these technologies are typically described in isolation with weak integration into systems. The integration points to imperatives for managers of airports and stakeholders to accept predictive as well as adaptive approaches to maintenance, to raise the visibility in real-time of systems through digital means, and to link logistics planning with long-term sustainability as well as resilience objectives. The review identifies principal gaps in research, such as the underuse of stochastic modelling, the omission to develop broad-basis frameworks to reconcile between upstream and downstream operation, and the underuse of considering sustainability dimensions, as well as human-machine interaction dynamics in systems for maintenance."

    "abstract": "Greenhouse based Controlled Environment Agriculture enables year round crop production. Maintaining a specific microclimate requires a significant amount of energy for controlling the atmosphere under the environment. Rising electricity prices, irregular solar energy generation, and specific microclimate requirements create challenges in operations and the economic viability of the system, thus demanding smart energy optimization. This creates a technical need for advanced Demand Side Management (DSM) techniques capable of aligning load operation with forecasted demand, renewable output, and market signals. Traditional strategies such as fixed rules, time slot scheduling, or heuristic controls offer limited adaptability, lack robustness under uncertainty, and do not generalize across climate zones or crop requirements. Recent developments introduce hybrid AI driven DSM frameworks that combine forecasting, optimization, and autonomous control using approaches such as Deep Learning (DL) based predictors, Model Predictive Control schedulers, and exploration Reinforcement Learning policies to enhance renewable utilisation, reduce cost, and maintain microclimate stability. This review systematically analyzes these methodological shifts, comparing forecasting, scheduling, and control approaches in terms of predictive performance, computational overhead, and deployment feasibility. Recurring challenges including limited transferability across climates, insufficient reporting of techno economic outcomes, and weak validation against biological risk constraints are examined alongside potential solutions such as uncertainty quantification, domain adaptation, and assessment of reliability.

    "abstract": "With the integration of high-power pulsed load (HPPL) into all-electric aircraft (AEA), the power supply capability of the aircraft’s electrical system faces significant challenges. Solely relying on fuel cell (FC) cannot meet this demand, and introducing energy storage devices can address this power requirement. To fully leverage the characteristics of different devices, this paper proposes an energy management strategy (EMS) that considers both transient and steady-state conditions for a system configuration comprising FC, battery, and supercapacitor (SC). For transient power such as HPPL, the proposed strategy can allocate power of different frequencies to different energy devices through a decentralized scheme based on mixed droop control. For the steady-state power distribution, a distributed optimization scheme will be added to another mixed droop control strategy to optimize the output power of the fuel cell and the battery, thereby ensuring the FC operates at its optimal efficiency. Additionally, the proposed strategy supports state-of-charge (SOC) recovery of energy storage devices, bus voltage stability, and fault-tolerant operation in the event of device failures, for both steady-state and transient power conditions. It also enables plug-and-play functionality for multiple FC, battery and SC units, thereby enhancing system reliability. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed EMS is validated through experiments on a developed prototype."

Our model employs a heterogeneous expert pool and a channel-aware gating mechanism that dynamically selects experts to efficiently deal with the input token complexity and enhance the robustness against adverse channel conditions. This enables efficient scaling of model capacity, activating lightweight experts in favorable scenarios and larger ones when needed, thereby balancing task performance and computational efficiency. Experimental results on a semantic similarity classification task using the Quora Question Pairs dataset confirm our HMoE-SC design improves semantic accuracy while efficiently reducing inference cost compared to the state-of-the-art models."

    "abstract": "As vehicle automation levels rise, future automated driving systems can enable drivers to engage in nondriving-related tasks (NDRTs). However, drivers remain responsible for driving safety. In the case of an automated vehicle failure, a driver must disengage from their NDRTs and take control of the vehicle. When fully engaged in NDRTs during Level 3 automation, NDRTs can compete for the resources for driving tasks, thereby depriving cognitive and physical readiness. This study investigated how compromised driver readiness affected takeover performance in situations with varying urgency levels. A simulated driving experiment was conducted with 32 participants in four states of readiness deprivation created through NDRT assignment, and two time budget levels were applied to represent multiple urgency scenarios. First, subjective ratings on readiness deprivation showed that depriving drivers of one form of readiness (i.e., cognitive or physical) adversely affected the other. Furthermore, retaining cognitive readiness may provide greater self-assessed utility. The NDRTs with similar interaction attributes generate comparable readiness deprivation ratings, offering a systematic way to evaluate their impact on takeover. Then, the impact of readiness deprivation on takeover performance varied significantly based on time budgets. With ample time, depriving drivers of physical or full readiness increased takeover time. However, these delayed actions, combined with stable lateral control, suggested a safe takeover strategy aimed at readiness recovery. Conversely, limited time hindered this recovery. Drivers performed takeovers despite impaired readiness, resulting in quicker but often abrupt post-takeover lateral movements. Notably, takeover actions were initiated once both cognitive and physical readiness were achieved, regardless of the time budget."

End-to-end deterministic communication is crucial for ensuring reliable and predictable data transmission, particularly in the edge AI applications requiring immediate responses, such as real-time digital twin, robotics and automation systems. This paper addresses the challenges of integrating 5G with Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) in Edge AI environments by proposing two \"lightweight\" integration solutions that utilize loose and tight coupling methods. The tight coupling method utilizes the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) to achieve tight scheduling between 5G and TSN, significantly reducing latency and improving responsiveness to dynamic wireless environments. We developed a testbed using commercial 5G network equipment to evaluate both integration solutions, focusing on key performance metrics such as transmission latency and jitter. Additionally, based on the proposed 5G and TSN solutions, we constructed a real-time digital twin system to track the movements of a robotic arm, and the results demonstrate a significant improvement in positioning accuracy."

In this paper, a multi-Agent reinforcement learning framework based on Multi-Head Attention as Mixture-of-Head Attention Network (MOHN) is proposed to effectively solve the classical problem in flexible manufacturing, the flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP). To begin with, an innovative approach is introduced for formulating FJSP as a Markov decision process (MDP). This methodology integrates both process selection and machine allocation into a unified action space. Additionally, a dynamic decision timing mechanism is ingeniously incorporated, significantly enhancing the effectiveness of the MDP's action space. Second, in order to efficiently extract more comprehensive and potential state feature information from the action space, this paper proposes a MOHA-based state extraction method to capture the complex linkages between processes and machines in the manufacturing process, so as to improve the decision-making efficiency of the agent. Experiments on a large number of instances at different scales show that the method outperforms the traditional PDRs algorithm with strong generalization ability."

The renewal of the overcurrent relay and phase-to-ground fault relay settings in the protection system at hydroelectric power plants jelok is very necessary because there has been no update to the settings since hydroelectric power plants Jelok was established in 1935. Then the coordination between relays can be analyzed using the current versus time plot curve in the ETAP 12.6 program.

To reduce the overhead for channel state information (CSI) acquisition with multiple-satellite cooperation, statistical CSI (sCSI) is utilized in the system. In such a situation, we first derive an approximated but exact expression for ergodic rate of each UE. Then, we aim to maximize the minimum approximated UE ergodic rate by the proposed alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm that jointly optimizes LEO satellite beamforming and RIS phase shift. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms of spectrum efficiency over baseline algorithms."

Although recent research has made progress in predicting human attention in social contexts, accurately estimating attention in industrial settings remains a challenge, particularly in industrial settings where it is crucial for error prevention, productivity optimization, and maintaining a secure work environment. In this paper, we present a multimodal deep fusion framework, ELLISON, designed to predict human attention lapses during HRC activities in manufacturing assembly tasks. First, we introduce a multimodal attention tracking pipeline featuring dual backbone Transformer Encoder models, which is trained to identify areas of interest related to human attention incorporating operator’s head pose and gaze features. Secondly, a deep fusion method is applied to consolidate the outputs of both modalities using a learned weighted strategy to provide a unified estimate of human attention throughout the tracking process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in tracking human attention in identifying instances where workers paid close attention or became distracted while working alongside robots, during collaborative tasks. The proposed method has potential applications in enhancing safety measures, optimizing workflows, and improving efficiency of HRC in industrial environments."

However, none of the image edge detection algorithms reported at present is completely suitable for edge detection of HSS circular saw blades. This paper proposes an improved Transformer algorithm based on deep learning, which has been subjected to a series of improvements targeting the inspection task of circular saw blades. The model designs dual-path input and preprocessing for silver and black circular saw blades. In order to enhance feature representation, a four-layer stacked Transformer encoder with global-local attention fusion and a four-level multi-scale Decoder with residual connections were specially designed. In addition, combining the weighted BCE loss and improved multi-region Dice loss, a compound enhanced edge loss (EEL) algorithm was proposed to balance classification accuracy and positioning accuracy. Experimental results show that when the threshold value is 0.92, the F1-scores of the model for black saw blades and silver saw blades are 0.8710 and 0.8902, respectively, which are superior to the traditional operators (Canny, Sobel) and mainstream deep learning models (U-Net, SegNet). The ablation experiments further verify the necessity of key modules, in which the Transformer encoder and traditional edge features significantly improve the detection performance, thus providing a high-precision and efficient solution for the edge detection of high-speed steel circular saw blades."

This paper proposes a multimodal fusion-based framework to enhance viewpoint prediction which is jointly optimized with adaptive streaming. The proposed approach presents a neural network model to predict the viewpoint of the user based on multimodal fusion technique, which takes unexpected events into consideration for refined accuracy.

These stages created requirements, user personas, user flows, prototypes, and user feedback, which served as key references throughout frontend development using the Scrum framework. Meanwhile, scrum is applied to manage the development process iteratively through structured sprints. Testing is done using the User Acceptance Test (UAT) to evaluate user satisfaction with the developed application. The integration of design thinking and scrum results in adaptability in responding to feature changes during the development of the frontend of the Santapan application. UAT testing shows that this application gets a positive response with an average user satisfaction score of 90%, which indicates that the Santapan application has met user needs."

    "abstract": "K-Means is one of the most widely used clustering algorithms due to its simplicity and efficiency; however, its performance is often hindered by random centroid initialization and the use of Euclidean distance. This study proposes an enhanced K-Means framework by integrating Rapid Centroid Estimation (RCE) for centroid initialization and Canberra distance as the similarity measure. Two datasets were employed for validation: the Wholesale Customers dataset with six numerical attributes and the New Student Enrollment 2024 dataset with six categorical attributes encoded numerically. Data preprocessing included label encoding and Min–Max normalization. The clustering performance was evaluated using three internal validation indices Silhouette Coefficient, Davies Bouldin Index (DBI), and Dunn Index over ten independent runs. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RCE–Canberra approach consistently improves clustering quality compared with standard K-Means Euclidean, particularly for numerical data. The best performance was observed on the Wholesale dataset with normalization at = 3, achieving a Silhouette Coefficient of 0.584, a DBI of 1.12, and a Dunn Index of 0.095. These findings confirm that combining RCE and Canberra distance enhances both intra-cluster cohesion and inter-cluster separation, offering a more reliable alternative to conventional K-Means clustering."

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes/Waymo subset of the MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from 2.6% to 1.2% (–1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive’s shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well."

    "abstract": "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) technology has shown significant potential in multi-condition mechanical fault diagnosis. Its core lies in utilizing class labels, domain labels, and data structure information to achieve cross-domain knowledge transfer. However, existing methods generally suffer from two key issues: they only model the first two types of information through classification loss and domain adversarial loss while neglecting data structure information, resulting in insufficient feature discriminative capability; meanwhile, they fail to effectively integrate multi-view signals, limiting the comprehensive characterization of fault features. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Time-Frequency Feature Fusion Graph Convolutional Adversarial Network (TFFGCAN). First, a dual-channel graph structure modeling module is constructed to build graph structures for time-frequency information separately. Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) are employed to extract features from both graph data, and time-frequency features are fused through a cross-attention mechanism. Second, joint modeling of the three types of information is achieved in a unified framework, where multi-kernel maximum mean discrepancy is used to measure differences in graph structures across domains. Finally, the effectiveness of TFFGCAN is verified on the XJTUSpurgear dataset. The results show that this method achieves the best performance among comparative methods."

    "abstract": "In complex industrial processes, digital twin technology faces modeling difficulties due to the absence of key quality variables, data driven soft sensing demonstrates significant potential in predicting quality variables due to its advantages of low cost and rapid response. However, data driven soft sensing models often suffer from data scarcity due to difficulties in obtaining labeled samples and high data repetition rates, which in turn affects prediction accuracy. Although virtual sample generation methods have been proposed to alleviate this issue, existing methods generally overlook the interdependencies among features and lack effective evaluation of the quality of generated samples, resulting in all samples participating in model training with equal weights. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposed a data augmentation and sample weighting soft sensing modeling method based on graph feature learning, referred to as GFSW-VSG, to mitigate the constraints imposed by insufficient samples on model performance. This model introduces a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) into the discriminator to maintain consistent interdependencies between the features of generated and original data. Subsequently, sample confidence is calculated to assign weights to virtual samples for weighted learning in the soft sensing model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through an industrial chlortetracycline (CTC) fermentation process."

    "abstract": "In target tracking with sensor network under decentralized architecture, the sensor network resources including sensing and communication resources are always constrained, meanwhile, the quality of measurements acquired by different sensor nodes toward the same target usually differs from each other. Both the selected sensor nodes and communication topology among them significantly affect not only the tracking accuracy but also network resource consumption. Thus, to improve resource utilization efficiency, this paper proposes a sensor network resource management method for target tracking under decentralized architecture, focusing on the selection of sensor nodes acquiring high-quality measurements and the optimization of their communication topology. First, this paper derives an iteration-adaptive decentralized PCRLB(IA-DPCRLB) as a tracking accuracy metric, and a tracking accuracy constraint function is established based on the IA-DPCRLB. Additionally, an objective function is constructed by modeling both the sensor scheduling cost and the communication cost. Finally, to solve the non-convex optimization problem, an enumeration-based genetic algorithm is employed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can adaptively select sensor nodes and dynamically optimize the communication topology according to the target’s motion state, achieving the minimized system resource consumption while ensuring the predefined tracking accuracy, thereby significantly improving resource utilization efficiency."

In this paper realistic user active detection and realistic channel estimation is carried out for unsourced sparse multiple access (USMA) scheme where sparse interleaver division multiple access is employed. The estimated channels of active users from preamble part are applied for multi-user signal detection for data transmission part. It is found that the multi-user detection performance loss of USMA compared to the ideal channel estimation is marginal in both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and flat fading channel under the reasonable system parameter setting."

    "abstract": "Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to discover behaviors or events deviating from the normality in videos. As a long-standing task in the field of computer vision, VAD has witnessed much good progress. In the era of deep learning, with the explosion of architectures of continuously growing capability and capacity, a great variety of deep learning-based methods are constantly emerging for the VAD task, greatly improving the generalization ability of detection algorithms and broadening the application scenarios. Therefore, such a multitude of methods and a large body of literature make a comprehensive survey a pressing necessity. In this article, we present an extensive and comprehensive research review, covering the spectrum of five different categories, namely, semi-supervised, weakly supervised, fully supervised, unsupervised, and open-set supervised VAD, and we also delve into the latest VAD works based on pretrained large models and open-world learning, remedying the limitations of past reviews in terms of only focusing on semi-supervised VAD and small model-based methods. For the VAD task with different levels of supervision, we construct a well-organized taxonomy, profoundly discuss the characteristics of different types of methods, and show their performance comparisons. In addition, this review involves the public datasets, open-source codes, and evaluation metrics covering all the aforementioned VAD tasks. Finally, we provide several important research directions for the VAD community.

    "abstract": "Text-driven human motion generation based on diffusion strategies establishes a reliable foundation for multimodal applications in human–computer interactions. However, existing advances face significant efficiency challenges due to the substantial computational overhead of iteratively solving for nonlinear reverse diffusion trajectories during the inference phase. To this end, we propose the motion latent consistency training (MLCT) framework, which precomputes reverse diffusion trajectories from raw data in the training phase and enables few-step or single-step inference via self-consistency constraints in the inference phase. Specifically, a motion autoencoder with quantization constraints is first proposed for constructing concise and bounded solution distributions for motion diffusion processes. Subsequently, a classifier-free guidance (CFG) format is constructed via an additional unconditional loss function to accomplish the precomputation of conditional diffusion trajectories in the training phase. Finally, a clustering guidance module based on the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</i>-nearest-neighbor (KNN) algorithm is developed for the chain-conduction optimization mechanism of self-consistency constraints, which provides additional references of solution distributions at a small query cost. By combining these enhancements, we achieve stable and consistency training in nonpixel modality and latent representation spaces. Benchmark experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional consistency distillation methods with reduced training cost and enhances the consistency model to perform comparably to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models with lower inference costs."

Specifically, FSAT employs a private CNN model architecture, where linear layers are computed through an optimized homomorphic ciphertext convolution operation, while non-linear layer operations are efficiently realized using a secure searchable index and an encrypted look-up table, which replace polynomial activation approximations and significantly improve inference accuracy and latency performance. To further mitigate information leakage, we introduce a dual-constraint adversarial training scheme that makes it substantially more difficult for an adversary to infer sensitive attributes of the input data. Experimental results demonstrate that FSAT achieves high inference accuracy and efficiency while substantially reducing the risk of sensitive data leakage."

We present SURFNet, a surface-aware two-stage framework that boosts accuracy and cross-dataset generalization via explicit ground-structure modeling. A Satellite Semantic Augmentation Algorithm (SSAA) preserves salient surface elements and synthesizes structure-preserving pseudo-backgrounds to diversify satellite training data. A Dual Positional Encoding (DPE) combines learnable 2D embeddings with rotation-aware encodings, while a Ground-Aware Aggregation Block (GAB) performs dynamic multi-branch integration of local–global cues.On University-1652 and SUES-200, SURFNet delivers competitive in-dataset results and achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization from University-1652→SUES-200 across altitudes. Additional transfers underline deployability: University-1652→DenseUAV exposes a large style/coverage gap that is substantially closed by lightweight fine-tuning (freezing the backbone, adapting small heads on a 50-class subset), while SUES-200→University-1652 shows expected asymmetry tied to the smaller source diversity of SUES-200. Subset studies on SUES-200 (dense/sparse buildings, water scenes, natural landscapes) further indicate that SURFNet exploits general surface saliency—not only the four SSAA categories—to generalize across scene types. Overall, surface-aware augmentation plus structure-guided aggregation yields features that are both accurate and adaptable for real-world CVGL."

Traditional nullforming methods, such as Null-Sweeping, rely on changing null directions across the resource blocks (RB) to improve the impact of nullforming. Yet these null directions are predefined for uniform user distributions and may not fully account for nonuniform deployments. We propose a user-aware nullforming approach that leverages K-means clustering to adapt null positions to dense user regions in the terrestrial cells, while time-frequency resources are allocated proportionally to user density. Simulations show that our method reduces HAPS interference for terrestrial users and improves fairness in interference distribution."

    "abstract": "Photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) technology, as a widely concerned gas detection method, plays a key role in applications such as human exhaled gas analysis, transformer fault monitoring, and downhole exploration early warning. However, the traditional PAS detection system has a relatively complex composition, consisting of an excitation light source, a photoacoustic cell, and a microphone. This leads to a large system volume and poor stability. This paper proposes a miniaturized PAS detector fabricated based on micro photoacoustic cell. The sensor organically combines the photoacoustic cell with an optical acoustic-sensitive microcavity, achieving a significant miniaturization of the detection system. Meanwhile, for the in-situ testing environment in transformer oil, it adopts a small-aperture oil-gas separation tube for packaging. In the in-situ direct detection of dissolved acetylene in oil without degassing, it achieves a fast response time of less than 5 minutes and a detection accuracy reaching the ppb (parts per billion) level. This provides an innovative solution for transformer characteristic gas detection with high precision, insitu capability, and real-time performance."

    "abstract": "Wi-Fi-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using Channel State Information (CSI) has received significant attention due to its non-intrusive nature and wide applicability in smart cities, healthcare, and smart home systems. Despite its potential, real-world deployment faces a major challenge: ensuring the model’s ability to generalize across different users, who exhibit distinct behaviors and encounter diverse environmental factors. This issue, termed Cross-User Generalization (CUG), arises from distribution shifts caused by variations in users’ body shapes, postures, movements, and environmental conditions. To address this challenge, we propose a cross-domain generalization framework based on an Attention-based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (ABLSTM) network. The proposed framework enhances the generalization capabilities of HAR models by leveraging multi-source training and incorporating attention mechanisms for effective temporal feature learning. Specifically, the model learns user-invariant features across diverse training users and adapts to new users without requiring direct exposure to their data. Extensive experiments on a multi-user CSI dataset demonstrate that the ABLSTM model improves average test accuracy by 2.0%–6.7% compared to BiLSTM and GRU models, and over 18.0% compared to MLP-based models, while achieving the lowest training and testing loss. This methodology offers a robust and scalable solution for Wi-Fi-based HAR, promoting reliable deployment in complex, multi-user environments encountered in smart cities, healthcare monitoring, and security surveillance."

    "abstract": "Over-the-air computation (AirComp) leverages the inherent superposition property of wireless multiple-access channels to enable direct signal aggregation from massive users. However, unfavorable channel conditions can severely degrade the computed mean square error (CMSE). To address this limitation, we introduce a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) into the AirComp system. Unlike prior works that assume full signal reflection by each RIS element (RE) regardless of its phase shift, we adopt a practical model accounting for the coupling between the amplitude and phase of each RE. Based on this model, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the CMSE by jointly optimizing transceiver design and the RIS reflection matrix. To tackle this highly nonconvex problem, we propose a dual-loop optimization framework, where the outer loop employs the genetic algorithm to obtain a near-optimal RIS reflection matrix and the inner loop uses an alternating optimization approach for transceiver design. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed dual-loop algorithm outperforms baseline methods in reducing the CMSE."

Traditional models assume idealized, static parameters for illumination, lens optics, and resist thresholds, yet overlook non-ideal effects such as illumination non-uniformity and lens aberrations. To address this, we propose a real-exposure-datadriven OPC algorithm that learns average illumination conditions from actual exposure data via gradient descent, enabling a highfidelity simulation model for iterative mask optimization. Experiments show that our method effectively mitigates parameter deviation issues in conventional models, offering a robust solution to simulation-to-reality gaps and demonstrating strong potential for advanced-node lithography correction."

Non-high throughput (HT) duplicate (DUP) packets with the maximum bandwidth of 320 MHz for Wi-Fi 7 consist of sixteen duplicated 20 MHz subchannels of 64 subcarriers. Extremely high throughput (EHT) DUP mode is one of the new features of Wi-Fi 7 for the range extension with reliability. 320 MHz EHT DUP packets consist of two duplicated 160 MHz subchannels of 2048 subcarriers. For Wi-Fi symbols, outputs of an FFT core of decimation in frequency in bit-reversed order (BRO) are generally reordered into subcarriers in natural order (NO) using an FFT output reorder buffer. A 2048-depth memory is necessary for combining duplicated 160 MHz subchannels of 320 MHz EHT DUP mode in NO. On the other hand, the proposed CSO does not need a memory for combining duplicates because duplicated subcarriers are manipulated consecutively. In addition, we can achieve the required SNRs of 0.4~0.8 dB with decision-aided channel tracking in CSO for 320 MHz non-HT DUP packets with modulations except BPSK. Lastly, the ratio of minimum latency to FFT size for continuous reordered data for 320 MHz non-HT DUP packets decreases from 93.8 % to 77.4 %."

    "abstract": "Rydberg atomic quantum receivers represent a transformative approach to achieving high-sensitivity, broadband, and miniaturized radio frequency (RF) reception. However, existing static signal models for Rydberg atomic receivers rely on the steady-state assumption of atomic quantum states, which cannot fully describe the signal reception process of dynamic signals. To fill in this gap, in this paper, we present a transfer function-based model to compute the dynamic signal response of Rydberg atomic receivers in closed form. Specifically, by applying small-signal perturbation techniques to the quantum master equation, we derive closed-form Laplace domain transfer functions that characterize the receiver’s dynamic responses to time-varying signal fields. To gain more insights into the quantum-based RF-photocurrent conversion process, we further introduce the concept of quantum transconductance that describes the quantum system as an equivalent classical system. Simulations for Rydberg atomic receivers validate the proposed signal model, and demonstrate the possibility of quantum receivers to outperform classical electronic receivers through the improvement of quantum transconductance."

Unlike conventional approaches that recast such problems as weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) minimization, we demonstrate that this transformation cannot hold equivalence in the considered scenario. To address this, we propose a modified WMMSE formulation leveraging channel covariance matrix decomposition. By exploiting channel characteristics, a low-complexity decomposition method is then developed, accompanied by an efficient algorithm. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method in some practical simulated scenarios."

However, impulsive interference caused by factory robots’ operation could be a technical challenge to threaten uRLLC. In this paper, based on multiple networking paths through different access points, grant-free radio access network has been developed and shown effective uRLLC under impulsive interference whose activities are modeled by a bursty Markov process.

Here, we theoretically demonstrate a nanophotonic perfect meta absorber comprised of a two-dimensional (2D) array of pyramidal multi-layered metal-dielectric (MD) structures. Each multi layered structure has 20 pairs of alternating MD layers comprising titanium nitride (TiN) and silicon dioxide (SiO2), with an optically thick TiN metal layer as back reflector. We theoretically show an exceptional average absorbance of 99.17% at normal incidence spanning ultra-broadband wavelength range of 0.3–5 μm, with peak absorbance of 99.99% at 1.28 μm wavelength. The proposed nanophotonic meta-absorber has an average absorbance of at least 94% for up to 60° of oblique incidence for random polarization. Thus, our proposed design is both angle-insensitive and polarization-independent. Our effective medium theory-based theoretical modeling comprehensively verifies the results obtained from full-wave simulations. Furthermore, the calculated figure-of merit for the proposed meta-absorber suggests that it can outperform some broadband absorbers recently reported in the literature. Thus, the suggested meta-absorber has potential applications in energy harvesting and thermal infrared detection."

    "abstract": "Existing Optical Remote Sensing Image Salient Object Detection (ORSI-SOD) methods mainly rely on a semantic segmentation paradigm, which relies on pixel-wise probabilities, leading to overconfident mispredictions. In contrast, the random sampling process of the diffusion model allows multiple possible predictions to be drawn from the mask distribution, effectively alleviating this problem. However, existing diffusion models mainly use Transformers as conditional feature extraction networks. Although they are good at global modeling, they have limited ability to handle long-range dependencies due to computational complexity. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MambaDif, an innovative diffusion model architecture based on Mamba. Specifically, we regard ORSI-SOD as a conditional mask generation task leveraging the diffusion model and achieving target distribution matching by adding noise to the mask and iteratively denoising it to match the target distribution. Then, we adopt Mamba to extract global features, efficiently process long sequences, and capture global contextual information with linear complexity. In addition, we introduce the global-local feature collaborative completion module (GLM), which combines the ability of convolutional layers to extract local features with the advantage of Mamba in capturing long-range dependencies, thereby achieving excellent denoising performance. Extensive experiments show that MambaDif outperforms SOTA methods in eight evaluation metrics on two standard datasets (EORSSD and ORSSD). We also report the generalization performance of the model on the challenging ORSI-4199 to evaluate its robustness."

Physical Layer Security (PLS) is a promising paradigm, and this work explores wireless channel-based Secret Key Generation (SKG) by proposing an Extended Huffman Coding (EHC) framework to enhance quantization stage. While non-uniform coding is common in Analog-to-Digital (A2D) conversion, it remains largely unexplored in SKG due to key mismatch risks. To address this, we propose a Huffman Coding (HC)-inspired framework that generates binary codes using reversed HC principles and extends them by sequentially altering the Least Significant Bit (LSB), ensuring equal-length unique codes for quantization levels while enhancing generation rate, agreement, and randomness. Additionally, histogram/ Probability Density Function (PDF) matching aligns quantization level probabilities at legitimate nodes to minimize mismatches while exchanging minimal statistical information without compromising secrecy. Unlike conventional quantization, which relies on predetermined codes vulnerable to eavesdropping, our scheme dynamically computes quantization codes at runtime, adding an extra layer of security. Moreover, while conventional HC avoids codes of a level to be a subcode of another level, SKG benefits when one code is a subcode of another, making detection harder. Instead of compression, as desired in conventional A2D conversion, SKG requires longer and random keys that reliably match at legitimate nodes, which our scheme ensures. Simulations are conducted under Rice-fading conditions that evaluate the impact of variations in the Rician K-factor on SKG performance. The proposed method is assessed using key SKG metrics named: Key Agreement Rate (KAR), Key Generation Rate (KGR), and Key Randomness Rate (KRR) (employing the NIST test suite). The obtained results demonstrate the potential of our proposed scheme for secure and scalable SKG solutions in future networks."

    "abstract": "The emergence of 6G technologies is rapidly accelerating large-scale communication environments. Machine-to-machine and device-to-device communications are emerging as critical challenges in various application fields, such as the internet of things, vehicular ad hoc networks, and the internet of drones. As 6G environments demand hyper-connectivity and large-scale deployment, the need for low-latency and robust UE authentication mechanisms becomes paramount. However, current networks lack adequate mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access by malicious User Equipment (UE) and to secure UE-to-UE communications. Accordingly, this paper proposes a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based UE authentication mechanism for Open RAN, applicable to key next-generation use cases. In the proposed mechanism, when a gNB (i.e., O-DU and O-CU) authenticates a UE initially in Open RAN, the O-DU hashes the UE’s Identifier (ID) and pseudo-ID using the QUARK algorithm. The O-DU encrypts a one-time pad—generated using a physically unclonable function, location information, and finger vein data—with the ChaCha cipher. Then it generates a security credential with them. When the UE connects to a new O-DU through its movement, the new O-DU verifies the UE’s prior authentication by querying the transaction stored in the DAG-based ledger. It ensures that only authenticated UEs connect with the gNB and access the network."

Machine learning (ML) has been very successful in identifying anomalies in transaction data. However, the comparison of the performance of different ML algorithms has been inconsistent, which has been caused by variations in datasets, preprocessing procedures, and metrics of measurement. This paper conducts a comparative analysis of five supervised machine learning models—Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, and Logistic Regression—on a realistically imbalanced publicly available dataset comprising approximately 50,000 transactions, out of which a mere 0.8% were fraudulent. Training and testing were conducted on standard preprocessing, feature engineering, and oversampling techniques, and the assessment was conducted on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and cross-validation scores. The results show that tree-based ensemble models, i.e., Random Forest (accuracy of 87.72%, F1-score of 76.38%) and CatBoost (accuracy of 87.53%, F1-score of 76.12%), were superior in terms of precision and F1-score, yet with an ongoing trade-off at the cost of recall being moderate (62-64%), indicating that a substantial number of fraud instances were left undetected. These findings highlight the importance of using robust models appropriate for handling imbalanced data and point to future research to improve recall as well as to test model performance on real-world transactional data."

Data were collected from 322 active Shopee users in Central Java, Indonesia, and analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling–Partial Least Squares (SEM-PLS). The results show that perceived enjoyment and gamification effectiveness significantly enhance perceived usefulness and ease of use, which in turn shape user attitudes. Furthermore, utilitarian value and social influence emerge as strong predictors of adoption intention.

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is a key enabler for 6G, yet it introduces considerable interference that limits its performance. To minimize interference and enhance spectrum efficiency of the ISAC systems, we propose a user-grouping and full non-orthogonal multiple access (GF-NOMA) approach. Specifically, we first group communication users and sensing targets based on their spatial distribution, so that spatial beam orthogonality can be employed to reduce interference between different groups. Then, by taking sensing targets as virtual communication users, each group is fully multiplexed by NOMA in the power domain for interference cancellation. To optimize the performance of the proposed approach, we formulate a beamformer design problem to maximize the weighted sum of the communication throughput and sensing power. Meanwhile, we propose a double-penalty successive convex approximation (DP-SCA) algorithm to solve this problem by iteratively searching for the optimal solution. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach improves the system performance by about 10% on average compared to the non-grouping approach.

    "abstract": "Voltage prediction is critical for ensuring both safety and operational efficiency of vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) in long-duration energy storage. In this paper, we propose a physics-data fusion model framework for long-term voltage prediction of VRFBs. First, a parameterized Nernst equation is introduced to construct a physically meaningful latent space. Second, the temporal dynamics of hidden state variables are modeled based on electrochemical principles to precisely capture their time-dependent behavior. Subsequently, auxiliary variables are constructed using a physics-guided approach based on the polarization. Finally, a deep neural network is employed as the output layer of the model to establish the mapping between multidimensional feature variables and voltage. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach effectively captures the long-term voltage aging trends under diverse operational conditions, improving both accuracy and generalization performance."

    "abstract": "We investigate a UAV-assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers and a limited UAV battery capacity. In this framework, the source UAV detects eavesdroppers and transmits their position information to a jammer UAV. While the source UAV communicates with its intended receivers, the jammer UAV simultaneously transmits jamming signals to disrupt potential eavesdroppers. To enhance the secrecy capacity between the source UAV and intended receivers, we formulate a joint optimization problem that considers user scheduling policies, transmitted power allocation, and UAV trajectory design. Given that the airborne duration of the UAV is primarily constrained by its onboard battery, we also take energy consumption into consideration in the trajectory optimization process. The inherently complex and non-convex optimization problem is decomposed into three subproblems, which are iteratively solved by employing the successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm. To better align with real-world conditions, we model the communication rate using Polyanskiy’s bound. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our optimization strategy and reveal that the UAV battery capacity significantly impacts the secure rate."

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is considered a typical new scenario of 6G. The fusion of sensing and communication will greatly facilitate the application requirements of ultra-high resolution, such as environment reconstruction. Therefore, to provide a theoretical reference for the design of a three-dimensional (3D) imaging algorithm in ISAC, this paper proposes a new method to obtain the range resolution in any direction in the 3D space based on the definition of conventional range resolution in the bi-static system, which solves the shortage that the range resolution in a specific direction can only be calculated. Specifically, we first analyze the conditions that need to be satisfied when two targets can be distinguished in the bi-static system. Next, we derive the theoretical range resolution in any direction based on the characteristics of the iso-range lines in the bi-static system and propose a solving method according to the Euler-Rodrigues rotation formula and rigid body motion characteristics. In addition, we also design a statistical method for range resolution based on the Axis-aligned Bounding Box (AABB) collision detection algorithm as a comparison method. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can each carry a small-sized edge server to offer computation services to multiple end users. In this paper, we consider a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based two-layer UAV swarm edge intelligence network, which includes task-generating UAVs (TUAVs) and an edge server UAV (SUAV). SUAV offers extra computation capacity to all TUAVs to process their computational tasks remotely. To minimise the long-term total service delay and the total energy consumption of all TUAVs based on the tasks’ transmission and processing, we propose a proximal policy optimisation (PPO)-based offloading decision and resource allocation joint optimisation algorithm by optimising offloading decisions, communication and computation resources allocation, and transmit power for all TUAVs. Simulations demonstrate that our approach outperforms benchmark solutions in terms of long-term total service delay and total energy consumption of all TUAVs in a UAV swarm system."

Accurate extrinsic calibration among sensors is the prerequisite for achieving multi-sensor fusion.

We propose in this paper a novel extrinsic calibration model (CalibCfC), which exploits spatio-temporal features to calibrate the extrinsic parameters between LiDAR and camera. Specifically, CalibCfC not only exploits our proposed global cost volume layer to model the global matching relationships among all point cloud and image depth features, but also extracts short-term causality among consecutive frames by our proposed convolutional closed-form continuous-time (ConvCfC) layer. For the KITTI raw dataset and KITTI Odometry dataset, CalibCfC achieves mean errors of 1.3286 cm and 0.0783° in translation and rotation as well as 0.4825 cm and 0.0789°, respectively, which are better than the peer learning-based calibration methods."

This paper introduces a novel Optimal Aerial Nodes Placement (OAP) framework to enhance the reliability of S-G FSO links with an objective of turbulence aware path length balancing. We explore three deployment configurations, namely, serial, parallel, and OAP. We evaluate two cooperation protocols, amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF). Comparative analysis reveals that the proposed OAP framework performs better under DF mode compared to AF and achieves a 20 dB performance improvement over traditional parallel transmission and a 6 dB improvement over serial transmission in DF mode, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of OAP in boosting FSO link reliability."

As an effective technique to integrate and manage the massive amount of knowledge, a knowledge graph helps structure and visualize knowledge and promotes sharing and reusing knowledge. Constructing a question-answering system over a manufacturing process knowledge graph can assist engineers and researchers in solving process decision-making and optimizing problems related to practical production. However, manufacturing process knowledge is characterized by its domain-specific complexity, semantic ambiguity, and context sensitivity, and the user questions are diverse and complex, which requires the corresponding system to have high semantic parsing capabilities to resolve the queries and provide accurate answers. Therefore, large language models are introduced to leverage their strong language understanding, reasoning, and generalization abilities to achieve question answering over the manufacturing process knowledge graph. It adopts multi-step reasoning to guide the large language model to decompose the original complex question into multiple sub-questions. An end-to-end entity linking approach and a subgraph retrieval method based on relation paths are also proposed to retrieve relevant and high-quality information from the manufacturing process knowledge graph and feed to large language models to generate answers. Experimental results on a real data set show that the average Hits@1 value of the proposed method reached 93.6%, outperforming existing knowledge graph question-answering methods."

To enable this integration, gaps in process integration, role definitions, and technical validation are identified through a gap analysis. The framework addresses process- and role-related gaps by adapting each step of the VDA Volume 5 development process—planning, validation, calibration, and deployment—to meet conformity requirements. Developed during the planning phase at a German automotive manufacturer, this framework provides a structured approach for designing ML systems that comply with industry standards, contributing to more efficient and reliable quality assurance (QA) processes."

Unlike conventional MIMO systems, the pseudo MIMO technology enables the transmission of a greater number of parallel data streams than the available radio frequency (RF) chains at the receiver. This is achieved by connecting multiple antenna elements to each receiving RF chain and applying a sequence of analog combining patterns for signal reception within the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) sampling interval. The entire signal processing procedures are formulated using matrix representations, leading to a compact expression of the equivalent channel matrix for each OFDM subcarrier. This matrix is further decomposed into the product of the frequency domain wireless channel matrix and the analog combining matrix. Numerical results and prototype testing demonstrate the benefits of pseudo MIMO in terms of both spectral and energy efficiency."

Devices were fabricated using SD1 photoalignment with SLM-based polarization patterning and E7 liquid crystal cells with 1 micrometer thickness per layer. Polarized optical microscopy confirms the intended interlayer rotation and the designed plus-one q-plate order.

Blockchain technology has the advantage of producing transparent information by implementing the concept of peer-to-peer validation. Patients and all parties involved in the blockchain network will validate all patient health transactions. Patients and related parties will receive transparent information about patient treatment, as they will validate all patient treatment transactions.

    "abstract": "Radio map presents communication parameters of interest, e.g., received signal strength, across a geographical region. It can be leveraged to improve the efficiency of spectrum utilization. With the rapid development of radio technology and the proliferation of radio-enabled devices, there is an increasing demand for finer granularity (higher resolution) in radio maps. However, the problem of fine-grained radio map construction is uniquely challenging, as it requires to utilize an extremely small number of radio samples collected by sparsely distributed sensors to infer the map. To address the problem, we propose a novel edge-cloud model collaboration paradigm. This paradigm first groups sensors into multiple clusters, with cluster locations optimized based on principles of radio propagation. Next, a small model on each edge device generates a local radio map for the respective cluster region using intra-cluster radio samples. Finally, a large model in the cloud constructs a global radio map for the entire region from the local maps produced by edge devices of different clusters. To evaluate the proposed paradigm, we also develop an UNet-based small model for the edge device and a Transformer-based large model for the cloud. Extensive simulations show that our paradigm is capable of constructing fine-grained radio maps from an ultra-low sampling rate of 0.1%, and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art."

Leveraging DTN’s real-time digital-physical synchronization, closed-form expressions for the user’s covert rate and warden’s minimum detection error probability (MDEP) are derived under worst-case detection. A DTN-driven double deep Q-network (DDQN)-DSSJ algorithm solves the normalized weighted-sum maximization problem under covertness, sensing ratio, power, and speed constraints. Simulations demonstrate that DTN-driven DDQN-DSSJ achieves 25% faster convergence, enhanced stability, and superior covertness compared to proximal policy optimization (PPO) and deep Q-network (DQN)."

We first study the variation of RCS with the observation angle during the target’s movement. Then, we use Periodogram algorithm for position and RCS estimation based on OFDM echo signal. After that, we create the POFACETS-based RCS database. The result of target recognition is obtained by matching the sampling RCS sequence with the database. Finally, we choose correlation coefficient as the criterion to reduce the complexity of data matching. Simulation results show that an accuracy of approximately 98.7% is achieved in target recognition."

    "abstract": "Machine translation is widely used to support communication across languages, but it continues to face problems with idioms, cultural expressions, and complex sentence structures. In many cases, translations from tools like Google Translate are correct in grammar but weak in meaning, especially when dealing with metaphors or culture-based phrases. To address these challenges, this study applies transformer-based neural machine translation models, with a focus on attention mechanisms that help capture context across longer sentences. A set of French-to-English conversational texts containing idiomatic and cultural expressions is used to test the system. The translations are evaluated using both automatic metrics such as BLEU and METEOR, and human judgment to measure cultural and semantic accuracy. The results are compared with Google Translate outputs to see how AI methods can better manage linguistic and cultural challenges. The study shows that while AI improves translation quality, it still requires human support to achieve culturally sensitive and contextually faithful results."

    "abstract": "Functional electrical stimulation (FES) has emerged as a promising technique for motor rehabilitation, yet quantifying its effects remains challenging. While current assessment methods utilizing clinical scales, kinematic parameters, and biomarkers offer comprehensive evaluations, they fail to delineate the specific motor function domains influenced by FES, and quantify both therapeutic outcomes and functional improvements. To address these limitations, we introduced multi-objective decision analysis method to propose a novel multidimensional evaluation framework for assessing FES-driven motor performance under varying stimulation parameters. This study represents the first systematic analysis of the effects of different FES parameters on motor function from three dimensions: movement execution completeness, dynamic movement stability, and muscle fatigue. For this, we collected surface electromyogram (EMG) and inertial signals under different parameters of FES-driven wrist movements. As a result, we found a relationship between the FES stimulus parameters and different movement level features. Our findings demonstrate that completion indicators generally increased with increasing stimulus amplitude, while movement stability indicators showed an inverse relationship with stimulus frequency. Notably, fatigue indicators exhibited dual trends, reflecting different aspects of motor unit performance. Further analysis showed revealed that our proposed model was sensitive to changes in stimulus parameter conditions while maintaining consistent evaluation rankings as sample sizes increase. This work establishes a novel, cost-effective model and methodology to quantify motor function and stimulus effects during FES application, providing a crucial foundation for subsequent precise modulation of FES parameters and timely evaluation of rehabilitation progress."

To improve the performance of AirComp, simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) is employed to provide a full-plane coverage. However, the CSI estimation is challenging, while the imperfect CSI degrades the performance of AirComp. Then, to address this issue, in this paper we investigate the robust beamforming design for STAR-RIS assisted AirComp system. Specifically, both the imperfect CSI of cascaded channels and direct channels are considered with a bounded CSI-error-uncertainty. In this work, we aim at optimizing the computation accuracy in the worst case of CSI error. To solve this intractable max-min problem, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm based on the Lagrange multiplier method and the binary property of transmit/reflect coefficient vectors at the STAR-RIS. Simulation results show that the our algorithm approaches the lower bound where the perfect CSI is assumed."

    "abstract": "Low-light video enhancement is highly demanding in maintaining spatiotemporal color consistency. Therefore, improving the accuracy of color mapping and keeping the latency low are challenging. On this basis, we propose incorporating wavelet-priori for the 4D lookup table (WaveLUT), which effectively enhances the color coherence between video frames and the accuracy of color mapping while maintaining low latency. Specifically, we use the wavelet low-frequency domain to construct an optimized lookup prior and achieve an adaptive enhancement effect through a designed wavelet-prior 4D lookup table. To effectively compensate for the a priori loss in the low light region, we further explore a dynamic fusion strategy that adaptively determines the spatial weights on the basis of the correlation between the wavelet lighting prior and the target intensity structure. In addition, during the training phase, we devise a Fourier-text driven appearance reconstruction method that dynamically balances brightness and content through multimodal semantics-driven Fourier spectra. Extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmark datasets show that this method effectively enhances the previous method's ability to perceive the color space and achieves metric-favourable and perceptually oriented real-time enhancement while maintaining high efficiency.

This approach limits channel coding during the training phase to reduce overhead, while leveraging the high coding gain of non-binary polar codes and a deep neural network-based fast decoder to decrease complexity and power consumption. In the semantic module, we design a feature fusion network based on attention mechanisms and residual modules to more accurately capture cross-modal semantic features. For transmission, an adaptive non-binary polar (ANP) encoding strategy is introduced, while a neural network-driven non-binary polar (DNP) decoder is employed in the decoding part. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system significantly improves transmission efficiency and reliability while reducing bit error rate, and effectively lowers transmission power consumption."

Due to the advent of deep learning, neural network models are increasingly employed as the cover medium. In existing approaches, the embedding of secret data results in an obvious degradation of the model's original task performance, such as image classification. This paper proposes a low-distortion steganography method that embeds secret data into neural network models without degrading the model's original performance. The method selectively modifies parameters with minimal correlation to the loss function, ensuring that the model's performance remains unaffected. Furthermore, a suitable modification amplitude is defined to minimize the impact on task performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method enables low-distortion steganography while significantly improving embedding capacity and security. Notably, a maximum of 3.25 M bits of secret data is successfully embedded into a VGG model on the MNIST dataset, resulting in less than 0.1% accuracy degradation, a significant improvement over previous methods."

Meanwhile, we propose a dual-heterogeneous-encoder network (DHE-Net) tailored for real-world noise. DHE-Net leverages spatial order information obtained from Knearest neighbor (KNN) sampling. It employs heterogeneous dual encoders to extract both the central semantic details and boundary distribution features of point cloud patches, thereby enabling more effective denoising. Experiments on RealLiD demonstrate that DHE-Net substantially outperforms mainstream denoising algorithms across multiple metrics, including chamfer distance, thereby proving its robustness and practicality under real-world noise conditions. The dataset and code will be released as open-source after publication to support future research."

This study proposes a tailored deployment framework for 5G-based smart farming systems that incorporate intelligent edge devices (IEDs), MEC nodes, and 5G small cells. A hybrid metaheuristic, combining the exploration capability of Simplified Harmony Search (SHS) with the local intensification of Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS), is designed to solve the resulting placement optimization problem. The approach is evaluated through a smart farm scenario featuring spatially distributed IEDs and diverse communication demands. Results show that the proposed SHSVNS approach achieves superior performance compared to existing approaches in reducing total deployment cost while maintaining coverage and responsiveness. This demonstrates its practical potential for enhancing agricultural digitalization through efficient infrastructure deployment."

In this work, we assume that base stations can temporarily improve the service and provide multiple service options to the UAVs at some associated costs. We propose a trajectory planning algorithm that considers the adaptive bitrate requirements of an application and all the service options available to find the optimal path between points in the 3D space.

    "abstract": "Lane detection is a vital component of autonomous driving technology. It identifies the positions and boundaries of lane lines in images captured by onboard cameras, facilitating key autonomous driving functions and enhancing road safety. Deep learning-based methods dominate lane detection task, with the Ultra Fast Lane Detection (UFLD) model being one of the most well-known recent approaches. Unlike other pixel segmentation-based methods, UFLD distinguishes itself through its row-anchor detection approach, enabling rapid processing speed. However, UFLD encounters challenges related to detection accuracy in various complex scenarios. An analysis of UFLD architecture revealed that insufficient global dependencies limit its performance and generalizability in complex scenarios. To address this limitation, this paper proposed a non-local UFLD model, which strengthens the global dependencies by integrating non-local blocks. Additionally, an auxiliary Lane Intersection over Union (LIoU) loss function is introduced to refine the model’s ability to accurately detect the position and shape of the lane lines. Experimental results on the CULane dataset show that non-local UFLD surpasses original UFLD in detection accuracy across most scenarios while maintaining high detection speed."

This work aims to first investigate the natural mating and ovipositing behaviors of black soldier flies and then engineer an artificial environment that well suits their needs. In particular, a modularized and scalable facility equipped with dedicated light recipe and climate control has been designed and built. The results of our comparative experiments revealed that black soldier flies in the artificial facility tended to have better mating and oviposition quantitatively and qualitatively as compared to the control group in the nature environment. As a result, this work demonstrated that within a well-controlled and comfortable artificial environment, it is possible and feasible to stably breed black soldier flies in large scale.

    "abstract": "As industrial equipment becomes increasingly complex and intelligent, fault diagnosis (FD) technology has emerged as a critical means to ensure system reliability and safety, spurring the development of various real-time online monitoring techniques. Traditional fault diagnosis methods primarily rely on single data sources and specific algorithms, which makes it challenging to effectively integrate the multimodal data captured by diverse sensors and often overlooks the vital role of human expertise in the diagnostic process. By leveraging a universal fault diagnosis framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with multimodal data, existing methods can be seamlessly integrated. LLMs possess powerful capabilities in natural language understanding, knowledge integration, and reasoning, enabling them to analyze text, images, signals, and other types of multimodal information to facilitate zero-shot and few-shot knowledge reasoning and fault diagnosis. This paper systematically reviews the development of LLM- and multimodal data-based fault diagnosis technologies, outlines key techniques such as data-driven processing, feature extraction, and feature fusion within LLM frameworks, and analyzes the technological advancements fostered by these methods. It also summarizes the advantages and limitations of this approach in fault diagnosis and health state assessment, and offers an outlook on the future trends and challenges of applying LLMs in multimodal fault diagnosis. The aim is to provide technical guidance for researchers and engineers, thereby accelerating the innovation and application of intelligent fault diagnosis technologies."

    "abstract": "Interference has been a significant concern that may degrade the performance of autonomous train localization using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), especially for safety-critical GNSS applications in railway transportation. Due to complexity and uncertainty of GNSS deception interference, GNSS-based train localization may significantly suffer from the vulnerabilities of an ordinary Train Position Unit (TPU), which would substantially hinder the trustworthy application of GNSS in railway systems. However, it is usually difficult to accurately characterize the effect of deceptive interference in misleading the position computation. Without relying on complex analytical theories, data-driven model-based detection has demonstrated great potential for practical applications. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive initiative focused on developing an active detection strategy specifically designed to combat typical GNSS spoofing threats. The Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network-TabTransformer (CTGAN-TabTransformer) solution is proposed for constructing the detection model, where CTGAN realizes the dataset augmentation and sample balance level enhancement. With this basis, a TabTransformer-based attack detection model can be derived effectively. Interference injection tests were carried out using real rail profile data. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed detection solution compared with different data-driven methods. Findings of this research provide an effective approach to enhance the resilience of GNSS-based train localization with a GNSS deception attack detection capability, which illustrates the potentials in enabling autonomous, safe and reliable state perception and operational control of modern railway trains."

This distortion critically impacts the 8th harmonic ADB component, especially at large oscillation amplitudes or high external rotation rates. High-accuracy whole angle mode HRG operation, particularly under virtual rotation, critically depends on compensating this nonlinearity error. This study mainly focuses on actuation nonlinearity, existing methodologies for addressing this issue primarily rely on establishing a mathematical model for actuation nonlinearity estimation. However, the compensation parameters obtained from a single fitting process may lack in accuracy, inherently constrained by estimation precision. In this paper, a novel identification and compensation method for actuation nonlinearity is proposed, with particular emphasis on real-time evaluation of compensation effectiveness based on the component analysis of ADB. An evaluation criterion based on the invariance of the magnitudes of the residual ADB across varying virtual rotation control forces (virtual rotational speeds) is further proposed. Experimental results validate the accuracy and applicability of the proposed method, demonstrating a reduction of 96.8% in the peak-topeak magnitude of the 8θ residual ADB component, a bias instability (BI) of 0.004°/h and the scale factor nonlinearity is improved to 0.21 ppm after the actuation nonlinearity compensation."

To address scalability in large urban scenarios, a metaheuristic based on the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) is used. Experimental results using realistic mobility traces from Cologne, Germany, show that the proposed Primary Deployment strategy significantly outperforms the baseline approach of placing RSUs in high-traffic areas, achieving up to 302% more vehicle coverage under specific configurations.

Ultimately, the dynamic process of establishment and extinction at the ns-level is monitored, and the intrinsic linewidths of multiple frequency comb teeth are also measured simultaneously. This method allows parallel interrogation of multiple comb lines and captures comb transient dynamics without discrete optical filtering or signal degradation."

To address this, a hybrid architecture combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a Vision Transformer (ViT) is proposed, leveraging self-attention to enhance global feature modeling. Evaluated on the SPEED+ dataset with an NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU, the method achieved state-of-the-art accuracy, with an angular error of 0.793° and a positional error of 0.023 m. To meet the constraints of onboard systems, structured model compression was applied, including progressive pruning, mixed-precision quantization, and hierarchical knowledge distillation. The compressed model retained high accuracy while reducing parameters by 62% and model size by 80%, demonstrating strong potential for real-time deployment in space applications."

The liquid neural network-based low-complexity beamforming (LNNLC-BF) is proposed in this paper to address the computational complexity and robustness of RIS-assisted multiuser secure communication system with imperfect channel state information and resource constraints. First, the differential equation of time-varying channel features is constructed by the continuous-time modeling of liquid neural network. Then, the sparse activation and dynamic path pruning are combined to reduce the dimension of matrix. Finally, a low-dimensional projection is designed to transform the high-dimensional beamforming into a low-dimensional spatial optimization to realize the joint mapping of beam and phase shift. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method through numerous and extensive simulations and show that the proposed LNNLC-BF provides a high security and low computational complexity scheme in the presence of imperfect channel state information."

    "abstract": "Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is a critical step before signal demodulation in wireless communications. Most of the current studies focus on the AMR in Gaussian noise environment, but wireless channels, such as those in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications, often contain impulsive noise, which can cause significant degradation or failure of traditional algorithms. Based on this, this paper proposes an intelligent AMR model designed for impulsive noise environment, where the alpha-stable distribution is introduced to construct impulsive noise. To fully utilize the feature information of the original signal in different domains, the wireless signal is transformed into the Cauchy-score constellation (CASCOST) based on amplitude-phase features and the hyperbolic tangent cyclic spectrum (HTCS) based on frequency domain features. An improved ResNet152 model is adopted for feature fusion to achieve AMR in impulsive noise environment. Simulation experiments show that the recognition accuracy of all modulation types is about more than 90% at a generalized signal-to-noise ratio (GSNR) of 6 dB and the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by comparing with other methods."

Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) is one of the main causes of accidents as it may reduce climber concentration. Mount Sibayak with an altitude of 2212 meters has the potential to cause AMS, especially for climbers who do not choose routes suitable for their physical condition. This research aims to develop an Android-based Mount Sibayak hiking trail recommendation system to prevent AMS using Random Forest algorithm and fall motion detection with threshold method. The system uses Random Forest algorithm to recommend routes based on physical condition, climber experience, and weather conditions. To overcome data imbalance in the dataset, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) was applied to generate synthetic data for minority classes. Fall motion detection utilizes accelerometer sensors with threshold method. The dataset was compiled based on climber responses to various climbing scenarios. The Random Forest model achieved 85% accuracy in recommending suitable routes, while the fall detection system achieved 99.2% accuracy. The system successfully integrated route recommendation with fall motion detection in a single Android application."

In this paper, we address a task offloading problem in SAGVN, where unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites collaborate to offer mobile edge computing (MEC) services to vehicles. Our goal is to jointly design service placement and task offloading strategies for each UAV to minimize overall system latency, subject to mobility, coverage, energy, and bandwidth constraints. The problem can be reformulated as a multi-agent Markov decision process (MAMDP), where each vehicle and UAV can act as an agent, and the actions taken by agents correspond to the optimal UAV trajectory, subchannel selection, task partition ratio, and offloading destination. Then, we decompose the problem into three sub-problems of service placement, task offloading, and subchannel selection. Given the extensive observation and action space, an iterative best response multi-agent proximal policy optimization (IBR-MAPPO) algorithm is proposed. Finally, simulation results show that our approach converges rapidly and achieves lower execution delay than baseline algorithms."

    "abstract": "Recently, since the formed frequency hopping patterns show superior performance, chaotic nonlinearity has been utilized by jammers to generate frequency-hopping sequences (FHSs). In the navigation confrontation scenario, accurate prediction of nonlinear hop frequency plays a decisive role in enhancing the anti-interference performance of drones and unmanned vehicles. Existing prediction methods typically rely on a priori information heavily. To address this issue, this study proposes a nonlinear frequency-hopping operation point prediction algorithm based on the Homotopy-Hidden Markov Model (HT-HMM). Firstly, the parameter information of drones and unmanned vehicles at the starting and target positions is taken as the starting point. This information is combined with the mapping function of non-linear frequency-hopping interference to construct a homotopy relationship. During the movement of drones and unmanned vehicles, this homotopy relationship can serve as a substitute for the priori information of prediction points. The relevant information is input into the Hidden Markov Model for training, from which the probability of the occurrence of hop frequency can be derived. Using this probability, the frequency point of nonlinear frequency-hopping interference received at the next moment at the next position can be estimated. Simulation results show that in the absence of priori information, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the proposed method is equivalent to that of the improved Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Particle Swarm Optimization Time-Frequency Atomic Decomposition Long Short-Term Memory Network (PSO-TPA-LSTM) algorithms with priori information. Moreover, the running time of this prediction method is only 0.239 times and 0.109 times that of the compared two algorithms respectively."

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs), which recently are on a hot topic, necessitate reliable trajectory forecasting to ensure the safety and stability of intelligent traffic systems—particularly in scenarios where conflict arbitration might fail. To address this, we introduce a novel trajectory prediction framework leveraging the Context-Aware Multi-Level Attention Augmented Long Short-Term Memory (CAMLAA-LSTM) with driving classification module, which captures the dynamic interrelation between vehicles and their surrounding contexts. Central to our approach is a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)-based driver behavior identification module, which classifies driving styles to enable personalized modeling. Building upon this, we design attention-enhanced LSTM networks, integrating both spatial and temporal attention layers, which are tailored to distinct driver profiles and varying road environments. This personalization strategy allows the model to adjust its internal structure for more accurate predictions. Comprehensive evaluations using the NGSIM dataset demonstrate that our model surpasses four established baselines (S-GAN, PIP, LSTM), achieving the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) across all tested time horizons. These findings suggest that the proposed framework represents a significant advancement in trajectory prediction, particularly in enhancing precision, thus contributing to the progress toward fully autonomous driving systems."

This paper used a coupling coordination model to measure the relationship between the carbon emission intensity of electricity consumption (CIEC) and the comprehensive green transformation (CGT) in the three major urban agglomerations of the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) from 2010 to 2021. On this basis, Kernel density estimation and exploratory spatial data analysis were employed to reveal the spatiotemporal evolution patterns of the coupling coordination relationship. Furthermore, the Dagum Gini coefficient and Markov chain were used to analyze the regional differences and hierarchical transition trends. The results indicated that: (1) The CIEC showed a gradual decrease, while the CGT first increased and then declined slowly. (2) The coupling degree exhibited a downward trend, with a spatial pattern of east-to-west decline. (3) The overall imbalance in the coupling coordination of the YREB improved annually, but spatial disparities among urban agglomerations remained significant. (4) The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) demonstrated high coordination stability and potential for upgrading; the middle reaches of the Yangtze River (MRTR) faced challenges of instability in moderate coordination, while the Chengyu (CY) region had a relatively severe risk of degradation. This study provided significant theoretical underpinnings for formulating regionally differentiated carbon emission reduction policies and advancing high-quality development within YREB."

The proposed PG framework explicitly incorporates reflection, transmission, and diffuse scattering into channel modeling, and employs a physics-aware scatterer discretization and classification strategy, which reduces the complexity of the conducted graph. Then, SPointNet enables fast estimation of scattering coefficients, allowing the model to bypass exhaustive analysis of material properties. Finally, we conduct channel measurements in real indoor environments to validate the proposed approach. Experimental results show that the proposed model accurately models channel responses while significantly reducing modeling time compared to traditional PG-based methods."

As the operating frequency enters the sub-THz range, several challenges arise, including high path loss and aggravated phase noise (PN). This underscores the critical importance of PN estimation in DFT-s-OFDM waveforms, which offer a lower peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) than CP-OFDM. To the best of our knowledge, existing works focus solely on PN estimation without considering channel estimation. However, separately estimating PN and the channel can degrade overall system reliability, since PN distorts channel estimation, which in turn impairs subsequent PN estimation. To address this problem, we propose a novel joint PN and channel estimation algorithm in DFT-s-OFDM, which has not been previously investigated. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it against conventional non-joint approaches."

In this paper, we investigate a typical V2X resource allocation problem requiring optimization of both vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication performance. Instead of setting one single system goal, we formulate it as a multi-objective optimization problem and aim to seek the complete trade-off between the objectives, i.e., the Pareto frontier (PF). To this end, the problem is first transformed to a multi-objective Markov decision process (MOMDP) and solved by a multi-objective reinforcement learning resource allocation (MORLRA) algorithm.

    "abstract": "Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) face substantial security threats due to their inherent reconfigurability, heavy reliance on third-party intellectual property (3PIP) blocks, and increasing deployment in safety-critical domains. To compound these challenges, the proprietary nature of FPGA bitstreams hinders the ability to verify designs against potential threats such as hardware Trojans. Given these security challenges, prior works have proposed reverse engineering (RE) solutions to recover netlist information from bitstreams for security analysis. However, these solutions are FPGA-specific and require an exhaustive mapping between the netlist functions and bitstream bits. This paper introduces Project Foxtrot, a novel, vendor-agnostic framework for FPGA bitstream RE. Our framework leverages machine learning (ML) to simplify and accelerate the bitstream mapping process. It addresses the limitations of previous works by providing a universal approach that can be adapted to various FPGA vendors. The work presented focuses on the ML techniques integrated within our framework. We demonstrate how these techniques are used to abstract complex, time-consuming tasks, thereby making the process more efficient and scalable. We present our framework and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using a lookup table (LUT) recovery use case. Our experiments, conducted on the Intel-Altera Flex 10K, the AMD-Xilinx Spartan 7, and the AMD-Xilinx Artix 7 FPGAs, show perfect accuracy in LUT truth table recovery, surpassing recent state-of-the-art approaches."

    "abstract": "6G networks are expected to significantly benefit from advanced wireless local area technologies such as Wireless Gigabit (WiGig), which operates in the 60 GHz frequency band. This band supports extremely high data rates and low latency, making it ideal for next-generation wireless applications such as the metaverse and holograms. However, WiGig signals are highly susceptible to attenuation from physical obstructions, resulting in frequent handovers and connectivity disruptions. Traditional reactive handover mechanisms are often slow due to latency in decision-making and processing overhead. However, proactive handover strategies that leverage channel prediction can enhance network reliability and improve the quality of service. This paper investigates the feasibility of using statistical methods, specifically the auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, to predict the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) in real-world indoor WiGig environments. Our results indicate that ARIMA exhibits poor predictive accuracy, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 15 dBm, which may trigger inaccurate handover decisions by initiating handovers under strong signal conditions or failing to respond under weak ones. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose an ensemble learning-based channel prediction approach utilizing the random forest (RF) algorithm. Our results show that the RF model significantly outperforms ARIMA by effectively capturing the nonlinear dynamics of real-world indoor WiGig channels. Specifically, the RF model achieves a 90% reduction in both mean absolute error and RMSE, and a 99% reduction in mean squared error, offering a promising solution for robust proactive handover management in 6G networks."

In this paper, we proposed a US-RIS-aided communication system incorporating an eavesdropper-side RIS (ES-RIS). This system model provides a cost-effective and energy-efficient alternative to large-scale antenna arrays for both the legitimate and eavesdropper users. Compared to traditional employments of RISs in the presence of eavesdroppers, the ES-RIS concept introduces, for the first time, the use of multilayer RISs deployed at the eavesdropper side for uplink transmission. Moreover, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) maximization problem is formulated with multilayer structures, and a multilayer transmit beamformer design is utilized to iteratively find the optimal solution. The secrecy rate performance of our proposed system is evaluated, with investigating the effect of the main parameters on the secrecy performance, such as the number of RIS layers and the ES-RIS position. The simulation results demonstrate that the secrecy rate of the proposed system model improves with increasing the number of RIS layers."

To address this, we propose the first joint integration of early exit and structured pruning for AMC, optimizing computational efficiency without significantly compromising accuracy. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the unique interactions between these techniques and the non-intuitive impact of pruning on early-exit models. Our experiments evaluate the impact of various pruning criteria, pruning percentages, and early-exit thresholds. Our results reveal that the effectiveness of different pruning criteria in early-exit AMC models is highly context-dependent, with no universally optimal strategy, and that increasing pruning levels and early-exit thresholds intensifies the trade-off between computational efficiency and classification accuracy."

However, prior studies often assume circularly symmetric complex Gaussian (CSCG) signals for BDs, which is impractical for low-complexity BDs. This paper addresses this gap by investigating SBCR systems where the BD adopts one of two popular modulation schemes in wireless communications, i.e., binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) and quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulation schemes. We derive the PT’s rates for these modulation schemes, highlighting the critical role of BD’s modulation phase in enhancing the PT’s rate. We then formulate two optimization problems to maximize the PT’s rate by optimizing the BD’s reflection phases for BPSK and QPSK, respectively, and derive closed-form expressions for the optimal phases. Simulations validate our theoretical analysis, and reveal that BPSK modulation achieves a higher PT’s rate than that of QPSK."

    "abstract": "High-voltage isolating switches are the main power transformation equipment to ensure the continuous and reliable power supply of the power grid, and their heating problem cannot be ignored. Due to the fact that the load current of the highvoltage isolating switch does not change significantly in the short term, it is difficult to comprehensively collect temperature rise data under different working conditions. This paper proposes a machine learning-based temperature rise estimation scheme for the hard connection contact part of isolating switch. Firstly, the simulation model of the hard connection contact part of isolating switch is built on Creo. The simulated temperature rise data under different working conditions are obtained by ANSYS Icepak thermal simulation. Then, the basic MLP model is constructed to fit the temperature rise surfaces under different values of contact resistances. On this basis, in order to solve the problem that the contact resistance of the equipment is difficult to measure during actual operation, the random forest regression model is constructed to estimate the value of contact resistance. Finally, the correct MLP model is constructed to fit the correction of temperature rise data. The experimental results show that the basic MLP model has a good fit for the simulated temperature rise data. In addition, the measured data can fall on the temperature rise surface corrected by the correct MLP model, indicating the effectiveness of the temperature rise correction. Importantly, by using the basic MLP model and the correct MLP model, the specific temperature rise data for the hard connection contact part of isolating switch under different working conditions can be calculated."

    "abstract": "Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and base station (BS)-based wireless positioning are the predominant technologies for outdoor user equipment (UE) localization. However, their performance deteriorates significantly in dense urban environments with complex architectural structures. This degradation arises because obstructions disrupt line-of-sight (LoS) conditions between the UE and satellites or base stations, reducing positioning accuracy. To address this challenge, this paper introduces LocVMunet, a novel deep neural network designed for high-precision localization based on received signal strength (RSS) from a limited number of base stations. The proposed LocVMunet seamlessly integrates the Cross-Scan Module (CSM) with signal distribution modeling, enhancing spatial feature extraction and improving localization accuracy. Unlike traditional methods, this neural network-based approach inherently mitigates the impact of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions, enabling real-time localization across any region covered by the radio map. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the LocVMunet establishes a new benchmark for RSS-based urban localization, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art neural network-based methods. Notably, it achieves a 24.8% positioning error reduction over LocUNet and a 22.7% improvement over LocSwinUnet in the five-base-station setup, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in urban positioning."

To address performance degradation caused by inaccurate perception of parameters such as position, a two-layer driving control framework is proposed, consisting of a high-level scheduling controller and a low-level real-time controller. Kalman filtering is employed to reduce state estimation errors and an improved Model Predictive Controller (MPC) is designed to ensure platoon stability under uncertainty.

Then, a personalized update strategy is employed, where batch normalization (BN) layers are regularized within a clustered structure through hierarchical clustering. At the same time, Non-BN layers are updated using similarity-based weighting across all vehicles.

In this system, the operator, serving as the master side, dons the exoskeleton to issue control commands to the slave-side robot while leveraging feedback from both the exoskeleton and the VR HMD for cognitive decision-making. This closed-loop teleoperation system provides a multi-sensory feedback experience that integrates visual and haptic sensations, significantly enhancing operational stability and accuracy. Furthermore, for force feedback control, we propose a strategy based on environmental parameter estimation in conjunction with Weber’s law, allowing for self-adaptive adjustments of force feedback mapping in response to varying environmental conditions. Experimental results indicate that operators experience a high level of immersion with this system and successfully complete tasks such as remote ultrasound detection.

To address this challenge, traditional tree-based approaches like the K-best algorithm have been proposed, which employ a fixed complexity at each layer to manage computational demands. The K-best algorithm remains computationally intensive due to its complexity highly dependent on the QAM modulation size and is further followed by a sorting scheme applied at each layer. Another tree-based approach, called the box decoding, has been developed to overcome these limitations in small-scale MIMO systems. However, the complexity of this algorithm escalates significantly in MIMO systems with higher dimension as the number of candidates generated by the box decoding grows substantially. In this paper, we propose an innovative solution, called the K-box algorithm. In contrast to K-best, K-box decouples the candidate selection procedure and the size of constellation space similar to box decoding while restraining the candidates expansion in higher-dimensional MIMO by sorting only when the number of candidates exceed a certain limit.

In the health monitoring module, a dual-stage attention mechanism is introduced, which includes spatial and temporal attention, aimed at capturing the spatiotemporal features in the multi-source data and optimizing anomaly detection through dynamic threshold adjustments. To further improve prediction accuracy, a multi-scale multi-head attention mechanism is used, and Monte Carlo Dropout is applied to estimate the uncertainty of the prediction results. Furthermore, a dynamic adaptive fine-tuning mechanism solves the issue of prediction bias, making the predictions more aligned with actual operational trends. Experimental validation demonstrates that the proposed method performs excellently in anomaly detection and trend prediction, offering high engineering application value."

Counting mangrove trees manually can take a long time and some limitations result in errors in the number of existing mangrove trees. To save time in calculating the number of mangrove trees in a field, we need an application that can calculate the number of mangrove trees automatically. The data taken came from the coastal areas of North Sumatra with input in the form of photos in .jpg or .jpeg format with the results taken from the top of the Mangrove tree with a drone. The picture is taken with a perspective perpendicular to the Mangrove tree with the camera height when shooting± 30 meters above ground level The results of the experiment by first conducting image training of 280 image data and testing as many as 20 image data with dimensions of 4000 x 3000 pixels, it can be concluded that the application can perform pixel readings of training images with a maximum network parameter error of 0.01 and a learning rate of 0.25. The application can detect and calculate the number of mangrove trees with an accuracy value of 90.85%."

These methods were chosen for their ability to deeply understand word context through natural language representations and effectively capture sequence patterns in text data. A multi-aspect approach was used to evaluate three main aspects: app performance (app performance and stability), services (transportation services and others), and pricing (promotions or discounts). The data used in this study consists of reviews written by users in Indonesian on the Google Play Store. This study is expected to produce a model capable of classifying sentiment based on these aspects into Positive, Negative, or Neutral categories with high accuracy. The data used consists of 10,000 reviews and 3 aspects (Performance, Services, and Price). Based on the test results obtained, the BERT-BiLSTM method achieved an accuracy of up to 0.98.

However, it entails prohibitive implementation costs due to excessive computational complexity and feedback overhead. In this paper, we propose a distributed precoding algorithm for uplink MU-MIMO systems to address the limitation. Specifically, user equipments (UEs) only share statistical CSI, while the base station (BS) is assumed to have access to full real-time CSI to align with practical systems. Moreover, unlike previous distributed precoding scheme, we take into account the indispensable multi-user interference (MUI). For each UE, we formulate a minimum mean square error (MMSE) optimization framework with terminal power constraint for bit error rate (BER) reduction. By judiciously integrating real-time CSI and statistical information, the algorithm is divided into two categories: purely distributed (PD) scheme and combined distributed (CD) scheme, achieving complexity and link overhead reduction. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in achieving favorable BER performance."

To minimize the mean square error (MSE) between the transmit signal and the received signal, a joint optimization problem of the IRS association, the IRS reflection coefficients and the power allocation is formulated based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) precoding scheme.

Equipping APs with energy harvesting (EH) capabilities can reduce grid energy comsumption by leveraging renewable resources. And strategic AP selection can further enhance energy savings without compromising quality of service (QoS) during low-traffic periods. Therefore, we formulate a problem of minimizing grid energy consumption under stochastic EH patterns and different QoS requirements, where AP selection and power allocation (PA) are taken into consideration jointly. Then, we reformulate it as a mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) problem for optimal solutions. Given the prohibitive complexity for large-scale networks, we propose: 1) A sparsity-enhanced iterative optimization algorithm employing reweighted L1-norm relaxation to overcome the non-convexity of L0-norm optimization, and 2) A deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based AP selection algorithm that circumvents combinatorial complexity. Simulation results show that compared to baseline algorithms, the proposed algorithms can significantly save energy consumption, which approximate the optimal solution with dramatically lower complexity."

Traditional methods often struggle to generate feasible schedules in large-scale, dynamic academic environments. This study proposes an Improved Genetic Algorithm (IGA) that combines the global search ability of Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the local optimization strength of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). ACO is first used to generate a high-quality initial population based on pheromone trails and heuristics, which is then refined using GA operators: selection, crossover, and mutation. The fitness function minimizes schedule conflicts, prerequisite violations, and room inefficiencies. The model was tested using real data from the Computer Science Department for the even semester of 2024, involving 19 courses, 20 lecturers, and 6 classrooms. Results show that IGA significantly outperforms standalone GA and ACO, achieving up to 83% conflict reduction and demonstrating higher consistency across multiple runs, as reflected by lower standard deviation values. These findings indicate that IGA is a robust, efficient, and scalable approach for academic scheduling and is well-suited to real-time, constraint-rich educational settings."

    "abstract": "Photon-counting computed tomography (PCCT) has emerged as a promising imaging technique, enabling spectral imaging and material decomposition (MD). However, images typically suffer from a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to constraints such as low photon counts and sparse-view settings which provoke artifacts. To prevent this, variational methods minimize a data-fit function coupled with handcrafted regularizers that mimic a prior by enforcing image properties such as gradient sparsity. In the last few years, diffusion models (DMs) have become predominant in the field of generative models and have been used as a learned prior for image reconstruction. This work investigates the use of DMs as regularizers for MD tasks in PCCT, specifically using diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) guidance. Three DPS-based approaches–image-domain two-step DPS (im-TDPS), projection-domain two-step DPS (proj-TDPS), and one-step DPS (ODPS)–are evaluated. The first two methods achieve MD in two steps by performing reconstruction and MD separately. The last method, ODPS, samples the material images directly from the measurement data. The results indicate that ODPS achieves superior performance compared to im-TDPS and proj-TDPS, providing sharper, noise-free and crosstalk-free images. Furthermore, we introduce a novel hybrid method for scenarios involving materials absent from the training dataset. This method combines DM priors with standard variational handcrafted regularizers for the materials unknown to the DM. This hybrid method demonstrates improved MD quality compared to a standard variational method and does not require additional training of the DM neural network (NN)."

This paper presents an application designed to improve medication management for Arabic-speaking elderly users. The application employs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) scanning to identify medications, and potential drug–drug interactions in Arabic. The application has a personalized scheduling module that provides reminders for doses, refills, and missed medications. A formative usability evaluation involving task-based testing and semi-structured interviews with participants aged 50–80 revealed high task completion rates, positive perceptions of drug–drug interaction awareness, and strong intention to adopt the system. The findings highlight the value of integrating drug–drug interaction alerts into digital medication support systems and provide design insights for supporting medication management among elderly users."

However, existing approaches often struggle with spatio-temporal modeling, resulting in suboptimal background suppression and target misclassification. Moreover, stringent recovery tolerances limit computational efficiency in sequential infrared processing. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel approach that enhances both background estimation and target detection by leveraging spatio-temporal features. Specifically, we integrate a four-dimensional (4-D) spatio-temporal tensor with a fully connected tensor network (FCTN) completion strategy, utilizing the sum of nuclear norms to maximize intermode correlations while minimizing clutter. For target extraction, we employ a dual Gaussian-core spatial saliency filter (SSF) and a temporal difference filter (TDF), enabling precise discrimination between true targets and static interference. The resulting model—Spatial-Temporal Prior-Assisted Fully Connected Tensor Network (STPA-FCTN)—balances background suppression with target preservation. Furthermore, we systematically analyze recovery convergence in STPA-FCTN and identify an optimal tolerance of 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-3</sup> using the proposed open-source TensorISTD benchmark.

In this paper, we conduct a thorough causal analysis to investigate the origins of biased activation. Based on our analysis, we attribute this phenomenon to the presence of co-occurring background confounders. Building upon this profound insight, we introduce a pioneering paradigm known as Counterfactual Co-occurring Learning (CCL), meticulously engendering counterfactual representations by adeptly disentangling the foreground from the co-occurring background elements. Furthermore, we propose an innovative network architecture known as Counterfactual-CAM. This architecture seamlessly incorporates a perturbation mechanism for counterfactual representations into the vanilla CAM-based model. By training the WSOL model with these perturbed representations, we guide the model to prioritize the consistent foreground content while concurrently reducing the influence of distracting co-occurring backgrounds. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the initial exploration of this research direction. Our extensive experiments conducted across multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed Counterfactual-CAM in mitigating biased activation."

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are highly effective at transforming sparse and unstructured data into dense and semantic representations, demonstrating strong capabilities in object detection tasks. However, their performance often diminishes when detecting small-sized objects due to the loss or corruption of critical information during feature extraction. To address this challenge, DPAKS is introduced, a reliable DETR- like detector for small objects enhanced with directional prior auxiliary knowledge to guide the model's focus on small objects. In the decoder of DPAKS, a small denoising training strategy is employed that reduces the interference of noisy queries generated from real small objects. This approach effectively learns the features of small objects during the denoising process, sharpening the model's attention to small-sized objects. Additionally, to enhance the reliability of DPAKS's backbone, an auxiliary branch is introduced that provides supervision via shorter paths, improving the optimization of low-level feature parameters. This branch facilitates the transmission of gradient information suited for small objects without interfering with the detection of other sized objects. Furthermore, a new supervision head is proposed and added to the detection head of DPAKS, which categorizes object sizes based on artificial prior knowledge. This guides the model to effectively learn size categories and become more sensitive to small objects. Remarkably, DPAKS achieves competitive performance in small object detection without imposing additional computational burdens at the inference stage.

In addition, the time-varying parameters, strong coupling effects, and multiscale interactions of nonlinear systems further exacerbate the complexity of modelling and analysis. Therefore, in order to study nonlinear complex dynamic systems and to obtain their physical properties, this paper proposes a data-driven method, the nonlinear probing excitation method. Nonlinear complex dynamical systems are often regarded as black-box systems and cannot be explained directly. The method proposed in this paper constructs a data-driven model through inputs and outputs, which contains the essential properties of the system, and is able to extract the physical properties of the system from it, and then explains part of the black-box system, and by repeating this process, it is possible to construct multiple models, and obtain the physical properties of the system one by one, and ultimately complete the implementation of the interpretability of the whole black-box model. In this way, the correlation between the input and output of the system and the nonlinear nature of the system is established from the data-driven point of view, and the physical characteristics of the nonlinear system are obtained, in order to predict and control the behaviour of the nonlinear system."

    "abstract": "Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly essential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting a more sustainable transportation sector. However, EV adoption also introduces a significant electrical load. This paper analyzes real-world EV charging data alongside household electrical load data to evaluate the impact of EV charging on power distribution systems. The EV charging data were collected from a pilot program in Saskatchewan, Canada, while the household load data were obtained through advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in the same province. The pilot program categorized participants into three groups: Open Choice, Targeted Charging, and Peak Avoidance. The Targeted Charging and Peak Avoidance groups received incentives to shift their charging behavior and reduce peak demand. Our analysis shows that such incentives are highly effective in reducing peak demand—for example, the Targeted Charging group achieved a 51% reduction. However, simulation results indicate that incentivized charging can overload transformers in low-voltage power distribution systems. The study shows that the evaluated power distribution system can handle 2 EVs per house under normal conditions. However, under extreme conditions (e.g., hot days), the existing power infrastructure cannot handle 1 EV per house, even with incentives. In such cases, an optimized charging strategy is necessary. The study also indicates that the voltage sag is not the bottleneck of the EV penetration. This study provides a foundational reference for utilities to design smart EV charging programs, assess their impacts, and plan for future infrastructure needs."

In this research, we propose a flip scheme activated by a Normalized Path Metric (PM) range and a mismatch criterion, which respectively leverage the properties of SCL decoding and dynamic frozen bits of eBCH-polar codes. This work also improves the selection the flipping bits by modifying metric to account for the structure of dynamic frozen bits and reduce the search space. Based on these modifications, we proposed SCLF-1 and SCLF-2 decoding algorithms for eBCH-polar codes. Simulation results show that both of the proposed decoding schemes achieve superior performance compared to other contemporary decoding algorithms for CRC aided polar (CA-polar) codes, demonstrating enhanced error rates performance within the same decoding attempt."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose BeamLLM, a vision-empowered millimeter-wave (mmWave) beam prediction framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to enhance the accuracy and robustness of beam prediction. By integrating computer vision (CV) with LLMs’ cross-modal reasoning capabilities, the framework extracts user equipment (UE) positional features from RGB images and aligns visual-temporal features with LLMs’ semantic space through reprogramming techniques. Evaluated on a realistic vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenario, BeamLLM achieves 61.01% top-1 accuracy and 97.39% top-3 accuracy in standard prediction tasks, outperforming traditional deep learning models. In few-shot prediction scenarios, performance degradation is limited to 12.56% (top-1) and 5.55% (top3) from time sample 1 to 10, demonstrating superior prediction capability."

    "abstract": "Jamming devices disrupt signals from the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and pose a significant threat by compromising the reliability of accurate positioning. Consequently, the detection and localization of these interference signals are essential to achieve situational awareness, mitigating their impact, and implementing effective countermeasures. In this paper, we utilize a two-times-two patch antenna system (i.e., the software defined radio device Ettus USRP X440) to predict the angle, elevation, and distance to the jamming source based on in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples. We propose to use an inertial measurement unit (IMU) attached to the antenna system to predict the relative movement of the antenna in dynamic scenarios. We present a synthetic aperture system that enables coherent spatial imaging using platform motion to synthesize larger virtual apertures, offering superior angular resolution without mechanically rotating antennas. While classical angle-of-arrival (AoA) methods exhibit reduced accuracy in multipath environments due to signal reflections and scattering, leading to localization errors, we utilize a methodology that fuses IQ and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-computed spectrograms with 22 AoA features and the predicted relative movement to enhance GNSS jammer direction finding."

These concepts typically thrive on data and could be challenging to implement due to the semantic heterogeneity induced by the diverse manufacturing resources. Information modelling is a well-established approach traditionally used in software engineering to address semantic heterogeneity. Although the relevance of information modelling has already been established in CPPS, a suitable framework for information model development is not yet available. Therefore, our goal is to address this issue by proposing a domain-specific semantic information modelling framework for CPPS that enables the seamless integration of diverse manufacturing resources into intelligent business applications."

Some preliminary works have studied this traceability issue, enabling the identification of model leakers within the FL network when the model is maliciously distributed. However, these works often achieve traceability by compromising the identity privacy of legitimate Clients. In this paper, we propose AnonymTracker, an anonymous FL model leaker tracing scheme. To protect the anonymity of legitimate Clients, we design a group signature-based fingerprint embedding mechanism, combining group signatures with model watermarking for effective and undeniable leaker identification. We further embed unique fingerprints in each Client’s model during training and use a cosine-similarity-based metric to compare extracted and embed fingerprints in the tracing phase, enhancing leak identification accuracy. The security analysis demonstrates AnonymTracker’s protection of legitimate Clients’ identity anonymity. Experiments on benchmark datasets and models confirm its good effectiveness, fidelity, and robustness against various watermark removal attacks."

    "abstract": "Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) switch modeling offers an effective and simplified framework for analytical modeling of DC-DC converters. This systematically synthesizes both DC and small-signal AC models by replacing the nonlinear switching behaviour with a linearised equivalent three-terminal small-signal circuit. The technique provides a topology-independent model, which eases the analysis of converters in various topologies. The Fast Analytical Circuits Techniques (FACTs) are then used to derive control-to-output transfer functions in the form of low-entropy expressions, from where we can easily extract time constants, poles, and zeros. It bypasses the algebraic complexity associated with traditional methods such as state-space averaging (SSA). The resulting analytical expressions simplify the process of stability analysis and controller design by revealing the effect of components on system dynamics. The resulting expression of the analytical expressions simplifies the process of stability analysis and controller design by indicating the interaction of components on system dynamics. Analytical findings confirm the capability of the PWM switch model to model converter dynamics accurately, and is more precise than traditional models with a significant reduction in modeling time. This method is therefore of great benefit to the academic research and practical applications of power electronics."

    "abstract": "Near-field microwave imaging is a promising non-contact method for detecting subsurface anomalies. However, the impact of the air gap between the antenna and target on the image quality has not been systematically studied. In addition, many reconstruction techniques require background data, making reference-free imaging important for practical applications. This study investigates how antenna-to-target spacing affects imaging using a 1-port reflection-based setup with four patch antennas operating at 1.5, 2.43, 3, and 4 GHz. A distinct “null-point”- the standoff distance where the reflection coefficient is minimized - is identified and validated as the optimal spacing via simulations and experiments. ABS, clay, and water were used as dielectric targets with a water-filled container embedded in clay to simulate anomalies. For solid ABS, the first null-point ranges from 0.125λ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub> at 1.5 GHz to 0.03λ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub> at 4 GHz, with a larger range for the water-filled ABS block. The simulation and experimental results were in close agreement. A novel multi-spacing reference-free approach to near-field microwave imaging for subsurface anomaly detection with high contrast was presented. At optimal spacing, the Michelson contrast for water anomaly detection at 3 GHz increased to 74.5% compared to 42.4% at non-optimal spacing. The final reference-free images produced using the multi-spacing algorithm provided a contrast of 93.6% in the simulation and 91.2% in the measurement, validating the superior contrast performance of this approach. The Dice Loss also decreased from 0.251 to 0.116, demonstrating improved localization accuracy. This approach offers a cost-effective and practical solution for real-world deployment, without requiring reference data."

This study compares the efficacy of a webcam-based eye tracker to a research-focused screen-mounted eye tracker in code comprehension tasks. We conducted onsite experiments with 49 participants, each using both types of eye trackers simultaneously to assess the webcam-based eye tracker’s capability to capture visual patterns at general, semantic, and token levels and detect individual differences. Additionally, we conducted offsite experiments with 10 participants to supplement the findings. Our findings indicate that while the webcam-based eye tracker effectively captures programmers’ semantic comprehension, but faces challenges in accurately identifying cognitive patterns at a more detailed token level in onsite settings. Furthermore, the elevated noise observed in real-world offsite conditions significantly limits the tracker’s reliability for drawing accurate conclusions. Participants also encountered challenges with calibration and task initiation, highlighting areas for improvement in conducting webcam-based eye-tracking studies offsite in the future. <p xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">This study investigates the feasibility of webcam-based eye-tracking studies in SE, offers insights to enhance the accuracy of webcam-based eye-tracking in programming potentially, and provides guidelines for future webcam-based eye-tracking study designs.</p>"

    "abstract": "Accurate mapping of cropland field parcels (CFPs) is essential for efficient agricultural production and management. However, CFPs in high-resolution remote sensing imagery exhibit substantial variability in size, shape, and spatial distribution, making it challenging to accurately capture their features using only local or global information, which limits the mapping precision. To address this, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-transformer hybrid network with boundary guidance (CTHBNet) for effective CFP mapping from high-resolution imagery. CTHBNet comprises three key modules: 1) a CNN-transformer fusion encoder that integrates local and global features to enhance recognition of multi-scale parcels; 2) a hierarchical information fusion decoder that progressively restores parcel shapes to delineate complete boundaries; and 3) a boundary-guided feature enhancement module that refines the boundary clarity and reduces parcel adhesion. Moreover, a multi-task learning strategy jointly optimizes parcel extent, boundary, and distance features to improve the mapping precision. We evaluated CTHBNet on GaoFen-2 imagery across four distinct agricultural regions in China. The results showed that CTHBNet can achieve an overall accuracy of over 92%, an F1-score exceeding 82%, and a mean intersection over union exceeding 84%, demonstrating its effectiveness in CFP mapping. Comparative experiments confirmed the superior accuracy and boundary delineation of CTHBNet, and ablation experiments validated the effectiveness of each proposed module. Furthermore, experiments on five global regions and multiple public benchmarks further demonstrated its robust generalization capability. In particular, by fusing the complementary strengths of CNN and transformer models, CTHBNet significantly improves the representation of complex parcel boundaries and diverse shapes, thereby enhancing its adaptability to heterogeneous cropland structures and increasing the overall mapping precision."

The two key elements of the proposed policy include the construction of a set of convex layers (nested convex polygons) using the initial positions of the agents, and a novel search space region for each of the agents. The search space for an agent on a convex layer is defined as the region enclosed between the lines passing through the agent’s position and normal to its supporting edges. Guaranteeing collision-free paths, a goal assignment policy designates a unique goal position within the search space of an agent at the initial time itself, requiring no further computation thereafter. In contrast to the existing literature, this work presents a one-shot, collision-free solution to the circular distribution problem by utilizing only the initial positions of the agents. Illustrative examples and extensive Monte Carlo studies considering various practical attributes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

The results demonstrate significant improvements over the original channels, whose entropy source mainly relies on mobility and channel variations. More importantly, this scheme works well without extra helpers or multiple antennas, thus providing a potential for developing reliable, lightweight security solutions for resource-constrained devices in practice."

To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a multi-axis rail monitoring robot capable of single-plant life cycle management. By leveraging an end-cloud architecture, the system integrates real-time environmental monitoring with object detection models for growth analysis and breeding recommendations. Experiments in a simulated greenhouse showed 100% plant coverage, 91.3% pest detection accuracy, and savings of 493.92 hours per acre compared to manual propagation while consuming only 0.4313 kWh of energy.

However, estimation ambiguity can occur when the actual CFO exceeds the maximal capture range, which is determined by the time interval between the paired tracking reference symbols. This paper proposes a low-complexity method to resolve the CFO ambiguity issue using a leakage ratio (LR) function. The technique can significantly increase the effective CFO capture range without changing the time pattern of the tracking symbols. Our simulations also show that the proposed method can reliably classify the correct CFO candidate even in low SNR conditions."

A multi-segment adaptive steering strategy is further introduced to support smoothly varying scene trajectories while maintaining Doppler continuity and stable imaging geometry. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves orientation-adaptive beam tracking, ensures consistent resolution across segments, and significantly improves coverage efficiency compared with conventional sliding-spotlight operations."

Although deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown promise in complex decision tasks, existing approaches often struggle to accurately characterize vehicle interactions and to learn informative driving representations. To address these limitations, we propose a graph neural network-based multi-vehicle decision-making framework. The core of the framework is a spatial-temporal graph architecture that integrates graph attention networks (GAT) with temporal convolutional networks (TCN) to effectively model vehicle interactions and extract rich driving features for decisionmaking. The model is trained using a multi-agent deep Q-network (MADQN) algorithm. Extensive experiments in a highway offramp scenario demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines in key metrics such as average speed and task success rate, achieving a balanced performance in traffic efficiency, task completion, and driving safety."

A base station equipped with a movable uniform linear array (ULA) transmits sensing signals and receives echoes along a linear slide. By modeling the round-trip Doppler shifts caused by motion, we construct a spatio-temporal signal model and reinterpret the temporal phase variations as spatial shifts. This enables the synthesis of a virtual array with an aperture up to twice the physical displacement. A sparse recovery algorithm based on simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (SOMP) is employed for efficient DoA estimation. Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) analysis shows that the CRB scaling improves from first-order to third-order with respect to observation time, demonstrating the efficiency of motion-induced aperture synthesis. Simulations validate the analysis and confirm that MAL achieves accurate localization with minimal physical antennas, including the single-antenna case."

This work proposes the RIS-assisted NOMA-MEC in vehicular networks, considering dynamic challenges such as heterogeneous vehicle processing capability, time-varying channel from high-mobility and dynamic task workloads. We formulate a system latency minimization problem by jointly optimizing the task offloading ratio, edge server resource allocation and RIS passive beamforming, while satisfying the task deadline and Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) requirements. To overcome the limitations of conventional optimization methods in such dynamic environments, we propose a soft actor critic (SAC)-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, which dynamically adapts to real-time channel state information (CSI), task workload and vehicle processing capability of all vehicles. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach achieves lower latency performance compared with the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) baselines.

Regarding C-V2X single-hop communication, a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-based routing protocol has been proposed, where SNR between vehicles, RSUs, and BSs is used to assess communication paths as a metric. However, owing to blockage events between communication nodes, SNR values between nodes may fluctuate sharply; therefore, the conventional methods that use an instant SNR as a metric cannot ensure stable communication against blockage events. This paper proposes a novel blockage prediction-based 5G C-V2X routing method that enables the selection of links that remain stable over time. Specifically, assuming that future line-of-sight (LOS) conditions between nodes are available from on-vehicle camera images, we develop a routing method that avoids non-LOS paths to prevent communication failures in single-hop transmission. Moreover, we propose a blockage prediction-based scheduling method, ensuring packet transmission only in the LOS conditions for further reliable packet delivery. Our system-level simulation in an intersection environment defined by 3GPP demonstrates that the proposed blockage prediction-based routing protocol outperforms the conventional SNR-based routing protocol in terms of packet reception ratio."

    "abstract": "Electromagnetic interference (EMI) still poses a serious threat to reliable wireless communication, particularly in crowded and hostile electromagnetic environments. While space-time block coding (STBC) and other conventional diversity techniques have been extensively employed to mitigate multipath fading, their ability to mitigate EMI is inherently limited, especially when interference uniformly affects every component of the antenna. The spectral efficiency of Fluid Antenna (FA)-enabled Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems can be significantly enhanced by employing Index Modulation (IM). However, current FA-enabled IM (FAIM)-aided MIMO systems suffer from considerable performance degradation due to strong spatial correlation in the wireless channel, which is caused by the dense port distribution of the FA. In this paper, we propose an effective approach that integrates a Fluid Antenna System (FAS) with STBC to enhance system robustness in the presence of EMI. Simulation results show that integrating an FAS into a dual-antenna receiver employing STBC significantly improves spectral efficiency and reliability under EMI. At low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), the presence of EMI reduces Bit Error Rate (BER) performance by more than 12% when compared to the traditional arrangement without EMI. In contrast to the system affected by EMI without FAS, the BER curve closely resembles the scenario without EMI when FAS selection is used, resulting in a ~10% BER reduction at E<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">b</inf>/N<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</inf> = 6 dB. Similarly, the achievable rate bridges the performance gap caused by EMI by improving by more than 1.5 bps/Hz over the SNR range. These findings confirm that FAS is effective in reducing EMI and improving communication in unfriendly settings."

    "abstract": "The highly dynamic Low Earth Orbit (LEO) environment poses significant challenges for efficient and heterogeneous service provision. A promising approach is to use the communication links of LEO satellites as signals of opportunity, where opportunistic offloading techniques appear to improve the overall performance. However, current solutions often overlook the sophisticated predictive capabilities to exploit spatio-temporal correlation across multiple dimensions (e.g., link quality, node capacity, task requirements), failing to evaluate the quality of transient opportunities for offloading decisions. This paper proposes a Spatio-Temporal Transformer-based Opportunistic Task Offloading (STOTO) approach for heterogeneous tasks in dynamic LEO. The core of STOTO is a spatio-temporal Transformer prediction model, designed to achieve superior awareness of evolving service requirements and resource availability. Then, the scheme dynamically evaluates the situation and resource availability, allocating tasks to the optimal nodes in real time. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 8.4% higher task completion rates on average."

While existing solutions attempt to meet these demands, achieving both high-throughput processing and robust data integrity remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes an end-to-end distributed data pipeline and blockchain-enabled framework that integrates online anomaly detection, scalable data aggregation, and secure verification to ensure reliable cyber evolution. An Apache Kafka-based streaming pipeline ingests high-velocity sensor data and employs a dynamic bucketing strategy that finalizes buckets based on data volume, elapsed time, and network gas costs. Once validated, each bucket’s canonical sensor data representation is hashed and committed on-chain for tamper-evident storage. To enhance efficiency and security, the framework supports both Merkle tree and Verkle tree cryptographic data structures for comparative analysis. Implemented on a private Ethereum-like blockchain, our system efficiently handles large-scale sensor ingestion while enabling per-record verification. By integrating real-time anomaly correction, cryptographic proof mechanisms, and on-chain commitments, our solution delivers trustworthy, verifiable sensor streams tailored to the low-latency and high-reliability needs of next-generation systems."

This study proposes an integrated machine learning framework to predict and spatially map stunting risk by utilizing multidimensional data sources, including socioeconomic indicators, environmental factors, and health infrastructure data. Employing both supervised learning (Random Forest) and unsupervised learning (K-Means clustering), the framework enables reliable risk classification and geographical segmentation. The Random Forest model produced outstanding classification across four risk categories, while the K-Means clustering yielded coherent clusters verified by a silhouette score of 0.4058. The spatial visualization component blends clustering results with Geographic Information Systems (GIS), giving actionable risk maps associated with the strategic objectives of the North Sumatra Regional Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMD) 2019–2023. This technique enhances the precision of policy targeting in resource-constrained environments and provides a reproducible model for public health decision support. The findings show the practicality and policy importance of mixing data science with regional planning to reduce stunting through evidence-based therapies."

A prototype filter with complex frequency-domain coefficients is derived for odd-numbered subcarrier symbols by solving the problem.

    "abstract": "The heterogeneity of tasks in Marine Internet of Things (MIoT) poses unique challenges for efficient task offloading. Existing algorithms often struggle to adapt to diverse task requirements, resulting in suboptimal resource utilization and increasing system energy consumption. To address this issue, we propose a multi-access edge computing (MEC) system, consisting of two components: underwater acoustic communication and task offloading. In the underwater acoustic communication component, underwater sensor nodes (USNs) transmit their data packets to an ocean buoy (OB) using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology. The OB then offloads the received data packets to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) using orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) technology. Our goal is to minimize the total energy consumption of the system by jointly optimizing the transmission power for the USNs and the OB, as well as the binary variables representing the offloading decisions for data packets and the subcarrier allocation in OFDMA while satisfying delay constraints. Since this problem is non-convex, we decompose it into a top problem that optimizes the transmission power of the OB and the binary variables representing the offloading decisions for data packets and the subcarrier allocation in OFDMA, and a bottom problem that optimizes the transmission power of the USNs. To solve the bottom problem, we convexify it by transforming the problem and applying the successive convex approximation (SCA) method. For the top problem, we employ the chaotic evolution optimization (CEO) approach to optimize both discrete and continuous variables. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces energy consumption compared to existing algorithms, highlighting its potential to enhance the sustainability and efficiency of maritime IoT systems."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Inertial sensors based on vibrating transducers are becoming increasingly ubiquitous [1]–[9]. Among them, Vibrating Beam Accelerometers (VBAs) are reemerging as a compelling alternative to traditional pendulum accelerometers [10], thanks to their digital output, lower production costs, and inherent digital output [11]–[17].In the pursuit of improved performance, researchers in academia and industry are actively working to reduce error sources in these devices. One effective strategy to minimize common parasitic sensitivities, such as temperature or aging, involves adopting a differential configuration [11]–[17]. In this setup, two beams operate in a push-pull mode, where the frequency of each beam shifts in response to applied acceleration. The difference between these frequencies serves as a measure of acceleration. This method is commonly referred to as Frequency Modulated (FM) mode.However, as previously reported, though not extensively discussed in the literature, this differential mode has a critical limitation. Within a specific range of accelerations, referred to as the lock-in zone, both beams exhibit identical measured frequencies [14]–[19]. This results in a loss of sensitivity to external accelerations, thereby degrading the performance of the sensor.Interestingly, studies have shown that within this lock-in zone, the ratio of the amplitudes of the two beams remains sensitive to external acceleration [20]–[24]. This alternative operational mode, which uses amplitude rather than frequency as the sensing variable, is known as Amplitude Modulated (AM) mode.Recent studies have shown that the lock-in effect observed in axisymmetric Coriolis Vibrating Gyroscopes (CVGs) is a fundamentally physical phenomenon [25] and [26]. This means that CVGs become unresponsive to external angular velocity within the lock-in zone, regardless of whether they operate in FM or AM modes [26].This finding raises a natural question: Is the frequency lock-in observed in differential VBAs also an intrinsic physical effect, or is it merely an artifact of the sensing architecture or signal processing methods? This study aims to explore that question and beyond.We argue that, contrary to the common belief, frequency lock-in in differential VBAs is not a physically intrinsic phenomenon. Instead, it is an artifact introduced by the methods used to detect vibration frequencies. To distinguish this artifact from the well-established physical lock-in observed in other inertial sensors [25]–[27], we refer to it as \"pseudo-lock-in.\"In practical implementations, a frequency detection scheme is essential for monitoring beam vibrations. We demonstrate that a widely used technique, specifically, the zero-crossing frequency counter, is responsible for the apparent pseudo-lock-in behavior. This claim is supported by an analytical investigation of the simplest physical model of a differential VBA [14].We further extend the standard model of a differential VBA, which typically assumes identical beams, to a more realistic case involving unequal beams. Our analysis reveals that the primary effect of beam asymmetry is to shift the center of the pseudo-lock-in range away from zero acceleration.To provide a comprehensive understanding, we derive analytical expressions for the boundaries of the pseudo-lock-in zone and present formulas for its width and position. Based on these findings, we conclude that this analysis may offer a pathway toward resolving the pseudo-lock-in issue in VBAs operating in a differential configuration."

Existing authentication solutions depend on trusted integrators or centralized security anchors, which can expose sensitive data or create single points of failure. We introduce AuthenTree, a distributed authentication framework that leverages multi-party computation (MPC) in a scalable tree-based architecture, removing the need for dedicated security hardware or centralized trust. AuthenTree enables secure chiplet validation without revealing raw signatures, distributing trust across multiple integrator chiplets. Our evaluation in five SiP benchmarks demonstrates that AuthenTree imposes minimal overhead, with an area as low as 0.48 % (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$7,000 \\mu ~\\mathrm{m}^{2}$</tex>), an overhead power under 0.5 %, and an authentication latency below <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1 \\mu ~\\mathrm{s}$</tex>, bypassing previous work in some cases <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$700 \\times$</tex>.

Here, we design an ultra-broadband microwave metalens based on a single-layer plasmonic metasurface working at reflective regime. The meta-atom is constructed by a complementary split ring resonator which can realize ultra-broadband cross polarization conversion simultaneously with high efficiency. By applying a gradient phase metasurface with varying radius arrays, numerical simulations indicate that the designed microwave metalens can focus ultra-broadband microwaves from 16 GHz to 21 GHz, with a corresponding relative working bandwidth of 27%. The average focusing efficiency can reach a very high value of 80% within the working bandwidth. Moreover, the dispersion characteristic of ultra-broadband metalens shows a negative-positive hybrid dispersion which is distinct to previous reported broadband chromatic metalens with only single dispersion property."

    "abstract": "Intelligent transportation initiatives increasingly employ extensive networks of Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors in combination with fog-computing platforms that locate computational resources near data sources in both maritime and urban environments. Although such connectivity enhances traffic monitoring and control, it simultaneously broadens the attack surface, placing sensitive operational data at heightened risk. Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) simplifies cryptographic key management in these contexts; however, it remains constrained by key-escrow exposure and the practical complexity of securely distributing private keys. This study analyzes these limitations and evaluates the extent to which two quantum techniques, Blind Quantum Computation (BQC) and Quantum Annealing (QA), can provide effective solutions. In particular, BQC enables encrypted computation without disclosing the user’s identity to the processing server, thereby substantially mitigating the key-escrow vulnerability inherent in conventional IBE deployments. Meanwhile, QA is recommended for its ability to dynamically optimize network performance and security configurations. By synthesizing recent developments, discussing challenges, and recommending quantum-enhanced solutions, this study marks a significant step towards securing and optimizing smart transportation systems through advanced cryptographic techniques and quantum computing."

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a key paradigm for deploying AI models across large numbers of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in edge computing. While FL avoids uploading raw data to a central server, client privacy remains vulnerable during new client integration, when previously unseen devices first register their identities and cryptographic keys. A malicious or semi-honest central server (CS) can manipulate training to isolate target gradients, reconstruct local data, and tamper with aggregation. We study the Identity Forgery and Gradient Inversion Attack (IFGIA) against federated edge learning. By fabricating virtual clients and exploiting secure aggregation, a malicious CS can recover target gradients with success rates above 99.5% under realistic edge settings, revealing a critical weakness in existing privacy-preserving and verifiable FL schemes. To defend against IFGIA, we propose Robust Federated Learning (RFL), a framework tailored for edge computing that combines model splitting between edge clients and edge servers, lightweight differential privacy on intermediate representations, and split verification using digital signatures and homomorphic hashes. Experiments show that RFL reduces IFGIA's success rate to 73.6%, shrinks per-client communication from 375 MB to 40 KB, accelerates edge-side training by at least 10×, and maintains competitive accuracy."

A tractable error system is established, where the coordinate transformation technique and interval matrix method are employed to handle cooperation-competition interactions and the memristive connection weights, respectively. A coopetition-dependent event-triggered controller is constructed, which can reduce network bandwidth utilization and eliminate Zeno behavior. Taking into account the residual terms, the system delay, the finite-time constraint, and the influence of cooperation-competition interactions, some new control parameters are introduced into the designed controller. By resorting to the inequality techniques and the Lyapunov theory, a finite-time bipartite synchronization criterion is established. Then, within the established theoretical framework, an optimization model is designed to achieve bipartite synchronization in minimal time. Accordingly, a sparrow search-based optimization algorithm is employed to derive the optimal controller parameters. Finally, effectiveness and advantages of this research are validated through both a numerical example and a practical application."

This enables such models to execute covert tasks while remaining undetected. Despite the rapid progress in deep functionality hiding, countermeasures remain unexplored. In this paper, we propose Distribution Offset Analysis (DOA), a novel method for detecting hidden functionalities in DLMs. Our key insight is that the weight distribution of a benign DLM typically follows a Gaussian distribution, whereas a container DLM with hidden functionalities exhibits notable statistical deviations from this Gaussian pattern. In our methodology, we first compute the distributional distance (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e.,</i> offsets) between the model's weights and an ideal Gaussian distribution. We then fuse these offsets with weight features into a unified representation, which is subsequently used to train a meta-classifier for hidden functionality detection. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DOA method, which achieves an average detection rate of over 87% against existing state-of-the-art deep functionality hiding techniques."

To this end, we propose RGM-YOLO (RefConv–GhostNet–CBAM-enhanced YOLOv8 ), which introduces deformable convolution and channel attention via RefConv and GhostNet modules, and experimentally validates it on the BDL-PCB (Bare Die on Laminate–Printed Circuit Board) large-scale dataset. Experimental results show that RGM-YOLO achieves 94.2% in mAP50 and 67.3% in mAP90–95, representing improvements of 2.4% and 11.2% over the baseline model, YOLOv8. The number of parameters and GFLOPs is reduced by 4.2M and 2.5G, respectively, while the FPS increases from 78 to 102. This approach offers a high-precision, low-latency defect detection paradigm for edge IoVT devices targeting small defects and can be generalized to other industrial quality-inspection scenarios."

    "abstract": "The early screening of cervical cancer relies on the accurate identification of cell nuclei in microscopic images, but the cells are distributed in different focal planes under high magnification, resulting in local blur in a single frame image. Traditional fusion algorithms are difficult to meet the real-time requirements due to high computational complexity, and deep learning-based methods are limited by hardware cost and data dependence. In this paper, according to the gray characteristics of Pap staining cervical nucleus (the pixel value in clear areas is lower), a lightweight multi-focus image fast fusion algorithm is proposed. The fusion image is directly synthesized by extracting the minimum gray value of the RGB channel of the multi-focus plane image pixel by pixel. In addition, a coarse-fine double-step search strategy is used to quickly locate the optimal focal plane, and a dynamic threshold mechanism is introduced to reduce redundant calculations. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art multi-focus image fusion performance in cervical cytology applications."

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been increasingly adopted in traffic management and surveillance applications; however, detecting small and densely distributed vehicles in complex urban environments remains a prominent challenge. To address this issue, we propose GMSNet, an enhanced detector tailored for concurrent small and dense vehicle detection, incorporating three core innovations. First, a Global-Multi-Simple ResNet (G-ResNet) backbone integrates the self-designed Global Convolutional Attention Module (GCM) into residual units, enabling effective capture of long-range contextual dependencies while preserving fine-grained spatial details. Second, a selfdeveloped Multi-path Convolution-enhanced PAN (M-PAN) neck strengthens multi-scale feature aggregation by fusing contextual information across different levels, thereby improving the representation capability of dense vehicle features. Third, a SimAM-integrated Detection Head (S-Head) embeds the existing parameter-free SimAM attention mechanism prior to the detection head, which adaptively emphasizes salient vehicle features and suppresses irrelevant background noise, while optimizing computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on UAV-based vehicle detection benchmarks demonstrate that GMSNet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both detection accuracy and inference speed, providing a reliable solution for small and dense vehicle detection in UAV imagery within complex urban scenarios."

    "abstract": "The perception of a single vehicle has limitations. In contrast, vehicle-infrastructure cooperative perception can share perception information among nodes, overcoming view limitations and occlusion for more comprehensive environmental awareness. However, vehicle-infrastructure cooperative perception encounters two main challenges: the trade-off between perception performance and communication bandwidth, and the negative impact of communication delay on perception. To address these challenges, this paper devises a cooperative data transmission algorithm with delay compensation that innovatively combines feature selection and delay compensation to reduce data volume and offset delays. The algorithm exploits spatial value differences for dynamic feature selection, reducing data transmission while maintaining key performance, and has a receiving-end designment to synchronize the asynchronous features. Simulation results show that the proposed a Sparse BEV Feature Transmission Algorithm with Delay Compensation (DC-SBEVTx) significantly reduces data transmission volume in bandwidth-limited scenarios while maintaining acceptable Average Precision (AP). It also maintains high AP under communication delays, outperforming baseline methods in terms of AP across various conditions, such as different average delay and position noise levels."

    "abstract": "In this paper, a joint optimal allocation of transmit power at the source and jamming power at the destination is proposed to maximize the average secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) of a wireless network within a finite time duration. The destination transmits the jamming signal to improve secrecy by utilizing full-duplex capability. The source and destination both have energy harvesting (EH) capability with limited battery capacity. Due to the Markov nature of the system, the problem is formulated as a finite-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) problem. We propose the finite-horizon joint power allocation (FHJPA) algorithm for the finite-horizon RL problem and compare it with a low-complexity greedy algorithm (GA). An infinite-horizon joint power allocation (IHJPA) algorithm is also proposed for the corresponding infinite-horizon problem. A comparative analysis of these algorithms is carried out in terms of SEE, expected total transmitted secure bits, and computational complexity. The results show that the FHJPA algorithm outperforms the GA and IHJPA algorithms due to its appropriate modelling in finite horizon transmission. When the source node battery has sufficient energy, the GA can yield performance close to the FHJPA algorithm despite its low-complexity. When the transmission time horizon increases, the accuracy of the infinite-horizon model improves, resulting in a reduced performance gap between FHJPA and IHJPA algorithms. The computational time comparison shows that the FHJPA algorithm takes 16.6 percent less time than the IHJPA algorithm."

To address these, this paper proposes the DynamicStatic Multi-scale Network (DSMS-Net), an end-to-end Siamese framework. DSMS-Net introduces two novel components. First, the Adaptive Difference Module (ADM) employs a dynamic kernel generation mechanism to adaptively compute spatio-temporal differences, which effectively suppresses pseudo-changes caused by illumination or misalignment. Second, the Hierarchical Multiscale Fusion (HMF) module uses a multi-branch, dualattention architecture to meticulously refine and fuse change features across diverse scales, preserving both semantic context and spatial details. The network is validated on the challenging LEVIR-CD and WHU-CD public benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that DSMS-Net achieves competitive accuracy with significantly reduced computational cost, confirming its potential for efficient and high-precision change detection in practical applications."

To overcome challenges such as complex geometric transformations, noise, and novel object categories, we propose the ProgressivePointCLIP framework, which fuses adaptive sampling with a gradient-guided strategy. This approach comprises three key stages-adaptive dynamic sampling, gradient-regularized multiview projection, and a progressive learning mechanism-that jointly preserve crucial geometric cues, align cross-modal information, and enable continual learning in evolving environments. Progressive-PointCLIP maintains strong performance under severe noise, viewpoint shifts, and category expansion, showing clear advantages in zero-shot inference, semantic segmentation, and cross-modal retrieval. Comparative evaluations indicate substantial reductions in cross-modal feature inception distance, marked gains in recall, and lower inference latency. Ablation studies and visual analyses verify that the mutual reinforcement of these sub-modules heightens three-dimensional feature extraction, enhances point-cloud fidelity, and accelerates processing. Consequently, Progressive-PointCLIP stands as a robust solution for dynamic three-dimensional sensing and offers a foundation for real-world deployment of point-cloud technologies."

This paper explores the integration of covert communication techniques with deep reinforcement learning to bolster security in wireless networks. Covert communication, which prevents adversaries from detecting transmissions, is a critical factor in protecting data transmission over vulnerable wireless channels. This paper considers a two-hop wireless system model that is optimized using a double-deep Q-network algorithm. The problem is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process, jointly optimizing relay selection, transmission, and jamming powers to maximize covert communication rates while minimizing detection by adversarial wardens. Comprehensive numerical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method under various system conditions, including different configurations of relay and jamming powers. The results confirm that our model aligns well with theoretical expectations and substantially enhances covert communication by intelligently adapting to environmental dynamics."

However, the sequential nature of sensor data makes manual annotation extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming, severely limiting the scalability of traditional supervised learning approaches. To address this challenge, self-supervised learning (SSL) has become a highly promising alternative by enabling the extraction of effective feature representations from large amounts of unlabeled data.In this work, we propose a novel attention-guided time-channel masking strategy for self-supervised learning in HAR tasks. Unlike traditional random masking methods, our approach utilizes multi-head attention mechanisms to dynamically select and mask the most discriminative portions of the sequence, thereby guiding the model to learn deeper structural patterns and salient features within the data. Extensive experiments conducted on three public datasets — MotionSense, USC-HAD, and UCI-HAR — demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms both traditional random masking and fully supervised baselines in terms of macro-averaged F1-score and classification accuracy. Furthermore, ablation studies validate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed attention-guided masking strategy under different masking ratios, with particularly notable advantages observed at lower masking rates. These results collectively confirm the effectiveness and potential applicability of our method for enhancing self-supervised representation learning in HAR tasks."

However, the high data dimensionality, complex pattern structures, and scarcity of anomaly samples present significant detection challenges. Existing machine learning and deep learning methods often suffer from limitations in detection accuracy or computation complexity. To resolve these problems, we propose a successive Support Vector Machine (SSVM)-based anomaly detection approach for EV charging piles. SSVM consists of multiple Support Vector Machine (SVM) modules in a layered architecture, with each layer incrementally improving detection accuracy by capturing subtle feature differences. We also propose a training method for optimizing SSVM's parameters and hyperparameters, significantly reducing the training time. Experiments on a real-world EV charging pile dataset demonstrate that SSVM achieves a superior trade-off between detection performance and inference time across different training sample sizes, compared to existing methods such as SVM, random forest (RF), and convolutional neural network-long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM). The significant improvements highlight the practical value of SSVM in EV charging pile anomaly detection."

A dataset of 138 images was gathered and analyzed to extract key morphological characteristics, such as color, size, roundness, contrast, and entropy. The previously mentioned qualities were utilized to categorize mud crabs into three quality grades: A, B, and C. The performance evaluation, utilizing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, indicated that the KNN model with 97.59% outperformed the fuzzy logic system with 89.16%. A prototype utilizing the KNN model was constructed and was tested on new samples, producing outstanding results. The study concluded that machine learning-based grading, such as the KNN classifier, is viable for evaluating the quality of Scylla olivacea, providing an accurate alternative to traditional techniques. Recommendations include enhancement of the automated grading system by expanding the dataset with more diverse images and additional mud crab species to improve adaptability and accuracy, and by exploring a hybrid KNN-fuzzy logic model.

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of intelligent driving technologies, many advanced driving applications require deterministic, low-latency, and high-bandwidth transmissions. Data Distribution Service (DDS) and Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) are the core technologies to meet the low-latency requirements of in-vehicle systems due to their real-time and deterministic trans-mission characteristics. However, the deep integration of DDS and TSN introduces new challenges for end-to-end application-level coordinated scheduling. To address these challenges in architectures where distributed sensor networks coexist with centralized computing resources, this paper proposes a joint task and network scheduling framework based on a multi-core Central Computing Platform (CCP). By constructing a time-dependency chain model spanning sensors, computing units, and actuators, we model application and communication tasks as a task tree compatible with the DDS publish–subscribe mechanism. Scheduling constraints from both application end systems and TSN are formulated and solved using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), thereby ensuring full-link Quality of Service (QoS) from environmental perception to execution control. Simulation experiments conducted under different optimization objectives demonstrate that the proposed method effectively addresses the scheduling problem of time-dependent chains while satisfying strict QoS requirements."

However, the complex texture, noise, and artifacts make precise IVUS image segmentation challenging. This study proposes an efficient automatic lumen segmentation method for IVUS images and develops the TransSegNet model. Based on the TransFuse-S architecture, the network introduces an innovative improvement by integrating the ASPP module into the feature maps from the DeiT branch output and the ResNet50 final layer. This multi-scale feature fusion mechanism enhances fine-grained vascular boundary representation. Experiments on a self-constructed augmented dataset demonstrate that TransSegNet achieves excellent performance with a Dice coefficient of 0.951, a Jaccard index of 0.909, and a Hausdorff distance of 0.110 while maintaining real-time processing speed. Comparisons with mainstream models show that TransSegNet improves the three metrics by 1.8%, 2.7%, and 19.7%, respectively, compared to TCBFormer. Compared to the computationally intensive FCBFormer, TransSegNet achieves a 3000× speedup with only a 0.8% Dice accuracy loss. Compared to TransFuse-S, it maintains a Dice advantage (+2.2%) while significantly reducing the Hausdorff distance by 19.4%. This study provides a balanced solution between accuracy and efficiency for real-time IVUS analysis."

    "abstract": "The advancement of self-driving technology is driven by the need for robust perception and navigation systems. Simulators for autonomous driving facilitate the rapid development and testing of navigation algorithms; however, a key issue for most is their inaccurate modeling of the radar sensor. This is a significant drawback as radars offer robust sensing capabilities in adverse weather conditions and occlusions. CARLA, a widely adopted open-source simulator, provides a simplistic radar model that fails to capture the complex physical and material-dependent behavior of real-world radar. To address these limitations, we present CShenron, a radar simulation framework integrated into CARLA, which generates realistic radar measurements by fusing LiDAR and camera data. C-Shenron also supports configurable radar parameters, multiple sensor placements, and scalable dataset generation. Our evaluations demonstrate that radar-camera fusion models, trained with C-Shenron’s generated data, achieve performance equivalent to traditional LiDAR-camera baselines on key metrics from the CARLA leaderboard."

Swin Transformer is adopted to segment various urban communication scenarios on our remote sensing imagery dataset and achieves satisfactory recognition accuracy. Subsequently, we perform electromagnetic parameter matching and prediction of real-time channel characteristics based on the 6G pervasive channel model (6GPCM) according to the recognition and segmentation results.

Further, the CSIC based PLS optimization model is proposed, where the expectation of the secrecy rate is maximized under the PLS requirement and the radar CRB based constraint. The corresponding CSIC semidefinite relaxation (CSIC-SDR) based iteration algorithm is developed to achieve the beamforming design with the aid of one-dimension search of the optimal CRB based sensing measure. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed CSIC-SDR outperforms the norm-bound CSI based and circularly symmetric complex Gaussian distribution CSI based beamforming designs in terms of the PLS performance."

Current research on multi-Quality of Service (QoS) scheduling has yet to adequately adapt to heterogeneous dynamic scenarios, which are characterized by varying periods, deadlines, and transmission units, resulting in limited scalability and inefficient resource utilization. To tackle these issues, this study introduces a Deep Q-Network algorithm enhanced with a Reward Backtracking mechanism (RB-DQN), designed to optimize slot scheduling in industrial wireless networks with mixed and heterogeneous QoS demands. This method comprehensively considers the influence of heterogeneous transmission units, deadlines, and packet generation times on resource allocation, and devises a joint metric to guarantee QoS for diverse data types. Furthermore, RB-DQN integrates delayed feedback to mitigate slot overlapping conflicts arising from disparate transmission unit sizes, thereby enhancing resource utilization efficiency. Extensive simulation results indicate that, in comparison to existing scheduling strategies, the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the delay and jitter for delay-sensitive data, while maintaining the continuity and stability of video data streams."

Unlike the traditional EM algorithm, we derive a modified EM algorithm by incorporating suitable priors for the channel coefficients to estimate the aggregate channel. Simulation results show that the proposed EM algorithm for the SCF-mMIMO system achieves good performance with fewer pilots, approaching that of the ML estimation. In addition, the modified EM algorithm using channel priors outperforms traditional EM algorithms.

    "abstract": "In today's technologically driven landscape, reverse engineering and intellectual property (IP) piracy pose serious threats to integrated circuits (ICs), especially as design and fabrication are increasingly outsourced across global supply chains. Logic locking has emerged as a promising defense by obfuscating circuit functionality through key-contingent logic. However, selecting and implementing a logic locking technique that balances security against modern attack vectors, as well as area and power efficiency, remains a challenge. State-of-the-art techniques often lack application-specific adaptability, rely on outdated strategies, and require manual key insertion. To address these challenges, we propose a novel machine learning (ML)-based framework that automates the prediction and implementation of locking mechanisms based on the architectural characteristics of hardware designs. We evaluate various ML classifiers to identify the most effective key-gate insertion strategy, and the Random Forest classifier achieves the best performance with 97% prediction accuracy. Beyond automation, the framework is enriched with Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) to support real-time key-gate updates. By dynamically reconfiguring logic-locked key-gates at runtime, DPR introduces an additional post-deployment security layer that resists static and side-channel attacks. Experimental evaluation on ISCAS'85 benchmarks demonstrates that DPR integration delivers strong adaptability and enhanced resilience against IP piracy with minimal overhead, making it practical for security-critical applications."

By leveraging the sparsity of the channel in the delay-Doppler domain and achieving full diversity gain, message passing (MP)-based detectors are considered highly promising nonlinear detectors for OTFS. However, these detectors typically use empirically-driven constant damping factors to control the convergence of the algorithm, which significantly limits the stability of algorithm performance. In this paper, we innovatively propose the Functional Damping Factor-Message Passing (FD-MP) algorithm. This algorithm achieves dynamic optimization of the damping factor by establishing a function model with the value of the probability mass function as the independent variable. By constructing multiple evaluation methods for the function model, we have verified that the proposed scheme, with a fixed functional damping factor, can achieve a better bit error rate (BER) performance than the MP algorithm under different channel conditions while maintaining the same computational complexity. This innovation significantly enhances OTFS detection performance and environmental adaptability, providing support for the practical implementation of OTFS systems."

The maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm can achieve theoretically optimal performance. However, the exponential complexity limits its practical application. This paper designs an AFDM signal detection algorithm based on expectation propagation (EP). The proposed EP-based scheme achieves effective AFDM signal detection by iteratively updating messages to approximate the true a posterior distribution. In addition, this paper further reduces the complexity of the proposed EP-based algorithm by utilizing the characteristics of the discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT) domain equivalent channel. Specifically, the sparsity and quasi-banded structure of the DAFT domain channel are first utilized for block processing. Subsequently, a low complexity matrix inversion operation is realized by combining the lower-upper (LU) factorization and the upper triangular matrix forward substitution algorithm. With typical AFDM system parameters, the proposed scheme reduces the complexity by 35.6 times compared to the traditional EP algorithm, while the performance is virtually unaffected. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme has a performance gain of up to 5 dB over the conventional algorithm."

To maximize task completion ratios within strict deadlines while minimizing latency and energy consumption, we model the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). Building on this formulation, we propose a multi-agent deterministic policy gradient approach based on MADDPG, where each agent dynamically selects priority classes, assigns tasks to edge servers, and optimizes CPU frequency allocation using only local observations. Simulation results demonstrate that our MADDPG framework not only meets task prioritization objectives but also achieves performance comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of centralized value function-based methods. These findings highlight the ad-vantages of distributed decision-making and localized resource management in complex VEC environments."

    "abstract": "To address the challenge of anti-jamming transmission in wireless communication systems under complex interference environments, this paper proposes a movable antennas systems anti-jamming transmission scheme based on deep unfolding networks. Although existing research has enhanced the diversity of anti-jamming strategies through mobile antenna technology, its optimization algorithms are complex, system overhead is large, and traditional deep learning schemes face problems such as strong data dependence and poor interpretability. Therefore, this paper innovatively introduces deep unfolding networks into the design of movable antennas systems, achieving efficient optimization through the fusion of algorithm unfolding and neural networks. Specifically, for the multi-jammer confrontation scenario, the non-convex joint optimization problem is decoupled into an alternating optimization problem of the receiving beamforming vector and antenna position, where the beamforming is solved in closed form through the generalized Rayleigh quotient. Further, by mapping the iterative optimization steps to the hidden layers of the neural network, a lightweight deep unfolding framework is constructed, significantly reducing the computational complexity of traditional iterative algorithms. Simulation results verify the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed scheme in real-time anti-jamming transmission under jamming environments."

    "abstract": "Functional electrical stimulation (FES) has emerged as a promising technique for motor rehabilitation, yet quantifying its effects remains challenging. While current assessment methods utilizing clinical scales, kinematic parameters, and biomarkers offer comprehensive evaluations, they fail to delineate the specific motor function domains influenced by FES, and quantify both therapeutic outcomes and functional improvements. To address these limitations, we introduced multi-objective decision analysis method to propose a novel multidimensional evaluation framework for assessing FES-driven motor performance under varying stimulation parameters. This study represents the first systematic analysis of the effects of different FES parameters on motor function from three dimensions: movement execution completeness, dynamic movement stability, and muscle fatigue. For this, we collected surface electromyogram (EMG) and inertial signals under different parameters of FES-driven wrist movements. As a result, we found a relationship between the FES stimulus parameters and different movement level features. Our findings demonstrate that completion indicators generally increased with increasing stimulus amplitude, while movement stability indicators showed an inverse relationship with stimulus frequency. Notably, fatigue indicators exhibited dual trends, reflecting different aspects of motor unit performance. Further analysis showed revealed that our proposed model was sensitive to changes in stimulus parameter conditions while maintaining consistent evaluation rankings as sample sizes increase. This work establishes a novel, cost-effective model and methodology to quantify motor function and stimulus effects during FES application, providing a crucial foundation for subsequent precise modulation of FES parameters and timely evaluation of rehabilitation progress."

    "abstract": "Encrypted traffic classification has become a crucial task for network management and security with the widespread adoption of encrypted protocols across the Internet and the Internet of Things. However, existing methods often rely on discrete representations and complex models, which leads to incomplete feature extraction, limited fine-grained classification accuracy, and high computational costs. To this end, we propose TrafficAudio, a novel encrypted traffic classification method based on audio representation. TrafficAudio comprises three modules: audio representation generation (ARG), audio feature extraction (AFE), and spatiotemporal traffic classification (STC). Specifically, the ARG module first represents raw network traffic as audio to preserve temporal continuity of traffic. Then, the audio is processed by the AFE module to compute low-dimensional Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), encoding both temporal and spectral characteristics. Finally, spatiotemporal features are extracted from MFCC through a parallel architecture of one-dimensional convolutional neural network and bidirectional gated recurrent unit layers, enabling fine-grained traffic classification. Experiments on five public datasets across six classification tasks demonstrate that TrafficAudio consistently outperforms ten state-of-the-art baselines, achieving accuracies of 99.74%, 98.40%, 99.76%, 99.25%, 99.77%, and 99.74%. Furthermore, TrafficAudio significantly reduces computational complexity, achieving reductions of 86.88% in floating-point operations and 43.15% of model parameters over the best-performing baseline."

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for privacy preservation of modern power grids is constantly expanding. A single privacy-preserving mechanism is gradually unable to cope with the problem of privacy leakage in distributed energy management of microgrids. To solve this problem, a multiple privacy preservation scheme for distributed energy management of microgrids is proposed. The proposed scheme integrates attenuated differential privacy (ADP) with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), and is embedded within the distributed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), with the objective of minimizing power generation costs while preserving sensitive information from distributed generators (DGs). The convergence of the algorithm under mixed noise and encryption mechanism is strictly proved by constructing an extended Lyapunov function, and multiple indicators are used to reflect the advantages of multiple privacy preservation mechanism in privacy-cost trade-off. The efficacy and scalability of the proposed scheme is verified by the simulations on IEEE 30-bus and 118-bus system. It is demonstrated by the simulation results that despite the additional time cost, the privacy preservation efficacy and economy of the proposed scheme are better than a single mechanism."

Transformer-based methods alleviate these issues by modeling long-range dependencies, but many existing designs are multi-stage and inefficient, or fail to adequately address noise and contextual bias in RS data. This work proposes CAMformer, a single-stage hybrid CNN–Transformer framework that jointly captures local details and global semantics for more reliable pseudo-label generation. To further improve robustness, we introduce an inter-class decoupling strategy (ICD) to resolve category conflicts, an uncertainty-weighted optimization (UWO) scheme to suppress noisy activations, and a context intervention sample enhancement (CISE) module to mitigate biased contextual dependencies. Extensive experiments on the challenging iSAID and ISPRS Vaihingen datasets demonstrate that CAMformer achieves state-of-the-art performance with 39.5% and 46.4% mIoU respectively, surpassing recent one-stage methods, while cross-domain validation on PASCAL VOC2012 confirms its generalization to a certain extent. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining CNN–Transformer hybrids with context-aware learning for WSSS in RS applications."

To this end, we design a model-driven deep learning for OTFS detection in the presence of unknown PN in V2X communication. In particular, we propose an iterative detection algorithm in the delay-Doppler domain to diminish the inter-carrier interference (ICI) caused by PN based on variational inference theory, which constitutes an approximate probabilistic inference technique associated with variational free energy minimization. Additionally, by inducing some trainable parameters, we further develop an unfolding approach to rapidly convergence and improve performance in deep learning manner. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed detector reveals state-of-art performance comparing with other solutions in terms of bit error ratio (BER)."

    "abstract": "Emotion Causality Analysis in Conversations is a critical research field that provides deep insights into the psychological and behavioral dynamics of individuals during interactions. Previous research has typically framed emotion causality analysis in conversations as an utterance-level classification problem. However, this coarse-grained approach often results in models capturing only superficial associations between emotional utterances and their cause utterances, rather than understanding the genuine causal relationships. This limitation undermines the generalizability of these models. However, this coarse-grained methodology often leads to models merely capturing the superficial correlations between emotional expressions and their corresponding cause statements, instead of delving into and comprehending the authentic causal connections. This limitation undermines the generalizability of these models. Additionally, existing methods are often criticized for their lack of interpretability, which significantly restricts their practical applications. In this paper, we introduce DualECot, a novel dual-view reasoning framework that leverages Chain-of-Thought to comprehensively analyze the emotional dynamics in conversations.

We then assessed the framework's effectiveness via in-context learning and supervised experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that DualECot not only achieves superior performance, but also enhances explainability and generalization capabilities. We will release our annotation as an open resource for the community.Specifically, the framework consists of two complementary reasoning chains.

    "abstract": "Semantic labels are inherently tied to geometry and luminance reconstruction, as entities with similar shapes and appearances often share categories. Traditional methods use synthesis-analysis, NeRF, or 3D Gaussian representations to encode semantics and geometry separately. However, 2D methods lack view consistency, NeRF extensions are slow, and faster 3D Gaussian methods risk spatial and channel inconsistencies between semantic and RGB. Moreover, these methods require costly manual dense semantic labels. To alleviate resource demands and achieve effective semantic reconstruction with sparse inputs while enhancing RGB rendering quality, we build upon 3D Gaussian by integrating semantic features from pre-trained models-requiring no additional ground truth input-into Gaussian features, and construct a hypergraph neural network to capture higher-order correlations across RGB and semantic information as well as between different frames. Hypergraphs use hyperedges to link multiple vertices, capturing complex relationships essential for cross-modal tasks. This higher-order structure addresses the limitations of NeRF and Gaussian methods, which lack the capacity for such advanced associations. This framework enables precise novel view synthesis and 2D semantic reconstruction without manual annotations, achieving state-of-the-art results for RGB and semantic tasks on room-scale scenes in the ScanNet and Replica datasets, while supporting real-time rendering speeds of 34 FPS."

Cross-sectional ultrasound measured nerve cross-sectional area and flattening ratio. Twelve subject-specific FEA models analyzed stress distributions in the nerve, while DTI evaluated diffusion tensor of the median nerve indicating microstructural properties. Correlations between biomechanical and microstructural parameters were examined. Results showed that cross-sectional area, axial strain, von Mises stress, maximum principal stress, and frictional anisotropy of the median nerve decreased from the carpal tunnel inlet to outlet. Strong and significant correlations (r>0.8, P<0.05) were found among these parameters. Our findings in healthy individuals suggest that segmental nerve displacement creates localized strain, particularly at the carpal tunnel inlet. These potential biomechanical vulnerabilities could contribute to the initiation or progression of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, a hypothesis requiring further clinical investigation."

    "abstract": "Deadbeat predictive current control (DPCC) scheme has been widely applied in permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive systems due to its superior dynamic response and current tracking performance. However, the control performance of conventional DPCC is susceptible to inherent one-step control delays and motor parameter mismatches. To address these challenges, a minimum-delay DPCC (MD-DPCC) strategy with model mismatch compensation is proposed in this paper. Differing from conventional method that relies on the average stator voltage equations of the motor, the proposed strategy constructs the transient current ripple prediction model by minimizing the delay between the sampling instant and system update instant. This prediction model ensures high performance and robustness even when affected by nonlinear disturbances such as model parameter mismatches. Furthermore, the mathematical expression of this transient model at various sampling instants is derived and discussed in detail. To further enhance steady-state accuracy, an improved feedback correction loop is introduced, which leverages the high-precision current prediction to effectively eliminate steady-state errors. Finally, experimental results conducted on a SPMSM drive platform based on STM32H742 validate that the proposed MD-DPCC strategy achieves fast and precise current tracking as well as strong robustness to model parameter variations."

The transmitter and receiver are first pre-trained under AWGN to establish a stable baseline. Subsequently, a conditional GAN (cGAN)-based equalizer is introduced at the receiver side to adaptively mitigate unknown fading effects without requiring explicit channel state information (CSI). The framework is validated in practical multi-antenna wireless environments, demonstrating strong compatibility with modern communication systems. Additionally, a quality-aware loss function balances pixel fidelity and perceptual video quality. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms conventional H.264+LDPC baselines, achieving up to 4.2 dB PSNR gain under fast-fading channels."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate a novel wireless powered mobile edge computing (MEC) system assisted by pinching antennas (PAs), where devices first harvest energy from a base station and then offload computation-intensive tasks to an MEC server. As an emerging technology, PAs utilize long dielectric waveguides embedded with multiple localized dielectric particles, which can be spatially configured through a pinching mechanism to effectively reduce large-scale propagation loss. This capability facilitates both efficient downlink energy transfer and uplink task offloading. To fully exploit these advantages, we adopt a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) framework and formulate a joint optimization problem to maximize the system’s computational capacity by jointly optimizing device transmit power, time allocation, PA positions in both uplink and downlink, and radiation control. To address the resulting non-convexity caused by variable coupling, we develop an alternating optimization algorithm that integrates particle swarm optimization (PSO) with successive convex approximation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PA-assisted design substantially improves both energy harvesting efficiency and computational performance compared to conventional antenna systems."

Traditional methods struggle with challenges such as varying road widths, occlusions, and background noise. This paper proposes an improved U-Net architecture that integrates channel and spatial attention modules between the encoder and decoder to enhance feature capture at road edges and intersections. Additionally, a multi-scale feature fusion strategy, inspired by D-LinkNet, addresses road width variability and noise interference. Drawing from Transformer-based attention mechanisms, the model ensures robust performance on small-scale datasets. Experiments on the Kaggle Road Segmentation Data dataset demonstrate superior results, achieving an IoU of 76.3% and F1 score of 76.4%, outperforming the baseline UNet by 5.2% in IoU and recent state-of-the-art models. Ablation studies confirm the contributions of each module, while cross-scene and noise robustness analyses highlight the model's generalization. This approach provides a lightweight, efficient solution for high-precision road extraction in remote sensing applications."

In this paper, we propose a neural demodulator that incorporates an additional probability layer to mitigate performance degradation in BICM systems. Furthermore, we introduce Joint Model-1, which integrates this neural demodulator with a belief propagation (BP) decoder for 16-QAM polar-coded BICM. To further improve performance, we use Joint Model-1 as a pre-trained model and extend it by adding an additional dense layer, resulting in Joint Model-2. Experimental results show that Joint Model-2 surpasses both BICM and BICM-ID systems under Ungerboeck labeling."

To deal with the optimization problem of channel selection, an improved Max-logit learning algorithm is proposed to optimize the distributed channel selection strategy, which reduces system interference and improves network throughput through a heterogeneous learning rate and appropriate the unaltered action probability. Experimental results validate that the proposed algorithm provides a significant reduction in cumulative interference, as well as improves spectrum utilization and network throughput. In addition, it can adapt to communication requirements more efficiently than traditional centralized and other distributed access algorithms, thus ensuring stable system performance in dense user environments."

    "abstract": "Load balancing in open radio access networks (O-RAN) is critical for ensuring efficient resource utilization, and the user’s experience by evenly distributing network traffic load. Current research mainly focuses on designing load-balancing algorithms to allocate resources while overlooking the cascade stability of load balancing, which is critical to prevent endless handover. The main challenge to analyse the cascade stability lies in the difficulty of establishing an accurate mathematical model to describe the process of load balancing due to its nonlinearity and high-dimensionality. In our previous theoretical work, a simplified general dynamic function was used to analyze the stability. However, it is elusive whether this function is close to the reality of the load balance process. To solve this problem, 1) a data-driven method is proposed to identify the dynamic model of the load balancing process according to the real-time traffic load data collected from the radio units (RUs); 2) the stability condition of load balancing process is established for the identified dynamics model. Based on the identified dynamics model and the stability condition, the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) can control RUs to achieve a desired load-balancing state while ensuring cascade stability."

A dual-timescale architecture is empolyed: a slow timescale for association decisions and a fast timescale for power allocation and packet-level transmissions, enabling precise evaluation of network performance. Extensive simulations demonstrate that packet delays are significantly reduced by this approach compared to conventional methods, including user association with the nearest AP or association that maximizes the signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio, particularly in scenarios marked by high traffic, heterogeneous traffic distributions, or uneven user densities. The trained policies also show robust scalability across diverse network sizes and traffic conditions."

    "abstract": "Over the past 75 years, microelectronic device miniaturization has been enabled by the development of novel materials and increasingly compact and complex device architectures. Rapid and ongoing evolution of advanced test capabilities is needed to support all aspects of hardware development, manufacturing, quality, security assurance and supply chain verification. Multi-modal and multi-scale test methodologies that build on existing trusted methodologies are needed to combat the array of increasingly sophisticated and diverse threats to device integrity. Advances in architecture place significant demands on metrology, particularly at the densely packed, multi-interface regions in advanced-node devices. Techniques such as scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and atom probe tomography (APT) add to the existing suite of metrology techniques for physical assurance by providing sub-angstrom spatial resolution for detailed atomic-scale analysis. The efficacy of these and other techniques are inextricably linked to the preparation of high quality, representative electron transparent specimens in configurations suitable for each specific technique. Specimen preparation of features at this scale and geometric complexity is non-trivial. Physical constraints dictate that even a perfectly prepared specimen will inescapably contain multiple adjacent and overlapping features resulting in signal convolution when imaged in transmission. Margins for error and tolerance for artifact are vanishingly small considering that nanometer scale misplacement of site-specificity will exacerbate the signal convolution problem, in some cases completely obscuring key information. This paper addresses some of the challenges and physical limitations associated with locating, capturing, and isolating a nm scale feature of interest (FOI) within the volume of an ultra-thin electron transparent STEM specimen. We present a robust, ultra site-specific specimen preparation methodology using focused ion beam (FIB) optimized for STEM analysis, enabling high-resolution structural and chemical characterization of complex nanoscale interfaces with precise isolation of features of interest. Although the specific example presented focuses on the challenges of STEM specimen preparation for FinFET devices at the 4 nm technology node, the concepts presented have broad application to any geometrically complex material system."

Conventional deep learning models, while effective in temporal pattern recognition, exhibit limited capability in capturing spatial dependencies across heterogeneous sensor networks, thereby restricting their ability to represent dynamic system behavior. To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel method titled graph attention-based deviation network (GADN4SA) for circulating water system situational awareness. The proposed method dynamically constructs task-aware sensor graphs based on signal correlations, integrates both structural and semantic representations, and leverages attention-guided mechanisms to model long-range spatial-temporal dependencies. In addition, a structured deviation scoring module is incorporated to enable interpretable anomaly quantification and attribution. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of robustness, accuracy, and generalization, highlighting its effectiveness for deployment in safety-critical industrial environments."

FAHS organizes port queues into fixed, elastic, and best-effort (FB/EB/BE) resource blocks and integrates global path control with local queue scheduling to cope with both transient and persistent faults. Discrete-event simulations on a 16 node Internet2-based topology show that FAHS keeps AVB packet loss below 4.2 % under transient faults and reduces recovery time from about 12.1 ms to 4.8 ms compared with a Fault-Reroute scheme, while also lowering AVB loss under persistent faults versus Static-CSQF and Adaptive-CSQF.

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancements in technologies such as autonomous driving, intelligent robotics, unmanned aerial vehicles, and low-altitude economy applications, the demand for high-precision and highly robust positioning systems has become increasingly critical. Multi-sensor fusion positioning has gained widespread adoption due to its superior accuracy and robustness, with factor graph optimization receiving particular attention for its efficient modeling of multi-source constraints. However, traditional approaches often assume fixed noise levels, neglecting the dynamic variations of uncertainty in complex environments. To address this limitation, this paper proposes an uncertainty-aware GNSS/IMU/Vision multi-sensor fusion positioning algorithm. Recognizing the distinct error characteristics of GNSS and IMU, the error state Kalman filter (ESKF) is first employed to develop dynamic uncertainty models for each sensor. Building upon this, an adaptive weighting factor based on the covariance trace is introduced to apply uncertainty weighting to the GNSS/IMU data, thereby mitigating the impact of error interference during high-noise periods. Finally, the weighted multi-source data, along with visual feature observations, are incorporated into the factor graph optimization framework, enabling global state estimation within a sliding window. The proposed method is validated using the GVINS public dataset, and experimental results demonstrate its superior performance in challenging low-altitude economy scenarios, such as weak GNSS signals and significant IMU drift. Compared to traditional factor graph optimization algorithms, the proposed method improves positioning accuracy by 33% and reduces velocity error by 40%."

The computation offloading task is divided into data transmission and task computing sub-tasks to achieve fine-grained optimization of energy efficiency and reduce task complexity. A staged multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm is proposed to solve the energy optimization problem. In the transmission stage, user equipments (UEs) act as agents to optimize the allocation of transmission power, while in the computing stage, access point (AP) clusters act as agents to optimize the allocation of computational resources. The simulation results demonstrate that compared with the baseline algorithm, the proposed scheme can achieve a significant improvement in energy consumption during the transmission stage, and near-optimal performance with lower complexity during the computing stage."

    "abstract": "Historical maps contain valuable geographic information for analyzing historical patterns and providing insights for contemporary development. Unlike modern maps and remote sensing images, historical maps have been preserved for long periods but face challenges such as limited availability and low resolution. Additionally, their map symbols differ significantly from modern ones, making information extraction inefficient. To address these challenges, this study proposes an intelligent method for extracting hydrological information from historical maps, using the topographic map of ditches and channels along the Yellow River in Ningxia Province as case data. The dataset was constructed by combining clustering methods, symbolic syntax, and mathematical morphology. The SAM structure was refined, and its weights optimized via transfer learning. Hydrological information was then extracted from the historical map using the enhanced SAM model. Experimental results show that this method produces clear boundaries, complete contours, and the highest precision and accuracy. A comparison with the region’s current hydrological conditions reveals that most historical rivers and ditches have been diverted, shifted, or vanished, with a significant reduction in lake areas. This paper improves the SAM model, demonstrating its applicability in historical map analysis and offering a novel approach to map information extraction."

Recent advances in deep learning, with its powerful feature extraction and nonlinear modeling capabilities, present promising solutions to these limitations. This paper explores the integration of skin model shapes with deep learning and proposes Mating Status Image (MSI), a novel 2D representation of 3D difference surface, to facilitate the transition of assembly deviation analysis towards a data-driven paradigm. The proposed Res-UNet module can be integrated into current deviation estimation workflow, enabling parallel contact point prediction and thereby significantly improving computational efficiency. Based on the discrete cosine transform and gaussian random field, we constructed a self-built dataset, with the result of centroid-driven algorithm serving as ground truth. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves 0.8238 accuracy in contact point prediction, alongside a significant enhancement in computational speed. By leveraging MSI and deep learning, this research advances the transition toward intelligent and efficient of assembly deviation analysis."

This paper proposes a Cross-Pair Vector Constraint Approach to enhance the robustness of polarization-based orientation. By exploiting the stability of near-orthogonal vector cross products, the method selects optimal electric-field vector pairs from polarization images and fuses candidate sun vectors using Degree-of-Polarization (DoP) weighting for a statistically optimal estimate. Simulation results show a 39.3% reduction in RMSE (from 0.056°to 0.034°), while field tests demonstrate an 8.7% improvement in heading accuracy compared with the traditional SVD-based method. The proposed approach effectively suppresses noise amplification and can be directly embedded into an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) framework for real-time polarization–inertial fusion, enabling stable orientation in GNSS-denied environments."

To address the challenge, we propose replacing the ULA with a coprime array in the sensor module of the STAR-RIS to enhance high-accuracy direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. Furthermore, we derive the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) of the proposed architecture, and a joint optimization problem is formulated to minimize the CRB. To solve the problem, we introduce Schur complement to transform the non-convex problem into a Fisher information matrix (FIM) optimization problem, and an efficient dual-loop iterative algorithm based on the penalty dual decomposition method is adopted to resolve it. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed coprime array structure can achieve higher theoretical sensing accuracy compared with the traditional ULA structure."

    "abstract": "The exploitation and utilization of marine resources has always been the focus of people's attention. And seafood aquaculture is always the focus of agricultural development and the exploitation of marine resources. With the development of smart agriculture, the detection and monitoring of seafood has become more intelligent. Due to the complexity of underwater terrain, it is particularly difficult for underwater cameras to acquire images of marine life. Therefore, the detection of marine life often faces problems such as difficulty in acquiring datasets and scarcity of data in datasets. To address the above problems, this paper proposed a seafood detection algorithm based on the combination of deep convolutional generative adversarial network and MDRFF Resnet50 with FPN Faster R-CNN network. The algorithm uses Faster R-CNN as the basic framework for marine life detection and uses deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) to generate data for small dataset to effectively expand the dataset without the difficulty of underwater image acquisition. For feature extraction network, we use Resnet50 as backbone and combine with feature pyramid network to enhance the feature extraction capability. We also design a new feature fusion module MDRFF. This module performs multiscale feature extraction and splices them into new features by dilated convolution with different dilation rates. Then the concatenation is weighted and adjusted by channel and spatial attention, and finally outputs a more efficient feature map. From the final experimental results, it can be seen that our proposed method has a good improvement in detection accuracy."

Existing resource allocation approaches always depend on instantaneous CSI, which is impractical for highly dynamic meta computing scenarios due to rapid CSI fluctuations. To address this issue, we propose a novel computation offloading scheme that jointly optimizes transmit power and computation resource allocation for multi-antenna users by leveraging statistical CSI. Specifically, a closed-form expression for the ergodic capacity and a tight bound for the MIMO diversity transmission scheme are derived. These theoretical results decouple the complex joint optimization into two tractable subproblems, where the ergodic capacity expression is utilized for global computation resource assignment via a Kuhn–Munkres (KM) algorithm, while the bound significantly simplifies the transmit power optimization problem. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves substantial energy consumption reductions compared to conventional methods, highlighting the effectiveness of utilizing statistical CSI in meta computing resource allocation."

A handover mechanism based on a composite quality indicator (CQI) that balances the trade-off between the quality and longevity of a link is proposed. To capture the nonlinear behavior of the links between the LEO satellites and the user terminal (UT), two logistic functions (LFs) are employed to dynamically adjust the weight to generate the CQI and the value of the handover threshold, respectively. By using the Two-Line Element (TLE) data, a genetic algorithm (GA) is developed to find the optimal parameter values to facilitate the two LFs by searching a multidimensional solution space. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed handover mechanism not only enhances link quality and longevity but also reduces the number of handovers compared to the elevation-based and max remaining visibility time (RVT)-based methods."

In this paper, we propose a multi-antenna RS design for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based ISAC systems with a single receiving antenna. We exploit the two-dimensional (2D) convolutional characteristics of the delay-Doppler domain channel and the quasi-orthogonality of zero correlation zone (ZCZ) sequences to efficiently separate channel responses from multiple antennas with low complexity. The proposed parameter estimation algorithm is compatible with conventional 2D-fast Fourier transform algorithms. Numerical simulations demonstrate that in single-path scenarios, the estimation performance reaches the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB). However, in multipath scenarios, performance diverges from the CRLB at high signal-to-noise ratios due to interference between paths."

However, due to the severe packet loss of satellite links and the variations among them, the existing distance aware delivery node selection methods may lead to significant packet loss and delivery delay. To solve this problem, a packet loss aware delivery node selection method is proposed in this paper. First, the delivery delay of coded sub-contents is analyzed by taking packet loss into account. And the delivery node selection problem is formulated as a delivery delay minimization problem. Then, the problem is divided into multiple sub-problems according to the time slot, where each sub-problem is a single-constraint knapsack problem. Based on the Edmonds theorem, the greedy algorithm is used to obtain the optimal solution. Finally, simulations are carried out on a walkerdelta constellation to verify the performance of the proposed method. And the results show that the user perceived packet loss and the packet retransmission induced delivery delay can be reduced by 83% and 42.8%, respectively, when compared with the existing distance aware delivery node selection method."

    "abstract": "Multiple Access Control (MAC) mechanism is imperative for Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) communications, which directly impacts system performance. IEEE 1609.4 protocol is dedicated to address the issue of MAC in VANETs. The protocol divides channels into a Control Channel (CCH) and Service Channels (SCHs), where nodes compete in CCH to gain access to SCHs to transmit data. However, this mechanism fails to guarantee Quality of Service (QoS) performance of heterogeneous services. To cope with this situation, this paper proposes a novel Priority-Aware Hybrid MAC protocol (PAH-MAC) for VANETs, enhancing QoS by introducing differentiated transmission schemes for Vehicular to Vehicular (V2V) and Vehicular to Infrastructure (V2I) communications. For V2V links, emergency data is broadcast directly in CCH to earn the highest channel access priority. For V2I links, service data is further classified into two priority levels. Safety-critical service packets employ a preemption-based TDMA scheme to ensure the opportunity of transmission in SCHs higher than regular service packets. And V2I regular service packets follow a TDMA-based reservation mechanism but will defer transmission if preempted by emergency service packets. This design optimizes spectrum efficiency while guaranteeing QoS for critical V2I services. Furthermore, we develop an analytical framework based on an M/D/1 tandem M/M/4 queueing model and a deferred reservation model, followed by theoretical and simulation-based evaluations. The simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of throughput and control overhead compared with typical IEEE 1609.4 under high mobility of VANET."

    "abstract": "During the industrial production and development test process, multiple high-cost field tests are required to optimize or verify the quality of the product. Sensitivity analysis can determine the factors that have an important impact on the product in the early stage of the test and screen out the important factors for sequential testing. When the test sample is small, sensitivity analysis of a small number of samples is often difficult, especially when the inputs are correlated. A Kriging-based Sobol sensitivity analysis strategy for correlated inputs is proposed under the above questions. Comparisons with BP neural network and SVM are performed under mathematical simulation and precise experiments to demonstrate."

    "abstract": "Bone age assessment (BAA) is a critical research topic in pediatric radiology, with growing interest in developing automated BAA methods. This study proposes a bone age prediction model integrating cluster analysis and convolutional neural network (CNN) regression, further enhanced by a multi-scale attention mechanism to construct a \"divide-and-focus\" dual-driven deep learning framework. Targeting age-sensitive regional features in hand radiographs, we innovatively design an adaptive spatial attention module that achieves hierarchical anatomical feature enhancement through saliency detection of attention-guided regions of interest (ROI). The algorithm first uses multiconstrained clustering of K methods to generate age-specific subsets, followed by parallel execution on each subset: 1) attention-guided ROI segmentation and feature enhancement; 2) validation of the base CNN regression networks (including ResNet, DenseNet and EfficientNetV2); 3) set of cross-subset models with Bayesian-optimized weighting strategies for final prediction. By synergistically integrating the data distribution priors with attention-driven anatomical priors, the method delivers interpretable solutions when performing medical image regression tasks. The modular design ensures compatibility with mainstream CNN architectures. The method will aid pediatric growth monitoring and the diagnosis of endocrine disorders."

Unlike traditional methods that rely on transmitter locations, sampling point-based approaches offer greater practical benefits by leveraging real-world measurements. In this paper, we argue that RME should be treated not merely as a generative task but rather as a style transfer problem, where the goal is to transform sparse sampling point distributions into high-fidelity radio maps. To this end, we propose RadioPix2pix, a Generative Adversarial Network GAN-based model with physical awareness that effectively learns the mapping between sparse measurements and dense radio maps. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms deep learning baselines, achieving superior performance even at an extremely low sampling rate of 0.15%. This work provides a novel perspective on RME and advances the state-of-the-art in data-driven radio map reconstruction."

    "abstract": "Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) is a technique used to detect anomalous graph nodes, which is very important in industrial informatics, particularly in cybersecurity, industrial IoT (IIoT), and intelligent monitoring systems. It is widely used for detecting network intrusions, sensor anomalies, and fraudulent behaviors in smart manufacturing, power grids, and industrial automation. In recent years, graph anomaly detection has been mainly based on graph autoencoder (GAE) and comparative learning. Among them, GAE utilizes the reconstruction loss of the graph to estimate the anomalous nodes. However, the existing methods ignore the negative offset problem of abnormal nodes in obtaining node representations. In the graph, there are far more normal nodes than abnormal nodes, and the features of abnormal nodes are diluted by the features of normal nodes during message passing, which affects the model’s ability to detect abnormal nodes. Therefore, we propose AAE-GAD, a graph anomaly detection method based on the attention mechanism of online updates, to solve this problem. Specifically, first, we obtain the local anomaly scores of all nodes by training a local model, extract a set of normal nodes with high confidence, and compute the hybrid attention weights based on the similarity of the nodes’ central representations with the set of normal nodes and the difference of the anomaly scores with their neighboring nodes. Secondly, we get the node representation by modifying the mechanism of message passing and utilizing the hybrid attention weights in the global model to perform dynamic message passing, and the reconstructed graph can better identify the anomalous nodes. Finally, we continuously update the hybrid attention score using the anomaly score obtained from the global model to make it more discriminative. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AAE-GAD, and AAE-GAD achieves good results in anomaly detection for contextual and structural types. In highlight, AAE-GAD achieves significant results on the Enron dataset."

    "abstract": "Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are susceptible to interference signals. When the critical navigation zone encounters severe large-scale GNSS interference, the rapid construction of a regional navigation augmentation system based on pseudo-satellite technology is of great strategic and application value for national security through forming a sustained navigation capability. However, the existing pseudo-satellite deployment algorithms are only suitable for ideal scenarios, without considering the air-ground cooperative deployment. To solve these problems, this paper constructs a multi-objective optimization model for pseudo-satellite deployment that takes the signal coverage, positioning accuracy, deployment cost and time into account. These evaluation indexes are analyzed with the presence of signal occlusion and propagation loss by adopting the DEM (Digital Elevation Model). Then, an improved Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA III) is proposed to solve it. The genetic operation is designed with a five-element individual integer coding and normalization mapping. Besides, an adaptive change crossover/mutation distribution index is used in algorithm iteration to accelerate the convergence speed. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can optimize the deployment strategy by reducing deployment time and cost, and improving flight endurance while ensuring coverage and positioning accuracy in different deployment areas."

    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is one of the most common and highly lethal gynecological malignancies, and its early diagnosis and accurate subtyping are of great clinical significance. Whole-slide images (WSI) contain rich tissue structural information required for pathological diagnosis and are often regarded as the \"gold standard\". However, due to their high resolution and high annotation cost, they typically only have patient-level weak labels. To address the insufficient feature representation under weak labeling and fully explore the potential histological correlations among instances, this paper proposes an ovarian cancer pathological image classification method based on Self-Supervised and multi-relational graph learning (SS-MRGL). First, self-supervised learning is employed to pre-train weakly labeled image instances, obtaining robust and discriminative compressed feature representations. Then, a multi-relational graph is constructed, and a multi-perspective joint modeling approach using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) is introduced to capture the spatial topological and contextual semantic multi-dimensional information among instances, respectively. Finally, a gated attention mechanism is used to dynamically fuse graph-level features. Experimental results on the YN-OCPD dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the accuracy of ovarian cancer diagnosis under weak supervision."

Meanwhile, due to the influence of fading channel, we develop a two-step synchronization strategy-based peak detection algorithm to identify effective antennas. Based on the detection results, we can estimate the time offsets and integer frequency offsets (IFOs) between different effective transmit-receive antenna pairs. Furthermore, we utilize cyclic correlation operations to complete the estimation of fractional frequency offsets (FFOs). This is a multi-parameter estimation method based on time-domain signal processing, which has higher real-time performance and lower computational complexity. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in estimating time-frequency offsets for synchronization."

    "abstract": "In the transmission control protocol (TCP), the receiver is required to send acknowledgment (ACK) segments to inform the sender about the successful reception of the data segments. In wireless networks such as Wi-Fi, TCP ACKs introduce additional contention in the shared wireless channel that adversely affects the end-to-end TCP performance. But thanks to the cumulative nature of TCP ACKs, the receiver can send fewer ACKs. A number of studies have improved TCP’s performance on Wi-Fi by using various ACK reduction schemes. However, none have taken advantage of the important property of Wi-Fi’s frame aggregation scheme, which carries multiple data segments and thus causes bulk arrivals at the receiver. This property can be efficiently exploited to dramatically reduce the number of TCP ACKs. We propose an aggregation-aware ACK delaying (TCP-AAD) scheme where the receiver TCP sends only one ACK segment for all data segments received in a single Wi-Fi aggregate frame. This approach significantly reduces the number of ACKs, leading to less contention on the shared wireless medium and increased end-to-end throughput. The proposed and existing schemes were implemented in the ns-3 simulator, and their performance was evaluated for various numbers of stations, as well as different distances between stations and the access point."

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a promising solution to enable ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) for 6G wireless communications. To reduce pilot overhead, multi-resolution codebook-based beam training has been proposed for RIS-aided communication systems. However, the hardware constraints of the RIS such as the limited control capability, mutual coupling, and manufacturing tolerances have not been fully considered, which may result in non-ideal beam patterns and misleading beam search directions, thereby degrading the overall beam training performance. To address this issue, in this paper, we revisit the multi-resolution codebook design and beam training scheme by taking the RIS hardware constraints into account. First, we propose a wide-beam generation method via multi-beam superposition, where the RIS reflection coefficients are optimized to achieve high beam gain with minimal fluctuations. Then, a posterior-based beam training scheme is proposed to adaptively correct erroneous beam search directions, thereby improving the beam training accuracy. We implement a prototype RIS with 32x32 reflective elements and deploy a 26 GHz millimeter-wave RIS-aided wireless communication testbed to experimentally evaluate the proposed scheme. The results indicate that our approach achieves low training overhead and a data rate close to the exhaustive search method."

However, the guard zone size inversely affects the probability of coverage (PoC) creating a trade-off between coverage and security. To address this, we propose a joint optimization framework for RIS configuration and guard zone size to meet a desired secrecy threshold while maximizing PoC. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we evaluate the interplay between guard zone size, RIS phase shift design, and the spatial distribution of users and eavesdroppers. The results indicate that the proposed approach ensures strong secrecy performance and efficient coverage, providing a flexible and effective solution for secure communication in next-generation wireless networks."

However, in the millimeter wave (mmWave) or higher frequency bands, the significant increase in the number of transmit antennas results in prohibitive feedback overhead. To tackle this issue, we propose a deep learning based multi-user CSI compression framework called CoTransNet. For users in a neighboring area, CSI can be decomposed into two components: one is shared by all users in the area and another is unique to each individual UE. By leveraging shared information, CoTransNet extracts correlations among channels and eliminates redundant feedback information. Experimental results indicate that employing the CoTransNet architecture leads to an average improvement of approximately 4.98% in squared generalized cosine similarity (SGCS) across diverse feedback budgets and a reduction of about 3.54 dB in normalized mean-squared error (NMSE)."

To achieve higher spectral efficiency, accurate channel state information (CSI) is required. However, due to the high-dimensional HMIMO channel induced by the large number of antenna elements, accurate CSI estimation typically demands a great number of pilots, which consumes plenty of communication resources. Diffusion models are capable of effectively capturing the distribution of channels. By leveraging the learned channel distribution as a prior, accurate channel estimation can be performed using only a limited number of pilot signals. In this paper, we propose a diffusion model-based channel estimation scheme for HMIMO systems. We first exploit the inherent redundancy of HMIMO channels in the wavenumber domain to perform the channel compression. Subsequently, a diffusion model is employed to capture the distribution of the compressed channel, and a cross-attention module is integrated to learn the relations between the received pilots and the compressed channel. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately recover the HMIMO channel with only a small amount of pilots."

The fingerprints of these points are obtained and used to adaptively update the data set. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed adaptive sampling strategy in improving localization accuracy while significantly reducing data collection effort.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study a mobility-aware two-timescale online optimization for constructing a digital twin (DT) -assisted task execution system under end-edge-cloud collaboration. DTs are deployed on edge servers deployed on roadside units (RSUs), and needs to be proactively migrated based on the future location of its corresponding vehicle. To minimize the task response latency executed by DT with stringent energy consumption constraint, we jointly optimize the uploading frequency of vehicle’s status data for adaptive mobility prediction, the DT migration decision along with the communication and computation resource allocations. Considering that decision variables are triggered asynchronously, we propose a novel two-timescale mobility-aware online optimization approach (TMO), which first employs an extended two-timescale Lyapunov method to decompose the problem into a series of instant subproblems and then integrates a multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithm to dynamically determine uploading frequency of vehicle’s status data as the length of the large-timescale. After that, for each small-timescale problem, we develop a GRU-based vehicle trajectory preidiction method to predict the location of vehicles, followed by an alternate minimization (AM) based algorithm to decide remaining decision variables based on the predicted trajectory. Theoretical analyses and simulations show that the proposed approach can reach asymptotic optimum and demonstrate its superiority over counterparts."

    "abstract": "In addressing the path planning problem, recent works consider the integration of the traditional A* algorithm with deep reinforcement learning, employing artificial neural networks as heuristic function, and training the neural networks with reinforcement learning, has been demonstrated to enhance the efficiency of path search in complex environments. However, two problems exist. 1) network retraining is required when encountering unfamiliar environments, 2) following the framework of the A* algorithm leads to a limited improvement in search efficiency. To address these problems, this paper proposes a hierarchical path planning framework. The upper level planning transforms the global path planning problem into a multi-stage path planning problem for a sequence of subgoal points according to the shortest distance principle, which leads to the improvement of the planning efficiency. The lower level planning implements path planning to the subgoal points by proposing a Local-environment Reinforcement Learning A* (LRLA*) mechanism, in which a heuristic function neural network with local environment as input is constructed and trained by self-generated paths, so that the generalization of the algorithm is guaranteed. Based on the hierarchical framework, a Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning A* (HRLA*) path planning algorithm is designed. The experimental results demonstrate that the HRLA* algorithm can rapidly generate a bounded suboptimal path in randomly generated environments after one-shot training, eliminating the need for retraining. Furthermore, the number of node expansions is reduced by more than 80% compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm, with the path cost loss comparable to existing algorithms."

    "abstract": "In this paper, the method of convex optimization combined with reinforcement learning is used to solve the problem of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for self-powered sensor in high-speed railway (HSR) scenario. The self-powered sensor on the high-speed train collects ambient energy, and offloads the sensing data by using NOMA in time slots when the train-to-ground (T2G) communication system employs time-division multiple access (TDMA) to serve multiple carriages. In each time slot, when the self-powered sensor is in energy collecting mode, the T2G communication is used for energy collecting, and when the sensor is in data offloading mode, the T2G communication becomes interference noise. Our goal is to maximize the amount of self-powered sensor data offload within the scope of a base station. This is a long-term return problem, which cannot be optimized only slot by slot, but needs to be optimized as a whole, so we use the principle of reinforcement learning for optimization. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm is better than the greedy algorithm and the random algorithm, and has better performance in multiple scenarios."

    "abstract": "Recently, various intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been proposed for in-vehicle networks. However, as vehicle network attacks become increasingly sophisticated, existing IDSs have shown limitations in effectively detecting new threats. In particular, supervised learning-based IDSs are incapable of detecting previously unseen attacks. On the other hand, while unsupervised learning-based IDSs can detect such attacks, they often suffer from relatively low detection performance. To address these limitations, we propose a semi-supervised generative adversarial network (SGAN)-based IDS for in-vehicle networks. In our proposed SGAN, the adversarially trained discriminator serves as an anomaly detector. Furthermore, we enhance the discriminator’s detection capability by incorporating labeled attack data during training. For instance, a discriminator trained on three distinct types of attacks can effectively detect unknown attack type. This approach enables more accurate and robust distinction between normal and attack data. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach is suitable for in-vehicle network security, achieving an average detection accuracy of 99.63% and a precision of 99.52% for unknown attack types."

Through a combination of theoretical modeling, full-vectorial beam propagation simulations, and experimental validation, we demonstrate that optimized core-collapse tailoring within the fusion region significantly enhances mode-field matching and reduces insertion losses to sub-dB levels. The proposed method exhibits promising potential for applications in gas sensing, dispersion compensation, and microfluidic photonic devices."

    "abstract": "The security of Radio Access Network (RAN) is increasingly becoming a focal point of attention. The lack of integrity protection and encryption mechanisms in the Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol before the establishment of a security context poses a significant security threat that cannot be overlooked. Unlike traditional full-band radio jamming and Fake Base Station (FBS) attacks, Signal Overshadowing can precisely target specific time-frequency resource blocks, offering stronger stealth and energy efficiency. In this paper, we propose two novel attack patterns targeting System Information Block type 1 (SIB1) by leveraging Signal Overshadowing. These attacks achieve precise and stealthy signal injection through high-precision time-frequency synchronization. Experimental results demonstrate that both attack patterns can effectively cause Denial of Service (DoS) while maintaining stable characteristics of the received signal, such as Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP), with no significant fluctuations observed. These innovative attack strategies provide valuable insights into the vulnerabilities of the RAN protocols and contribute to the development of further security enhancement mechanisms."

A channel selection function is called consistent if the selected channel remains unchanged when the available channel set shrinks, provided the selected channel is still available. We show that all consistent channel selection functions are equivalent to the function that always selects the smallest-index channel under appropriate channel relabeling. This leads to a natural representation of a consistent channel hopping algorithm as a sequence of permutations. For the two-user MRP, we characterize rendezvous time slots using a fictitious user and derive tight bounds on the maximum time-to-rendezvous (MTTR) and expected time-to-rendezvous (ETTR). Notably, the ETTR is shown to be the inverse of the Jaccard index when permutations are randomly selected. We also prove that consistent channel hopping algorithms maximize the rendezvous probability. To guarantee a deterministic tight MTTR bound, we propose the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">modulo algorithm</i>, which uses modular arithmetic with one-cycle permutations and achieves performance comparable to locality-sensitive hashing (LSH)-based algorithms. The framework is extended to multiple users, with novel strategies such as stick-together, spread-out, and a hybrid method that accelerates rendezvous in both synchronous and asynchronous settings. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed algorithms."

    "abstract": "Satellite videos capture broad field of view of city-scale scenes, while moving objects of interest could only claim to be tiny, occupying only several pixels. Besides, noises from target-similar surroundings and illumination change exist everywhere in the complex satellite imaging backgrounds, where objects are easily occluded by man-made buildings or clouds. Therefore, considering the limited information capacity of spatially appearance and semantic features, satellite video object tracking algorithms should make the most of temporal sequence information, to cope with the above challenges involving object detail deficiency, object occlusion and environmental noises. In this paper, we focus on the critical characteristic “temporal sequence” and fully exploit its implied target changing tendency and motion continuity to boost tracker performance. The proposed Temporal-Sequence-Driven Transformer tracker (TSTrans) utilizes Transformer framework to take advantage of its long-term relation modeling ability. To obtain robust object understanding, TSTrans introduces multiple temporal templates to extract target variation pattern, thereby achieving dense target-aware attention between searching patches and long-term template sequence. For global refinement of tracking result, TSTrans resists occlusion and model attention distraction challenges through trajectory prediction based on historical frame sequence. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on three large-scale satellite video datasets including SatSOT, SV248S and VISO. Contrasted with 12 advanced trackers, our TSTrans demonstrates state-of-the-art (SOTA) tracking accuracy, with precision and success scores of 71.00%/53.20%, 86.36%/40.84% and 65.38%/28.05% on SatSOT, SV248S and VISO respectively, running at around 50 frames per second (FPS).

Motivated by this, this paper proposes an online graph-attentional multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (GAMD) method to enhance the power system resilience and EV charging convenience in cold weather. To address the high-dimensional and non-Euclidean characteristics of the state of power-transportation network, the method integrates a graph attention network for global state perception with a decentralized multi-agent system for collaborative decision-making. The proposed method optimizes conflicting objectives, including the resilience of EV charging service, traffic efficiency, and the economic efficiency of emergency power supply. For the first time, the proposed method incorporates the traffic impedance variations induced by V2G dispatch to take into account the dynamic traffic condition. The proposed method is validated with a high-fidelity microscopic simulation platform (SUMO) driven by real-world data. Results suggest the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art benchmarks, with noted improvements across multiple performance metrics. The aforementioned endeavor establishes a robust and scalable paradigm for managing a dispatch-intensified coupled urban power- transportation system."

Under certain structural assumptions, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of the estimation error dynamics. We further present a decentralized design of the proposed observer, where the operation and construction of the observer can be completed by each subsystem using its locally available information, including the system’s basic configuration, local measurements, and data exchanged with neighboring subsystems. In addition, we demonstrate that our distributed estimation framework can be applied to solve the distributed estimation problem for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems with fixed composition by employing an observability decomposition method. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of our scheme by applying it to vehicle platooning."

    "abstract": "Tracking the rapid spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19 in communities poses a significant global health challenge, mainly because traditional testing methods struggle to detect asymptomatic carriers and effectively manage outbreaks. To address this, we present a scalable, networked molecular testing framework for wastewater-based epidemiology that, for the first time, integrates portable nucleic acid testing (NAT) devices with long-range wireless communication and cloud-based data management. Each battery-powered node can perform Reverse Transcription - Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP), a rapid nucleic acid amplification method, on-site directly on raw wastewater samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection. A node executes up to eight independent tests on a microfluidic cartridge, monitoring fluorescence signals from the RT-LAMP reactions in real time and transmitting the results via long-range radio (LoRa) to a gateway, which uploads structured data to a NoSQL cloud database. An interactive dashboard enables bidirectional communication with nodes and provides spatiotemporal visualization of both live and historical data, including hotspot identification through geotagging and mapping of metrics such as 7-day positivity rates. Rigorous system testing with four nodes under varied transmission scenarios confirmed a packet delivery ratio exceeding 99%, ensuring accurate and reliable reconstruction of time-series RT-LAMP curves. By integrating NAT with IoT communication and cloud analytics, this system supports unattended, long-term wastewater monitoring and can provide public health officials with timely, actionable insights. This framework demonstrates the potential of IoT-enabled molecular testing to advance decentralized surveillance beyond conventional laboratory-based workflows."

    "abstract": "Customer baseline load (CBL) estimation holds the key to the successful implementation of demand response (DR) programs. In traditional control group methods, non-DR users are clustered into sub-clusters. DR users are matched with those in sub-clusters showing similar load patterns, and the matched users’ load data is used to estimate DR users’ CBL. In general, the existing methods can generate relatively accurate CBL estimation results as long as the number of matched users is adequate. However, the current control group methods suffer from two major limitations, which not only undermine the estimation accuracy but may also render the methods entirely ineffective: 1) These methods are highly vulnerable to uneven distribution of sub-clusters; 2) The load data of the non-DR participating users are under-exploited. To this end, this paper proposes a CBL estimation method based on variance transformation principle and contrastive learning framework. Firstly, the variance transformation principle is revealed, which is the basis to generate enough samples showing correlation with the DR users. Secondly, a neural network model based on contrastive learning framework is established to further recognize the non-DR participating users showing highly similar load pattern to the DR users and extract the high-dimensional load features from the DR users and the matched users. Finally, the CBL estimation results can be obtained by the feature similarity-weight calculation. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method is validated by using multi-source datasets and comprehensive evaluation indicators."

    "abstract": "In the era of big data and intelligent sensing, deep neural networks provide new impetus for prognostics and health management (PHM) with their powerful feature extraction capabilities. However, the pursuit of performance through increased network depth and complexity concurrently escalates the number of hyperparameters and model intricacy, thereby exacerbating the inherent opaque nature and restricting their deployment in complex industrial settings. To address this dilemma, this article develops a machine health prognosis framework with ex-ante interpretability based on complex domain time-frequency network (CDTFN). Specifically, this article first investigates the intrinsic bonds between network convolution and time-frequency transforms. Building upon this foundation, four complex observation operators with trainable parameters are designed for extracting fault-related time-frequency information, embedding it into the CDTFN as a preprocessing layer. Simultaneously, by extending the forward and backward propagation mechanisms of real-valued networks to the complex domain, the proposed CDTFN gains the capability to fuse complex-valued time-frequency information and establish end-to-end mapping from feature representation layers to prediction labels. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed prognosis framework based on CDTFN are verified by public and self-built run-to-failure rolling bearings datasets. The detailed experimental results further demonstrate its distinct advantages in interpretability and generalization capability."

    "abstract": "This paper describes Split Rendering over the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) in 3GPP 5G Advanced networks, as standardized in Release 19. Computer graphics (CG) applications, particularly Extended Reality (XR) applications, are computationally intensive and have strict latency requirements. Consumer mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and netbooks, have limited processing power and energy capacity, restricting the quality and complexity of CG and XR services that can be delivered locally. Offloading compute and energy-intensive rendering tasks to the network offers a promising solution, provided a high level of Quality of Service (QoS) is maintained by the network between the server and client devices. IMS is a core subsystem of 3GPP networks that provides high QoS real-time voice and video services. The introduction of Data Channel (DC) capabilities in IMS enables deployment of new services that can benefit from this high QoS and compute resources in the network. The new split rendering over IMS standard provides service providers with a unified framework for deploying split-rendered applications that leverage IMS DC capabilities."

    "abstract": "To enable the diagnosis of multi-source partial discharge (PD) on the surface of epoxy fiberglass boards, this study investigates optical PD signals and diagnostic methods associated with typical defects and their combinations. The electric field distribution for typical insulation defects is analyzed, and both emission spectroscopy measurements and PD experiments are performed. The results demonstrate that different PD modes exhibit distinct spectral characteristics. For needle, crack, and metal contamination defects, the detection limits using a full-band silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) are determined to be 64.37 pC, 78.12 pC, and 159 pC, respectively, with corresponding response coefficients of 450 mV/pC, 300 mV/pC, and 160 mV/pC. The SiPM response coefficient is found to vary with detection wavebands and PD modes. Multispectral analysis shows that although the 300-400 nm band accounts for the highest proportion across all discharge modes, the distribution characteristics of each wavelength band differ. A decision tree model is developed for discharge pattern diagnosis, achieving an accuracy of 95.09%."

    "abstract": "Infrared (IR) imaging offers advantages in several fields due to its unique ability of capturing content in extreme light conditions. However, the demanding hardware requirements of high-resolution IR sensors limit its widespread application. As an alternative, visible light can be used to synthesize IR images but this causes a loss of fidelity in image details and introduces inconsistencies due to lack of contextual awareness of the scene. This stems from a combination of using visible light with a standard dynamic range, especially under extreme lighting, and a lack of contextual awareness can result in pseudo-thermal-crossover artifacts. This occurs when multiple objects with similar temperatures appear indistinguishable in the training data, further exacerbating the loss of fidelity. To solve this challenge, this paper proposes CapHDR2IR, a novel framework incorporating vision-language models using high dynamic range (HDR) images as inputs to generate IR images. HDR images capture a wider range of luminance variations, ensuring reliable IR image generation in different light conditions. Additionally, a dense caption branch integrates semantic understanding, resulting in more meaningful and discernible IR outputs. Extensive experiments on the HDRT dataset show that the proposed CapHDR2IR achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing general domain transfer methods and those tailored for visible-to-infrared image translation.

However, conventional AFDM channel estimation schemes exhibit significant limitations. Therefore, we propose a low-complexity channel estimation scheme which adopts different pilot designs for integer and fractional Doppler cases. Specifically, the generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm is employed to replace the expectation step of the sparse Bayesian learning algorithm based on expectation maximization (EM), thereby reducing computational complexity. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that, compared with conventional methods, the proposed scheme not only offers advantages in pilot power consumption and overhead, but also achieves excellent performance and low complexity in various Doppler cases."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of intelligent unmanned systems and autonomous navigation technologies, particularly driven by the strategic demands of the low-altitude economy, navigation systems are facing increasingly higher requirements for accuracy and robustness. During global navigation satellite system(GNSS) outages, GNSS/INS integrated navigation degrades into standalone inertial navigation system(INS), which leads to rapid accumulation of positioning errors. This paper proposes the GNSS pseudo-increment prediction method based on the Transformer-long short-term memory (LSTM) network. It utilizes inertial measurement unit measurements and INS output navigation results as inputs, where the Transformer is employed to extract global temporal features and the LSTM is used to model temporal dependencies. The predicted GNSS pseudo-increments are then fused with INS outputs via the Kalman filter(KF) for state updates. Experiments based on the publicly available vehicle dataset demonstrate that during 50s GNSS outage, the proposed method achieves over 90% reduction in horizontal errors compared to pure INS, and over 40% compared with LSTM and Transformer models, respectively. These results confirm that the method effectively mitigates INS drift and significantly enhances the accuracy and robustness of navigation and positioning."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable planning capabilities in complex language reasoning tasks. However, existing multi-step reasoning technologies easily introduces potential unreliable and inaccurate error accumulations over long-horizon action steps, and thereby making it exceedingly difficult to accurately explore the exponentially large search space. This deficiency primarily stems from the short-sighted greedy decoding of the next admissible action, and the lack of build-in actionable knowledge, which exacerbates the generation of hallucinatory or conflicting action sequences. To address these limitations, we propose Actionable Knowledge-augmented agent Planning (AKP), a novel LLM-based framework designed to enhance task planning of language agents by incorporating external actional knowledge. Specifically, we introduce a new knowledgeable policy called GVR by exploring future longer-term action paths, which leverages multiple domain foundation models (Verifier, Rewarder) trained on actional knowledge to jointly guide and calibrate more reasonable action generation. Additionally, AKP integrates the learned GVR into Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for deliberate planning, predicting various potential actions and iteratively refining alternative plans through lookahead and backtracking. Experimental results demonstrate that AKP significantly outperforms existing baselines, showcasing superior planning performance in tackling complex goal tasks across diverse embodied environments."

Firstly, OFDM technology is exploited with the 16QAM signal model, to disperse the signal across a series of mutually orthogonal narrowband subcarriers, which enables flexible adaptation to different frequency band resource. Then, LDPC channel coding is uitilized to improve the system's interference resistance and transmission reliability, which substantially reduces the computational complexity of encoding and decoding by the sparse parity-check matrix. Finally, various simulation tests are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed modulation scheme significantly enhances the spectral efficiency and reliability of information transmission, which provides technical support for telemetry systems in diverse scenarios such as high-orbit satellites, deep-space probes, and near-Earth spacecraft."

To support simple SISO-ISAC applications, a low-complexity fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based sensing algorithm is developed for the sake of the superior performance of OCDM-IM over traditional OCDM. Building on this, the framework is further extended to more attractive MIMO-ISAC systems in order to achieve improved bit error rate (BER) and a lower peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) compared to the conventional MIMO-OCDM scheme. For sensing, it enables distance, velocity, and angle estimation by formulating the OCDM-IM waveform within a compressed sensing framework, which is then efficiently solved using the proposed orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm. Simulation results confirm that the OCDM-IM waveform enhances communication performance through IM while preserving the promising sensing performance."

Recent advancements in deep learning techniques have shown promising results in medical image analysis, particularly in lung cancer identification. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates a multi-kernel 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with dual-feature fusion using the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) for lung cancer classification. Our comprehensive evaluation across three distinct datasets (IQ-OTH/NCCD, LIDC-IDRI, and NSCLC-Radiomics) demonstrates the method’s robustness and generalizability, achieving 99.16% accuracy on the primary dataset. The fusion strategy combines the strengths of CNNs in automated feature extraction with the descriptive power of HOG in capturing shape information and LBP in characterizing local texture patterns, resulting in statistically significant improvements (p<0.01) over existing single-dataset approaches. This multi-scale, multi-feature integration addresses key limitations in current pulmonary nodule analysis while maintaining clinical applicability."

    "abstract": "The role of trust in communication systems is critical in an interconnected world. Remote Attestation (RA) introduces a new paradigm to establish this trust, enabling communication systems to defend against new classes of attackers. In the context of distributed group communications in which communication partners join the network at runtime, existing solutions for network attestation are inadequate. They rely either on a central entity to facilitate joining of devices and/or network attestation, or on hardware features that are not present on the most common cryptoprocessors.To address this gap, a new network RA scheme is proposed in this work. This scheme includes two protocols: one for attesting communication partners upon network entry and another one for regular network attestation. Instead of a third-party verifier, the members of the network themselves act as verifiers in the system. The proposed protocol suite is integrated into LCMsec, an existing peer-to-peer Publish/Subscribe protocol in which trust was previously coupled to the possession of private keying material. A proof-of-concept implementation is assessed to show that the network attestation latency scales well with large group sizes. It is demonstrated that the protocol introduces little startup latency beyond the baseline introduced by the underlying attestation mechanism."

    "abstract": "The ocean contains vast resources such as biological, mineral, and strategic resources for national defense. Developing underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) to achieve collaborative data collection and transmission is essential for marine exploration activities. The Internet of Things (IoT), enabling real-time data transmission, holds immense potential in its application to UWSNs, known as the underwater Internet of Things (UIoT). Underwater vehicles (UVs), as mobile nodes in UIoT, play an irreplaceable role in enabling dynamic network topology and overcoming static node coverage limitations. However, in the face of massive data generated by UIoT devices, seeking an efficient communication method has become increasingly important. Underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) technology has attracted extensive attention in underwater communication due to its high-speed data transmission capability and superior transmission capacity. Nevertheless, existing UWOC systems ignore the semantic information of transmitted data, leading to unnecessary communication resource overhead. Furthermore, the spatiotemporally dynamic marine environment presents significant challenges to UWOC technology. This paper integrates semantic communication into the challenging scenario of underwater wireless optical image transmission to further optimize the bandwidth compression efficiency and anti-interference capability of underwater optical wireless communication. In the experimental verification section, the results demonstrate that the communication scheme proposed in this paper can achieve excellent image transmission performance in variable seawater channels, outperforming the traditional source-channel separation communication paradigm in terms of image transmission performance and exhibiting certain robustness."

To overcome these issues, we propose dynamically adjusting the size of the potential field by incorporating the relative distance between the vehicle s real-time position and the target point as a criterion. Additionally, we apply the simulated annealing (SA) method, which uses its inherent search probability to escape local minima. Finally, path smoothing is performed to compensate for the shortcomings of the traditional APF algorithm. MATLAB simulations of the improved APF-based obstacle avoidance path planning confirm the feasibility of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Reliable and continuous localization is essential for autonomous and safety-critical vehicle applications. However, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are often unavailable or unreliable in environments such as urban canyons, tunnels, forests or during electronic interference and jamming. In such cases, pure inertial navigation represents a possible fallback solution, providing position, velocity and attitude without any external infrastructure.This paper investigates whether it is feasible to determine all required initial values — position, velocity, roll, pitch, and heading — without GNSS and to subsequently perform accurate inertial navigation based solely on MEMS sensors. To evaluate this capability, a comprehensive experimental study was conducted using MEMS-based inertial navigation systems (INS), operating entirely in GNSS-denied conditions. Three MEMS-based INS of different performance grades and one FOG-based reference system were tested in real-world driving experiments, using an iMAR KIA test vehicle. All initial values were obtained without GNSS: the initial position was manually determined using OpenStreetMap and satellite imagery, achieving an accuracy of approximately 15 m RMS; the velocity was initialized through a Zero-Velocity Update (ZUPT) while stationary; roll and pitch were derived from accelerometer-based leveling; and the heading was determined via MEMS-based gyrocompassing or subsequent waypoint alignment. Four test drives, each between 4.9 km and 5.8 km, were driven under identical initialization conditions to ensure comparability. The evaluation was performed using five aiding configurations: without aiding, Zero-Velocity and Zero-Rate Updates (ZARU), Vehicle Motion Modelling (VMM), a combination of them, and finally, a fully GNSS-independent configuration combining VMM, ZUPT/ZARU, and Waypoint Alignment (WA).The results show that unaided MEMS systems experience rapid drift, exceeding up to 200 % of the distance traveled, whereas the combination of VMM + ZUPT/ZARU + WA reduces position error (PE) to below 1 % of the distance traveled. The best-performing MEMS system achieved a 3D RMS error of 0.58 % DT, while the FOG reference remained below 0.1 %. Therefore, even with a coarse initial position the paper is demonstrating the feasibility of MEMS-only navigation for short- to medium-term autonomy.A comparison with a strategic-grade Ring Laser Gyro (RLG) INS confirmed the expected performance difference of roughly one order of magnitude but also highlighted the technological maturity of modern MEMS sensors. When combined with optimized aiding strategies, MEMS-based INS can achieve reliable sub-percent navigation accuracy, making them highly attractive for autonomous ground vehicles, defense applications, and GNSS-denied operations."

The Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) simulation is utilized to evaluate the correctness of BN predictions using evidence-based scenarios. Results demonstrate that the AutoML-enhanced DEC has outperformed traditional clustering approaches. The performance of the proposed BN model achieved an overall accuracy of 95.6%, indicating its ability to understand the complex relationship of accidents causing congestion. Validation in SUMO with evidence-based scenarios demonstrated that the BN model’s prediction of congestion states closely matches those of SUMO, indicating the high reliability of the proposed BN model in ensuring smooth urban mobility."

To address this, we propose a partitioning strategy that segments the ground into cells, clusters them into gateway-centered partitions to minimize link occupancy, and maps these partitions onto the mega-constellation network. This approach enhances global load balancing and reduces routing overhead. Within each partition, an improved Backpressure-Longer Side Priority (BP-LSP) routing algorithm further optimizes intra-partition traffic distribution. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed strategy significantly improves network load balancing, outperforming baseline methods in packet loss rate and throughput."

    "abstract": "Tokopedia is one of the largest e-commerce platforms in Indonesia and has received many opinions from users who have used the application for buying and selling activities. However, these reviews are only available in text form without any filters based on certain aspects or sentiments, making it difficult for users to understand the quality of services, products, and prices in detail. Analysis of user reviews plays an important role in understanding customer perceptions of services and features provided on e-commerce platforms. One way to overcome this problem is to use aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) techniques. Some previous studies have shown that CNN deep learning model is very good in performing aspect-based sentiment analysis. In addition to CNN, the BERT model as a contextual word embedding is also capable of producing more optimal output than conventional word embeddings. Therefore, this paper aims to classify aspect-based sentiment analysis from the Tokopedia e-commerce platform with BERT as contextual word embedding and CNN as a multi-task extraction for aspect and sentiment classification simultaneously. The dataset used amounted to 10,000 reviews and 3 aspects (Service, Quality and Price). Based on the test results obtained, the BERT-CNN method achieved an accuracy of up to 91%, which is higher than other models such as Word2Vec-CNN, XLNet-CNN, and RoBERTa-CNN, which achieved accuracies of 89%, 87%, and 90%, respectively. This result shows that using BERT as a word embedding is good for improving the accuracy of the model."

    "abstract": "Handover (HO) is essential for ensuring seamless connectivity but poses significant challenges, such as HO interruption time, frequent HO, and HO failures, especially in dense urban environments with millimeter wave small-cell deployments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel HO procedure that leverages a digital twin of the radio access network (RAN Twin), which is compatible with the 3GPP New Radio standard, Release 18. The proposed RAN Twin integrates multimodal sensing data and historical network information to generate an optimal list of candidate cells and share user equipment context data. This enables early synchronization with the target HO cell, minimizing interruption time. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the baseline 3GPP HO in terms of latency and HO rate, underscoring its potential to enhance overall network performance."

    "abstract": "Immersive communications, such as the Extended Reality (XR) and Cloud Gaming (CG), is one of six usage scenarios in the 6th generation (6G) [1]. These applications demand stringent requirements on the frame level delay and frame level reliability. At the application layer, techniques such as Forward Error Correction (FEC) are employed to ensure successful frame decoding even if some encoded packets are not received in time. However, the technical benefits of application layer FEC cannot actually be realized as although the upper layer (i.e., application layer) can tolerate errors, lower layer (i.e., physical (PHY) layer) of wireless network strives for 100% reliability. To address this contradiction, this paper proposed a Medium Access Control (MAC) sub Protocol Data Unit (subPDU) self-decoding method, where receiver (RX) can independently decode MAC subPDU(s) corresponding to a Code Block (CB) in a Transport Block (TB), without relying on the successful reception of preceding CBs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can increase the number of users whose frame decoding success rate exceeds a certain threshold in a cell (i.e., cell capacity) by 20%, the overall user experience for immersive services can be greatly improved."

By integrating multiple input multiple output (MIMO) technology with OTFS, spectral efficiency is substantially enhanced through simultaneous multi stream transmission over identical spectral resources, while maintaining transmission reliability without bandwidth expansion. In this paper, we propose a new scheme called the MIMO-OTFS system based on three-dimensional constellation diagrams (3D-MIMO-OTFS), which improves the minimum Euclidean distance (MED) of the system through three-dimensional constellation diagrams and enhances the spectrum efficiency of the system through MIMO technology. According to the simulation results, the bit error rate performance and spectrum efficiency of the proposed system are superior to those of the reference system."

    "abstract": "In modern industry, the operational status of rotating machinery has a significant impact on both production safety and economic efficiency. Deep learning-based intelligent diagnosis methods have become effective tools for fault detection. However, under complex operating conditions, single-modality diagnostic approaches often lack robustness and generalization ability. As a result, multimodal information fusion has emerged as a popular research direction. To address this issue, a multimodal cross-fusion network (MCFN) integrating attention mechanisms and a cross-guided fusion strategy is proposed. First, an improved bi-directional long short-term memory network is employed to extract temporal features from one-dimensional modality data, and a residual neural network (ResNet) captures spatial features from two-dimensional modality data. Then, a self-attention mechanism is introduced to enhance the resolution of spatiotemporal features. Finally, a cross-guided fusion module is proposed to effectively integrate multimodal information via feature interaction modulation and normalization. During model optimization, a focal loss and label smoothing strategies are introduced to improve generalization on imbalanced data. Experiments on the PU dataset involving 13 classes of bearing faults demonstrate that MCFN achieves an average testing accuracy of 97.18%, significantly outperforming comparison algorithms."

Using imitation learning based strategies to dynamically generate adaptive robot actions provides new ideas for industrial robot control. Based on the requirements of accuracy and safety for industrial tasks, this paper proposes Robust Diffusion based on the diffusion policy. The Robust Diffusion can reduce the residual noise by training effectively and increasing the success rate of the policy. To prove the feasibility of embodied Artificial Intelligence (embodied AI) application in industrial robot behaviour generation, the Robust Diffusion is applied to a seat control units picking-and-place task in the industry. The results illustrates that the success rate is improved and some of the incorrect actions are removed."

A major concern is collusion between ride-hailing service providers (RHSPs) and drivers, which can compromise passengers’ location privacy through repeated matching. Additionally, existing solutions often fail to consider drivers’ profit-oriented nature, leading to low order acceptance rates and inefficient resource allocation. To address these issues, we propose a privacy-preserving ride-matching scheme utilizing Multi-Party Secure Computation (MPC) and homomorphic encryption. Our approach prevents RHSPs from accessing sensitive user data while ensuring fair ride allocation. By incorporating drivers’ expected earnings into the matching process, our solution enhances order acceptance rates and reduces resource waste. Furthermore, an efficient decentralized matching algorithm offloads computation to Roadside Units (RSUs), minimizing reliance on centralized servers. Our scheme ensures secure, efficient, and accountable ride-hailing services while protecting user privacy."

Specifically, the model integrates a Temporal Predictive Decoder with dilated convolution for improved temporal forecasting, and a Spatial Interpolation Decoder with cross-attention to seamlessly map between input and output spaces. A synthetic dataset generated via OMNeT++ simulations is also introduced to compensate for the lack of real-world UAV jamming data. Experimental results confirm that STS-T outperforms existing baselines, providing a robust solution for predicting jamming spectrum situations in complex UAV swarm environments."

This study conducted experiments on several models and selected the highest accuracy in one of the models that had been tested. The dataset used is a public kaggle dataset. This SMS Spam dataset consists of 5572 messages categorized with rights, namely legitimate messages, and spam, which are unwanted messages. Classic Machine Learning models with Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, KNN, LDA have been piloted. The accuracy results with a value of 98% were found in SVM and Logistic Regression. Naïve Bayes of 94% generated the highest recall. The highest precession was also achieved by logistic regression, which was 98%. These findings prove that regression logistics is a reliable model for classifying messages considered correct in the context of SMS spam detection. This research contributes that classic machine learning models, especially naïve Bayes, and regression logistics, are still very relevant in dealing with digital problems, especially spam classification in SMS."

To address the challenge of poor timeliness in CSI feedback for high-speed mobile scenarios, this paper proposes a joint CSI prediction and compression scheme for CSI feedback. Traditional methods improve timeliness by increasing the feedback frequency but suffer from additional overhead. The core innovation of this proposal is the integration of CSI prediction and compression functions on the user equipment (UE) side using deep learning methods. Considering channel estimation errors, the paper investigates the optimal prediction time interval to maximize the system’s channel capacity. ConvLSTM network is used to predict the future CSI when PDSCH is transmitted with historical CSIs, followed by a Transformer model that performs adaptive compression under dynamic channel conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a 7.06% performance improvement over the eType II codebook-based feedback scheme. It ensures both timeliness and accuracy of CSI feedback in high-speed mobility scenarios while maintaining low feedback overhead."

In order to stabilize the quality of service (QoS) for each user, the transmit power is minimized under multiple mean squared error (MSE) constraints. The optimization problems of analog beamforming and RIS reflection beamforming are solved by the proposed inner approximation-iterative coordinate ascent (IA-ICA) method. Compared with the semidefinite relaxation algorithm (SDR) and latest inner majorization-minimization (iMM) method, our approach always converges to lower transmit power. Moreover, a modified subgradient method (MSM) is developed to tackle the classical convex digital precoder optimization problem and obtain the optimal values. Simulation results verify that the proposed method can obtain higher performance solutions than the existing work. The proposed IA-ICA method is more suitable for solving the non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) with extra constant modulus constraints."

To compute the optimal MA positions, we propose the geometric-detection-based derivative matching optimization (DMO) method. The MAs using the DMO method demonstrate superior cost-effectiveness and energy efficiency compared to FPAs with digital phase shifters. Unlike existing MA optimization methods, the DMO method does not require complex matrix computation. It is non-iterative and can achieve the optimal MA positions under several designed geometric conditions. When the conditions are not satisfied, we prove that the normalized mean square error (NMSE) between the theoretic optimal result and the DMO result can converge to zero. Simulation results demonstrate that the DMO-assisted MA array outperforms the FPA in received power in multi-path propagation environments."

The IndoBERT model achieved 100% training accuracy and 99.17% test accuracy, demonstrating strong performance in recognizing various spam categories.

DistilBERT achieved a validation accuracy of 99.59% and a test accuracy of 97.52%. While slightly lower in performance, it confirms the potential of DistilBERT as a lightweight alternative. These results affirm the strength of IndoBERT for nuanced spam classification in Bahasa Indonesia, while also highlighting efficiency-accuracy trade-offs relevant for real-world deployment.

While cloud-end collaborative video transmission methods can reduce bitrates beyond conventional compression techniques, the periodic transmission of high-resolution keyframes consumes significant bandwidth due to semantically irrelevant background information. To address this, we propose a cloud-edge-end collaborative video transmission scheme based on object-guided video super-resolution. In this scheme, the edge extracts key objects from sparsely selected keyframes at the end and transmits them along with low-resolution video to the cloud, where our Keyframe-Guided Video Restoration Transformer (KG-VRT) is used to improve the video quality. Experimental results on public datasets show that our network outperforms state-of-the-art keyframe-based baselines with a 1.73 dB PSNR improvement and maintains robust performance even with keyframe intervals of up to 30 frames. A comparative analysis of two transmission strategies—transmitting full keyframes versus transmitting only key object regions—demonstrates a 60% – 80% reduction in keyframe bitrate while maintaining object detection accuracy at a significantly reduced overall system bitrate. This highlights the efficiency and scalability of our approach in bandwidth-constrained surveillance scenarios."

    "abstract": "Presently, the emergence of large-scale AI models, particularly those powering AI-generated content (AIGC) systems such as ChatGPT, marks a new frontier in intelligent applications. As we move toward the era of 6G networks—characterized by ultra-low latency, ubiquitous intelligence, and massive connectivity—the integration of such models into real-world network systems becomes increasingly critical. However, two pressing challenges remain unresolved. First, task diversity across dynamic network environments necessitates models that can rapidly adapt to heterogeneous and evolving requirements. Second, the intensive computational and energy demands associated with the training and inference of large-scale models—especially under online learning scenarios—pose serious scalability concerns for network deployment.To address these dual challenges, we propose Multi-Adaptation Hubs (MAHs), a novel and scalable network architecture designed to synergize large AI models with intelligent network operations under 6G paradigms. MAHs operate by decomposing complex tasks into modular sub-domains, each handled by a lightweight sub-model constructed as a pair of low-rank matrices. This factorization strategy substantially reduces the number of trainable parameters, enabling faster adaptation and improved computational efficiency. The system then aggregates the outputs of these specialized sub-models to dynamically generate task-specific parameters, allowing for fine-grained control, modular reuse, and enhanced generalization across diverse tasks and network contexts."

    "abstract": "The rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) demands advanced residential charging solutions, where user behavior varies widely due to factors like electricity tariffs and weather conditions. Such conditions make charging predictions particularly complex. This study addresses this challenge by predicting the time an EV remains connected to a residential charger using a dataset of 106,260 sessions. To this end, we propose the Connection Time Neural Model (CTNM), a deep neural network designed to model the complex dynamics of domestic charging, and we introduce the Weighted Error Metric (WEM), a novel metric that penalizes overestimations and under-estimations differently to reflect their real-world impacts on both grid management and user experience. Utilizing bidirectional charger data, we focus solely on connection time, bypassing energy prediction. CTNM is benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods (i.e., Random Forest, Dense Neural Network, XGBoost, and Support Vector Regression) using Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and WEM as performance metrics. Results demonstrate CTNM’s superiority, reducing average error by 18%, and weighted error by 31% compared to Random Forest, thanks to its deep architecture and integration of contextual features, like variable tariffs and weather."

EtherCAT over TSN transforms a traditional EtherCAT ring into multiple shorter rings interconnected via TSN switches, enabling concurrent data transmission across segments and reducing cycle time. However, the use of multiple segments introduces contention for the master in the return path, potentially leading to scheduling failures and an increase in cycle time. We study the impact of network topology, i.e., the number of segments and slave node distribution, on schedulability, and formulate the topology optimization problem for the converged network based on schedulability analysis. We evaluate our methodology and optimal solution using SMT and Integer Programming (LIP) solvers, respectively. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and our solution outperforms baselines."

To address this limitation, we propose a hybrid stock prediction model based on Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), which captures both short-term fluctuations and long-term dependencies in time series data. Furthermore, we integrate sentiment features derived from financial news using natural language processing techniques, allowing the model to incorporate qualitative insights alongside numerical data. Experimental results across multiple stocks show that our model outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. This study demonstrates the value of combining affective computing with deep temporal modeling for more reliable and socially aware financial forecasting."

To address this, we present a network digital twin (NDT)-enhanced QoE optimization scheme tailored for the unique demands of IoV environments. Our approach integrates a context-aware gated recurrent unit (GRU) within the NDT to proactively predict short-term bandwidth fluctuations and enable anticipatory bitrate adaptation. We introduce a user-centric QoE model that dynamically incorporates the real-time perceptual QoE factors derived from vehicular user digital twins (VUEDTs). Furthermore, we formulate a joint optimization problem that simultaneously determines optimal video bitrate and resource allocation to maximize user-specific QoE under high-mobility IoV scenario. This problem is modeled as a Markov decision process and solved using a proximal policy optimization learning framework. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme can achieve significantly improved user QoE when compared to other baseline schemes."

However, achieving ultrahigh-definition (UHD) OCT with broadband swept lasers necessitates advanced system-level optimization to address challenges such as dispersion management, sensitivity roll-off, and imaging depth. This study presents a comprehensive framework for optimizing UHD-OCT systems by integrating broadband swept laser sources with tailored system designs. We employ a multi-objective optimization approach that balances spectral bandwidth, sweep rate, and coherence length to enhance axial resolution while maintaining sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Advanced algorithms for dispersion compensation and numerical refocusing are implemented to mitigate aberrations and extend the effective imaging range. Experimental validation demonstrates a resolution of <2 µm axial and <3 µm lateral over a 3 mm depth, enabled by a 250 nm broadband swept laser operating at 200 kHz sweep rate. Furthermore, we introduce a novel noise-reduction strategy leveraging digital signal processing (DSP) to suppress relative intensity noise (RIN) and improve image contrast. The optimized system is evaluated in biological samples, revealing subcellular features with unprecedented clarity. This work provides a scalable blueprint for UHD-OCT systems, broadening their applicability in ophthalmology, cardiology, and oncology."

The proposed approach formulates the HITS network design as a grid-based optimization problem that minimizes the cumulative risk associated with the grid cells occupied by the network. Without compromising model integrity, the approach is illustrated through an equivalent objective that minimizes the number of activated grid cells. The solution maintains origin–destination (OD) connectivity and enforces flow conservation. In contrast to previous routing-based formulations, this method reduces algorithmic complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left( {{G^2} \\times P} \\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(G)$, where G is the number of grid cells and P is the number of OD pairs. This OD-agnostic formulation enables large-scale deployment without performance degradation. A comparative analysis between the routing-based and grid-based approaches demonstrates significant improvements in scalability, and a case study validates the model’s key feature—that the solution time is independent of the number of OD pairs. The paper also outlines potential extensions involving 3D layered routing, risk-aware network design, and real-time simulation-based validation."

Intent-driven network (IDN) enables network operators to express high-level intents using natural language, which are then automatically translated into executable network configurations. However, the unstructured and ambiguous nature of intents poses challenges to achieving accurate intent-to-configuration translation. The emergence of a large language model (LLM) offers a promising solution to this problem. This paper proposes an LLM-empowered framework for generating IDN configurations, which integrates fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation, prompt engineering, and knowledge distillation techniques. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through a network slicing use case implemented using open-source tools. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework improves configuration generation time and accuracy by 24% and 25%, respectively, compared to the baseline schemes."

Therefore, in this paper, we first construct an IoV communication-sensing-computation integration architecture. Then we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning-based method for the joint optimization of latency and energy consumption for the ICSC in IoV, incorporating weighted decomposition and neighborhood parameter transfer strategy. Simulation results demonstrate that our method has a better ability of convergence and diversity and lower running time than the traditional method."

Moreover, in our model, a residual structure is introduced to bridge the gap between the statistical model and the measurement data. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves a prediction error [root mean square error (RMSE)] of 3.5 ± 0.2 dB compared to the 7.1 ± 1.5 dB for 3GPP statistical model prediction, and the pearson correlation coefficient of 0.88.

Secure communication between these devices remains a challenge, as traditional cryptographic key exchange protocols impose significant computational and power constraints. Physically Derived Symmetric Key (PDSK) generation offers a lightweight alternative by leveraging the shared wireless channel characteristics to establish encryption keys without prior trust. Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of PDSK in ultra-wideband (UWB) systems, as UWB’s high-resolution channel measurements capture high-entropy yet highly correlated signal variations at different devices. In this work, we evaluate the feasibility of UWB-based PDSK in BAN wearable devices. Our results show that secret keys can be reliably generated, achieving a bit agreement rate (BAR) of 84.14% and a key success rate (KSR) of 92.7% while generating 240-bit keys in 0.35s. We further analyse key generation performance across different wearable placements and movement conditions, demonstrating that UWB-based PDSK is a viable and practical solution for secure communication in BAN applications."

This paper presents a bio-inspired fin-ray gripper with force-position hybrid control, designed to enhance the grasping of delicate and irregularly shaped objects. Inspired by fish fin structures, the gripper utilizes TPU 95A material for its grasping end, featuring a trapezoidal geometry with transverse notches to increase contact area and friction, thereby improving adaptability and stability. An adaptive PID controller, incorporating just-in-time learning (JITL) and real-time sensor feedback, dynamically adjusts force and position parameters to prevent excessive deformation and ensure safety. Experimental validation on a robotic arm demonstrates superior performance in grasping fragile, soft, and rigid objects compared to traditional position control, with reduced object and gripper deformation."

Leveraging both onboard and roadside unit computing resources for collaborative processing, we formulate a non-convex mixed-integer optimization problem to maximize the collected reward that integrates path planning, UGV speed control, offloading decisions, and energy management.

To solve this problem, previous works have exploited vehicles and road side units as anchors, and suggested estimating the distance using phase information of V2X (vehicle-to-everything) OFDM signals. To further reduce the outage and improve the positioning accuracy, it is reasonable to use as positioning anchors the large number of LEO (Low Earth Orbit) satellites, which currently are mainly deployed for ubiquitous communications. Experiments in some literature revealed that LEO satellites use an OFDM-like structure to transmit data, and it is possible to exploit the OFDM phase information of LEO satellite signals to estimate the distance. It is well known that the impact of Doppler shift is serious at high speeds. To verify the feasibility of using the OFDM-based ranging with LEO satellites, this paper analyzes the impact of Doppler shift on the phase measurement of OFDM signals, and reports the ranging performance under 3D ray tracing simulations."

Specifically, to guarantee fairness, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the minimum achievable rate over all users via UAV trajectory, transmit beamforming, and antenna position design, subject to a covertness constraint. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, we develop a two-step method to obtain a sub-optimal solution. Specifically, we first design the UAV trajectory under the assumption of ideal beam patterns, which significantly decouples the UAV trajectory optimization and directional transmit beamforming. Then, an alternating optimization algorithm with the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique is developed to optimize the UAV transmit beamforming and MAs’ positions. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed system design can effectively enhance spectrum-efficiency and stealth of UAV downlink transmissions, significantly outperform conventional systems with fixed-position antenna (FPA) arrays, and closely approach the performance upper bound with ideal beam patterns."

This paper proposes an efficient latency based task offloading strategy in a multi-tier Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network (SAGIN) with MEC and FSO communications. We consider a static deployment of ground users in Yamagata prefecture, Japan, offloading computational tasks to High Altitude Platforms (HAPs) and a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellation. In this system, elevation-based FSO visibility and atmospheric attenuation can affect transmission latency, while server workload can impact computation latency. We design a hierarchical clustering-based framework and evaluate it alongside two other baseline approaches in terms of latency performance.

In Indonesia, water sources are generally categorized into two types: piped water distribution systems and non-piped sources. Piped water is managed and distributed by clean water utility companies through plumbing systems equipped with water meters to measure customer usage. This study presents a system designed to assist water utility companies in remotely monitoring customer water usage in real-time using Internet of Things (IoT) technology, without requiring each household to have its own Wi-Fi network. The system collects water flow data using the YF-S201 water flow sensor connected to an ESP32 microcontroller. It utilizes Espressif Mesh Networking Protocol (ESP-MESH) technology to implement a Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) as the local communication protocol between sensor nodes, eliminating the need for internet connectivity. The ESP-MESH network supports self-configuration and self-healing capabilities, simplifying the deployment and maintenance of each node. Once data is collected locally, it is transmitted to an Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) broker via a gateway using the SX1276 Long Range (LoRa) module, which enables long-range communication to cover a broader area. The data published to the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) broker is then subscribed to and visualized through a dashboard built using the Node-Red platform. The results show that the system has an average water volume measurement error rate of 6.73% and an average data transmission latency from the sensor node to the gateway of 3029.8 ms over a distance of up to 50 meters."

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) provide a wide range of opportunities for the service sector, such as last-mile deliveries, surveillance, and data gathering. Finding an optimal collision-free path is necessary to enable UAVs to complete their mission successfully. However, most of the existing path-planning solutions focus on a single UAV and a single target only while overlooking the case of a UAV swarm that collaborates to find collision-free service delivery paths spanning multiple targets or points of interest within a three-dimensional (3D) map. Therefore, to overcome this limitation we propose a novel Multi-UAV Direct Goal Bias Rapidly Exploring Random Trees Star (MDGB-RRT*) algorithm to provide robust path solutions where multiple UAVs traverse a shared 3D urban environment, with each having unique identified goal positions whilst traversing the map with collision-free guarantees. In contrast to RRT*, MDGB-RRT* directly connects the expanding tree to the target location within a predefined search radius, which reduces both the initial pre-validated path length and computation time. The simulation results obtained show that MDGB-RRT* achieves a notable performance advantage compared to existing algorithms for both single and dual-UAV urbanised 3D environment. In addition, MDGB-RRT* maintains its performance advantages with the introduction of two UAVs within the same environment."

The sub-block indices are then permuted to generate a set of equivalent puncturing patterns (EPPs), each of which guarantees high reliability for message bits. A puncturing pattern for each HARQ transmission is selected from the generated set of EPPs. A Gaussian-approximation based method is proposed to optimize the selection, ensuring that additional redundancy bits are sent in HARQ transmissions. The proposed design has low complexity due to the limited number of sub-blocks and can be implemented offline to generate a lookup table of puncturing patterns. Up to 0.5 dB improvements in the error-correcting performance are obtained compared with state-of-the-art techniques."

    "abstract": "With the advent of the 6G mobile communication network era, the existing non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA) technology faces the challenge of high successive interference in multi-user scenarios, which limits its ability to support more user access. To address this, this paper proposes a novel power-domain sparse-dimensional constellation multiple-access scheme (PD-SDCMA). Through the signal space dimension selection strategy (S2D-strategy), this scheme sparsely superposes low-dimensional constellations onto high-dimensional signal spaces, and reduces the high-order interference caused by superposition coding (SC) by taking advantage of the non-correlation between dimensions. Specifically, PD-SDCMA reduces the successive interference between users by sparsifying the dimension allocation of constellation superposition and designs a sparse superposition method based on the theory of vector space signal representation. Simulation results show that, under the AWGN channel, PD-SDCMA significantly outperforms the traditional PD-NOMA in terms of the number of supported users under QPSK and 16QAM modulations, and also has better BER performance. This paper provides a new solution for efficient spectrum utilization in future scenarios with large-scale user access."

    "abstract": "Blockchain has been widely adopted for reputation management in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems due to its decentralization, immutability, and traceability. As more IIoT devices participate in reputation evaluations, there is an increasing demand for low-latency and reliable traceability of reputation data. However, conventional blockchain traceability queries require traversing all on-chain transactions to find target data, leading to high latency in both data querying and result verifying. To this end, we propose a fast and verifiable tracing approach for blockchain-enabled reputation management in IIoT networks, namely BCTree. Specifically, to reduce query time for reputation traceability, we accelerate multiple types of reputation queries by designing a hierarchical index structure for BCTree. This index structure incorporates Merkle B<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">+</sup>-trees for fast retrieval of reputation values and Shifting Hash Bloom Filters (SHBFs) for fast retrieval of evaluators and evaluated entities. Furthermore, to reduce verification time for query result integrity, we develop a lightweight verification technique for BCTree based on a One-Hashing Bloom Filter (OHBF). Simulation results demonstrate that, compared to the state-of-the-art baseline, our BCTree reduces traceability query time by 86.78%, verification time by 22.01%, and verification object size by 33.22%, making it well-suited for latency-sensitive IIoT reputation management applications."

To address this, we propose a dynamic beamforming scheme to mitigate HO failures and improve data rates. First, a beamforming-based HO model is established, quantifying the impact of beam direction on data rate and HO reliability. Based on this, an optimization problem is formulated, aiming to enhance data rate, reduce HO failure probability, and minimize beam adjustment overhead. Subsequently, a dynamic beam adjustment algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning is designed, leveraging its real-time decision-making capability to adaptively optimize the beam direction under rapidly changing channel conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme requires only 23% of the beam adjustment overhead of the ideal real-time precise beamforming, while achieves nearly identical HO performance and 98.9% of its data rate."

    "abstract": "The introduction of Collective Perception (CP) services in Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) aimed to enhance safety by increasing awareness of both V2X and non-V2X objects. Recent research confirms that CP services can significantly boost awareness. However, CP services come with several drawbacks, including the need for additional channel capacity to transmit generated CP messages (CPMs) and the required extra processing power at the CPM receiving vehicle to process all the received CPM objects. While numerous studies address the former drawback, there is a gap in research concerning the latter challenge. This study addresses that gap by proposing a novel, lightweight approach to optimize CPM processing through intelligent filtering of received data. At the core of our approach is a lightweight yet effective utility function, designed to identify which CPM objects are relevant in a given driving context. Our analysis shows that the majority of received CPM objects are not utilized by the receiving vehicle, indicating considerable potential for optimization. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed utility function can filter out up to 74% of CPM objects in some scenarios, while the resulting reduction in useful situational awareness remains as low as 0.031% illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in conserving computational resources without significantly compromising safety."

This paper proposes a novel vision-assisted point cloud data association method for MTT. Firstly, we utilize the back-projection information of visual detection to assist in partitioning the measurement set, which effectively handles situations involving multiple closely spaced targets. In addition, to mitigate the impact of radar missed detection on association and tracking performance, we present a point cloud measurement supplementation method based on the combination of the unmatched back-projection point of visual detection with the predicted state information of the corresponding target. Finally, the Murty algorithm is introduced to obtain the association subset and implement global hypothesis updates in MTT.

The approach leverages the GAMEEMO dataset (four emotional states) and the ESR dataset (five seizure-related categories) to develop compact, high-performance models. Preliminary experiments validate the pipeline’s feasibility, achieving 92.6% accuracy with a 15 ms inference time (int8 quantization) for seizure detection on ESR, and 79.9% accuracy (raw data, 16 filters) with RDT preprocessing reducing inference time to 146 ms (77.9% accuracy, 85% on-device with 20 samples, int8) for emotion recognition on GAMEEMO. RDT reduces data dimensionality, enabling a five-fold latency decrease compared to raw data processing, while maintaining discriminative features critical for classification.

    "abstract": "Adversarial training (AT) has shown impressive advantages in maintaining accuracy and enhancing robustness against adversarial examples. However, most existing AT techniques jointly optimize clean-example accuracy and adversarial-example robustness as dual objectives. This setting introduces an often overlooked issue; when optimizing hard samples near the decision boundary, the model may bolster robustness at the expense of accuracy or preserve accuracy to the detriment of robustness. To alleviate the accuracy–robustness sacrifices induced by hard samples, we propose mitigating hard sample interference (MHSI) from a sample-intervention perspective. MHSI aims to reduce the instability caused by hard samples during AT. Specifically, we introduce a weighted adaptive (WA) mechanism that strengthens the model’s learning of clean samples, thereby reducing the negative impact of hard samples on accuracy. In addition, guided by an analysis of the gradient norm and the Hessian matrix, we design a dynamic calibration (DC) strategy that dynamically calibrates the probability outputs of hard samples to mitigate their damage to robustness. With these two modules, our approach significantly improves robustness without sacrificing accuracy. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, and SVHN demonstrate that MHSI effectively improves both accuracy and robustness and outperforms state-of-the-art methods under glass-box attacks. Notably, under an <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$l_{\\infty }$</tex-math> </inline-formula> attack, MHSI yields up to a 6.22% robustness gain over the AT baseline.

    "abstract": "Despite significant advancements in large visual-language models (LVLMs), hallucinations remain a major bottleneck in their practical applications. One key factor contributing to hallucinations is the over-reliance on language priors during the autoregressive text generation process. Visual Contrastive Decoding (VCD), a popular technique for mitigating hallucinations, perturbs the visual input and compares the perturbed output with the original. However, it often overlooks the gradual attenuation of visual information within the decoder, limiting the model's ability to generate text based on actual visual content. We propose a novel, training-free method—Visual-Enhanced Contrastive Decoding (VECD)—which addresses this issue by amplifying visual information within the decoder, thereby reducing hallucinations caused by excessive reliance on language priors. VECD dynamically selects later layers for visual injection, while retaining only essential visual tokens in early layers. This approach enhances the generation process by adaptively balancing visual and language priors. By comparing outputs with and without visual amplification, we derive a refined probability distribution for the next token. Moreover, we improve the beam search algorithm by introducing a visually guided token selection strategy, enabling the generation of text that aligns more closely with the image content. Our extensive experiments show that VECD significantly reduces hallucinations and improves the quality of generated text, demonstrating its effectiveness as a practical solution."

    "abstract": "With the wide spread of video, video watermarking has become increasingly crucial for copyright protection and content authentication. However, video watermarking still faces numerous challenges. For example, existing methods typically have shortcomings in terms of watermarking capacity and robustness, and there is a lack of specialized noise layer for High Efficiency Video Coding(HEVC) compression. To address these issues, this paper introduces a Deep Invertible Network for Video watermarking (DINVMark) and designs a noise layer to simulate HEVC compression. This approach not only increases watermarking capacity but also enhances robustness. DINVMark employs an Invertible Neural Network (INN), where the encoder and decoder share the same network structure for both watermark embedding and extraction. This shared architecture ensures close coupling between the encoder and decoder, thereby improving the accuracy of the watermark extraction process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly enhances watermark robustness, preserves video quality, and substantially increases watermark embedding capacity."

    "abstract": "Inherently equipped with arbitrary resolution and multi-view consistency, the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) as an implicit scene representation has drawn extensive attention. While traditional NeRFs excel at novel view synthesis (NVS) under ideal conditions, they overlook the potential of learning consistent geometric representations across varying sight qualities. Current methods mainly focus on optimizing synthesis under clear visibility, which limits their effectiveness in downstream scene understanding tasks where robust geometry comprehension is crucial. In this paper, we propose a NVS pre-training technique named ShadowNeRF which firstly synthesizes degraded views with shadowed regions to challenge the model in inferring complete scene geometries. We then design a self-supervised sight recovery process with a two-stage unshadowing framework, which progressively recovers neighboring areas and reveals geometric properties of invisible regions. This pre-training strategy of degradation synthesis and recovery, when combined with taskspecific fine-tuning, enhances the understanding of underlying scene structure for the model and strengthens its ability to process scenes under varying sight conditions. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our pre-training and finetuning pipeline significantly improves the model performances in semantic segmentation and 3D object detection, as well as the reconstruction quality of complex scenes."

    "abstract": "Anisotropic Magnetoresistance (AMR) angle sensors are widely utilized in industrial applications owing to their non-contact operation, cost efficiency, and miniaturization potential. However, harmonic distortion inherent in AMR measurements fundamentally limits angle encoder accuracy. This work introduces a high-precision AMR sensor employing a wave-type topology that suppresses harmonic errors through geometric innovation, demonstrating significant performance enhancements versus conventional strip-type sensors: 64.3% reduction in maximum angular error (0.50° vs. 1.4°), 65.3% lower worst-case nonlinearity (0.2% vs. 0.576%), and minimal change in repeatability (0.14° vs. 0.137°). Systematic evaluation of dynamic responses under variable field angles through Stoner–Wohlfarth modeling and experimental validation exhibits excellent agreement, confirming curvature optimization effectively minimizes angular errors. Mechanistic analysis identifies demagnetizing fields and induced anisotropy as dominant error sources. Crucially, this architecture maintains fabrication simplicity, demonstrating exceptional cost-performance synergy for automotive, robotics, and industrial automation applications requiring sub-0.5° accuracy."

    "abstract": "Shadow-based moving target tracking is essential for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-borne video synthetic aperture radar (ViSAR). Traditional detect-before-track (DBT) algorithms are ineffective for dim shadows, while track-before-detect (TBD) algorithms incur prohibitive computational costs. Moreover, improving tracking accuracy for dim shadows often increases false alarms in cluttered areas. This paper presents an adaptive shadow-aware tracking (ASAT) algorithm and its implementation for low-power edge deployment. The algorithm adaptively extracts the moving target shadow aggregation area (MSAA) from current frames using prior tracking results. Shadows within the MSAA are classified into strong and dim categories using multi-value constant false alarm rate detection and morphological processing. Dim shadow traces are then processed by a TBD-based algorithm, while strong shadow traces are handled by a DBT-based algorithm. Together, adaptive MSAA extraction and subsequent classification-based processing form a joint strategy that enhances tracking accuracy and improves real-time performance on low-power edge platforms. The ASAT algorithm is deployed on a low-power edge system-on-module featuring a multi-core central processing unit and an embedded graphics processing unit. To enable low-power edge–oriented algorithm design and lightweight implementation, an algorithm–hardware co-design methodology is introduced. Experiments on UAV-borne ViSAR data demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively outperforms traditional approaches in both tracking accuracy and real-time performance on UAV-borne low-power edge platforms."

    "abstract": "Visual place recognition is a fundamental task essential for applications like visual localization and loop closure detection. Existing methods perform well under controlled environments, but often fail in scenarios with significant domain shifts, such as drastic day-to-night transitions and severe occlusions. This limitation arises because existing approaches are globally optimized without explicit supervision for out-of-distribution (OOD) adaptation and overlook semantics as a complementary modality for improving OOD robustness via local context refinement. To address this, we propose a dual-branch network that jointly optimizes feature attention and feature description under semantic guidance, achieving improved OOD adaptation with overhead comparable to existing methods. The feature attention branch is guided by semantically-informed context richness, while the feature description branch is supervised through inter-class repelling and intra-class re-ranking. Additionally, we introduce a simple yet effective query rejection module that leverages the learned attention to assess an image’s informativeness, allowing it to exclude queries that lack place-representative context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method raises the average Recall@1 and Recall@5 by 3.5 and 3.9 percentage points over its state-of-the-art counterpart, and accelerates feature matching by 28% for downstream visual localization without performance degradation."

    "abstract": "“One-way wave-equation depth migration (OWDM) is a foundational and efficiency-driven technique in seismic imaging. However, conventional OWDM methods, such as the split-step Fourier (SSF) and generalized screen propagator (GSP) methods, exhibit limited accuracy, particularly when imaging geological structures with steeply dipping reflectors or strong lateral velocity variations. Highly accurate local-velocity-based approaches are prohibitive in 3D applications due to computational intensity for large-scale tensor decomposition operations or multiple iterations. To address this critical issue, this study proposes a novel OWDM method combining the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Padé approximation for wavefield extrapolation (FFT–Padé). The method efficiently calculates the square-root operator in the wavenumber domain using a pseudo-spectral Helmholtz operator, then approximates the one-way wave propagator with an accurate, low-order Padé expansion. Quantitative numerical tests demonstrate that the proposed FFT–Padé method provides significantly improved amplitude fidelity and effective artifact suppression, notably enhancing the imaging of steep-dip reflectors compared with both SSF and GSP techniques. Critically, these accuracy gains are achieved with minimal computational overhead, as only 16% slower than the GSP method. Application to real seismic data confirms the method’s robustness, superior imaging clarity, with a signal-to-noise ratio approximately 12% greater than that of the SSF method."

A key bottleneck in such systems is the limited communication bandwidth between edge and cloud, which necessitates quantization of the information transmitted about generated tokens. In this work, we introduce a novel quantize-sample (Q-S) strategy that provably preserves the output distribution of the cloud-based model, ensuring that the verified tokens match the distribution of those that would have been generated directly by the LLM. We develop a throughput model for edge-cloud SD that explicitly accounts for communication latency. Leveraging this model, we propose an adaptive mechanism that optimizes token throughput by dynamically adjusting the draft length and quantization precision in response to both semantic uncertainty and channel conditions. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed Q-S approach significantly improves decoding efficiency in realistic edge-cloud deployment scenarios."

    "abstract": "3D scene graph generation (3DSGG), which involves classifying objects and predicates, is an emerging topic in 3D scene understanding. Recent studies leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) have introduced sophisticated architectures that enhance classification performance. However, since GNNs serve as the core and constitute the majority of parameters in 3DSGG models, their computational demands substantially increase overall complexity, which makes it difficult to determine the optimal model capacity. In this paper, we propose the first compression framework for lightweight 3DSGG models, based on pruning-as-search and knowledge distillation. This framework integrates multiple strategies and modules. In phase 1, the framework identifies the optimal compression ratio through pruning-as-search. In phase 2, to mitigate the accuracy loss incurred during compression, we employ structured pruning and a novel knowledge distillation strategy that effectively transfers precise information from the teacher to the compressed model. Experimental results show that our approach reduces model size by more than half while improving classification accuracy.

In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient framework for cross-domain resource coordination tailored specifically to scalable video coding (SVC) multicast transmission. Our work jointly considers both optical resources on the wired side and wireless resources on the wireless side, where we introduce advanced techniques such as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to boost spectral efficiency and better accommodate high data-rate demands. By leveraging the flexible wavelength allocation capability and energy-saving advantages of time and wavelength division multiplexed passive optical network (TWDM-PON), we formulate a unified optimization problem based on a utility function that balances user quality of experience (QoE) and overall system power consumption. The optimization problem involves selecting suitable SVC enhancement layers for users, assigning wireless resources, and allocating optical wavelengths. To simplify this complex process, we divide the original problem into two subproblems: user grouping and resource allocation. The subproblem is converted into a convex form using the convex-concave procedure (CCP) and solved iteratively. Our proposed solution effectively coordinates optical and wireless resources, addressing repeated requests for identical video content alongside QoE requirements. Simulation results demonstrate that our method achieves improved resource utilization and a better balance between QoE and power efficiency compared to existing approaches."

The findings show that navigation depth exerts a stronger influence on trust perception and search efficiency than color, with the flat structure consistently outperforming the tree structure. While color had a modest effect, blue interfaces facilitated more efficient visual exploration than red or green. These results highlight that structural simplicity outweighs color cues in shaping elderly users’ trust, offering empirical evidence and design implications for developing accessible and trustworthy health applications for aging populations."

    "abstract": "Nonlinear microscopy enables label-free imaging by deriving contrast from the intrinsic spectroscopic responses of specimens, thereby offering a valuable tool for biomedical applications. Often, clinical imaging systems implement either multiphoton or vibrational contrast, not both. Consequently, most clinically deployed label-free nonlinear microscopes lack a robust, complementary contrast palette suitable for investigating the morphofunctional features of heterogeneous specimens. This deficiency limits not only the analytical capabilities of the nonlinear microscope but also its diagnostic utility. A main reason for this disregard is that the various imaging modalities impose distinct and stringent requirements on the excitation source and the detection chain. In this contribution, we propose a strategy that targets both multiphoton and vibrational contrasts to achieve a robust, complementary contrast palette. The approach emerges from a systematic investigation of readout schemes and provides engineering criteria to tailor the detection chain and thus maximize quantitative performance. In concert with this detection strategy, we present a compact laser source that drives vibrational coherences while simultaneously exciting multiphoton signals. We validate the resulting imaging platform using two rodent case studies: one involving a naturally occurring metastatic cancer in a mouse and another relying on an allogeneic mammary cancer model in a rat. Owing to its dimensions, cost, and versatility, we anticipate that this biophotonics tool will readily find its way into clinical applications."

In the proposed method, preprocessing is first applied to the raw field data, including outlier removal, extraction of charging/discharging segments, and SOH labeling. Subsequently, a set of key battery health features are extracted from the processed sensor data, including various statistics of battery pack voltage, current, temperature, as well as vehicle operational data such as mileage, speed, etc. These extracted features provide a comprehensive representation of in-vehicle battery degradation behavior. Next, a hybrid deep neural network model, integrating the convolutional neural network, temporal convolution network, and attention mechanism, is developed to map these features to battery SOH. Numerical experiments are conducted using data from 13 real-world EVs. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accurate SOH estimation, effectively capturing the degradation dynamics of EV batteries in real-world conditions."

Five classifiers (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting) were implemented and evaluated through cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning. The experimental results showed that Gradient Boosting achieved the highest performance, with an accuracy of 94.82% and balanced precision, recall, and F1 scores across all classes. Further SHAP analysis identified key features such as phone usage hours, total screen time, and physical activity.

Specific attention is given to the real-time parameter estimation of dc-ac switched-mode power converters; Nevertheless, the proposed method can be applied to many alternative applications where efficient and accurate parameter estimation is required. The proposed scheme is computationally efficient, based on a Kalman filter algorithm, and uses an infinite impulse response adaptive filter as the plant model. The system identification scheme reduces the complexity of computation of existing typical adaptive algorithms. Importantly, the proposed approach can also identify the parameters fast and accurately, thus providing an efficient hardware solution that is suitable for real-time applications. In doing so, the uncertainties of VSIs can be identified by estimated parameters changes. The analysis of simulation and verification based on experimental data from a prototype flexible dc-ac converter is presented. Results clearly demonstrate that the estimated parameters of the dc-ac converter are a high match to the real experimental system. The scheme can be directly employed on adaptive and self-tuning digital controllers to improve control performance of a wide range of renewable energy applications."

To address this gap, this paper investigates sensing mutual information (SMI) in a general scenario where a sensing transmitter (TX) sends random signals to multiple targets each equipped with an IRS, and multiple sensing receivers (RXs) process the received echoes. We derive a closed-form tight upper bound on SMI and propose an efficient manifold optimization-based method to maximize it by jointly optimizing the transmit precoder and IRS reflection coefficients. Simulation results validate our analysis and demonstrate substantial enhancements in SMI achieved by the proposed method."

    "abstract": "The underwater propulsion system is a vital component of marine equipment such as ships, submarines, and unmanned underwater vehicles, making accurate fault diagnosis essential for ensuring operational reliability. However, existing data-driven methods face key challenges: the absence of a comprehensive mixed fault dataset, difficulty in extracting features from nonlinear and dynamically coupled signals, and sensor data imbalance caused by varying sensor reliability. To address these issues, we propose a Residual Convolutional Fusion Network (RCFN) that incorporates three core modules—double-loop residual convolution, feature reconstruction, and multi-sensor interactive fusion. RCFN enhances feature extraction, reduces redundancy, and improves the integration of multi-sensor data. Experimental results demonstrate that RCFN achieves a 3.2%–10.5% improvement in fault recognition accuracy over baseline models. Furthermore, we developed a dedicated experimental platform and constructed a comprehensive mixed fault dataset using four types of sensors to simulate four single faults and seven mixed faults in underwater propulsion systems."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel physical layer security (PLS) scheme for non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems that jointly enhances secrecy and bit error rate (BER). The proposed approach leverages power hopping (PH), wherein users’ power coefficients are dynamically allocated to obscure both the decoding order and actual power allocation from potential eavesdroppers. This uncertainty significantly reduces the feasibility of successful interception. Analytical expressions for the BER and secrecy outage probability (SOP) are derived under diverse channel conditions and eavesdropping scenarios. The theoretical findings, validated through Monte Carlo simulations, confirm that the proposed scheme robustly preserves the secrecy of legitimate users regardless of the eavesdropper’s channel quality. Moreover, the approach yields substantial improvements in both BER and SOP, particularly for the near user."

    "abstract": "Automatic modulation classification (AMC) has emerged as a key technique in smart radio environments in sixth-generation (6G) communications. AMC enables effective data transmission and supports deep connectivity without requiring prior knowledge of modulation schemes. However, the low classification accuracy under the condition of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) limits the implementation of AMC techniques under the rapidly changing physical channels in 6G and beyond. This paper investigates the AMC technique for the signals with dynamic and varying SNRs, and a deep learning based noise reduction network is proposed to reduce the noise introduced by the wireless channel and the receiving equipment. In particular, a transfer learning guided learning framework (TNR-AMC) is proposed to utilize the scarce annotated modulation signals and improve the classification accuracy for low SNR modulation signals. The numerical results show that the proposed noise reduction network achieves an accuracy improvement of over 20% in low SNR scenarios, and the TNR-AMC framework can improve the classification accuracy under unstable SNRs."

    "abstract": "Frequency agile waveforms have been widely used to improve radar's anti-jamming performance. However, such waveforms induce initial phase jitter and disrupt signal coherence, which escalates the problem of the target motion compensation and signal processing computational cost. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a novel method for designing ingenious frequency and pulse repetition frequency (PRF) joint agile waveforms that integrates target motion compensation, jitter initial phase compensation, and efficient coherent accumulation. First, the frequency and PRF of each group are ingeniously designed to preserve coherent echo signals, enabling the minimum image entropy algorithm to be introduced for target velocity estimation and achieve target motion compensation. Thanks to the identical frequency set of each pulse group, an inter-group cofrequency echo phase cancellation method is proposed to achieve precise compensation for initial phase jitter. Finally, a linear fitting method across pulse phases is proposed to achieve target Doppler uniformization, facilitating efficient target accumulation by the FFT algorithm. Simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed waveform and processing method for motion compensation and coherent processing for targets."

However, the LSLSNs operate in an open space environment, where the effects of space environmental factors such as electromagnetic radiation, thermal conditions and solar flares can easily lead to regional correlated damage for satellite nodes, severely degrading network performance. To ensure stable and robust transmission, we propose a Robust and Intelligent Multipath QUIC Transmission (RIMT) method in LSLSNs. The RIMT method is deployed in multi-domain based satellite networks leveraging distributed Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technology, where satellites are divided into various autonomous domains managed by a local SDN controller for high efficiency and flexible management. To address regional correlated damage, RIMT employs pre-computed backup flows to seamlessly switch from compromised flows. Additionally, we introduce an innovative congestion control algorithm designed to maintain stable data transmission during the route switching process. We implement RIMT in the Kuiper K3 shell network, experiments show that RIMT can achieve more enhanced performance than other mechanisms."

    "abstract": "This study addresses the challenge of inaccurate dispensing positioning caused by angular deviation in the placement of PCB workpieces. An innovative dispensing localization method based on Blob analysis and template matching is proposed. First, Blob analysis is performed on the PCB workpiece to generate a binary image containing all dispensing points. A highly reliable positioning template is then obtained using template matching. Subsequently, the coordinates of each dispensing point within the template are mapped to their corresponding locations on a new PCB workpiece via an affine transformation. The key advantage of the proposed method is its ability to acquire a comprehensive and effective positioning template in a single operation, which is then used to locate dispensing positions on PCBs with angular deviations. Simulation experiments demonstrate that even when the acquired PCB workpiece exhibits a certain degree of angular deviation, the method maintains a positioning error below 0.1%. Therefore, the proposed approach provides a practical and efficient solution for achieving high-precision and high-efficiency PCB dispensing processes. Simulation results demonstrate the method's strong capability in correcting positional and angular misalignments. While initial validation is conducted under controlled conditions, the proposed approach presents a promising and efficient solution framework for high-precision PCB dispensing, laying the groundwork for future validation in real-world industrial settings."

The AQ sensor system is integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) to improve sensing performance and reliability.

The main issue addressed is the low Lighthouse performance scores, which indicate slow initial loading times and large JavaScript bundle sizes, especially on pages with complex visual elements. To address these challenges, the research adopts a structured methodology consisting of initial performance analysis, identification of performance bottlenecks, implementation of modular loading strategies, and post-optimization testing. Development was conducted using Visual Studio Code, and performance evaluation was carried out with Google Lighthouse, Webpack Bundle Analyzer, and browser developer tools. The application developed for this study includes several core pages such as Login, Data Analysis, Data Account, Data Income, and Data Menu. The results demonstrate significant improvements: over 80% reduction in bundle size, up to 80.66% faster loading times, and performance score increases ranging from 19% to 70.8% across key metrics including First Contentful Paint (FCP), Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Total Blocking Time (TBT), and Speed Index. These findings confirm that modular and on-demand loading strategies can effectively enhance the responsiveness and efficiency of CSR-based web applications.

    "abstract": "Low-power wake-up signal (LP-WUS) serves as a critical technology addressing the energy efficiency requirements of Internet of things (IoT) devices. LP-WUS adopts the on-off keying (OOK) modulation scheme to implement device wake-up functionality, which achieves substantial energy consumption reduction. Furthermore, 3GPP has introduced a novel low-power synchronization signal (LP-SS) which ensures that wake-up receiver (WUR) can determine the start timing of LP-WUS coded bits. This periodic reference signal is also applicable for signal measurement to detect channel quality. The measurement method current employs the ON-OFF characteristics of sequences to estimate signal power and noise power. Under fading channels, the measurement performance of LP-SS exhibits a limitation, which has nothing to do with the measurement methods. Meanwhile, timing offset in non-coherent detection receivers also affects measurement performance. In this paper we analyze the impacts of fading and timing offset on measurement performance and derive the theoretical results of measurement errors. Meanwhile we conduct simulation analysis to verify the deviation between theoretical values and practical results. It demonstrates that timing offset causes measurement range shift rather than overall expansion, and that increasing average samples provides additional gains. These findings establish theoretical foundations for enhancing the performance of measurement methodologies."

    "abstract": "When MEMS gyroscopes operate in scenarios where the applied specific force is constantly changing, like Satcom on the move(SOTM) and Electro-optical Pod, the gyroscope's G-sensitivity error will cause bias changes. If this bias change cannot be compensated for, it will lead to rapid attitude divergence. Therefore, G-sensitivity error should be calibrated before using the device. For the G-sensitivity error calibration problem of MEMS gyroscopes, a Calibration method of MIMU two-axis turntable considering G-sensitivity error is proposed. The G-sensitivity error model is added to the traditional gyroscope device model. Calibrate the gyroscope's constant bias and G sensitivity error using static data, and calibrate the gyroscope's scale error matrix and constant bias residual error using dynamic data. Corresponding simulation experiment, calibration experiment, and gravity reversal experiment are conducted separately. The experiment results show that the proposed calibration method is effective. The simulation experiment result shows that the proposed calibration method can separate the G-sensitivity error from the gyroscope device error. In the calibration experiment of this paper shows that the pure inertial navigation update reduces the eastern misalignment angle by 48.94%, the northward misalignment angle by 25.61%, and the upward misalignment angle by 81.54%. The results of gravity invert experiment shows that gyroscope x-axis bias standard deviation under specific force variation reduced by 54.60%, y-axis reduced by 13.44%, z-axis reduced by 34.51%."

In this work, a vehicle-borne experiment with collected triple-frequency observations from BDS-2 and BDS-3 satellites were utilized to evaluate the ambiguity resolution and positioning performance of single-epoch triple-frequency RTK positioning in urban environments. The results indicate that in complex urban environments, the extra-wide-lane ambiguity of certain satellites cannot be correctly resolved by the integer rounding methods.

    "abstract": "The ceramic valve core is widely used in industry due to its wear resistance, corrosion resistance, and hightemperature resistance. However, its high hardness and brittleness make it prone to damage and cracks during processing, affecting the product's appearance, safety, and service life. Therefore, accurate and efficient surface defect detection is crucial. Although existing detection methods have made some progress, there are still shortcomings in detection speed, computational resource consumption, and hyperparameter tuning. To address these issues, this paper proposes a surface defect detection method for ceramic valve cores based on a lightweight object detection network. The method employs MobileNetV3 to construct a multi-scale feature pyramid, incorporates an anchor-free region proposal network that generates candidate boxes by directly predicting object centers and offsets to achieve real-time defect detection. Additionally, a channel attention mechanism is used to improve classification accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that this method offers high detection accuracy and low computational resource consumption, making it suitable for defect detection tasks in industrial production. It effectively resolves the challenges of traditional methods in handling the diversity of defects and multiscale characteristics in complex production environments."

    "abstract": "For vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) safety communication in 3GPP New Radio (NR) Sidelink Mode 2, each vehicle must autonomously select periodic radio resource by using Sensing-based Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SB-SPS) algorithm. SB-SPS helps avoid packet collisions through determining whether a particular resource among potential candidates will be used by other vehicle’s transmission. In 3GPP Release 16, all packet transmission (Tx) periods below 100 ms were newly allowed to support more delay-critical safety applications. Unfortunately, an undesirable artifact of the current specification is that vehicles operating with different Tx periods can experience excessive and unfair successive collision event lengths. This may cause some vehicles to suffer longer average successive collision durations just by picking a \"wrong\" resource reservation period (RRP). To address this issue, we propose a revision to the current specification for fair resource occupancy time for all vehicles irrespective of RRPs. Through analysis and simulation, it is shown to resolve the unfair and inordinate collision episode lengths issue while scarcely sacrificing packet delivery performance compared to the current specification."

However, in mixed-autonomy traffic, the unpredictability of human-driven vehicles (HDVs) poses significant challenges for CAV control. Moreover, existing cooperative control methods often assume seamless real-time information sharing, leading to excessive communication demands that strain limited transmission resources. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight Digital Twin (DT) framework that models the traffic environment and surrounding vehicle behaviors to reduce uncertainty in CAV decision-making. The framework employs an attention-based multi-agent deep reinforcement learning method, enabling each CAV to dynamically adjust its communication frequency with neighboring vehicles according to the significance of their observations for its driving control decisions. Asynchronous updates in the DT space allow CAVs to expand their situational awareness, enabling lightweight coordination that mitigates HDV disturbances and fosters swarm intelligence. Simulations show our scheme improves traffic stability and achieves 30% faster high-speed flow than baselines, while maintaining strong performance under low bandwidth."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising anti-jamming solution in frequency-hopping (FH) communication systems, owing to its dynamic anti-jamming capability independent of FH patterns. Nevertheless, conventional RL-based methods may require extensive retraining when previously encountered jamming signals reappear after a long period because of the obliviousness of RL. To address this issue, this paper proposes a memory-driven anti-jamming approach for FH communications. Inspired by reinforced continual learning (RCL), the proposed approach employs an adaptive expansion mechanism of sub-deep neural networks to efficiently capture and retain jamming patterns. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can make more rapid anti-jamming decisions compared to conventional methods when encountering previously observed jamming patterns."

    "abstract": "We consider a distributed reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) enabled MIMO system with a transmitter and a receiver. In this work, we find the optimal precoding matrix at the transmitter and the optimal phase shifts at the multiple RISs, under a transmit power constraint. The problem under consideration is non-convex, and in the recent literature, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based methods have shown promising results in such scenarios. Our solution is particularly based on the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm of DRL. Our innovative Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation for the problem leads to better rate compared with the prevalent formulations. Our simulation results show that SAC can improve the rate considerably starting from a random value. For fair comparison, we consider deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and alternating optimization (AO) as benchmarks. Our contribution also includes a new way of handling each episode which leads to stable training."

    "abstract": "Performance optimization is a critical concern in modern game development. Common bottlenecks arise from the high computational demands of game processing, physics simulations, and object interactions, challenges often exacerbated by the limitations of sequential processing. To address these issues, Unity, one of the most widely adopted game engines, offers the Unity Jobs System and Burst Compiler, which enable data-oriented parallel execution of code for improved efficiency. This study investigates the application of these tools to parallelize and optimize sequential algorithms. We analyze key performance factors, including thread scalability, agent count, and batch size. The results demonstrate that tailored configurations can yield performance improvements of up to 15.06×, with the Burst Compiler being essential in all scenarios. It is worth noting that single-threaded job implementations can sometimes rival multithreaded performance, particularly in smaller workloads, highlighting the benefits of transitioning from the MonoBehaviour architecture to Unity’s Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS). As a contribution, this paper presents an in-depth evaluation of parallelization and optimization strategies within Unity’s Jobs System, with a focus on performance and scalability."

    "abstract": "Distance metric learning is a key field of machine learning, which aims at improving the performance of pattern classification and data discrimination by optimizing features to make samples of the same category closer in the feature space and samples of different classes farther apart. Most existing metric learning methods work in Euclidean space with zero curvature due to its simple and convenient characteristics. The latest studies show that non-zero curvature geometric spaces can better capture discriminative information. In this paper, to explore and form a more generalized feature space that is capable of matching complex data structure of samples, we look into metric learning problem in the mixed curvature space and present a new method called mixed-curvature metric learning (MCML). By simulating dimensionality reduction operations in different curvature spaces and conducting sample mining in mixed curvature space, our metric learning method is extended to feature spaces with a mixture of positive curvature, zero curvature, and negative curvature. Extensive experimental results show that our MCML approach achieves the superior performance in image retrieval task on multiples benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed MCML method."

    "abstract": "Prescribed performance (PP) control is widely used in the construction of consensus protocols for multiagent systems (MASs) due to its property of ensuring that the variables of interest are constrained within the prescribed range during the control process. However, when unpredictable faults such as sudden sensor faults occur, or parameters such as the sampling interval are selected improperly, it can cause singularity problems and render the PP protocol ineffective. Introducing shear mapping into the PP mechanism can resolve the singularity problems, but it requires solving complex nonlinear equations, which may heavily occupy agents’ computational resources. To address this issue, we propose a novel dynamic shear mapping mechanism, based on which an event-triggered PP consensus protocol is developed for a class of heterogeneous leaderless MASs. Specifically, by constructing a dynamic shear angle related to the constraint performance functions and variables of interest, the need to solve nonlinear equations is reduced, while the hard–soft transition of performance constraint in the control process is achieved. It is proven that, under the proposed protocol, the consensus errors can strictly satisfy the PP requirements during a prescribed stage, and ultimately converge to zero asymptotically. Finally, a simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

The presented approach utilizes axis-separated electrostatic excitation via quadrature electrodes and a coupled transfer function model, enabling accurate in-field identification. Experimental results from 12 MEMS gyroscope research devices demonstrate a high degree of accuracy, with a mean residual of only 0.011% and a one-sigma deviation of 0.034% in comparison to measurements on a high-precision rate table. This motionless method offers a significant advancement, paving the way for improved in-field calibration and enhanced non-orthogonality performance of MEMS gyroscopes. Additionally the method is used to calculate the non-orthogonality drift over bending stress. The results suggest the method’s utility for recalibrating non-orthogonality drift throughout the device’s operational lifetime."

To address this, we extend an existing smartphone-based early warning system to integrate short-term trajectory prediction and road geometry to enhance collision avoidance and enable timely alerts. The system was evaluated with simulations and field experiments. The results show a significant improvement in short-term trajectory prediction accuracy, reducing the mean spatial error by up to 40% compared to baseline methods, making it a reliable positioning system for complex urban roads."

By achieving delay-Doppler orthogonality in a twisted time-frequency domain, AFDM offers robust and efficient communication while enabling integrated sensing and communication through precise environmental parameter estimation. However, a major drawback of AFDM is its high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), which can cause power amplifier saturation and degrade system reliability. To address this issue, we propose an autoencoder-based PAPR reduction scheme leveraging convolutional neural networks, which effectively lowers the PAPR while maintaining satisfactory bit error rate (BER) performance. Simulation results under various modulation schemes and linear time-varying channels demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms conventional methods in both PAPR reduction and BER performance."

Integrating Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) with 5G offers a promising solution, but efficient cross-domain (wired-wireless) cooperative scheduling remains a challenge. To address this, we propose Wireless Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding (W-CQF), an innovative cooperative scheduling scheme that extends TSN’s CQF mechanism to 5G networks. By synchronizing scheduling cycles across domains, W-CQF enables end-to-end deterministic transmission. The approach consists of: (1) Offline static planning, which leverages Network Calculus to derive constraints for optimizing traffic injection times, balancing load, and maximizing schedulable Time-Sensitive (TS) flows; and (2) Online dynamic allocation, where the 5G base station (gNB) fulfills its service guarantees by reserving resources for TS flows while utilizing remaining capacity for Best-Effort (BE) traffic. Simulations show that W-CQF outperforms uncoordinated CQF (UC-CQF) and traditional Time-Aware Shaper (TAS)-based methods, significantly improving mixed-traffic handling, wireless resource efficiency, and end-to-end reliability while meeting strict latency requirements."

However, existing weld defect detection algorithms still suffer from low detection rates and inadequate performance in detecting small objects. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight detection algorithm based on an improved RT-DETR model. Two key improvements are made in feature extraction and feature fusion. On one hand, this paper designe feature extraction network HGNetv2-PfAAM, leveraging HGNetv2 multi-scale for feature aggregation and parameter-free average attention module (PfAAM) for deep feature extraction, thereby achieving efficient lightweight feature extraction. On the other hand, a lightweight feature fusion module termed RepC3-Ghost is constructed, which enhances the extraction capability of both deep and shallow features through Ghost Conv partial operations and concatenation. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, experiments were conducted on the LoHi-WELD industrial weld dataset. The results demonstrate that the model improved precision by 2.4%, mAP50 by 2.1%, reduces GFLOPS by 60.1% and the parameter count by 47% compared to the original model, indicating the distinct advantages of the proposed approach in detecting surface defects in industrial welds."

Specifically, the covariance tensor of the sparse polarimetric MIMO radar is transformed into that of a virtually uniform polarimetric MIMO radar, and spatial tensor partitioning is further introduced to increase the number of identifiable targets. The CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition is subsequently employed to estimate the joint spatial and polarimetric parameter in a unified framework.

    "abstract": "In cyber-physical systems such as digital twins and industrial IoT, maintaining timely and informative state updates is essential for reliable system operation and control. The Age of Information (AoI) has been widely used to quantify data freshness, yet it treats all updates equally without considering whether they reflect meaningful state changes. As a result, AoI may overstate freshness in systems where source dynamics evolve slowly or insignificantly. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel metric, State-Aware Age of Information (SA-AoI), which extends the classical AoI framework by incorporating state variation into freshness evaluation. SA-AoI selectively considers only those updates that capture actual state changes, and further penalizes updates based on the degree of difference between the source and received states. This enables a more accurate measure of both temporal freshness and semantic relevance. We model the state evolution using an N-state discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC), and analyze SA-AoI under a G/Geo/1 queuing model with a preemptive Last-Come-First-Served (LCFS) discipline. We derive a closed-form expression for the average SA-AoI and validate our analysis through Monte Carlo simulations. The results offer new perspectives for designing efficient, state-aware update strategies in wireless communication systems."

    "abstract": "Human digital twin (HDT) is an innovative concept that creates digital representations of humans to support human-centric services by enabling real-time data synchronization between the physical twin (PT) and the virtual twin (VT). This PT-VT synchronization process is inherently data-intensive, requiring efficient resource management, especially in resource-constrained environments. Semantic communication has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional data-driven methods. However, single-encoder models may struggle to meet the dynamic requirements of HDT applications, particularly when resources are limited. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a multi-encoder semantic communication model that dynamically allocates resources—such as bandwidth and computational frequency—on specific application demands. The framework is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and is solved using a genetic algorithm (GA) based approach. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model optimizes synchronization while effectively managing power consumption, outperforming traditional single-encoder models in terms of accuracy, latency, and resource efficiency. This dynamic multi-encoder approach offers a scalable and adaptable solution for future HDT applications."

Most navigation system rely on GNSS for estimation of position, velocity and time often in combination with Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) to increase performance, frequency and additionally provide attitude, heading, rotation rates and accelerations. This combination works very well as long as a valid GNSS signal is available. However, this is not the case when the GNSS signal is disturbed, such as in indoor environments. One solution to this problem are local positioning systems based on Ultra-Wideband (UWB). In recent years, UWB technology has experienced considerable growth. It is an established method for localization with a relatively high level of accuracy, reaching approximately 10 cm and better. UWB itself is only capable of computing position and (local) time information based on sequential time of flight measurements of high frequency signals. To compute the full set of motion states, UWB like GNSS can be combined with an INS. The combination of UWB and IMU measurements can achieve accuracies below 0.2 m, as already demonstrated [1] and [2] . Currently, most UWB/INS combinations are used in robotics based on position measurements. The use of such systems for indoor navigation, especially in non-robotic and high dynamic contexts, is still in its early stages and has not been extensively researched."

In LEO-enabled IoT scenarios, timely data delivery is essential for situational awareness and real-time decision-making. To measure the freshness of the data, Age of Information (AoI) has been widely adopted as a key performance metric, particularly in applications with frequent status updates. However, minimizing AoI in LEO systems is challenging due to limited onboard resources and dynamic traffic demands. This paper focuses on the joint optimization of beam hopping (BH) scheduling and resource block (RB) allocation to reduce the average AoI across the network. To handle the complex problem, we propose a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. At the high level, a centralized satellite agent leverages the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to determine the beam illumination pattern over the service area. At the low level, a decentralized multi-agent PPO framework is employed, where each beam-level agent independently allocates resource block (RB) to users, aiming to improve data freshness and transmission efficiency. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms three benchmark strategies in reducing average AoI."

Using our LEO satellite network simulator, we also design and implement a Multi-Frequency Time-Division Multiple Access (MF-TDMA) and contention hybrid MAC for data and control information delivery for satellite-ground and satellite-gateway. Our designed MAC can support network scanning, association, authentication, timing offset compensation, and resource scheduling, and is specially optimized to reduce the delay. Using our full-stack simulator, we evaluate the end-to-end throughput, delay, and packet loss performance combining with a time-slot shortest path routing, and this demonstrates that our designed simulator can provide fair full-stack performance evaluation for LEO network design."

    "abstract": "The increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) presents new challenges in optimizing energy consumption, charging efficiency, and travel time. Dynamic Wireless Charging Lanes (DWCLs) offer a promising solution by allowing EVs to charge while driving, reducing dependency on static charging stations and minimizing downtime. However, optimizing the decision-making process for when and at what speed a vehicle should enter and exit a DWCL while maintaining an efficient driving strategy remains a complex problem. This work proposes a Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based reinforcement learning (RL) approach to dynamically control lane-switching and speed adjustments in a multi-lane road environment. The RL agent is designed to balance energy efficiency, travel time minimization, and charging maximization, while also considering real-world constraints such as road topology, accurate energy consumption modeling, and vehicle alignment with charging coils. By leveraging CARLA as a high-fidelity simulation environment, we implement and train a policy that autonomously decides lane-switching, speed adaptation, and charging strategies. The proposed framework not only improves the charging efficiency of EVs but also ensures smooth lane transitions while maintaining energy-optimal driving behavior. Experimental results show that the RL agent effectively learns the optimal use of DWCL, minimizing unnecessary lane switches and ensuring a highly efficient, and real-time deployable EV management system."

    "abstract": "Multi-receiver connectivity via non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a popular candidate scheme for next generation multiple access (NGMA) as it facilitates resource block sharing (RBS) through power-domain layered stacking of various users’ signals. Dividing base station (BS) power among users’ signals precisely and activating candidate receivers properly for RBS are essential to efficiently utilize the available RBs for optimized communication speed. Data-driven based operation is a rising machine-learning framework which can be tailored to attack this resource management problem. In this paper, we propose a data-driven based algorithm to opportunistically grant receivers paired access and jointly calibrate their allotted portions of the total BS power available for NOMA-based downlink connectivity experiencing backhaul link capacity limitations. The proposed data-driven approach is combined with preemptive caching to store locally popular high-demand data in order to mitigate the throttling effects of the burdened backhaul. Resource management operation is designed by leveraging the ability of data-driven based operation to produce progressive linear approximations of complex models, with the objective of boosting the total attainable rate level. We present simulation-based results to validate the ability of the proposed technique to arrive at efficient solutions."

The latest research common to creates new out-of-distribution samples through invariant and variant data combinations to enhance the model’s generalization ability. However, these researches mainly focus on distinguishing the variant(non-critical) features from the invariant (critical) features in the new sample training while paying less attention to reinforcing the invariant features. This insufficient emphasis on invariant features can adversely affect the model’s accuracy in out-of-distribution scenarios. To this end, we proposes a graph invariant learning method both creating the out-of-distribution train environment and focusing on learning graph invariant features. Specifically, we use feature level and graph level patterns comixup strategy, which can simulate various complex mixed environments and capture invariant patterns from mixed graph data. In details, first, we obtain representations of variant subgraphs and invariant sub-graphs through a representation network, and then perturb the invariant subgraphs by mixing up the variant subgraphs in the representation space to simulate complex environments in reality. Afterward, we integrate invariant subgraphs and variable subgraphs at the graph level, and utilize the discrepancy in mutual information between the graph-level and representation-level to train the model, thereby encouraging the model to capture invariant patterns underlying the graphs. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly out-performs state-of-the-art under various distribution shifts."

Two CNN architectures, VGG16 and ResNet50, were employed to classify corn quality into three categories: good, medium, damaged. The corn image dataset was obtained from publicly available sources and preprocessed through resizing, normalization, and data augmentation. The experimental results show that the ResNet50 model outperformed VGG16 in terms of classification accuracy and stability, achieving an accuracy of 91,3% compared to 89.2% with VGG16. The proposed system demonstrates its capability to automate corn quality assessment effectively, offering improved accuracy, consistency, and processing efficiency compared to manual grading methods.

Analysis of survey responses from 161 developers using PLS-SEM reveals that performance factors, particularly work quality, serve as the primary drivers of perceived productivity. In contrast, quantitative activity measures show minimal effects, and job satisfaction demonstrates no meaningful influence. These results challenge conventional productivity metrics that emphasize activity volume, instead highlighting output quality as a critical indicator.

This research employs a qualitative method with a descriptive approach, using a systematic literature review as the primary technique for data collection and analysis. The findings indicate that implementing a carbon tax supported by a Core Tax Administration System (CTAS) based on blockchain technology can enhance transparency, taxpayer compliance, and administrative efficiency. The system simplifies tax reporting, enables real-time monitoring, and reinforces fiscal accountability in managing carbon-related revenues. The study concludes that integrating digital technology into carbon taxation is a strategic move toward achieving a low-carbon economy in Indonesia.

To mitigate task correlation deficiencies and solve negative transfer, this paper proposes a hierarchical FL framework with personalized edge aggregation for multi-task scenarios. Specifically, we first decentralize the model aggregation process to CAV edges, and divide the convolutional neural network (CNN) model into a shared feature extraction layer and personalized decision layer based on task types, maintaining model accuracy in collaborative training. Next, to eliminate negative transfer during aggregation, we propose a representation similarity-based personalized model aggregation weight allocation algorithm. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves model accuracy and convergence speed while reducing energy and time costs in multi-task IoV scenarios."

However, the performance of the MEC system is severely affected by wireless attenuation, which fundamentally limits the full potential of the MEC. To address this issue, a system is conceived wherein an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is equipped with MEC servers by fully exploiting the UAV’s high mobility. We develop a comprehensive optimization framework considering real-time dynamic arrival of user tasks. Based on Lyapunov optimization theory, the overall problem is firstly decomposed into sub-optimization problems for each time slot. Then, a high-quality sub-optimal solution is obtained by optimizing WDs’ local computation frequency, scheduling indicator, and UAV trajectory to minimize WDs’ energy consumption alternately under the constraints of the task queue and UAV energy queue stability. Subsequently, an algorithm for task offloading and real-time trajectory optimization is proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce energy consumption on the WD side while maintaining the stability of all queues."

Precedingly, the forerunner victims of counterfeit parts include the Defense Industrial Base as well as United States electronics suppliers who provide electronics parts to the Defense Industrial Base. Distinctively, although the United States Department of Defense is preemptively managing the risk of counterfeit parts through risk mitigation policies and procedures that generally advise contractors and subcontractors on how to detect and avoid counterfeit parts through process guidelines and utilization of probabilistic risk assessment, the specific causal factors or root causes of counterfeits are not always evident. As a result, contractors and subcontractors are inevitably driven towards a tactical implementation of United States Department of Defense policy instead of a strategic longer-term solution. This research praxis orchestrates a strategy that is a Root Cause Analysis-based model to identify data features that are viable for counterfeit predictive analytics. The proposed strategy includes traditional Root Cause Analysis steps to Collect Data, Decide How to Analyze Data, identify data features (causal factors) that are viable for predictive analytics as well as non-traditional steps such as building a predictive model, and a means to optimize the model. Furthermore, two examples of predictive analysis are demonstrated: logistic regression and Naïve Bayes whereby data features such as debt ratio, credit rating, defense relationship, DFARS compliance, and DOD Industrial Sector Membership are utilized to predict the probability that a company has fallen victim to counterfeiting [1], [7]–[12], [13]."

    "abstract": "IEEE 802.15.4 is the core of multiple industrial standards such as WirelessHART, ISA100.11a, and 6TiSCH. It provides ultra-low-power operation and high reliability for battery-powered devices requiring a 5-10 year lifetime. However, due to its narrow frequency bandwidth, it is rarely used as a wireless ranging technique. Its low resolution in the time domain makes it difficult to precisely determine the arrival time of the signal, which is essential for Time-of-Flight ranging. Emerging approaches, such as WiFi fingerprinting, show promising localization performance by using learning methods to find the pattern mapping between signal characteristics and positions.This paper explores the potential of using learning approaches over IEEE 802.15.4 radios for ranging, based on RSSI and Round Trip Timing (RTT) samples. As a preprocessing step, groups of RTT samples are fed into a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), extracting two sets of features: the mean, variance, and weight of two distributions (line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight). Together with the mean and variance of the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and RTT samples, 10 features are used as the input to a multilayer perceptron network to predict the distance between the requester and reflector.The approach has been evaluated using IEEE 802.15.4 devices in three different scenarios: an empty football field, an underground parking lot, and an office area. The results show that with dedicated models trained using datasets collected from each scenario, the ranging prediction errors of 0.25 meters, 0.42 meters, and 0.58 meters at 80% probability are achieved in these three scenarios, respectively. With a single model trained using a combined dataset from all three scenarios, prediction errors of 0.41 meters, 0.60 meters, and 0.97 meters at 80% probability are achieved."

Though the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay remains the clinical gold standard in endotoxin testing, its strong reliance on horseshoe crab blood has aroused growing ecological worries, especially with the continuous decline of their wild populations. At the same time, existing alternative detection techniques still face problems such as inadequate sensitivity, low reagent utilization efficiency, and high operational costs. To tackle these challenges, this study proposes an innovative fiber-optic biosensing approach for endotoxin detection, which combines a tapered microfiber Bragg grating (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mu$</tex> FBG) with a microfluidic capillary. This system achieves lipopolysaccharide (LPS) quantification by tracking refractive index fluctuations caused by the adsorption of unreacted LAL, allowing for label-free detection with a sensitivity of under <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$0.001 \\text{EU} / \\text{mL}$</tex>. Simultaneously, the combination with microfluidic technology cuts down LAL usage by 95%, with each test requiring no more than <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$5 \\mu \\mathrm{L}$</tex> of the reagent. A regeneration strategy relying on competitive binding enables repeated utilization of the sensor without any decline in performance. By synergistically resolving the conflict between the clinical need for high-performance endotoxin detection and the ecological protection of horseshoe crabs, this research provides a new technical solution for efficient, economical, and eco-friendly endotoxin monitoring. It holds significant potential for large-scale application in clinical diagnostics and pharmaceutical quality control for endotoxin detection."

The time-varying DRIS induces active channel aging (ACA), which results in imperfect channel state information (CSI) and undermines MIMO jamming-resistant communications. We model a MIMO uplink jamming-resistant communication system in the presence of a DRIS, and adopt the achievable rates obtained from the widely-used zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean-square error (MMSE) receiver filters to quantify the rate degradation induced by the DRIS.

Simulation results demonstrate that the policy effectively guides experiments towards informative measurements, concentrating the posterior around true parameter values. Compared to a genetic algorithm, the RL approach achieves superior performance, highlighting its potential for optimizing sequential experimental design in complex, resource-constrained scenarios."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of the industrial internet of things and automation control systems, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems have been widely adopted in industrial manufacturing due to their flexibility and scalability. The cloud-fog automation (CFA) paradigm is emerging to address higher real-time and computing demands in complex industrial environments. To fully leverage the efficiency, flexibility, and scalability of Kubernetes, an open-source container orchestration platform Kubernetes in managing containerized applications, this article investigates methods for deploying SCADA systems on the Kubernetes platform. This approach aims to capitalize on Kubernetes’ benefits, such as automated deployment, elastic scaling, and high availability, to optimize resource management and enhance system performance. To validate the proposed solution, we employs testing tools such as wrk and tc, along with monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana, to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of Kubernetes’ advantages in various scenarios. We focus on three key aspects: reliability, scalability, and security. The results demonstrate that Kubernetes can significantly improve the scalability, fault recovery capabilities, and stability of SCADA systems."

    "abstract": "Intelligent fault diagnosis is crucial for ensuring equipment reliability and preventing costly failures in industry production. Fault diagnosis relies on contact-based measurement techniques in most cases, which exhibit inherent limitations under some extreme conditions. Meanwhile, practical industrial applications increasingly demand systems with low power consumption and low computational complexity, alongside intelligent algorithms for cross-domain generalization. In this study, to overcome limitations associated with contact-based fault diagnosis methods, event-based cameras with dynamic vision are proposed to measure subtle vibrations and diagnose faults for rotating machinery. A hybrid method that integrates meta-learning for domain generalization and deep correlation alignment is proposed to enhance cross-domain diagnosis accuracy under previously unseen operational conditions. Representation and preprocessing methods are employed to augment the dynamic vision data and transform the sparse, binary event-based signals into spatiotemporal frames. The conversion enables the dynamic vision data to be processed by the second-order leaky integrated-and-fire model, supported by neuromorphic computing. That not only improves feature extraction performance but also leverages the inherent low power consumption and computational efficiency of neuromorphic computing systems. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method, confirming the promising performance in unknown working conditions and its potential for industrial applications."

However, malicious cyber threats, such as False Data Injection Attacks (FDIA) through Vehicle-To-Everything (V2X) communications, pose significant risks to these objectives. FDIA can manifest as deceptive obfuscation, either translational (T-OBF) – a vehicle falsely claims to be on a parallel road –, or random (R-OBF) – the vehicle reports a random position that differs from its actual position by a few meters. Our approach tackles incorrect position data by leveraging cooperation between trusted participants. These participants perform ML-based FDIA detection by exchanging Angle-Of-Arrival (AoA) measurements, and also for positioning in conjunction with an Extended Kalman Filter to reduce FDIA effects. FDIA detection achieves 89% accuracy for T-OBF and 72% for R-OBF, reducing localization errors below 10m in 77.74% and 81.84% of cases, respectively."

To address this, we propose the Decomposed Inertia Identification (DII) framework, which utilizes inertia transfer theory and the Recursive Parameter Null Space Algorithm (RPNA) to decompose base parameters into fixed-base and residual subsets. This approach reduces optimization complexity and enables symbolic parameter identification. Inspired by animal spinning behaviors, we use spinning trajectories to excite leg dynamics, overcoming high-DoFs challenges. The Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) optimizes parameters under physical consistency constraints. The method was validated on a Unitree Go1 quadruped robot, achieving 98.1% parameter convergence within 200 iterations during spinning locomotion (0.5–2 rad/s yaw velocity). Updating inertial parameters reduced tracking errors by 63% in body posture control and improved straight-line locomotion accuracy by 89% under payload variations on leg. The DII framework bridges fixed- and floating-base systems, enabling the application of mature fixed-base methodologies to floating-base robots and advancing self-model identification for real-world applications."

A spatiotemporal initialization model is established, which incorporates position vector constraints between GNSS and odometry as well as time-delay. The feedback correction strategy of indirect Kalman filtering is used to solve the estimation of large angle heading alignment, and the proposed method achieves joint estimation of initial attitude, horizontal lever arm, and time-delay. Simulation and field tests demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can rapidly and effectively achieve absolute transformation of relative odometry, with a heading alignment accuracy better than 0.2 degrees.

However, 5G’s higher frequencies reduce its range and lead to performance inconsistencies, especially for users on the move. Moreover, the energy consumption of 5G is significantly higher than its predecessor, 4G, raising sustainability concerns. In this paper, we explore a solution that combines the strengths of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) with the advanced analytics capabilities of the Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) in 5G networks. We leverage two new functions, Sensing Service Function (SSF) and Energy Efficiency Control Function (EECF), designed to work together to make smarter, more energy-efficient network decisions. By optimizing base station downlink transmit power, our approach not only reduces energy consumption but also carefully balances the trade-offs between latency and energy efficiency.

To enhance energy efficiency and quality-of-service guarantees, while ensuring real-time requirements, a hierarchical real-time scheduling model that integrates multi-level task-container-node allocation is proposed. To overcome computational bottlenecks of existing centralized solvers, a bilevel distributed optimization framework is designed: the upper level solves task-container allocation and container resource interface decisions through primal decomposition, while the lower level reformulates original problem into convex optimization to derive task computation ratios and CPU frequency, achieving optimal solutions through iterative coordination. Hardware-In-the-loop simulations, implemented using the Ray distributed computing framework validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "In wireless-powered cognitive radio networks, short-packet communication has emerged as a pivotal technology for supporting Internet of Things (IoT) services due to its low-latency characteristics. However, the traditional Shannon capacity theory fails to accurately characterize the finite blocklength transmission properties of short-packet communication. Moreover, the inherent uncertainties in spectrum contention between primary and secondary users, coupled with energy harvesting in coverage-limited scenarios, further complicate the optimization of Age of Information (AoI). To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamic scheduling method for AoI-sensitive short-packet communication. First, based on the finite blocklength transmission theory, we derive a closed-form expression for the successful transmission probability of cognitive users’ short-packet data under interference constraints, which quantifies the impact of energy harvesting efficiency and spectrum sensing accuracy on transmission reliability. Second, we formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem to minimize the system’s expected weighted AoI, jointly optimizing spectrum access, energy allocation, and short packet encoding parameters. To solve this problem, we design a Lyapunov optimization-based maximum weight scheduling strategy, which achieves real-time decision-making by dynamically balancing data queue backlog and AoI weight factors. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy significantly outperforms round-robin and random scheduling strategies, achieving performance closer to the theoretical lower bound. Furthermore, the impact of short-packet coding length and transmission power on the system’s weighted sum AoI is thoroughly investigated."

However, its widespread adoption remains limited due to the high cost and the invasive nature of current measurement techniques. Changes in blood glucose (BG) levels stimulate the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems, leading to variations in the electrocardiogram (ECG). Hence, we proposed an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven, noninvasive BG monitoring approach based on ECG signals, addressing the need for affordable and continuous glucose tracking. Firstly, we applied multi-attention-based feature extraction with channel and spatial aspects to highlight important features and suppress dispensable ones. Secondly, we proposed multi-hierarchical feature fusion to gain the inter-layer second-order feature and enhance their representation capability. Lastly, fuzzy integral was adopted to couple different BG estimation values for decision-level fusion. To verify the feasibility of our approach, we collected a total of 103 days of ECG data with concomitant BG values from 21 participants and conducted a 10-fold cross-validation. Evaluation results revealed that our approach demonstrated competitive performance compared with several existing models. The root-mean-square error was 26.57 mg/dL, and the mean absolute relative difference was 13.39%. In addition, the zone A + B of Clarke and Parkes error grid analysis were 98.50% and 99.41%, respectively. Therefore, these results support the technical feasibility of implementing AI-driven, ECG-based BG monitoring in consumer electronics."

At the transmitter side, two FPTs are inserted at different frequencies in two polarizations respectively. At the receiver side, the power spectra of the four FPTs polarization crosstalk-induced are combined for polarization-fading-free FOE. Then, the four FPTs are employed together to cancel the effect of polarization on the FPTs’ power, achieving accurate and polarization-fading-free CPE. This avoids the estimated phase being severely impaired by noise when using a single low-power FPT for CPE. Subsequently, the FPTs are employed to estimate the Jones matrix for polarization demultiplexing. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly reduces the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of phase estimation at an optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) of 25 dB thanks to canceling the impact of polarization fading on CPE. Due to the accurate CPE, the proposed scheme achieves a Q-factor improvement of 0.9 dB compared to existing schemes. Experimental results further confirm that the proposed scheme reduces a 0.7 dB penalty in received optical power (ROP). The proposed cascaded carrier phase and polarization tracking scheme provides an efficient technical solution for robust carrier phase estimation and polarization tracking in future high-speed, high-order modulation optical communication systems."

    "abstract": "Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) in remote sensing image (RSI) relies solely on image-level labels, thereby significantly reducing the cost of instance-level annotations. Recently, pseudo-fully supervised object detection (PFSOD) models trained with image-level labels have achieved superior performance compared to traditional WSOD models. However, two major challenges remain. Firstly, the pseudo ground truth (PGT) used in existing PFSOD models often suffers from low localization accuracy, resulting in suboptimal detection results. Secondly, existing PFSOD models tend to miss detections when multiple objects of the same category exist within an RSI. To address these issues, we propose a novel PFSOD framework incorporating two key innovations. To handle the first challenge, a weakly supervised object detection guided segment anything model (WSOD-SAM) is introduced to generate object proposals instead of traditional selective search algorithms based on low-level features. The WSOD-SAM proposals can combine the detection capability of the WSOD model with the segmentation capability of SAM, therefore, the baseline WSOD model equipped with them can produce more accurate PGTs. To handle the second challenge, we design a heuristic pseudo-fully supervised training (HPFST) strategy, which dynamically mines potential objects with high class confidence scores as pseudo soft labels for the classification branch of the YOLO model, in addition to using the PGT. Ablation studies confirm the individual and combined effectiveness of WSOD-SAM proposals and HPFST strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves 78.12% and 31.44% mAP on the NWPU VHR-10.v2 and DIOR datasets, respectively, outperforming 16 existing WSOD methods.

    "abstract": "This work studies a magneto-optical surface plasmon resonance (MOSPR) sensor design that uses the photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) concept, including cerium-substituted yttrium iron garnet (CeYIG) and graphene to allow for very sensitive detection of magnetic fields at 632.8 nm. When subjected to a magnetic field, the CeYIG layer exhibits anisotropic optical behavior, explained by a permittivity tensor with nonzero off-diagonal components, thereby inducing magneto-optical (MO) activity. The magnetization is oriented along the z-axis, normal to the sensor surface. Notably, the proposed design achieves an extraordinary transverse spin-dependent shift (SDS) of approximately 237.93 μm with the external orbital angular momentum (EOAM) based centroid shift of 0.508 μm at resonance angle. This enhancement has enabled the MOSPR sensor to use as an ultra-sensitive PSHE-based magnetometer, with a maximal sensitivity of 11258.36 μm/RIU at a refractive index (RI) of 1.1 for detecting minute RI variations in the sensing medium. The proposed MOSPR sensor, performance enhanced by the integration of CeYIG and graphene with PSHE, demonstrates the importance of this sensor for next-generation MO sensing devices."

    "abstract": "In the field of human centric multimedia, text-driven human motion generation is a significant pursuit with wide-ranging applications across diverse scenarios. Despite substantial advancements, existing methods often suffer from a trade-off between inference latency and high-quality generation. To overcome this gap, we propose the Motion Latent Flow Matching model (MotionFlow), a novel and powerful framework for motion generation. It introduces flow matching algorithm in the latent space, which can achieve superior performance with just one-step inference. In addition to the text-driven task, we further extend our method to controllable motion generation. Specifically, we integrate a control encoder into the latent space and further decode the predicted latent code into motion space to support explicit supervision, ensuring the synthesized motion can tightly align with the input signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MotionFlow not only outperforms current leading approaches for the text-driven task, but also delivers remarkable capabilities in controllable motion generation."

    "abstract": "Multiple object tracking in satellite videos (SVMOT) is a challenging task due to the extremely small and dim target characteristics. Current learning-based tracking methods typically operate as open-loop systems, lacking feedback from tracking outputs, which makes it difficult to recover objects missed by the detector. In this paper, we demonstrate that target trajectories are crucial for target initialization, state updates, and recovery. Based on this insight, we propose a Transformer-based SVMOT method called Trajectory-Centric Transformer (TCT). The TCT comprises three trajectory oriented modules: a trajectory-prior incorporated detector, a 3D Trajectory-Deformable Transformer (TDT) encoder, and a Trajectory-Association Transformer (TAT) decoder. To recover missed targets caused by an unstable detector, we first incorporate historical information into the Sparse-UNet detector by combining target trajectories and segmented foreground as point clouds. Next, we introduce multiple trajectory hypotheses by associating targets with predicted tracking boxes and current-frame detection boxes. Unlike traditional trajectory-box association methods, we perform trajectory-level association using the Trajectory-Association Transformer. The 3D TDT encoder extracts the spatio-temporal target representation from a input video clip, and then the TAT decoder decodes the relationships among all hypotheses to update the true target state. Extensive experiments on the satellite MOT benchmark VISO demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."

Heuristic evaluation (HE) and cognitive walkthrough (CW) are employed to analyze the usability of mainstream diabetes self-management applications, identifying problems in elderly users' usage processes and self-efficacy acquisition. Semi-structured interviews are conducted with 30 diabetic patients aged over 60 years, and a diabetes management app-specific self-efficacy scale is designed for quantitative evaluation. User requirements are analyzed through the KJ method and user journey mapping. A closed-loop system of \"behavioral trigger—efficacy feedback—behavioral adjustment\" and corresponding design strategies are proposed. A self-management program meeting elderly users' needs is designed accordingly. The assessment using the diabetes management app-specific self-efficacy scale demonstrates that the program achieves an average score of 31.56, which is significantly higher than the control application (F=52.41, p<0.001, partial η²=0.76). The evaluation using the System Usability Scale (SUS) shows that the program obtains a score of 80.14, significantly exceeding the control application (F=21.61, p<0.001, partial η²=0.56). The design strategies effectively improve elderly diabetic patients' digital health management experience and self-efficacy."

    "abstract": "Existing lane-keeping strategies either rely on precise system models to pursue optimal performance, or handle uncertainties at the expense of performance guarantees. Few methods successfully reconcile robustness with optimality, which is impractical for real-world implementation. To overcome these limitations, this paper develops a completely model-free H<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">∞</sup> control method based on reinforcement learning and adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) theory that operates without prior knowledge of system matrices. The proposed approach employs an online policy iteration algorithm to solve optimal control pairs while considering vehicle dynamics in both yaw and roll planes through a 4-degree-of-freedom (DoF) model incorporating lateral offset, heading error, and roll angle. A load transfer ratio (LTR) evaluates vehicle roll stability, and a generalized H<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">∞</sup> disturbance attenuation criterion is established using Kronecker products for online parameter learning. Simulation validation using CarSim-Simulink platform with a high-fidelity SUV model demonstrates that the algorithm achieves rapid convergence of lane keeping errors and roll angle to zero within 10 policy iterations. Compared to traditional sliding mode control, the proposed method exhibits superior trajectory tracking accuracy and faster response under challenging conditions including road slip, rollover prevention, and actuator saturation. The results provide a practical optimal control solution for autonomous vehicle lane keeping without requiring precise model information, significantly enhancing safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) that extracts data knowledge while protecting the privacy of multiple clients has achieved remarkable results in distributed privacy-preserving IoT systems, including smart traffic flow monitoring, smart grid load balancing, and so on. Since most data collected from edge devices are unlabeled, unsupervised Federated Clustering (FC) is becoming increasingly popular for exploring pattern knowledge from complex distributed data. However, due to the lack of label guidance, the common Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) issue of clients have greatly challenged FC by posing the following problems: How to fuse pattern knowledge (i.e., cluster distribution) from Non-IID clients; How are the cluster distributions among clients related; and How does this relationship connect with the global knowledge fusion? In this paper, a more tricky but overlooked phenomenon in Non-IID is revealed, which bottlenecks the clustering performance of the existing FC approaches. That is, different clients could fragment a cluster, and accordingly, a more generalized Non-IID concept, i.e., Non-ICD (Non-Independent Completely Distributed), is derived. To tackle the above FC challenges, a new framework named GOLD (Global Oriented Local Distribution Learning) is proposed. GOLD first finely explores the potential incomplete local cluster distributions of clients, then uploads the distribution summarization to the server for global fusion, and finally performs local cluster enhancement under the guidance of the global distribution. Extensive experiments, including significance tests, ablation studies, scalability evaluations, qualitative results, etc., have been conducted to show the superiority of GOLD."

    "abstract": "In the field of Disorders of Consciousness (DoC), traditional diagnostic methods often struggle with high misdiagnosis rates and lack the sensitivity needed to discern subtle emotional responses, necessitating more accurate and comprehensive assessment tools. Current emotion recognition techniques, primarily using single-modality data such as electroencephalography (EEG) or facial expressions, fail to capture the complex interplay of emotional states in patients with DoC, leading to incomplete assessments. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel multimodal fusion framework that integrates heterogeneous EEG and micro-expression data through an innovative spatio-temporal attention mechanism. This approach significantly enhances the detection and classification of emotional states by leveraging differential entropy features from EEG and temporal features from micro-expressions, fused using deep learning techniques. The proposed method not only achieves mainstream models in terms of accuracy but also demonstrates potential for broad application in medical diagnostics, providing a basis for more personalized patient care and opening avenues for future research in clinical practice settings. We found that two patients had significantly better indicators than the others, indicating better brain activity levels and outcomes in these two patients, which is also consistent with the clinical results one month after the experiment. By effectively merging data from multiple sources, our study sets a new benchmark for emotion recognition in DoC, contributing to more accurate clinical assessments and enhancing the quality of life for affected patients."

Reliability analysis based on packet loss rate (PLR) establishes essential theoretical foundations for system evaluation. However, assessing the PLR in GF uplink IIoT networks for multiple HRLLC services in dynamic interference environments remains a critical challenge. This paper proposes a unified framework for evaluating the PLR, which first employs an interference-aware optimal clustering algorithm to systematically identify all possible interference patterns affecting a terminal. For each identified interference pattern, the PLR is analyzed independently. Therefore, a comprehensive PLR of each service is obtained by combining these individual PLR values through probability-weighted summation. It differs from most studies that rely on interference-averaging methods. The numerical results indicate that the proposed evaluation method enhances PLR accuracy by 10 dB compared to the benchmark."

Multiagent control has evolved significantly, with recent advances focusing on rigorous convergence analysis and diverse dynamical models. While the design of multiagent control with performance guarantee has also been developed, it generally assumes perfect knowledge of cost functions, which is often unrealistic due to the intrinsic difficulty of translating the designer’s goal into the signals related to instantaneous costs in some complex tasks, and uncertainties from disturbances, model inaccuracies, or adversarial interactions. This paper addresses optimal cooperative control for multiagent systems with uncertain cost functions. We propose a novel distributed policy gradient method that incorporates a scenario-based approach to handle uncertainties by sampling and integrating a practical distributed estimation algorithm to reduce computational load. Our algorithm ensures convergence while minimizing the global cost function using only local information exchange. The proposed approach bridges the gap between theoretical multiagent control and practical applications."

    "abstract": "Wireless sensing based on cellular signals has attracted widespread attentions. To achieve two-dimensional (2D) gesture recognition, current researches primarily employ a single-transmitter-multiple-receiver configuration, which however increases the deployment costs and collaboration difficulties among multiple receiving equipments. In fact, cellular signals across various frequency bands and from different operators are filled in the air. If signals from multiple base stations (BSs) can be utilized, there is an opportunity to achieve 2D gesture recognition using only a single receiver, and this will greatly ease the requirement for actual deployment. In this paper, we study a wireless gesture recognition method based on multi-cell cellular signals. First, we discuss how to acquire clean channel state information (CSI) in various multi-cell signal scenarios. Then, without prior knowledge, we propose a scheme to determine whether the BSs of different cells are co-located. For co-located BSs, we combine the CSIs from different bands to enhance the hand reflection path. For non-co-located BSs, the gesture trajectory can be recovered based on Doppler frequency shift information estimated from each transmitter-receiver pair. Finally, we build a prototype system to receive commercial LTE and NR signals, and demonstrate that even a single receiver can achieve excellent gesture recognition performance."

    "abstract": "Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL) detection has emerged as a promising nondestructive testing method for identifying defects in ferromagnetic materials, such as the steel cables used in cable-stayed bridges. Focusing on these critical load-bearing components—which are prone to corrosion, cracks, and localized damage under harsh environmental and operational conditions—this study leverages MFL-based point cloud data to enhance defect detection accuracy and reliability. A specialized MFL sensor array was deployed to collect high-resolution three-dimensional leakage magnetic field data, generating dense point clouds that capture the spatial variations in magnetic flux induced by surface and subsurface anomalies. To isolate defect-related signals from background interference, advanced point cloud processing algorithms were developed, encompassing noise filtering, feature extraction, and geometric reconstruction. Crucially, the surface area of the reconstructed 3D point clouds serves as a quantitative metric for defect detection. Furthermore, the local metal loss area of the steel cable can be derived from the cross-sectional surface area of these 3D point clouds. The results demonstrate that integrating point cloud data with automated defect characterization provides a robust framework for the structural health monitoring of stay cables, enabling early intervention and prolonging service life. This work contributes significantly to advancing intelligent inspection technologies for critical steel cable infrastructure."

First, a contrast adaptive modulation branch, guided by CLAHE and Sobel operators, dynamically refines attention logits to emphasize reflection-dense and structurally salient regions. Additionally, a physically guided slot regularization stabilizes slot updates and enhances discriminability under incomplete photon inputs.

Although existing studies compare OPC UA to other IoT protocols, they often focus on larger boards or high-level development frameworks, leaving a performance gap for smaller devices with limited resources. In this paper, we benchmark version 1.4 of the open62541 OPC UA Client/Server stack on microcontroller-based systems (ESP32, STM32H747) as well as a more powerful edge platform (RevPi Connect 4). We measure round-trip times under varying client counts and polling rates, assessing near real-time capabilities comparable to traditional PLCs. Our results show that the ESP32 and STM32 can support moderate polling loads and a small number of parallel clients, with average latencies generally under 10 ms. For higher client loads and stricter real-time demands, the RevPi platform sustains sub-ms average latencies for up to 100 parallel clients. These findings inform hardware selection and guide industrial practitioners in deploying embedded OPC UA Client/Server solutions for simple sensor-monitoring tasks or more complex edge applications. We discuss implications and limitations of this approach. Finally, future directions in subscription-based communication and implementing standardized data models on resource-constrained devices are discussed."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology, connected vehicles are now capable of acquiring high-precision environmental perception and positioning information. Accurate prediction of a vehicle’s future trajectory within the network is fundamental for enabling key functions such as autonomous path planning, proactive safety control, and driver behavior modeling. This paper addresses the problem of vehicle trajectory prediction in a V2X environment by proposing an improved Long Short-Term Memory network method based on an attention mechanism, named Attention Stack-LSTM (AS-LSTM). The proposed method integrates multi-modal perception data collected by the vehicle itself, including Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), Global Positioning System (GPS), multi-line LiDAR, and onboard cameras. Initially, time-series features are extracted from each modality and concatenated. Then, an attention mechanism is introduced to model the dynamic temporal dependencies within the sequence, thereby enhancing the model’s ability to focus on critical time steps and important modality information, ultimately improving prediction accuracy. To validate the effectiveness of the AS-LSTM method, experiments were conducted using the publicly available NCLT dataset. The evaluation was performed under two scenarios: one excluding image features and one including them. In the small-scale NCLT subset without image features, the AS-LSTM method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) in the range of [5×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−8</sup>, 7×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−8</sup>] and a coefficient of determination (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>) between [-0.780, -0.281], demonstrating stable performance. After incorporating image features, the model’s performance improved further, with MSE reduced to the range of [5×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−8</sup>, 6×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−8</sup>] and R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> improved to the range of [-0.701, -0.148]. In addition, the AS-LSTM method consistently outperformed traditional LSTM, Attention LSTM, and Seq2Seq LSTM models across different learning rate settings, exhibiting superior robustness and generalization ability. In summary, the proposed AS-LSTM method effectively fuses multi-modal perceptual data from the vehicle and leverages attention mechanisms to enhance the modeling of temporal dynamics. It offers a viable solution for high-precision trajectory prediction in V2X environments and can be applied to key modules in autonomous vehicles, such as path planning, motion control, and driving behavior prediction."

This can lead to ETSI generation rules potentially being invoked more frequently for inaccurately sensed objects, unnecessarily consuming network resources. Furthermore, inaccurate sensor data is more likely to be matched to the incorrect object track, yielding information that can mislead decision-making. The CAR-2-CAR Communication Consortium (C2C-CC) has proposed an object quality pre-filter to remove poor-quality measurements before triggering the collective perception generation rules, but its complexity has hindered deployment. At the request of ETSI and to hasten deployment, this paper explores the feasibility of proposing a ’simple’ pre-filter that will attempt to discard measurements that would be falsely associated based on a position error measure-based threshold. We find that implementing such a filter is complex and highly dependent on the environmental topology, road user type, geo-spatial density and temporal factors. Specifically, we investigate false associations under different sensor error ranges for diverse road users across 4 urban intersections, detailing their causation. We discuss the challenges in setting a distance measure-based threshold and evaluate its implications as a pre-filter to reduce the number of false and weakly associated objects in a CPM."

    "abstract": "Pinhole markings, such as pin 1 markers, mold indents, and ejector-pin recesses, are formed during plastic encapsulation and remain one of the few features that counterfeiters cannot easily erase without leaving tell-tale surface artifacts. Yet most optical-inspection pipelines ignore these tiny cavities, concentrating instead on package text or die imagery. This paper places pinholes at the center of a non-destructive counterfeit IC screening workflow. We manually annotate highresolution images of IC packages to capture four visually distinct cavity conditions: normal, coating droop, splatter marks, and complete coverage. The resulting dataset fine-tunes modern onestage You Only Look Once (YOLOv12) and Real-Time Detection Transformer (RT-DETRv1) detectors to deliver real-time localization and classification of suspect pinholes. By focusing on an intrinsic, fabrication-locked feature, the proposed approach provides an early, low-cost gate that flags questionable devices before resorting to time-consuming X-ray, Scanning Acoustic Microscopy (SAM), or decapsulation tests, thereby strengthening supply-chain assurance with minimal added burden."

    "abstract": "Accurate global digital elevation models (GDEMs) are essential for various geoscience applications. However, the accuracy of GDEMs in vegetated mountainous regions is relatively low due to substantial topographic relief and the penetration limitations of data acquisition techniques. The Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) acquires high-precision and high-density elevation measurements along its ground tracks on a global scale, offering reliable reference data for GDEM corrections. However, previous GDEM corrections using ICESat-2 altimetry data primarily focused on pixel-by-pixel vertical elevation corrections, often neglecting inter-pixel neighboring structure information, which is crucial for terrain modeling and analysis, particularly in areas with high relief. Therefore, this study incorporates not only ICESat-2 precise elevation observations and but also its along-track neighboring structure knowledge into a convolutional neural network-transformer hybrid model, termed NSCT, to correct GDEMs in global scale. The 1 arc-second Copernicus DEM was selected as the target DEM for correction due to its demonstrated superior accuracy. The proposed NSCT model, trained on a diverse range of globally distributed areas with varying topography and vegetation, was evaluated using ICESat-2, global control points, and high-resolution DEMs. Its performance was compared against eight currently most used DEM correction models and publicly available corrected GDEM products, including FABDEM, FathomDEM, and GEDTM30. Correction results demonstrated that the NSCT model generally improved Copernicus DEM accuracy by 66.34%, and outperformed existing correction models in both vertical elevation and neighboring structure assessment across diverse topographic and vegetation conditions. Furthermore, validation using ICESat-2 data and high-resolution DEMs outside the training area, as well with its application to SRTM and AW3D30 GDEM, demonstrated that the NSCT model exhibited superior transferability capability and consistently outstanding performance. This study is the first to integrate the precise elevation observations of ICESat-2 with along-track neighboring structure knowledge into GDEM corrections, offering valuable insights for future research in terrain modeling and analysis. The relevant code and test data are publicly available at: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.29380553."

    "abstract": "Although the lightweight Vision Transformer has significantly advanced image super-resolution (SR), it faces the inherent challenge of a limited receptive field due to the window-based self-attention modeling. The quadratic computational complexity relative to window size restricts its ability to use a large window size for expanding the receptive field while maintaining low computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose PromptSR, a novel prompt-empowered lightweight image SR method. The core component is the proposed cascade prompting block (CPB), which enhances global information access and local refinement via three cascaded prompting layers: a global anchor prompting layer (GAPL) and two local prompting layers (LPLs). The GAPL leverages downscaled features as anchors to construct low-dimensional anchor prompts (APs) through cross-scale attention, significantly reducing computational costs. These APs, with enhanced global perception, are then used to provide global prompts, efficiently facilitating long-range token connections. The two LPLs subsequently combine category-based self-attention and window-based self-attention to refine the representation in a coarse-to-fine manner. They leverage attention maps from the GAPL as additional global prompts, enabling them to perceive features globally at different granularities for adaptive local refinement. In this way, the proposed CPB effectively combines global priors and local details, significantly enlarging the receptive field while maintaining the low computational costs of our PromptSR. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method, which outperforms state-of-the-art lightweight SR methods in quantitative, qualitative, and complexity evaluations.

    "abstract": "This article proposes a novel distributed neuro-adaptive 3-D formation tracking control framework of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (multi-AUVs) subject to marine environmental disturbances. On the one hand, we assume that all AUVs can obtain the real-time states. By introducing a series of variable transformations, the multi-AUV system is transformed into an underactuated nonlinear system with virtual control input. Radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs), whose weights are updated online, are utilized to approximate nonlinear functions. Considering environmental disturbances, a virtual controller is designed such that all AUVs track the leader while maintaining the desired formation geometry. Then, the actual controller is given as an adaptive form according to the virtual control signals. On the other hand, we assume that all AUVs can only obtain the sampling states of themselves and their neighbors under the predefined event-triggered conditions. Multi-AUV system is transformed into a second-order system with complex nonlinear dynamics, then their states are reconstructed via a neuro-adaptive state observer using sampling states, and a virtual controller is proposed such that all AUVs track the leader while maintaining the desired formation geometry under local communication with no Zeno behavior. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control design."

    "abstract": "Motion capture (MOCAP)-free music for performance generation using deep generative models is emerging as a promising solution for the next-generation animation industry. This technology allows users to create dynamic musical performance animations without relying on MOCAP. However, implementing MOCAP-free content-to-performance generation systems presents significant challenges. First, integrating various standalone models into a cohesive system is essential, as each model governs distinct aspects of the avatar's behavior. For example, a facial expression generation module influences the avatar's facial expressions, whereas a fingering generation module determines hand positions. Second, most applications focus on humanonly performance generation, such as virtual vocalists and virtual dancers, without considering interactions with other objects, such as instruments, referred to as human-instrument performance generation. To our knowledge, comprehensive human-instrument content-to-performance generation systems are still rare. In this paper, we present a complete content-to-performance generation system, demonstrating its capabilities through a web application that enables users to create animations from their music content. This system incorporates four modules to generate parameters for controlling avatars: 1) a facial expression module, 2) a fingering generation module, 3) a body movement generation module, and 4) a video shot generation module. Additionally, we integrate an expressive music synthesis module to generate expressive audio from symbolic music data. Quantitative evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the four modules, whereas a user study provides qualitative insights into the system's performance.

    "abstract": "Given the challenge of balancing high fidelity with perceptual quality, multi-realism image compression is developed to adapt flexibly to varying requirements. It allows images with different levels of realism to be decoded from the same bit stream. Diffusion models are known for generating images with high perceptual quality. However, their inherent process of adding noise and denoising is often difficult to control and will bring more distortion. This limits their direct application in image compression, especially in multi-realism image compression which requires precise control to adapt to different requirements. To address this issue, we propose a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Consistency Guided Diffusion Model</i> as a post-processing network for multi-realism image compression, aiming to control the addition of detail representations, thereby adjusting the trade-off between subjective quality and fidelity. In detail, our proposed novel method is crafted to introduce an additional consistency guided feature branch into the diffusion model to constrain the deviation caused by randomness in the diffusion process to ensure fidelity. Furthermore, a syntax-driven feature fusion module is constructed to guide the information adaptive fusion of two branches with an input extra ultra-low stream, which contains the context information and trade-off control information. In addition, we design a warm-up based training strategy and adopt a continuous online optimization method to improve coding efficiency and trade-off control precision. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our method over existing compression techniques, as well as the effectiveness of each component."

Networks of drones, electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) vehicles, and other aircraft, termed Low-Altitude Economic Networks (LAENets), promise to transform urban logistics, aerial sensing, and communication. A key challenge is how to efficiently share and trust the computing utility, termed “computility”, of these aerial devices. We propose treating the computing power on aircraft as tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) that can be traded and orchestrated via blockchain. By representing distributed edge computing resources as blockchain tokens, disparate devices can form Low-Altitude Computility Networks (LACNets), collaborative computing clusters in the sky. We first compare blockchain technologies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and RWA frameworks to clarify how physical hardware and its computational output can be tokenized as assets. Then, we present an architecture using blockchain to integrate aircraft fleets into a secure, interoperable computing network. Furthermore, a case study models an urban logistics LACNet of delivery drones and air-taxis. Simulation results indicate improvements in task latency, trust assurance, and resource efficiency when leveraging RWA-based coordination. Finally, we discuss future research directions, including AI-driven orchestration, edge AI offloading and collaborative computing, and cross-jurisdictional policy for tokenized assets."

As a type of circular constellation, the spiral constellation can be straightforwardly constructed using a spiral expression. The proposed spiral constellation is optimized with full consideration of the entire operating range of the light-emitting diode. It achieves superior noise resilience due to its larger average minimum Euclidean distance and exhibits enhanced robustness against nonlinearity by virtue of its lower peak-to-average power ratio. Moreover, we propose a bit-to-symbol mapping algorithm to approximate the Gray coding gain, accounting for the non-uniform Euclidean distances between adjacent constellation points. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed constellation. Experimental results demonstrate that the available ranges of the driving peak-to-peak voltage and bias current are significantly extended, which clearly validates the superiority of the proposed scheme."

While current methods often focus on hard samples to learn discriminative features, these hard samples are more prone to label noise, which can negatively impact model performance. To address this issue, we propose an information-complementary hybrid contrastive learning framework that consists of two branches for extracting richer semantic information. Specifically, the first branch performs cluster-level contrastive learning to capture general semantic patterns, while the second branch employs relation-guided instance-level contrastive learning, which leverages local structures to mine hard samples for more discriminative representations. To mitigate label noise during hard sample mining, we introduce a temporal-guided dynamic weighting module that uses temporal clustering results to evaluate the reliability of the mined hard samples. This module generates instance-level weights to reduce the impact of unreliable samples, ensuring more stable training. Extensive experiments on four popular benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches."

In such environments, accurate torque prediction is essential for effective engine management and optimal task execution. This work addresses the torque prediction challenge for a wheel loader operating in quarry conditions by proposing a structured three-phase approach to feature selection that reduces model complexity while preserving predictive accuracy. In the first phase, features are selected based on domain expertise to capture the physical and operational realities of quarry machinery. A comprehensive set of features is then employed to establish a robust performance baseline. In the final phase, a data-driven analysis using SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) identifies the top five features that most significantly impact torque prediction. Model efficacy was validated via cross-validation, with R-squared and mean-squared error serving as the key performance indicators. Comparative analysis reveals that while SHAP-ranked features yield statistically optimal results, the expert-selected features are more aligned with the practical requirements of quarry operations. These findings support the design of efficient, interpretable digital twins for real-time decisions in challenging environments."

However, as the number of satellites in LEO networks increases, making the network denser and more dynamic, a scalable routing algorithm is required to efficiently find paths. Many existing routing algorithms are primarily designed for small-scale networks or terrestrial IP networks and may not be suitable for large-scale LEO networks. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient routing algorithm that leverages the grid-like topology by clustering satellites into sub-mesh groups and selecting major routing directions. To accommodate the continuously changing and dynamic topology, we introduce an update period determination method based on a devised correlation metric. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm efficiently discovers near-optimal paths in LEO networks designed with various distance-based cost metrics while significantly reducing computational overhead."

    "abstract": "Providing far-field unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) motion parameter estimation for countermeasure systems in protected areas is an important way to ensure low-altitude security. When a UAV intrudes from the far field, the localization model based on time difference of arrival (TDOA) is difficult to obtain the accurate motion parameters of the UAV due to the thresholding effect. To address this problem, this paper proposes a two-step direction of arrival assisted motion parameter estimation (DOA-AMPE) method, which utilizes DOA to guide the moving sensor nodes (MSN) for rapid deployment and thus achieve accurate estimation of far-field intrusion UAV motion parameters. In the first step, we adopt the null-space projection (NSP) algorithm to project the DOA of the intruder UAV to the zero subspace of the inverse-range for estimation. In the second step, the DOA estimation of the intruder UAV is utilized to assist the deployment of the MSN to overcome the thresholding effect due to the far-field conditions, and then the motion parameter substitution semidefinite relaxation (MPS-SDR) is employed to solve the constrained weighted least squares (CWLS) problem constructed based on the equations of motion. The simulation results show that the DOA-AMPE has a localization accuracy of close to the Cramer Rao Lower bound (CRLB)."

The VoI of perceptual information is first defined from the perspective of the receiving CAV, by analyzing the spatiotemporal correlation between perceived objects and the receiver’s driving context. Guided by this, each CAV performs a three-stage process to generate CPMs in order to enhance information exchange efficiency, thereby improving Cooperative Perception (CP) performance.

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) has become essential for tasks like detection and classification in autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, ML models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can weaken passenger trust and raise safety concerns in autonomous driving systems. This is especially critical in systems like traffic sign recognition (TSR), where a misclassification caused by an adversarial attack could lead to serious safety risks. This research work explored the vulnerabilities of TSR models to adversarial attacks focusing on projected gradient descent (PGD) and the fast gradient sign method (FGSM). An adversarial attack pipeline is proposed that leverages ScoreCAM-based region-of-interest (ROI) localization to enhance the effectiveness of these attacks. Adversarial attacks manipulate the input data to mislead the models, achieving a high attack success rate (ASR) by exploiting their vulnerabilities. Experimental results on multiple models such as VGG19, convolutional neural network (CNN), ResNet50 and vision transformers (ViT) demonstrate significant increases in ASR. For instance, our method achieved a 97.67% ASR using PGD on VGG19 and a 95.89% ASR using FGSM on the same model, marking a considerable performance gain over traditional approaches. Moreover, these results are achieved with high computational efficiency, with average query times as low as 69.8 milliseconds."

    "abstract": "In the domain of anti-money laundering (AML), obtaining sufficient labelled datasets to train anomaly detection models remains a significant challenge due to the sensitive nature of financial transactions. This study proposes a novel framework for synthetic anomaly graph data generation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). The method encodes various graph topologies such as fan-in, fan-out, bipartite, feedforward, cycle, and scatter-gather into adjacency matrices to simulate complex transactional behaviours commonly associated with money laundering schemes. Through comparative evaluation against Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) and traditional data augmentation techniques, the GAN-based model demonstrates superior capability in generating rich graph structures, reducing isolated nodes, and capturing diverse connectivity patterns. Despite higher reconstruction loss metrics (MSE and BCE), the GAN’s ability to model intricate relational structures makes it well-suited for downstream graph-based anomaly detection tasks. The proposed approach addresses the scarcity of labelled financial graph data by offering a scalable, customizable method to generate synthetic datasets reflective of real-world AML patterns. These findings establish a foundation for further research in graph synthesis for financial crime detection using deep generative models."

The charge pump employs a differential structure that prevents the current-mirror from entering the linear region when the switches are turned off, thereby reducing the charge-sharing effect. In addition, a rail-torail differential amplifier detects the common-mode difference at the input nodes and dynamically adjusts the biasing of the charging and discharging current sources to minimize current mismatch. The cooperative design of the complementary input stage and the common-mode feedback further extends the output-voltage range of the charge pump and effectively suppresses mismatch-induced charge-pump current errors. Implemented in a 12-nm CMOS process and driven by a 100-MHz reference clock under a 0.8 V supply, the proposed circuit demonstrates solid performance over a wide output-voltage range from 178 mV to 730 mV, with static current mismatch maintained below 1%."

At small timescales, we apply offline beam fingerprinting and online fast selection to determine the precoding vector and use slice-aware schedulers to allocate RBs to the user level.

    "abstract": "Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) has become a transformative technology to enable smart, reconfigurable, and cost-efficient wireless communication environments. Prior work has primarily focused on distributed IRS models, which require joint IRS design for both energy transfer and information transfer. This approach requires complex phase-shift reconfiguration and leads to suboptimal resource utilization. This work is a novel attempt to consider dedicated IRS for energy harvesting (EH) and information transfer in wireless powered communication networks (WPCN). Specifically, IRS-I is used to assist EH in the downlink (DL) at devices through a power station. A separate IRS-II is installed between devices and the data sink (DS) for information transfer using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). We investigated a non-linear EH model alongside dedicated IRS deployment, surpassing the limitations of the simplified linear EH approach. Our objective is to maximize the sum-rate (SR) problem while optimizing the active beamforming vector, transmit time, power allocation, and IRS phase-shifts considering NOMA-enabled WPCN. This non-convex optimization problem is solved using the proposed alternating optimization (AO) algorithm and simultaneously optimizes the resource allocation and IRS phase-shifts using semidefinite relaxation. The numerical results demonstrate the advantages of integrating dedicated IRS into WPCNs and show the notable performance gains of the proposed algorithm over benchmark schemes."

FL is also increasingly being explored in the field of hardware security for trusted integrated circuits (ICs), intellectual property (IP) protection, and cyber-physical systems (CPS). This paper demonstrates the ability of FL to effectively improve IC counterfeit detection while preserving privacy, allowing collaboration, and detecting new counterfeiting trends. An IC dataset was used to train the model in the FL framework to distinguish between an authentic and counterfeit IC, illustrating its potential in the field of hardware security. Furthermore, this work explores critical vulnerabilities of FL using the proposed byzantine data poisoning attack. This novel attack can compromise the model without significantly influencing its overall accuracy, making it extremely difficult to detect. Such vulnerabilities raise major concerns in critical applications where federated learning is widely deployed. This research further emphasizes the need for resilient countermeasures to protect the privacy and integrity of the federated learning framework."

This study proposes a comparative study of several Machine Learning (ML) methodologies incorporating physics-informed, transfer learning, and ensemble techniques, to predict hydraulic behavior. Traditional hydraulic simulators, such as EPANET, typically rely on first principle hydraulic equations that may not capture real-world complexity. By integrating physical knowledge from multiple sources (e.g., EPANET output and simple mass conservation laws), the gap between predicted and observed behavior is minimized.The techniques analyzed in this work were trained and tested on a real-world WSS dataset from a water network in Portugal. Results show that semi-supervised and ensemble techniques often deliver superior accuracy. It was evidenced that leveraging knowledge from diverse domains may boost the ML models capability to generalize in unseen data. It is also suggested that a tailored feature-by-feature importance weighting (in the output) leads to improved predictive performance.Overall, this study offers practical guidance on the integration of physical-informed knowledge into the ML training process in complex and noisy systems. It is expected that the acquired observations lead to an increase in predictive capabilities applied in WSS or other systems."

    "abstract": "GPU-accelerated services accelerate computation-intensive tasks by leveraging the parallel processing power of GPUs but incur high costs. Existing researches lack consideration for GPU’s heterogeneous acceleration efficiency for diverse services. In this work, we study SP’s GPU resource pricing and configuration via GPU virtual computing resource blocks (VCRBs) considering users’ heterogeneous tasks in computing markets. We model the interactions between SP and users as a two-stage Stackelberg game. In Stage I, SP purchases GPU resources and designs the prices and computation capacities of GPU VCRBs to maximize its profit. In Stage II, each user decides whether to adopt a GPU VCRB for task acceleration to minimize its cost. Due to the heterogeneous acceleration efficiency and users’ rational decisions, the uniform GPU VCRB design problem for multiple services is discontinuous and challenging to solve. Hence we first consider the multiple design scheme and derive SP’s optimal GPU VCRB design for each type users, where the price increases and the computation capacity decreases with the acceleration efficiency. Then under the uniform design scheme, we derive the optimal GPU VCRB design for two services and obtain that for multiple services via an efficient two-stage algorithm in quadratic time. Simulation results show that the uniform design scheme lowers the GPU VCRB management complexity and suffers only 12.9% profit loss on average compared to the multiple design scheme."

Unlike previous studies that rely on idealized scenarios, this work addresses the challenges of operating in real-world environments, where networks are designed for cellular coverage rather than positioning. The algorithm combines Received Signal Power (PRx) with the Dilution of Precision (DOP) from base stations to optimize dynamic station selection, improving system geometry and reducing estimation errors. To predict the UAV’s future position and calculate DOP in real-time, Kalman filters with Interacting Multiple Models (IMM), based on Constant Acceleration (CA) and Constant Velocity (CV) models, are employed. Additionally, a least squares approach with Taylor expansion, complemented by Tikhonov regularization, mitigates errors arising from ill-conditioned matrices. The methodology is applied to a predefined clustering of base stations in the city of Valencia (Spain), where each cluster is analyzed and optimized. The impact of the handover threshold on system accuracy is studied, proposing an inter-cluster handover scheme based on centroids. Experimental results obtained in a real urban environment demonstrate that the hybrid model significantly improves accuracy in handover zones compared to approaches relying solely on PRx."

Colonoscopy is currently the most effective clinical method for screening colorectal polyps and is of great significance for the early detection and intervention of the disease. It is crucial to accurately segment the polyp area from colonoscopy images. However, the significant variation in polyp appearance and the blurred boundaries with surrounding mucosa make accurate and robust automatic segmentation highly challenging. To address this, we propose a feature fusion network guided by multi-scale convolutional attention, named MsCAFF (Multi-scale Convolutional Attention-based Feature Fusion). Specifically, the Convolutional Attention Multi-scale Fusion module (CAMF) fuses multi-scale information from high-level feature layers based on convolution operations. It enhances the spatial representation of the feature map through channel and spatial attention mechanisms from CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module), while generating a global feature map to serve as the initial guidance for the RA (Reverse Attention) module. This design allows the model to better focus on the target when roughly locating polyp regions, without losing critical boundary information. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations on multiple challenging datasets, the results show that our network MsCAFF achieves significant improvement in segmentation accuracy."

We aim to maximize the signal-to-jamming plus noise ratio (SJNR) by optimizing the RIS beamforming and transmit power of the LEO satellite. Assuming the availability of global channel state information (CSI) at the RIS, we propose alternating optimization (AO) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques to address the complexity.

Waste-to-Energy (WtE) plants play a key role in sustainable energy production by converting municipal solid waste into electricity and district heating. However, optimizing the flue gas cleaning process—that is an integral part of this industrial process—remains a challenge, particularly in controlling the use of lime milk for neutralizing hydrogen chloride (HCl) and sulfur oxides (SOx). Existing fixed-equation approaches often lead to excessive reagent consumption, increasing operational costs and resulting in excessive waste production. This paper proposes a novel approach based on Genetic Programming (GP) with Symbolic Regression (SR) to develop a nonlinear dynamical model for optimizing reagent dosing in WtE plants. The methodology consists of two phases. In the first phase, the algorithm is developed and validated on a laboratory-scale multi-tank water level control system. In the second phase, the algorithm is applied to the original industrial problem based on data collected from the Iru WtE plant located in Tallinn, Estonia. The study utilizes the GPTIPS2F framework for MATLAB, incorporating dynamic feedback integration, variable importance weighting, and residual variance stability measures. Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy, robustness, and adaptability of the proposed model over traditional modeling methods. The experimental results show promise for data-driven modeling techniques towards improving process automation and efficiency in industrial energy systems."

While deep learning (DL) models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, excel at this task, their \"black-box\" nature limits interpretability and trust. This paper proposes a machine learning (ML)-based method that balances high accuracy with interpretability. We introduce a high-quality dataset, \"CARLA-Drive\", and leverage ML techniques like Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), which are efficient, lightweight, and interpretable. In addition, we apply the SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) explainability technique to provide personalized recommendations for safer driving. Achieving an accuracy of 0.92 on a three-class classification task with both RF and XGBoost classifiers, our approach matches DL models in performance while offering transparency and practicality for real-world deployment in intelligent transportation systems."

    "abstract": "In intelligent transportation systems (ITS), one of the main challenges is still finding efficient routes in highly dynamic vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). Even though traditional algorithms provide trade-offs between adaptability (responsiveness), computational complexity, and path optimality, their performance frequently deteriorates in situations that change quickly. In this study, a quantum-inspired routing algorithm based on Grover’s Search is evaluated in a traditional grid-based simulation setting. Through the simulation of quantum amplitude amplification, Grover’s method seeks to find effective paths with a shorter discovery time. Its performance is assessed against classical baselines—Dijkstra, A<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">∗</sup>, and Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)—under varying sparse traffic conditions, using three key metrics: Route Discovery Time (RDT), Path Length (PL), and Route Discovery Messages (RDM). Experimental results show that Grover’s Search consistently achieves lower RDT, indicating strong potential for latency-sensitive scenarios. Despite its higher message overhead, due to classical simulation of quantum processes, the approach underscores the promise of quantum-inspired routing and the need for further exploration of native quantum solutions in future ITS applications."

    "abstract": "Seamless connectivity and efficient mobility management in mobile networks can be facilitated via estimation of the speed and mobility state of user equipment (UE). In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for prediction of the UE speed based on the number of performed handovers and density of all base stations (BSs), including both macro base stations (MBSs) and small-cell base stations (SBSs). We leverage the capability of DRL to learn and adapt to complex mobility patterns, enhancing the accuracy of the speed prediction in highly dynamic environments. To demonstrate benefits of the DRL-based UE speed prediction, we further exploit the predicted speed to determine the UEs’ mobility states. The mobility state serves as an input for handover optimization via fuzzy logic. By incorporating the speed prediction, the system proactively anticipates changes in the UEs’ mobility and enables more precise and timely optimization of handover parameters. The simulation with realistic UE mobility traces shows that the proposed DRL improves the accuracy of the speed prediction by up to 35% and reduces the prediction root mean square error by up to 59% compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms. Moreover, using the proposed DRL-based speed prediction for fuzzy logic-based handover optimization improves the UEs’ sum capacity by up to 43% and reduces the number of handovers by up to 39% compared to state-of-the-art works."

    "abstract": "Molecular communication via diffusion (MCvD) suffers from significant inter-symbol interference (ISI) due to the stochastic nature of molecule propagation. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel ternary modulation algorithm, JT-MoSK (Joint Threshold-based Molecular Shift Keying), which combines dynamic threshold detection with a sliding window mechanism to enhance demodulation reliability. The key innovation lies in a dual-stage detection process where each symbol undergoes two independent verifications: first as the current symbol and then as the preceding symbol in the next time slot. By introducing a ternary molecular encoding scheme (A/B/C) with strict alternation constraints, the algorithm leverages progressive error correction—initially selecting the second-most probable molecule type upon conflict and ultimately defaulting to the least probable type if necessary. A dynamic reliability threshold (τ), adaptively calculated from channel conditions, enables efficient classification of demodulation confidence into high, medium, or low levels. Simulation results confirm that the proposed JTMoSK scheme significantly outperforms conventional modulation methods in BER performance while maintaining computational efficiency. This performance advantage stems from the innovative combination of ternary molecular encoding and the dual-stage verification mechanism, which effectively balances detection accuracy and implementation complexity in diffusion-dominated environments."

    "abstract": "In practical applications such as traffic accident detection, environmental factors can severely degrade image quality, making image restoration a critical factor for improving visual task performance. Since single image restoration methods struggle to address multiple degradation scenarios, researchers have attempted to use a unified model to simultaneously solve various degradation problems. However, existing methods face difficulties in addressing the coupling issues during the restoration process across different frequency domains of degraded images, which limits model performance improvements. Therefore, this paper designs a model that decomposes images into high-frequency and low-frequency spaces through Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). For the high-frequency components, a High-frequency Feature Adaptive Processing Module (HFPM) is employed for feature enhancement and cross-layer fusion, effectively extracting detailed textures while suppressing interference. For low-frequency components, a Low-frequency Feature Transformation and Enhancement Module (LTEM) captures global contextual information through cyclic convolution, improving the integrity of structural contours. To validate model effectiveness, tests were conducted on deraining, denoising and dehazing tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that this model maintains good restoration performance when simultaneously processing multiple degradation tasks."

The proposed approach seeks to identify a minimal yet effective deployment configuration that maximizes coverage efficiency while supporting multiple service types over a unified urban network. N-Deployment incorporates key elements from previous studies, including infrastructure minimization, geometric positioning, budget constraints, service continuity, data delivery requirements, and AI-based mobility pattern detection. A multiobjective optimization model is formulated to ensure that a given fraction of the vehicle fleet connects to the infrastructure within a predefined time window, traversing at least N covered zones along their routes. NSGA-II metaheuristic is employed to address large-scale urban scenarios. Experimental results using real mobility traces from Cologne, Germany, show that N-Deployment significantly outperforms traditional strategies, achieving greater vehicle coverage with fewer RSUs while supporting differentiated service levels. To our knowledge, this is the first unified strategy to simultaneously address service heterogeneity, infrastructure cost, and real-time connectivity in vehicular network deployments."

The office also handles inquiries regarding document status which gives greater challenges as they review, check, locate, or consult other offices to obtain the details regarding a particular document. To address these inefficiencies in manual document tracking within CvSU, two versions of a document tracking system (DTS) were developed, each focusing on improving the status tracking and user experience. The first version introduced barcode technology for basic tracking, while the second version enhanced usability and functionality based on iterative user feedback. The development process utilized iterative-agile methodology to enable flexible adjustments through continuous user engagement.

In practical wireless channels with variable timing, encoder-generated codebooks do not dynamically adapt to channel variations, resulting in a degraded bit error rate (BER) performance. We employ WGAN to model channel effects: 1) the generator models channel distortion to drive encoder-generated channel-adaptive codebooks; 2) the discriminator uses Wasserstein distance-based feature extraction to co-optimize decoder interference suppression via backpropagation. Simulation results demonstrate BER performance and computational complexity that surpasses deep learning (DL)-based benchmarks."

To address this issue, this paper proposes a dynamic spectrum prediction method based on temporal knowledge graphs. By integrating multidimensional knowledge including electromagnetic spectrum data, equipment parameter features, and environmental data, we construct a knowledge graph for communication spectrum coordination with fusion of static and dynamic knowledge (SDKG). By employing a knowledge graph embedding (KGE) model based on the recurrent evolution network via graph convolution network (RE-GCN) combined with graph neural networks (GCNs) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) reasoning algorithm, a GCN-LSTM with RE-GCN dynamic spectrum prediction algorithm is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the GCN-LSTM with RE-GCN algorithm can effectively enhance frequency prediction accuracy."

    "abstract": "The 2-D smoothing (TDS) algorithm is a powerful tool for smoothing and filtering 2-D sequences, serving a crucial role in tasks such as image processing and filtering. Despite its significance, the theoretical properties of the TDS algorithm have not been thoroughly explored in the current literature. In this article, we present a comprehensive analysis of the TDS algorithm, elucidating its mathematical properties and proposing innovative models for its application in image processing. First, we provide an equivalent description of the TDS algorithm and demonstrate that the trend sequence makes the loss function reach the global minimum. Regarding the convergence of the TDS algorithm, we demonstrate the convergence of both trend and fluctuation sequences. Specifically, as the global smoothing parameter tends to infinity, both sequences converge to a deterministic sequence that is independent of the global smoothing parameter. In this case, the TDS algorithm becomes equivalent to computing the trend sequence via the least squares method (LSM). Subsequently, we reveal the smoothing mechanism of the TDS algorithm, which attenuates the energy of the original sequence in the transform domain. Furthermore, we show that the forward transform kernel of the TDS algorithm is a separable orthogonal transform. In addition, we explore the intrinsic relationship between the trend and fluctuation sequences. Notably, an insightful result is that the fluctuation sequence is the trend sequence of the sequence obtained by applying the characteristic lag operator polynomial to the original sequence. Building on these insights, we propose several application scenarios and models for the TDS algorithm in image processing, such as image smoothing, high-frequency extraction, edge detection, and enhancement. To validate the effectiveness of the TDS algorithm, we present numerical simulations and image processing experiments, which demonstrate the correctness of the proposed theoretical framework and the superior performance of TDS in 2-D filtering tasks. This work lays a solid theoretical foundation for the practical application of the TDS algorithm, offering novel methodologies and insights for image processing, 2-D filtering, wireless communication, and computer vision."

    "abstract": "The importance of visual abstract reasoning problems in the field of image processing cannot be overstated. Both Bongard-Logo problems and Raven’s progressive matrices (RPM) belong to the domain of visual abstract reasoning tasks, with Bongard-Logo categorized as image clustering reasoning and RPM involving image progression pattern reasoning. This article introduces a novel baseline model, visual abstraction learning network (Valen), which falls under the umbrella of probability-highlighting models. Valen demonstrates remarkable performance in solving both RPM and Bongard-Logo problems, offering a versatile solution for these reasoning tasks. Our investigation extends beyond the application of Valen, delving into the underlying mechanisms of probability-highlighting solvers. In revisiting how these solvers handle RPM and Bongard-Logo tasks, we realize that they approximate the solution to each reasoning problem as a distribution in which primary samples are compliant while auxiliary samples are not. This prompts us to propose that the learning objective of probability-highlighting solvers is not the distribution of correct solutions but rather one jointly delineated by primary and auxiliary samples. To bridge the discrepancies, we introduced the Tine method, an adversarial learning-based approach that helps Valen estimate a distribution close to that of the correct solutions. However, adversarial training in Tine suffers from instability. Motivated by this limitation, we model the sample distribution of reasoning problems as a mixture of Gaussian distributions, enabling Valen to capture the correct solution distribution more efficiently. This nonadversarial methodology leads to the development of the framework utilizing neural networks for yielding (Funny) method. Building on a similar Gaussian-mixture paradigm, we further propose the supervised representation distribution planning method (SBR) method to plan the distribution of progressive pattern representations. Overall, this article contends that the key to enhancing solvers’ ability to address visual abstract reasoning problems lies in explicitly planning the distribution of predicted solutions to approach the correct solution distribution.

We present a training-time framework that jointly embeds a keydriven dynamic label-mapping and a proactive, self-defending trigger. The label-mapping encodes an owner-specific signature that authorized key holders can verify, update, or transfer by rotating keys; the defensive trigger actively hardens the model against unauthorized backdoor insertion and fakewatermark attempts. Our design yields three properties: (i) exclusivity—only the correct key decodes the watermark; (ii) updateability—ownership can be changed without retraining the backbone; and (iii) robustness—the watermark persists under common post-deployment changes. Across CIFAR-10/100, GTSRB, and Tiny ImageNet on five architectures, the method achieves (> 97%) watermark success rate while preserving original accuracy within 0.5 percentage points, retains (>85%) watermark strength after fine-tuning and (60%) pruning, and reduces fake-watermark success to (< 1.5%) (vs. (> 95%) on unprotected models). By coupling updateable encoding with proactive defense, our approach offers a practical, scalable path to secure, transferable ownership verification for neural-network marketplaces and model exchanges."

Safety filtering is employed to generate a safety trajectory and velocity complying with motion constraints, followed by a safety trajectory tracking controller that maintains tracking errors within predefined safety tubes.

    "abstract": "For 5G NR-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, using the reference signal for sensing has attracted fast-growing attention, as it does not degrade communication performance. Existing works focus on utilizing pilot or positioning reference signal for sensing. In contrast, this paper concentrates on sensing exploiting demodulation reference signal (DM-RS) in physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH). First, we establish a framework in 5G NR-based ISAC systems using DM-RS in PDSCH for wireless sensing. However, a ghost target phenomenon will occur, due to the inherent periodic time-frequency structure and sparsity of DM-RS. Then, to address this challenge, a linear interpolation-based method is proposed, which applied linear interpolation on the target information matrix. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that leveraging DM-RS for sensing is a effective scheme, and the proposed interpolation method can mitigate ghost target phenomenon efficiently."

    "abstract": "This paper considers downlink power allocation and beamforming (PABF) for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) against multipath interference. Yet, ISAC-oriented PABF is of great difficulty, due to its parameter-coupling structure and non-convex problem nature. A novel PABF method is proposed to address this issue. Firstly, in order to handle its complex problem structure, the PABF problem is divided into three subproblems, where communication-end beamformer, sensing-end beamformer and multipath power vector are decoupled. Secondly, structured models of the complex problem are extracted to address the non-convexity challenge. An efficient alternating optimization-based PABF algorithm with closed-form iterations is obtained. At the sensing receiver end, our PABF method can focus beams at the line-of-sight direction, while form null beams at reflection directions for suppressing multipath interference. Simultaneously, at the communication transceiver ends, it can smartly adjust beam gains and transmitting power over multiple paths to maximize the communication performance while ensuring a promised sensing performance. The proposed PABF algorithm can strike an on-demand communication and sensing performance tradeoff, via adjusting the sensing performance requirement. We have verified the efficiency of our PABF method by numerical simulations."

    "abstract": "The identification of channel scenarios in wireless systems plays a crucial role in channel modeling, radio fingerprint positioning, and transceiver design. Traditional methods to classify channel scenarios are based on typical statistical characteristics of channels, such as K-factor, path loss, delay spread, etc. However, statistic-based channel identification methods cannot accurately differentiate implicit features induced by dynamic scatterers, thus performing very poorly in identifying similar channel scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel channel scenario identification method, formulating the identification task as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. Furthermore, the MAP estimation is reformulated by a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which is then approximated and solved by the conditional generative diffusion model. Specifically, we leverage a transformer network to capture hidden channel features in multiple latent noise spaces within the reverse process of the conditional generative diffusion model. These detailed features, which directly affect likelihood functions in MLE, enable highly accurate scenario identification. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms traditional methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), back-propagation neural networks (BPNNs), and random forest-based classifiers, improving the identification accuracy by more than 10%."

Key environmental variables soil moisture, air temperature, and relative humidity drive the decision-making process, which is handled by a fuzzy inference system refined through decision-tree pruning. This approach maintains inference accuracy while simplifying the rule set. The lightweight publish–subscribe model provided by MQTT supports rapid, real-time data exchange. Additionally, MQTT’s hierarchical topic structure and single-level wildcards (+) enable efficient management of multiple zones and devices, making integration and expansion seamless. Simulation results demonstrate low communication latency and consistent system performance, contributing to improved water efficiency and crop yields. The system achieved 100% categorical agreement with manual decisions, confirming the logical soundness and numerical precision of its recommendations.

This study proposes a vision-based personnel detection system customized for tea garden scenarios, aiming to enhance on-site monitoring and labor management. We adopted the YOLOv5 object detection framework and integrated it with the DeepSORT tracking algorithm to develop a real-time pedestrian recognition system. The model was initially trained on the MOT20 dataset and tested on video data collected from real-world tea plantations.Experimental results revealed that models trained on conventional urban pedestrian datasets struggle to maintain detection accuracy in tea garden environments due to occlusions by tea plants, varying lighting conditions, and target sizes. Recognition performance significantly decreased in steep-angle or top-down camera views, highlighting the need for optimized camera deployment and domain-adapted training. To address this, we conducted data augmentation and parameter tuning tailored to the tea plantation context, improving the model’s mean Average Precision (mAP) and tracking consistency. This work contributes a practical framework for customized-area personnel detection in agriculture and underscores the necessity of developing domain-specific datasets for better generalization. The findings provide valuable technical guidance for intelligent agricultural surveillance and pave the way for further research into vision-based monitoring in crop-specific environments."

Furthermore, our evaluation metrics highlight a perfect classification performance for normal transactions, while also indicating areas for improvement in detecting fraud cases, with a precision of 0.85 and a recall of 0.68.

Recognizing the performance degradation caused by environmental blockers, the system introduces a joint wave-form design that ensures robust operation under varying channel conditions. A channel switching mechanism is deployed to reroute communication through alternative non-line-of-sight paths when the primary line-of-sight links are obstructed. Moreover, a dynamic power allocation strategy enforces a minimum rate constraint for the weak NOMA user, ensuring consistent quality of service. Extensive simulations over multiple blockage scenarios and signal to noise (SNR) conditions validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. Notably, under severe blockage, the system achieves up to a 400% sensing rate enhancement at 15 dB SNR, with only a 20% reduction in communication rate. These results corroborate the system’s ability to adapt and optimize joint sensing-communication performance in practical deployment environments."

In practice, ensuring reliable V2I links while maintaining high-throughput intra-platoon links is essential for road safety. This paper investigates the joint optimization of relay selection and resource allocation in a long platoon network, where a single relay vehicle facilitates intra-platoon connectivity. The objective is to maximize the long-term V2V sum-rate while satisfying V2I signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints and relay service duration limitations. To solve this temporally coupled optimization problem with hybrid decision variables—involving discrete relay and channel selection as well as continuous power control—we adopt a Hybrid Proximal Policy Optimization (H-PPO) framework. The proposed solution employs dual actor networks to simultaneously learn optimal discrete and continuous policies. Extensive simulations validate that the H-PPO algorithm achieves substantial improvements in V2V throughput while guaranteeing V2I reliability and energy-efficient relay operation in high-mobility long-platoon scenarios."

Based on the collected data, this study analyzes and models the stationarity and fading characteristics of the channel. The results show that the values for the 1st percentile, 50th percentile, and 90th percentile of the channel’s stationary distance (threshold=0.8) are 0.412 m, 5.99 m, and 23.19 m, respectively. Path loss analysis indicates that the close-in free-space reference path loss with a path loss exponent of 2.407 provides an accurate representation, while shadow fading follows a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 4.55 dB. To better capture the autocorrelation of shadow fading, a novel model is proposed, improving accuracy by 35% compared to the conventional exponential model. Additionally, small-scale fading envelope analysis using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) confirms that the Rician distribution is the most suitable model. The K-factor of the Rician distribution can be statistically modeled as a bimodal Gaussian distribution, with a goodness-of-fit (GoF) value of 0.026."

However, the trade-off between spatial and angular resolution in plenoptic cameras limits their application in scenarios requiring high spatial resolution. In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been widely applied to light field image processing, aiming to fully utilize the spatial and angular information of images. This paper proposes a novel CNN-based method for image information interaction in light field super-resolution (LFSR). This method effectively leverages the feature correlations between different views and promotes the learning of cross-scale and shallow features by introducing residual connections. The network architecture consists of three main stages: feature extraction, information interaction and fusion, and super-resolution (SR) reconstruction. Specifically, we extract rich spatial and angular features from the images, use residual connections in the information interaction and fusion stage to enhance feature learning capabilities, and finally upsample the fused features to generate the desired high-resolution (HR) images. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only performs well in visual effects and quantitative evaluations but also accurately recovers the details in the reconstructed images."

To address this technical challenge, this study proposes a step-length estimation model based on residual neural networks (ResNet) with limited-sample training. The architecture achieves precise step-length prediction across various motion states through temporal feature extraction and multi-rate motion pattern analysis. Experimental results validated by five independent test sets demonstrate that the system achieves a relative displacement estimation error below 0.6%, with the mean absolute error (MAE) of single-step length prediction consistently remaining under 0.045 meters. Analytical verification confirms that the proposed step-length estimation method significantly enhances the step-length measurement accuracy of shoulder-mounted IMUs, providing an effective technical solution for high-precision indoor positioning of IoT devices."

To address this issue, we propose Telecom mixture of models (TeleMoM), a consensus-driven ensemble framework that integrates multiple LLMs for enhanced decision-making in Telecom. TeleMoM employs a two-stage process: proponent models generate justified responses, and an adjudicator finalizes decisions, supported by a quality-checking mechanism.

    "abstract": "Designing dual-functional waveforms for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) under low-resolution hardware constraints remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel few-bit multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) signal design for uplink-downlink ISAC systems, where the transmitter is equipped with low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs). To mitigate the impact of coarse quantization, we adopt a spatial Sigma-Delta (Σ∆) modulation scheme and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the worst-case signal-to-quantization-plus-noise ratio (SQNR) for target sensing, while satisfying symbol error probability (SEP) constraints for all communication users (CUs). A two-stage solution is proposed: a Σ∆ filter is first optimized, followed by a dual accelerated projected gradient (APG) algorithm for symbol-level precoding to generate the DFRC signal. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Σ∆ scheme for suppressing the quantization noise, providing promising performance for both sensing and communication tasks."

    "abstract": "In high-mobility communication scenarios, traditional orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems suffer from performance degradation due to the Doppler effect. In contrast, orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation represents signals in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, effectively leveraging the sparsity and stability of the channel, making it a promising alternative. However, channel estimation in OTFS systems remains a challenge. This paper proposes an OTFS channel estimation method based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). By designing an appropriate pilot structure, the channel estimation problem is formulated as a convex optimization problem with ℓ<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</inf>-norm regularization, enabling efficient solution without requiring prior knowledge of sparsity. The paper provides a detailed description of the system model, ADMM algorithm derivation, parameter selection, and complexity analysis. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing CS-based approaches in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE), bit error rate (BER), confirming its superiority in high-mobility scenarios. This research provides significant theoretical and practical support for the implementation of OTFS systems."

On the other hand, VBA scale factor nonlinearity (SFNL) is a major contributor to DC offset under vibration. This study illustrates how the operating the resonator in the NL regime can provide a further additional consideration in the optimization of vibration rectification error (VRE). First, operation under a PLL-based closed loop when subjected to vibration is described. Then, a model explaining the impact of the resonator NL regime on VRE is proposed.

Yet, its analog nature makes performance vulnerable to noise and quantization. In this work, we study a photonic architecture that can operate either as a convolution accelerator (CA) or as a photonic convolutional neural network (PCNN). For the CA, we conduct a large-scale analysis of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$3 \\times 3$</tex> kernels with varying sparseness (amount of zeros) and negative density (amount of negative values), showing that highly sparse kernels with balanced positive and negative values are the least robust, with convolution quality degrading rapidly under high levels of noise. At the accuracy level, the CA demonstrates strong resilience, with less than 0.5% accuracy reduction even at 1-bit quantization. By contrast, the PCNN suffers larger drops—about 15% at 1 bit and 2% at 2 bits. Based on these results, we estimate that lowering digital-to-analog converter (DAC) resolution can reduce the DAC's power consumption by 98.44% in the CA and 96.88% in the PCNN while maintaining the same accuracy as higher quantization levels. These findings provide quantitative insights into how kernel design, quantization, and circuit-level choices shape the robustness and efficiency of photonic neural networks."

    "abstract": "Millimeter-Wave radar has emerged as a promising sensing modality for autonomous vehicles due to its robustness in adverse environmental conditions such as fog, rain, and low light. However, traditional radar processing pipelines relying on range-Doppler and angle-of-arrival estimation often produce sparse and noisy outputs, making object detection challenging. In this paper, we propose FouriDAR, a lightweight radar-only object detection network that, for the first time in this domain, applies the Fourier Network architecture for global frequency-domain modeling. By replacing the attention mechanism in Transformer-Based designs with Fourier transforms, our approach captures long-range spatial dependencies with significantly lower computational complexity. In addition, a self-learned MIMO preprocessing pipeline restructures radar input into learnable feature tensors, enhancing angular and Doppler cues for robust detection. Evaluated on the RADIal benchmark, FouriDAR achieves 72.3% average precision and 75.8% recall, outperforming existing radar-only models, while requiring only 1.2M parameters and 3.5 GFLOPs. These results demonstrate that introducing the Fourier Network to radar-based perception, coupled with adaptive MIMO-aware preprocessing, provides a new and efficient foundation for autonomous driving."

    "abstract": "Aerial base stations (ABSs) mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are capable of extending wireless connectivity to ground users (GUs) across a variety of scenarios. However, it is an NP-hard problem with exponential complexity in M and N, in order to maximize the coverage rate (CR) of M GUs by jointly placing N ABSs with limited coverage range. The complexity of the problem escalates in environments where the signal propagation is obstructed by localized obstacles such as buildings, and is further compounded by the dynamic GU positions. In response to these challenges, this paper focuses on the optimization of a multi-ABS movement problem, aiming to improve the mean CR for mobile GUs within a site-specific environment. Our proposals include 1) introducing the concept of global connectivity map (GCM) which contains the connectivity information between given pairs of ABS/GU locations; 2) partitioning the ABS movement problem into ABS placement sub-problems and formulate each sub-problem into a binary integer linear programming (BILP) problem based on GCM; 3) and proposing a fast online algorithm to execute (one-pass) projected stochastic subgradient descent within the dual space to rapidly solve the BILP problem with near-optimal performance. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves a high CR performance close to the upper bound obtained by the open-source solver (SCIP), yet with significantly reduced running time. Moreover, our method also outperforms common benchmarks in the literature such as the K-means initiated evolutionary algorithm or the ones based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), in terms of CR performance and/or time efficiency."

Addressing the capacity degradation due to delayed beam updates, we propose a beam tracking method based on dual codebook interpolation. This approach estimates beam update intervals through beam pattern analysis and angular velocity of terminals within satellite’s field of view, while maintaining the codebook. The precoder at any instant is generated through linear interpolation between active and updated codebooks. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method adaptively adjusts beam update intervals according to terminal’s position and channel conditions, effectively reducing beam tracking frequency while maintaining system capacity above specified thresholds."

    "abstract": "To reduce the heavy traffic burden over backhaul links, this paper studies a new reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided wireless caching system. The RIS is equipped with a smart controller to control reflective elements. The functions of content caching and energy harvesting (EH) are endowed to the controller. A two-phase transmission policy is designed. In the first phase, the requested contents that are not locally cached are delivered by the base station (BS) to the RIS, and the smart controller harvests the energy from ambient radio frequency (RF) signals. In the second phase, the smart controller distributes cached contents utilizing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmission with the aid of the harvested energy, while the RIS forwards the fetched contents. The beamforming vectors of the BS and the power allocation factors for NOMA transmission are jointly optimized to maximize the achievable sum rate of the system. The original problem is difficult to solve owing to coupled variables. After being processed by fractional programming (FP) and quadratic transformation (QT), it is divided into two sub-problems. The first sub-problem is solved by introducing auxiliary variables, and the second one is converted to be convex by rational transformations to the quality of service constraint. The optimal solution is achieved by alternatively solving the two sub-problems. Simulation results reveal that the original problem can converge quickly, and the proposed algorithm outperforms benchmarks in terms of the achievable sum rate."

This approach enables individual vehicles to collaboratively develop a global model capable of handling diverse extreme tasks at intersections. Additionally, it allows local vehicles to train models in conjunction with roadside units (RSUs) without compromising sensitive data, such as perception information. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FL framework not only boosts the convergence speed during the training phase by up to 114.26%, but also improves autonomous driving performance, as evidenced by higher reward values, lower collision rates, and reduced travel time, compared to benchmark RL schemes."

Existing MIMO ISAC literature often prioritizes communication rate or detection probability, typically under constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) assumptions, without jointly analyzing detection reliability and communication constraints. To address this gap, we adopt an eigenvalue-based detector for robust sensing and use a performance metric—the total detection error—that jointly captures false-alarm and missed-detection probabilities. We derive novel closed-form expressions for both probabilities under the eigenvalue detector, enabling rigorous sensing analysis. Using these expressions, we formulate and solve a —joint power allocation and threshold optimization— problem that minimizes total detection error while meeting a minimum communication rate requirement. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint design substantially outperforms conventional CFAR-based schemes, highlighting the benefits of power-and threshold-aware optimization in MIMO ISAC systems."

    "abstract": "Adaptive canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) is a technique for tracking time-varying tensor models in real time or at low cost, and has attracted much interest across a variety of signal processing applications. However, most existing CPD trackers assume slow variations of the model with fixed dynamic pattern, and some key parameters, such as the forgetting factor that weights the importance of historical observed data, remain unchanged during the tracking process. Therefore, without monitoring the state of the dynamic CPD model, these techniques may be less performant or even fail in cases where the model suddenly varies dramatically at some point, or the dynamic pattern of the model changes over time. To address this limitation, we propose a hybrid \"STATe monitoring assisted TRAcKing\" (STATTRAK) method, integrating a state monitor into the tracking process, based on which the CPD tracker adaptively selects the tracking (or decomposition) strategy as well as the forgetting factor. Note that the state monitor evaluates the variation of the dynamic CPD model between adjacent time points, in a recursive way, and thus is also of low-cost. This work focuses on third-order adaptive CPD, where data is added along one mode and factor matrices in the other two modes have fixed size with time-varying entries. Experiments show that STATTRAK consistently achieves higher accuracy than existing CPD trackers and significantly reduces CPU time compared with batch methods. Specifically, it is at least 15.5% more accurate than the compared CPD trackers, in terms of RMSE reduction, and is at least 14 times faster than batch decomposition, in terms of CPU time."

Its simple yet expressive elements enable engineers from different disciplines to model systems within a unified framework, promoting interoperability and collaboration. Additionally, the method supports semantic serialisation into RDF triples, enhancing digitalisation and supporting the creation of digital twins of real-world systems.

Since the electromagnetic emissions are related to the specific V2X messages, we investigate and model the transmission of cooperative awareness messages according to their standardization. The verification of this approach based on field-operational testing revealed the relevance of accurate trajectories derived from the GNSS source data. The maximum deviation in terms of the total amount of messages transmitted remained below 15%, which is an acceptable performance. This success allows us to quantify the expected electromagnetic emissions and provides a scalable approach for future V2X assessment."

However, the sub-THz transmission suffer from the combined effects of the channel environment and hardware impairments. In this paper, we conducted three indoor coverage experiments that demonstrate coverage enhancement using reflected waves and suppression of hardware impairments by employing Hybrid-DNN demodulator. We utilized 140 GHz-band Tx-RFIC and phased array antenna developed by Nokia Bell Labs as the sub-THz transceiver. The measurement results indicate that it is possible to obtain coverage performance comparable to that obtained in a line-of-sight environment, if a ray connecting the Tx and Rx antennas with one reflection by utilizing reflected waves from metal walls is available. In addition, the results also confirmed the coverage enhancement even under hardware impairment by using beam steering and Hybrid-DNN demodulation."

This paper investigates the matching of high-capacity, heterogeneous data transmission to the constrained communication time windows between Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites and high-altitude platforms (HAPs). By explicitly modeling the heterogeneous data transmission process, based on the matching game, this study examines how to maximize data transmission revenue while maintaining the stable transmission of high-capacity, heterogeneous data. This problem is reformulated as a three-sided matching game with size and cyclic preference lists (TMSC) involving HAP, satellite, and data. Since obtaining stable matching results in the TMSC is NP-complete, we propose a two-tier matching algorithm framework comprising two components: a random path to pairwise-stable (RPPS) matching algorithm for pairing HAPs with satellites, and a Roth-Peranson (RP) algorithm for matching HAP-satellite pairs with data. Efficient matching is achieved by imposing communication time window constraints and integrating the distinct characteristics of HAPs, satellites, and data. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves near-optimal data transmission performance while significantly reducing computational complexity."

We consider a scenario where a transmitter sends an information signal to a multi-antenna legitimate user while a multi-antenna eavesdropper attempts to intercept it. In this setting, a BD-RIS reconfigures the wireless environment to enhance secrecy. Aiming at the secrecy rate (SR) maximization, the joint optimization of transmit beamforming and BD-RIS reflection coefficients is formulated as a non-convex problem with power constraints on beamforming and symmetric and unitary constraints on BD-RIS reflection coefficients. To efficiently solve this challenging problem, a low-complexity framework that combines the augmented Lagrangian (AL) method and product manifold gradient descent (PMGD) algorithm is proposed to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution. Numerical results show that BD-RIS-assisted systems achieve higher secrecy rates compared to conventional RIS-assisted systems."

    "abstract": "Low-Earth-orbit(LEO) satellite communication, as a key technology in the future networking field, which can provide ubiquitous mobile communication services. However, the LEO constellation faces multiple challenges such as low throughput of onboard switching systems, large transmission delay, and the limited computing and storage resources on satellites, making it difficult to meet the requirement of the time-sensitive applications such as the Internet of Things and industrial Internet. To realize LEO-based time-sensitive networking (TSN), this paper proposes a deadline guaranteed scheduling algorithm based on time-ordered queues for time-sensitive LEO satellite networks. The key idea of the proposed algorithm is to simplify the deadline guaranteed scheduling problem of multiple periods into a single period. Thus, the problem of high storage complexity of scheduling table caused by period extension is solved successfully. To do this, the Push-In-First-Out(PIFO) queues, usually used in terrestrial networks, are configured at the output end of the onboard switching fabric. Through a reordering mechanism based on the deadline priority, packets are pushed into the appropriate position for waiting and then output in time order. Simulation results indicate that compared with traditional scheduling algorithms, the proposed algorithm saves 45% - 97% of the time flow table storage resources of the onboard switching system under the same conditions, effectively improving resource utilization. The throughput performance of the onboard switch is enhanced by approximately 15% - 24%, and the average delay is reduced by around 17% - 49%."

To address these issues, this study proposes a dual-objective multi-UAV data collection task allocation model for LAIN scenarios and introduces an improved multi-objective artificial rabbit optimization algorithm based on elite strategy (named ENS-ARMO). Considering the mapping between the task allocation model and the optimization algorithm, a hybrid encoding scheme is proposed. Comparative experiments with MOGA, MOACO, and NSGA-II under two task scales demonstrate that ENS-ARMO not only enhances data collection performance but also significantly reduces total flight distance, highlighting its efficiency and applicability in the context of the low-altitude economy."

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks, renowned for their rapid deployment and high mobility, are well-suited for emergency communications that require swift responses to dynamic tasks. However, complex operational environments and frequent target movements cause service clusters to move dynamically, leading to constant changes in communication demands and service types, as well as highly dynamic distributions of service source and destination clusters, which can result in service interruptions and delays. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamic task UAV network slicing architecture, comprising multiple UAV task clusters and a UAV physical infrastructure, designed to meet diverse service requirements. A slice resource reconfiguration model is developed to assess communication terminal issues caused by dynamic tasks, considering factors such as service interruptions, traffic rate, routing, node allocation, and spectrum allocation. The model aims to minimize service interruptions while considering constraints on limited spectrum, node resources, and flow capacities. To solve it, an algorithm based on the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) is introduced. Simulation results show that this algorithm effectively reduces service interruptions, decreases reconfiguration needs, and enhances resource utilization in dynamic environments."

To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel hierarchical spatial-semantic cooperative network (HiSCNet), which aims to leverage the complementary strengths of multi-level features to enhance detection performance. Specifically, bitemporal features are extracted using a Siamese backbone. A shallow feature guidance module (SFGM) is introduced in the early layers to enhance the perception of finegrained and boundary changes, while a deep semantic aggregation module (DSAM) is applied in the deeper layers to strengthen the representation of high-level semantic and structural differences. The refined features are progressively fused to produce the final change map. HiSC-Net was extensively evaluated on the LEVIRCD, WHU-CD, and CDD datasets, where it consistently outperformed the current leading methods with higher F1 score, overall accuracy (OA), and intersection over union (IoU), demonstrating its robust effectiveness in RSCD."

    "abstract": "During the last three decades, MEMS technology led to very small, light, and cost-effective inertial measurement units (IMUs). Thus, such IMUs became a mass product and enabled novel utilizations of inertial sensors that are characterized by multi-IMU arrangements. One example of this are IMU arrays that form a single, virtual, cost-effective IMU of medium performance by using simultaneously several cheap IMUs of low accuracy. The IMUs of these arrays are aligned in such a way that all corresponding sensor axes run parallel to each other. Although this approach is well known, it has not found widespread use.In contrast to these arrays, the paper introduces a new IMU array that is not meant as a general IMU but is designed for a specific purpose. It aims at the circumstance that customary MEMS gyroscopes are meanwhile able to detect the earth rotation rate, but require time-consuming procedures for a reliable gyrocompassing. To reduce the time required and to increase the accuracy of gyrocompassing with cost-effective gyroscopes, a circular arrangement of the measurement axes of a medium number of these sensors is proposed.In this regard, the paper presents an experimental setup that was designed to explore the potential of such a novel gyroscope arrangement and could be realized with low-cost customary components. After the description of the setup, verification tests are presented. Then, experiments with different variants of the Maytagging method for gyrocompassing follow. Together with the discussion of their promising results, an outlook how to continue these investigations concludes the paper."

Model poisoning attacks initiated by malicious vehicles are one of the most threatening attacks, in which malicious parties modify the weight parameters of the model to corrupt the global model, thus triggering security issues. In this paper, we proposed FedWM-IoV, a watermarking-based defense method against federated learning model poisoning attacks in IoV. The objective is to detect malicious local models through watermark embedding and watermark integrity detection and select benign local models for aggregation to improve the robustness of the system.

The effectiveness of these applications hinges on the availability of high-fidelity and spatially comprehensive radio maps. To address this, we propose an optimal path planning approach with distance constraints for efficient sampling in urban radio map reconstruction. Unlike traditional random sampling strategies, our method restricts sampling points to lie along a feasible road network and imposes a fixed distance constraint on the sampling path. We design a structure-aware genetic algorithm (GA_s) to optimize the path for mobile sampling, incorporating an unsupervised population evaluation metric to assess the fitness of candidate solutions. Experimental results show that, under equal sampling distance conditions, GA_s achieves a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.0626 in radio map recovery—outperforming random sampling (0.0796), A* algorithm (0.0748), and a conventional genetic algorithm (GA_c). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in enabling efficient and accurate radio map reconstruction for mobile sampling platforms in real-world urban settings."

One of the key challenges in AOI is optimising inspection tolerances. Traditionally, this process relies heavily on the expertise and intuition of engineers, making it subjective and prone to inconsistency. To address this, we are developing an intelligent, data-driven approach to optimise inspection tolerances in a more objective and consistent manner. Most existing research in this area focuses primarily on minimising false calls, often at the risk of allowing actual defects to go undetected. This oversight can compromise product quality, especially in critical sectors such as medical, defence, and automotive industries. Our approach introduces the use of percentile rank, amongst other logical strategies, to ensure that genuine defects are not overlooked. With continued refinement, our method aims to reach a point where every flagged item is a true defect, thereby eliminating the need for manual inspection. Our proof of concept achieved an 18% reduction in false calls at the 80th percentile rank, while maintaining a 100% recall rate. This makes the system both efficient and reliable, offering significant time and cost savings."

In edge networks, the deployment of fine-grained function instances to handle massive request data makes it more difficult to optimize the quality of user experience. This paper addresses the scheduling of heterogeneous function processing requests generated by users in serverless edge computing scenarios, considering the constraints of resources on edge nodes, and making decisions regarding the warm and cold start during the scheduling process. The problem is modeled as a constrained multi-objective optimization issue aimed at minimizing latency and energy consumption. A deep reinforcement learning strategy, grounded in Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO), is introduced to address this challenge, with each user being represented as an autonomous agent. Simulations were conducted to assess the impacts of the learning rate, the request volume, and the size of the input data of the function. The experimental results indicate that, compared with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA), under different scenarios of request scales, the average system delay is reduced by at most 31%, and the average energy consumption is reduced by at most 24%."

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of wireless communication technologies is exemplified by the emergence of 5GAdvanced and the anticipated 6G era. While 5G-Advanced enhances current capabilities, 6G aims to integrate AI-driven intelligence and advanced cryptographic techniques to strengthen security. This paper investigates the ZUCPRN model [1], a neural network-based cipher, designed to enhance wireless security in 5G and 6G networks. Although ZUC-PRN has the potential to replace traditional FSM-based ciphers, its resistance to various attacks remain unverified. We evaluate its susceptibility to Differential Power Analysis (DPA) attacks, comparing its security with the standard ZUC stream cipher. The analysis is conducted using a dedicated hardware-based testbench setup featuring the VAMAN board. This study offers key insights into the security and efficiency of the ZUC-PRN model, contributing to the advancement of more resilient encryption techniques for next-generation communication systems."

Current research mainly focus on On-Off Keying (OOK) and Binary Phase-Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation schemes and most overlook the crucial aspect of tag circuit sensitivity. In this paper, we derive the capacity of the M-ASK modulated backscatter system under the circuit sensitivity constraint of the tag. We conducts a comparative analysis of capacity performance across three scenarios: (i) backscatter communication systems without sensitivity constraints, (ii) backscatter systems employing different modulation orders, and (iii) conventional point-to-point communication systems. It is found that the circuit sensitivity of the passive tags has a considerable impact on the system capacity. Furthermore, high-order modulation can effectively increase the channel capacity of the backscatter communication systems."

    "abstract": "In order to suppress the inter-cell interference, the interference rejection combining (IRC) receiver is considered an effective scheme. The performance of the IRC receiver mainly depends on the accuracy of the covariance matrix of the received interference signals and noise. The basic covariance matrix estimation is inaccurate when the samples used in averaging operation is limited. In this paper, two IRC receivers based on eigenvalue filtering are presented to acquire a high accuracy covariance matrix. One of the proposed IRC receivers is subband based, filtering the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix on each subband. The other one is full frequency band based, acquiring the covariance matrix by the common channel characteristics on the entire bandwidth. Simulation results show that both of the proposed IRC receivers are robust and have a significant gain over the basic IRC receiver in various scenarios. The subband based IRC receiver can achieve a performance close to the ideal IRC receiver with a higher complexity. The full frequency band based IRC receiver has a lower complexity and outperforms the subband based one when the interfering channel has a dominant propagation path."

The machine topology and operating principle are firstly introduced, followed by a detailed analysis of key design parameters such as slot-pole combinations and winding configurations. Based on the DEP system requirements, the proposed PUAM -UCS machine is designed and optimized with respect to critical parameters such as the module number and dimensions of U-core stator. Followed, the theoretical models are developed to highlight the distinctions between the PUAM-UCS machines and conventional machines. A comprehensive performance evaluation, e.g., no-load back-EMF, output torque, power factor, losses, and efficiency, is carried out by both analytical approaches and finite element analysis (FEA). Finally, two prototypes of PUAM-UCS and PUAM machine with split-pole stators (PUAM-SPS) are fabricated and experimentally tested, demonstrating strong agreement with theoretical and FEA predictions. The results can confirm that this proposed machine can achieve improved torque density and better fault tolerance, making it a promising future candidate for eVTOL DEP system."

    "abstract": "Data clustering aims to partition the input data entities into several disjoint categories, where similar entities are grouped together while dissimilar ones are pulled apart. In general, the existing data clustering methods merely depend on the attribute information or constructed similarity graph information of the input data entities, and such one-sided cues may result in an incomplete understanding and potentially biased conclusions. How to well consider the inherent heterogeneous knowledge of data while maintaining the local semantics remains a challenging problem. To address this, we propose a novel knowledge-aware clustering (KAC) method, where the attribute information and inherent heterogeneous knowledge of data are jointly considered for better cluster structure recovery. Within this framework, there are four major modules. They are: 1) the target attribute autoencoder to capture a customizable target feature representation; 2) the meta-path aggregated knowledge graph encoder to learn an informative graph feature representation; 3) the dual information maximization to ensure the consistent semantics between two embedding representations; and 4) the self-training clustering to self-supervise the clustering learning. Experiments on several real-world datasets are conducted to validate the superiority of KAC, indicating the significance of explicitly considering the heterogeneous knowledge while maintaining local semantics."

    "abstract": "mmWave radar-based human pose estimation is garnering increasing attention in Internet of Things (IoT) applications owing to its robustness under adverse lighting conditions and occlusion scenarios. However, accurately estimating human poses from mmWave signals remains challenging due to two key limitations: the lack of structural consistency when perceiving targets as a unified whole, and the absence of spatiotemporal consistency when tracking individual targets. To tackle these two challenges, this paper introduces RF-PoseR, a dedicated human pose rectifier for mmWave radar-based pose estimation. RF-PoseR serves as a corrective framework that refines the pose outputs generated by mmWave pose estimation systems. Based on the observation that perceptual inconsistencies in radar signals result in severely erroneous joint estimations, we introduce spatial and temporal constraints to enhance pose estimation accuracy. Specifically, RF-PoseR incorporates three core components: (1) unreliable joint removal guided by spatial structure, (2) pose completion leveraging temporal continuity, and (3) cross-modal pre-training utilizing large-scale visual pose datasets. Extensive experiments on mmWave radar pose datasets demonstrate that RF-PoseR significantly enhances the accuracy of poses generated by existing radar-based estimation networks. Furthermore, experiments on visual datasets confirm the method’s broader applicability beyond radar perception tasks."

The existing switching laws, such as dwell time, average dwell time (ADT), and mode-dependent ADT (MDADT), depict the switching frequency by linear functions of switching interval length, which may insufficiently characterize the switching numbers and features of SNTDSs. To effectively ensure the system stability of SNTDSs and relax the conservatism of stability criteria, two novel switching laws, average switching density and mode-dependent average switching density (MDASD), are first proposed to illustrate the switching frequency of SNTDSs. Meanwhile, under the new switching laws, by constructing the proper multiple Lyapunov–Razumikhin functions, relaxed integral inequalities, and the trajectory-based approach, stability criteria are presented for SNTDSs, which can encompass and include certain aspects of prior research. Moreover, we apply the new switching laws and theoretical results to switched neural networks. Ultimately, we present two examples to confirm the effectiveness of the approaches we have developed."

Despite large-scale language models achieving notable success in general domains, even outperforming human-level performance in certain aspects, they are still faced with challenges such as data privacy and scarcity in the special domain. This study explores the method for efficient fine-tuning under resource-constrained conditions in the biomedical field. We propose a multi-stage fine-tuning approach that effectively improves the performance of pre-trained language models in biomedical question-answering tasks. Specially, A multi-prompt-based contrastive learning strategy and a multi-prompt self-consistency voting module are introduced, which improve the accuracy of QA tasks. The experiments on the PubMedQA dataset under reasoning-required settings indicate that our approach outperforms domain-specific pre-training models and achieves comparable performance with GPT-4, while the number of fine-tuned parameters is much less than the total parameters of the base model."

    "abstract": "In this work, a distributed indirect adaptive controller is designed for a group of robotic agents cooperatively manipulating a common payload. Uncertainty on the model of the manipulated object and the limited actuation capabilities of the single agents can significantly impact the overall behavior of the control system. An indirect adaptive control scheme is proposed in this article to address these shortcomings. In particular, model uncertainty and loss of effectiveness of the actuators are handled in a unifying fashion by an adaptive control architecture that preserves physical consistency of the estimated inertial parameters of the manipulated object, while simultaneously providing an antiwindup mechanism for the estimated inertial parameters in case of actuator saturation. In addition, a dynamic input allocation strategy is proposed to distribute the control effort among the agents in such a way that the intrinsic input redundancy of the overall setup is exploited for dynamic optimization of additional performance criteria, including optimization of the control efforts on each agent. The stability of the closed-loop system is proven theoretically, and the performance and robustness of the control system are validated by means of comparative simulations with respect to a baseline state-of-the-art controller."

    "abstract": "This study investigates how quantum dots (QDs) influence carrier migration under both low and high electric fields. The effects of CdSe QDs at different concentrations on the direct current (DC) conductivity and breakdown strength characteristics of polypropylene (PP) were systematically examined. The ohmic conductivity decreases with the incorporation of QDs, but the threshold electric field of ohmic conductivity remains unchanged at a certain temperature. The results indicate that under low electric fields, QDs act as scattering centers for carriers due to the Coulomb blockade effect, which increases the migration path and reduces conductivity. Under high temperatures and high fields, QDs primarily function as carrier traps, and the trapped carriers are difficult to de-trap because of the quantum confinement effect. As a result, adding QDs increases the threshold electric fields for Schottky injection and Poole-Frenkel (P-F) emission. For instance, at 105°C, the threshold electric field increases from 35 kV/mm to 50 kV/mm. Thermally stimulated depolarization current (TSDC) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) simulations confirmed that QDs introduce deep traps at 0.9-1.0 eV in the polymer matrix, effectively capturing carriers. In conclusion, this study demonstrates low-field scattering and high-field trapping of QDs, which reduce carrier mobility and improve dielectric characteristics."

At its core, a Data Coordination Agent fuses static knowledge (device topologies, user behaviors) with dynamic network information (weather patterns, electricity pricing) to build comprehensive energy consumption networks. Working together, three specialized agents form our Model Collaboration Agent Group: one handling spatiotemporal analysis through graph reasoning, another enabling quick adaptation to personal energy habits, and a third detecting anomalies without supervision. These collaborate via robust information sharing and decision coordination. Downstream, our Task Execution Agent Group transforms model insights into practical actions, while our Warning Agent Group employs continuous monitoring and signal coordination to minimize false alarms. The theoretical analysis demonstrated how this approach substantially improves prediction performance, speeds up adaptation to new users, and reduces false warnings without depending on rigid thresholds."

This study aimed to investigate two critical aspects: the evolution of AI applications across engineering disciplines and the ethical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). By examining patent publications, we traced how AI implementation in industrial engineering has evolved, revealing a clear progression from basic simulation-based approaches to sophisticated optimization techniques, and ultimately to contemporary machine-learning methodologies. To complement this technical analysis, we assessed six LLMs using established ethical sensitivity measurements previously validated with engineering students. Our findings revealed that while these models demonstrated proficiency in identifying ethical issues within presented scenarios, they exhibited notable inconsistencies when confronted with practical ethical dilemmas. These results make a significant contribution to our understanding of AI’s expanding role in engineering and its capacity for ethical decision-making, while simultaneously highlighting the pressing need to develop more robust ethical frameworks as these technologies become further entrenched in engineering practice. This research underscores the importance of maintaining stringent ethical standards in AI development and implementation, suggesting that continued refinement of ethical guidelines should parallel technological advancement in the engineering sector."

To address these challenges and improve prediction accuracy under Multiple Operating Conditions (MOC), we propose a Coarse-Fine Meta-learning Framework (CFMF). Initially, multiple Coarse Models are established using historical operating condition data. We then introduce a MOC-Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) strategy, which utilizes small-batch data from new operating conditions to identify similar time-series characteristics from historical conditions. These similar conditions data are used to train a meta-learning model for the Coarse Models based on Stacking, ultimately resulting in a fine model for quality index prediction. In industrial experiments, we compare the CFMF with classical multi-model learning strategies, and the results demonstrate that the proposed CFMF achieves superior prediction performance on the target domain test set."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates efficient resource allocation in space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) enabled ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) systems to enhance URLLC reliability under stringent latency constraints. Considering the packet delivery process comprising ground-toair (G2A) and air-to-space (A2S) phases from users to low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, a comprehensive reliability metric termed latency-constrained packet dropping rate (LCPDR) is introduced, which jointly captures packet losses induced by transmission errors, timeout violations, and buffer overflows. To further enhance reliability, retransmission is employed during packet delivery. An optimization problem of dynamic subchannel, time slot and power allocation is formulated to minimize the LCPDR. To solve the problem, a two-stage proximal policy optimization (TS-PPO) algorithm is proposed to decouple G2A and A2S resource allocations, thereby reducing computational complexity relative to conventional joint allocation. Moreover, a hierarchical deployment architecture and a leader UAV election mechanism are developed for efficient agent deployment. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a lower LCPDR than other benchmark algorithms, confirming its effectiveness."

In this paper, we propose an experience-driven spatial-temporal graph attention network (Exp-STGAN) for UDs’ clustering, by exploiting the spatial-temporal correlations from UDs’ historical traffic flows. Considering the UDs’ heterogeneity, we first characterize each UD’s out-going traffic flows by a dynamic radiation pattern, which reflects the UD’s spatial distribution of traffic demands and its targeted receivers in different directions. We aim to explore UDs’ clustering based on traffic flows’ radiation patterns and propose a spatial-temporal graph attention to aggregate information from different UDs correlated in space and time domains. Without true labels for the UDs’ clustering, we formulate a flow similarity metric based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to quantify the clustering performance. Moreover, to improve the learning efficiency, we integrate salient human experience into the graph attention module and also continuously update the experience during the training process. Experiments demonstrate that the Exp-STGAN framework can effectively cluster similar UDs by their dynamic traffic flows, highlighting the potential for flow-aware network performance maximization in large-scale IoT systems."

    "abstract": "The space-air-ground integrated network(SAGIN), as a core architecture of 6G communications, provides ubiquitous coverage for high-reliability and low-latency scenarios such as industrial Internet and autonomous driving. However, its dynamic environment faces multiple challenges, including resource competition between heterogeneous space-ground services, rapid topology changes, and Doppler shifts. To address the issues of delay jitter and queue congestion caused by mixed transmission of time-triggered (TT) and event-triggered (ET) services in time-sensitive networking (TSN), this paper proposes an analytical framework based on queuing theory with setup periods and multiple working vacations. This framework systematically analyzes the transmission dynamics of mixed services in space-air-ground integrated channels. By constructing a micro-level parameter coupling model, the regulatory effects of the setup period parameter on state transition efficiency, the influence mechanism of the vacation period parameter on resource release cycles, and the dynamic correlation between packet arrival rates and busy period ratios are revealed. The results demonstrate that traditional TSN static resource allocation strategies exhibit multi-dimensional mismatches in space-air-ground scenarios, necessitating dynamic scheduling algorithms to optimize time window orchestration and priority preemption mechanisms. The theoretical model proposed in this paper provides novel insights for adaptive resource scheduling in space-air-ground integrated networks, advancing TSN from fixed-topology systems to space-ground collaborative architectures. This work lays a technical foundation for realizing the 6G vision of \"ubiquitous coverage and on-demand service.\""

Our solution is suitable for typical FL applications where users employ the same model structure and quantization precision to train their local models.

We formulate an upload delay minimization problem considering the transmission power and model accuracy constraints for a frequency division multiple access (FDMA) system due to its popularity. Since the problem is difficult to solve directly, we reformulate the problem under some mild relaxations that are useful to simplify the problem without violating the goal of timely model upload in wireless FL. We develop a simple algorithm to find the optimal solution and present simulation results to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method in comparison with some benchmark schemes."

    "abstract": "The prediction of fertilization rates is a critical area of research in the agricultural field and is essential for ensuring global food security. With the ongoing expansion of the global population and the escalating repercussions of climate change, precise crop fertilization rate predictions have become paramount. This is because accurate predictions can optimize resource allocation and improve agricultural productivity. Moreover, they can provide scientific support for policy-making and agricultural input management, thereby promoting sustainable agricultural development. Despite its importance, the complexity of agricultural systems, which is influenced by multiple factors including climate, geography, soil conditions, and management practices, poses significant challenges to prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that effectively incorporates geographical knowledge and multi-dimensional feature information. By modeling spatial relationships through graph structures (nodes and edges), our framework enhances fertilization rate prediction accuracy. We validate the model using two datasets of different scales. The results demonstrate excellent predictive performance across all datasets and strong scalability, highlighting its potential for agricultural fertilization rate prediction."

    "abstract": "Terahertz (THz) communication systems suffer severe blockage issues, which may significantly degrade the communication coverage and quality. Bending beams, capable of adjusting their propagation direction to bypass obstacles, have recently emerged as a promising solution to resolve this issue by engineering the propagation trajectory of the beam. However, traditional bending beam generation methods rely heavily on the specific geometric properties of the propagation trajectory and can only achieve sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a new and general bending beamforming method by adopting the convex optimization techniques. In particular, we formulate the bending beamforming design as a max-min optimization problem, aiming to optimize the analog or digital transmit beamforming vector to maximize the minimum received signal power among all positions along the bending beam trajectory. However, the resulting problem is non-convex and difficult to be solved optimally. To tackle this difficulty, we apply the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution. Numerical results show that our proposed bending beamforming method outperforms the traditional method and shows robustness to the obstacle in the environment."

This paper presents a quality-efficiency driven scheduling and process co-optimization (SPCO) methodology for the pick-and-place (PAP) process in SMT production lines. Leveraging a cyber-physical system framework integrated with automated optical inspection, the proposed approach dynamically couples offline scheduling with online process capability feedback to achieve adaptive allocation of components. A precision-aware SPCO model is formulated to assign components to placement heads based on real-time process capability indices, ensuring compliance with stringent precision constraints. To enable real-time deployment, a precision-prioritized allocation heuristic (PPAH) is introduced, supporting component-head assignments under heterogeneous head capabilities. Experiments on industrial datasets demonstrate that PPAH completely eliminates precision violations while improving the overall process capability margin by 2.6-fold compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks, with only a moderate increase in total PAP time. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed co-optimization strategy in improving first-pass yield and robustness in high-mix SMT environments."

    "abstract": "As the number of model parameters grows dramatically, Split Learning (SL) has attracted widespread attention from both academia and industry. In contrast to traditional Federated Learning, SL uses a layer-by-layer training strategy in which users only need to train part of the model, thereby significantly reducing their resource overhead. Additionally, SL relies solely on intermediate activations during training, helping to some extent to mitigate the risk of raw data leakage. However, recent research has shown that even transmitting intermediate activations may still compromise user privacy. To solve this problem, several approaches have been proposed based on differential privacy or homomorphic encryption. However, there are still shortcomings in terms of security, robustness, and efficiency. For addressing these challenges, we propose a robust privacy-preserving SL framework. Specifically, we employ a threshold Paillier encryption scheme to protect users private data throughout the training process. Furthermore, our framework supports scenarios where users may go offline and remains resilient to collusion among users, thus improving overall system robustness. We also conduct a thorough security analysis and demonstrate through experiments that our solution achieves high accuracy and efficiency."

The sparse code-oriented schemes are highly valued because they are widely used in existing protocols, making their implementation require only minimal changes to current networks. However, drawbacks such as the heavy reliance on extrinsic feedback from powerful channel codes and the lack of transmission robustness pose obstacles to the development of sparse codes. To address these drawbacks, a novel sparse code structure based on a universally applicable power division strategy is proposed. Comprehensive numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Specifically, by employing the proposed power division method, which is derived analytically and does not require extensive simulations, a performance improvement of approximately 2.8 dB is achieved compared to schemes with identical channel code setups."

However, selecting an appropriate Post-Quantum Key Encapsulation Mechanism (PQ-KEM) is challenging due to varying performance metrics such as key generation time, encapsulation/decapsulation latency, and ciphertext overhead. This issue becomes particularly critical in VANETs, where vehicles and roadside units (RSUs) must rapidly and securely exchange data under dynamic network conditions. Current methods typically overlook the initial key distribution phase, leaving communications vulnerable at the earliest interaction. To address these challenges, we created an extensive, open-source benchmark dataset that rigorously evaluates several candidate PQ-KEM algorithms based on performance factors relevant to vehicular environments. Leveraging this benchmark, we developed a lightweight deep learning model that dynamically selects the most suitable PQ-KEM algorithm by predicting optimal performance considering security requirements and real-time conditions such as message size and network congestion. Each recommended PQ-KEM algorithm is authenticated using Dilithium-2 post-quantum signatures, ensuring secure and quantum-resilient initial key distribution between vehicles and RSUs. Our comprehensive simulations demonstrate that our adaptive PQ-KEM selector significantly reduces end-to-end latency and ciphertext overhead without compromising security, thus enhancing secure, efficient communication in VANET scenarios."

To overcome the inherent limitations of conventional single-clustering algorithms in handling complex temporal patterns and enhance robustness, a novel ensemble TSCL framework, integrating multi-metric fusion and diverse elastic distance functions, is proposed in this article. Initially, to extract multi-domain patterns, diverse base clusterers are fit for augmented time series sequences via diverse elastic distance measures, with the performance evaluated on the training subsets through multiple internal clustering validation metrics. Then, a multi-metric fusion scheme, leveraging entropy to balance the contributions of metrics, is introduced to assign adaptive weights to each clusterer, which are then incorporated into the construction of a weighted co-association matrix. To enhance the discriminative power of the similarity structure and generate robust consensus partitions, an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm with average linkage is applied to the refined distance matrix, which is transformed from the co-association matrix through a nonlinear mapping. Finally, the competitiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated via the comparative and ablative experiments on datasets from the UCR archive."

To address this issue, this paper proposes a simplified model of graph neural network based on combinatorial attention mechanism (GTNet) to reduce computational complexity and improve inference efficiency. This method adopts a Transformer based attention mechanism to model the relationship between images and text using a dynamic graph structure, thereby avoiding the high computational cost of Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNN). Firstly, we map the image scene and text problem to an initial weighted dynamic graph, in order to capture the inter modal correlation information through graph neural network (GNN). Subsequently, a combined attention mechanism is introduced to adaptively process each modality and its interactive features, in order to enhance the model's reasoning ability. Under the guidance of attention mechanism, the model can effectively filter out key semantic information by dynamically adjusting the edge weights in the graph structure. We conducted experiments on the public VQA dataset and the results showed that this method can maintain similar performance to complex hypergraph methods while reducing computational costs."

This work presents the first successful targeted misclassification attack against a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented on FPGA hardware, achieved by injecting a single clock glitch at the final layer (argmax) to manipulate the predicted output class. Our attack targets the commonly adopted argmax layer, a lightweight replacement for softmax in resource-constrained implementations. By precisely injecting a single clock glitch during the comparison phase of the argmax operation, the attack reliably induces misclassifications, forcing the model to 'skip' a specifically chosen class and output an incorrect label for it without affecting the computed scores of other classes. Unlike prior works that only cause random misclassifications, our attack achieves a high success rate of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$80-87 \\%$</tex> for a targeted class, without inducing collateral misclassifications of other classes.

High-gain directional holographic patterns can be generated by adjusting the amplitude responses of RHS elements. However, for XL-MIMO systems, the complexity of obtaining real-time channel state information (CSI) for beamforming is extremely high, especially when users are distributed in the near-field region of the RHS. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a one-shot multi-user beam training scheme with low complexity for large-scale RHS-assisted systems, which is applicable to both near-and far-field users. The proposed beam training scheme includes two phases that are performed simultaneously for all users: angle search and distance search. In the angle search phase, an RHS angular codebook is designed according to holographic principles. Each codeword in this codebook covers multiple angles in both the near-field and far-field regions, enabling simultaneous angular search for all users. For the distance search, by taking advantage of the additivity of holographic beamformers, we construct distance-adaptive codewords in real time, which can cover all the candidate angles of users. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves higher system throughput compared with traditional beam training schemes. The beam training accuracy approaches exhaustive search while significantly reducing the overhead."

    "abstract": "The rapid adoption of photovoltaic (PV) solar cells necessitates robust methods for anomaly detection and fault diagnosis to ensure optimal performance and longevity. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to identifying anomalies in PV solar cells using a combination of deep learning and machine learning techniques. We utilize a comprehensive dataset comprising 1191 validated images across two classes to train our model. We employ a Vision Transformer (ViT) model, specifically the ViT-B16 architecture, to extract high-dimensional features from PV cell images, achieving a training accuracy of 100% and a validation accuracy of 88.89%. Additionally, we explore the efficacy of Decision Tree classifier, which demonstrate exceptional performance with testing accuracies of 99.16%. Our results, validated through t-SNE visualizations and confusion matrices, highlight the potential of these methods in accurately detecting and classifying anomalies in PV systems. This study not only advances the field of PV anomaly detection but also provides a scalable and efficient framework for real-world applications."

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Transformers (VLTs) have achieved remarkable success, but their computational costs pose a challenge due to the large number of input tokens and extensive model parameters. Existing VLT compression methods primarily rely on single-modality-based token pruning or coarse-grained weight pruning techniques. However, these methods face significant obstacles, such as ignoring the critical alignment of different modalities and lacking the flexibility to dynamically compress each layer for token pruning, exhibiting inevitable performance degradation due to coarse-grained weight pruning, and struggling with the simultaneous compression of both input tokens and model parameters. To address those limitations, we propose MADTP++, a novel approach that integrates custom-made token and weight pruning processes into a unified framework, achieving superior compression in both parameter counts and computational costs. Specifically, for the token pruning process, we introduce the Multi-modality Alignment Guidance (MAG) module and the Dynamic Token Pruning (DTP) module to align semantic features across different modalities and guide the dynamic elimination of redundant tokens based on different input instances. For the weight pruning process, we propose a Hardware-aware Weight Pruning (HWP) module that leverages the Sparse Tensor Cores across diverse hardware setups to enable fine-grained parameter pruning within VLTs. To further unify token and weight pruning, we also propose a Cooperative Optimization Training Strategy that automatically assigns the required reduction in GFLOPs and Params to each branch before pruning and employs Knowledge Distillation Constraints to facilitate joint optimization of both pruning dimensions. Extensive experiments conducted on various VLT models and datasets demonstrate that MADTP++ can significantly reduce model parameters and computational costs while maintaining competitive performance.

    "abstract": "Functional electrical stimulation (FES) has emerged as a promising technique for motor rehabilitation, yet quantifying its effects remains challenging. While current assessment methods utilizing clinical scales, kinematic parameters, and biomarkers offer comprehensive evaluations, they fail to delineate the specific motor function domains influenced by FES, and quantify both therapeutic outcomes and functional improvements. To address these limitations, we introduced multi-objective decision analysis method to propose a novel multidimensional evaluation framework for assessing FES-driven motor performance under varying stimulation parameters. This study represents the first systematic analysis of the effects of different FES parameters on motor function from three dimensions: movement execution completeness, dynamic movement stability, and muscle fatigue. For this, we collected surface electromyogram (EMG) and inertial signals under different parameters of FES-driven wrist movements. As a result, we found a relationship between the FES stimulus parameters and different movement level features. Our findings demonstrate that completion indicators generally increased with increasing stimulus amplitude, while movement stability indicators showed an inverse relationship with stimulus frequency. Notably, fatigue indicators exhibited dual trends, reflecting different aspects of motor unit performance. Further analysis showed revealed that our proposed model was sensitive to changes in stimulus parameter conditions while maintaining consistent evaluation rankings as sample sizes increase. This work establishes a novel, cost-effective model and methodology to quantify motor function and stimulus effects during FES application, providing a crucial foundation for subsequent precise modulation of FES parameters and timely evaluation of rehabilitation progress."

    "abstract": "Low-order frequency response models for power systems have a decades-long history in optimization and control problems such as unit commitment, economic dispatch, and wide-area control. With a few exceptions, these models are built upon the Newtonian mechanics of synchronous generators, assuming that the frequency dynamics across a system are approximately homogeneous, and assume the dynamics of nodal voltages for most operating conditions are negligible, and thus are not directly computed at all buses. As a result, the use of system frequency models results in the systematic underestimation of frequency minimum nadir and maximum RoCoF, and provides no insight into the reactive power-voltage dynamics. This paper proposes a low-order model of both frequency and voltage response in grid-forming inverter-dominated power systems. The proposed model accounts for spatial-temporal variations in frequency and voltage behavior across a system and as a result, demonstrates the heterogeneity of frequency response in future renewable power systems. Electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations are used to validate the utility, accuracy, and computational efficiency of these models, setting the basis for them to serve as fast, scalable alternatives to EMT simulation, especially when dealing with very large-scale systems, for both planning and operational studies."

To better reflect practical deployment scenarios, the system model incorporates both geometry-induced blockage effects and imperfect channel state information (CSI). Aiming to enhance max-min fairness (MMF) among ground sensors, we formulate a joint optimization of the sensor transmit power, RSMA decoding order, and UAV hovering position. The resulting highly-coupled mixed-integer non-convex problem is challenging to solve. To tackle this, we develop a penalty-based successive convex approximation (SCA) framework that transforms the original problem into a sequence of efficiently solvable convex subproblems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RSMA scheme significantly outperforms conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) benchmarks in terms of max-min fairness, and robustness against CSI imperfections."

To achieve a balance between tremendous annotation burden and grounding performance, we propose a new Weakly Semi-supervised Temporal Sentence Grounding with Points (WSS-TSG-P) task, where the dataset comprises limited fully-annotated video-sentence pairs by start and end timestamps (full label) and a large amount of weakly-annotated pairs by a single point timestamp (point label). Based on this setting, we first introduce a point-tomoment1 regressor which converts point annotations to pseudo moment labels. To train a good regressor for reliable pseudo moment labels, we propose a point-guided feature aggregation module to aggregate cross-modal representations based on the prototype feature at the given point position. In addition, we propose to perform regressor self-training and design pseudo label generation strategies to exploit both full annotations and point annotations. All heterogeneous labels (full, pseudo moment, and point labels) are used to train a TSG backbone. In addition, we propose a novel point-guided group contrastive learning method by constructing reliable positive and negative sets and re-weighting pseudo moment labels to further improve the model performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets verify that our proposed method outperforms other semi-supervised learning methods and bridges the performance gap between weakly-supervised and fully-supervised learning methods in TSG."

First, hesitant fuzzy 2-tuple linguistic sets (HF2TLSs) are utilized to accurately capture DMs’ preferences in uncertain environments. Then, a Markov trust state transition model is developed to capture the dynamic evolution of trust relationships. Next, an enhanced PageRank algorithm, built on trust networks, is employed to determine the weights of DMs and subgroups, thereby improving decision quality. Additionally, multidimensional conflict detection indicators are introduced to quantify cognitive and interest conflicts among subgroups. Finally, an adaptive conflict resolution mechanism is presented to balance heterogeneous interests and achieve agreement. An illustrative example validates the model, with comparative analyses demonstrating its rationality and superiority."

The experimental evaluation compares three different metrics for pseudonym and Wi-Fi probe identifier association (Count, Statistical RSSI, and Pearson RSSI), demonstrating that the Pearson RSSI metric is better at tracking vehicles under pseudonym-changing schemes in all scenarios and against previous works. As an additional contribution to the state-of-the-art, we publicly release all implementations and simulation scenarios used in this work [1]."

Expressions for average AoI are rigorously derived for each scheme, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of the joint impacts of coding length, signal-to-noise ratio, and destination node quantity on system performance. Numerical simulation results show that the use of non-ARQ for the first hop can minimize average AoI under better channel conditions, while CARQ is suitable for scenarios with high reliability requirements, and truncated ARQ shows better overall performance when dealing with the trade-off between information timeliness and reliability."

Furthermore, cluster-centric CF-mMIMO system, which groups antennas and users into multiple clusters, was proposed to reduce computational complexity. However, inter-cluster interference (ICI) significantly degrades the link capacity. Additionally, the use of omnidirectional antennas in cluster-centric CF-mMIMO results in substantial optical mobile fronthaul load, making practical implementation challenging. To address these issues, this paper proposes an array-antenna-based cluster-centric CF-mMIMO system. The proposed CF-mMIMO system is compared with the omnidirectional-antenna-based CF-mMIMO system.

However, existing research predominantly focuses on computational methodologies, often overlooking the transmission mechanisms. In particular, quantization noise introduced during semantic compression and transmission severely impacts the fidelity and utility of the received data, which remains an unresolved issue. To address this challenge, we propose an Adversarial Learning-based Quantization Selective Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (ALQS-HARQ) mechanism tailored for semantic image transmission in remote sensing satellite networks. The proposed framework dynamically configures the number of quantization bits at the semantic encoder to enhance robustness against quantization noise. Furthermore, we design a quantized bitmerging retransmission scheme, equipped with an intelligent decision-making module and a standardized packet header. A novel metric is introduced to evaluate the semantic recovery completeness, guiding efficient retransmission. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed ALQS-HARQ mechanism achieves higher task success rates with reduced transmission overhead compared to conventional retransmission schemes, showcasing its superior efficiency and adaptability."

Furthermore, its performance on segmenting low-contrast targets is suboptimal, causing blurred or imprecise boundary delineation of subtle defects. Finally, the reliance on manual prompt inputs limits its suitability for the fully automated, high-efficiency inspection requirements of industrial production. To address these limitations, this study introduces the Industrial Defect-SAM (ID-SAM) for industrial defect segmentation. Initially, we incorporate expert knowledge and industrial process data to construct a structured prior knowledge base of defect patterns. This knowledge is then transformed into vectors via a Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) mechanism, enabling the model to utilize domain-specific knowledge for adaptive optimization. Subsequently, we employ the global feature fusion, integrating the prior knowledge vectors generated by CLIP with the raw features from the image encoder. This joint modeling approach, leveraging cross-modal alignment, enhances the segmentation accuracy of low-contrast targets. Finally, a CLIP-based semantic mechanism is designed that utilizes cross-modal semantic understanding to enable the model to automatically perceive target regions, eliminating the need for manual prompts, thereby improving inspection efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that the ID-SAM effectively enhances the segmentation accuracy of subtle defects and improves generalization capabilities across different process environments in semiconductor chip defect detection tasks."

This research proposes a modification of the Blum-Blum-Shub algorithm using multi-seed XOR and modulo order to improve randomness quality, pattern stability, and resistance to predictability in random number output. The evaluation is done through probability tests, distribution tests, entropy tests, and NIST statistical tests. Evaluation was conducted through probability tests, distribution tests, entropy tests, and NIST statistical tests. The results show that the modified algorithm can generate random numbers with a more balanced probability between 0 bits and 1 bits, totaling 50%; a uniform distribution without a dominant patterns; an entropy value very close to the maximum value (99.57%); and successfully passed 13 out of 14 types of NIST statistical tests (92.85%). Although the execution time is slower, the quality of randomness has improved significantly, making this algorithm a viable candidate for CSPRNG."

    "abstract": "Urban vegetation is crucial for environmental sustainability, particularly in the context of urbanisation, as it mitigates impacts. An accurate and timely evaluation of plant cover is essential for the effective planning and management of urban areas. By utilising the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Sentinel-2 satellite images, this research aims to develop and evaluate a model for predicting urban vegetation cover in Batu Bara Regency, Indonesia. The model incorporates the GEE cloud computing platform's exhaustive temporal and spatial coverage of Sentinel-2 data to forecast and map vegetation dynamics. Because of its durability and effectiveness in administering remote sensing data, the Random Forest (RF) method was implemented for the prediction procedure. A comparison of the predicted NDVI values with validation datasets was conducted to evaluate the model's efficacy using conventional metrics, including the Coefficient of Determination (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The model's R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> score was 0.85, and its root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.045, according to the assessment results. These metrics showcase a strong correlation between projected and actual NDVI values and a relatively low prediction error, which suggests that the model is highly reliable and accurate. Batu Bara Regency's vegetation cover prognosis map provides valuable insights into the geographical distribution and changes in urban greenery. This study demonstrates that the utilisation of GEE with Sentinel-2 NDVI data is a viable method for the monitoring and forecasting of urban vegetation cover. This information can be used to inform environmental decisions in the region. In the face of urbanisation and climate issues, the results provide a solid scientific foundation for local authorities and urban planners in Batu Bara Regency to devise evidence-based conservation plans that foster sustainable development."

In this paper, we investigate a distributed EH-enhanced MEC system consisting of multiple MEC servers and user mobile devices (MDs). The MEC servers, as service providers, inherently control the price and availability of resources. MDs reactively optimize their task offloading and battery energy management strategies. Considering the hierarchical structure and large optimization dimension of MEC, a Stackelberg game-based bi-level multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (BL-MADDPG) algorithm is proposed which treats the MD and joint MEC servers as follower and leader, respectively. Different from the parallel decision of conventional multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, the BL-MADDPG algorithm establishes a two-stage decision process and can achieve an energy efficient offloading strategy by taking MDs’ limited EH power into account. Simulation results are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme."

    "abstract": "In ship target detection tasks, challenges arise from heterogeneous ships, complex background interference, and weather conditions. Accurate ship target detection requires deep learning models with strong feature extraction and fusion capabilities. However, previous models still face limitations in addressing these challenges. Firstly, most traditional convolutional networks operate solely in the spatial domain, neglecting the rich global information present in the frequency domain. Additionally, effectively integrating features from different scales is beneficial, yet traditional multi-scale fusion methods typically rely on fixed encoder-decoder architectures, using simple cross-layer connections to integrate local and global features. To overcome these challenges, we propose MPN-YOLO, a network capable of capturing key information in both spatial and frequency domains. The network consists of three main components: a windmill convolution downsampling module, a lightweight space-frequency attention module, and a Multi-scale semantic feature fusion module. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed MPN-YOLO on public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to baseline models, MPN-YOLO achieves superior performance, with accuracy and mAP50-95 improving by 8.8% and 5.1%, respectively."

The model considers line-of-sight (LoS) conditions for both the Tx and receiver (Rx). At the Tx side, the feed antenna directs the beam toward the RIS, ensuring that at least one reflected ray from the center of the RIS reaches the Rx. The Rx captures the reflected rays arriving from the direction of the RIS. The statistical properties of the channel model for RIS-based beamforming in indoor scenarios are analyzed including path loss, delay power spectral density (PSD), and angular PSD. The statistical properties of the proposed channel model can well matched the channel measurements."

The proposed channel estimation method exploits LoRa packets’ preambles as pilot sequences, which enables semi-coherent detection with maximum ratio combining (MRC). The channel state information (CSI) acquisition and data detection are performed in a successive manner in time-of-arrival (ToA) order, where the channel estimation of an end device (ED) is enabled by the detected data of previous (in the ToA order) EDs in the network. To achieve the best channel estimation quality for each ED, we formulate and solve an optimization problem to maximize the preamble power to noise power ratio (PNR). Simulation results show that with the proposed preamble-based CSI acquisition method, massive MIMO LoRa networks can utilize MRC to detect overlapped and asynchronous packets from multiple EDs, at the cost of a reasonable deterioration in error performance as compared to the single ED case."

Most existing waterway perception models primarily focus on instance-level object perception paradigms (e.g., detection, segmentation). However, due to the complexity of waterway environments, current perception datasets and models fail to achieve global semantic understanding of waterways, limiting large-scale monitoring and structured log generation. With the advancement of vision-language models (VLMs), we leverage image captioning to introduce WaterCaption, the first captioning dataset specifically designed for waterway environments. WaterCaption focuses on fine-grained, multi-region long-text descriptions, providing a new research direction for visual geo-understanding and spatial scene cognition. Exactly, it includes 20.2k image-text pair data with 1.8 million vocabulary size. Additionally, we propose Da Yu, an edge-deployable multi-modal large language model for USVs, where we propose a novel vision-to-language projector called Nano Transformer Adaptor (NTA). NTA effectively balances computational efficiency with the capacity for both global and fine-grained local modeling of visual features, thereby significantly enhancing the model’s ability to generate long-form textual outputs. Da Yu achieves an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, surpassing state-of-the-art models on WaterCaption and several other captioning benchmarks.

    "abstract": "As vehicle automation levels rise, future automated driving systems can enable drivers to engage in nondriving-related tasks (NDRTs). However, drivers remain responsible for driving safety. In the case of an automated vehicle failure, a driver must disengage from their NDRTs and take control of the vehicle. When fully engaged in NDRTs during Level 3 automation, NDRTs can compete for the resources for driving tasks, thereby depriving cognitive and physical readiness. This study investigated how compromised driver readiness affected takeover performance in situations with varying urgency levels. A simulated driving experiment was conducted with 32 participants in four states of readiness deprivation created through NDRT assignment, and two time budget levels were applied to represent multiple urgency scenarios. First, subjective ratings on readiness deprivation showed that depriving drivers of one form of readiness (i.e., cognitive or physical) adversely affected the other. Furthermore, retaining cognitive readiness may provide greater self-assessed utility. The NDRTs with similar interaction attributes generate comparable readiness deprivation ratings, offering a systematic way to evaluate their impact on takeover. Then, the impact of readiness deprivation on takeover performance varied significantly based on time budgets. With ample time, depriving drivers of physical or full readiness increased takeover time. However, these delayed actions, combined with stable lateral control, suggested a safe takeover strategy aimed at readiness recovery. Conversely, limited time hindered this recovery. Drivers performed takeovers despite impaired readiness, resulting in quicker but often abrupt post-takeover lateral movements. Notably, takeover actions were initiated once both cognitive and physical readiness were achieved, regardless of the time budget."

    "abstract": "The growing demand for eXplainable AI (XAI) has renewed interest in fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) due to their interpretability, causal transparency, and hybrid intelligence capabilities. However, current FCM explanation methods either overlook their dynamic behavior or limit themselves to feature attribution. Counterfactual explanations, which describe the minimal input changes required to alter outcomes, address this gap but remain largely unexplored in these models. The only existing FCM-specific approach relies on fuzzy discretization and predefined rules, producing causally invalid and overly conservative explanations. On the other hand, generic model-agnostic methods assume feature independence and suffer from instability, restrictive assumptions, and high computational costs. To overcome these limitations, this article presents the counterfactuals via the backpropagation (CF-BP) algorithm, a first backpropagation-based counterfactual explanation method for quasi-nonlinear FCMs (q-FCMs), which is a generalization of traditional FCMs that resolves convergence issues. CF-BP exploits the similarity between q-FCMs’ recurrent reasoning and neural network forward propagation, using exact analytical gradients to generate precise, causally consistent, and robust counterfactual explanations within the continuous state space of the model. Extensive evaluations, including hyperparameter sensitivity analysis and benchmarking against eight state-of-the-art (SOTA) model-agnostic methods, confirm the superior performance of the proposed method across key counterfactual quality metrics."

To mitigate the inevitable overfitting issue during training, a risk correction method is introduced, leading to the development of a corrected risk estimator. The generalization error bounds of the unbiased risk estimator theoretically demonstrate the consistency of the proposed method.

Together, these metrics determine the overall effectiveness of the system and the competitiveness of the enterprise. To address the research gap, this study proposes a maintenance optimization method that jointly considers reliability and cost. In particular, a novel reliability assessment method is developed, incorporating both physical failures modeled and functional outputs that account for imperfect quality inspection. Moreover, considering rework and imperfect quality inspection, a cost analysis is performed for various operation modes of IMS. Further, a novel adaptive multi-objective particle swarm optimization with maintenance priority constraints (AMOPSO-P) method is developed to conduct the IMS control decision-making process, optimizing reliability and cost. Finally, to validate the proposed algorithm, we conduct a case study of China United Equipment Group on control decisions for a three-stage, four-station servo valve manufacturing system using simulations."

    "abstract": "The exponential growth of IoT devices presents critical challenges in bandwidth-constrained wireless networks, particularly regarding efficient data transmission and privacy preservation. This paper presents a novel federated semantic communication (SC) framework that enables collaborative training of bandwidth-efficient models for image reconstruction across heterogeneous IoT devices. By leveraging SC principles to transmit only semantic features, our approach dramatically reduces communication overhead while preserving reconstruction quality. We address the fundamental challenge of client selection in federated learning environments where devices exhibit significant disparities in dataset sizes and data distributions. Our framework implements three distinct client selection strategies that explore different trade-offs between system performance and fairness in resource allocation. The system employs an end-to-end SC architecture with semantic bottlenecks, coupled with a loss-based aggregation mechanism that naturally adapts to client heterogeneity. Experimental evaluation on image data demonstrates that while Utilitarian selection achieves the highest reconstruction quality, Proportional Fairness maintains competitive performance while significantly reducing participation inequality and improving computational efficiency. These results establish that federated SC can successfully balance reconstruction quality, resource efficiency, and fairness in heterogeneous IoT deployments, paving the way for sustainable and privacy-preserving edge intelligence applications."

    "abstract": "Cell-free architectures with distributed access points (APs) offer great potential for joint communication and sensing, yet they suffer from stringent synchronization requirements for coherent operation. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a cell-free millimeter-wave (mmWave) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework specifically tailored for drone detection. The design leverages a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to enable a novel delay-synchronized scheme: instead of fully synchronizing every AP, this study only estimates and compensates the propagation delays from each AP to the RIS via an RIS-based closed-loop calibration. This partial synchronization ensures that multi-AP signals arrive with phase aligned at the RIS, enabling coherent sensing beams even for a moving drone. The RIS reflects these combined beams toward the drone, and a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) detector at the receiver processes the returned echoes for drone presence. Simulation results confirm that the proposed delay-synchronized, RIS-assisted approach achieves significantly improved detection accuracy compared to baseline architectures that are RIS-free or unsynchronized, thereby providing a promising solution for robust drone detection in next-generation cell-free networks."

However, traditional channel attention mechanisms for CSI feedback heavily rely on global pooling methods, which overlook finer-grained statistical patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel CSI feedback scheme for massive MIMO systems by utilizing a differentiable histogram attention mechanism, named DHANet, to boosts channel feature extraction and improve system performance. Specifically, DHANet replaces the traditional global pooling operations in the Squeeze-and-Excitation Block with kernel density estimation (KDE)-based differentiable histogram feature extraction, thereby enabling the capture of detailed channel-specific statistical information for more efficient CSI feedback. Moreover, the proposed mechanism can be seamlessly integrated into the existing CSI feedback architectures. Simulation results demonstrate that the DHANet achieves superior performance compared to the traditional pooling-based methods, particularly under 1/8 compression rates, highlighting its significant potential for CSI feedback in massive MIMO systems."

When using error correction code (ECC), the signal constellation that maximizes the minimum Euclidean distance, such as quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), is not always optimal. For example, set partitioning is often utilized in higher-order modulation schemes. On the other hand, nonlinear iterative signal detection of PDA has been shown to efficiently suppress interference and to reduce the bit error rate (BER) compared to traditional minimum mean square error (MMSE) spatial filtering. However, PDA may degrade detection performance due to outliers in the expected value of transmitted signals. To solve these complicated issues, the proposed WAE retrieves the best signal constellation using the NN modulator, and simultaneously mitigates outliers in the expected value by introducing scaling factors optimized by DU in the PDA detector."

A dedicated foot-mounted inertial measurement system is introduced to streamline fingerprint database construction by enabling efficient sparse data acquisition through collaborative smartphone-device interactions. The developed LSTM-Attention framework demonstrates superior performance in initial position matching precision, accelerated model convergence, and enhanced trajectory consistency through adaptive feature weighting. Comprehensive evaluations across multi-story academic and office environments reveal pedestrian localization accuracy within 1.5 meters (horizontal) and floor discrimination success rates exceeding 95%, thereby advancing the state-of-the-art in smartphone-based 3D indoor positioning systems."

Initially, an auxiliary state space model of the tracking error is formulated by exploiting the minimal polynomials of the reference and disturbance signals. Subsequently, an implicitly constrained optimization problem is constructed, eliminating the need for explicit modeling of the unmeasurable disturbance. The minimal polynomial framework enables the transformation of the original problem into an explicit constrained optimization problem by linking past and predicted control inputs. Finally, the coordinate descent method is employed to iteratively solve the constrained optimization problem, enabling the successful deployment of the proposed controller on 10kHz high-speed hardware. Experimental results indicate that the proposed DR-MPC method exhibits substantial advantages regarding disturbance rejection, constraint handling, and dynamic tracking."

By integrating a residual convolution block attention module, the extracted features are weighted and optimized along both the “channel dimension” and the “spatial dimension,” facilitating the aggregation of key features while suppressing redundant information. Spatial convolution is utilized to extract spatial features across various electrode channels, followed by the application of a self-attention mechanism to capture global dependencies. Experimental findings illustrate that, within the realm of subject-specific evaluation, this framework attained a classification accuracy of 83.39 % on the BCI-IV-2a dataset.

We conduct a first-of-its-kind case study on a state-of-the-art (SOTA) CoWoS interposer system as follows. First, we carefully devise EM-based HTs for the interposer's power delivery network (PDN), a prime target for such HTs. Second, we confirm the HTs' disruptive effects, triggered by EM mechanisms, via SOTA physics-based FEM simulations. Third, we systematically evaluate the conditions under which these HTs remain hidden within the PDN, via commercial tooling for X-ray simulations. We find that our HTs can reduce mean time to failure (MTTF) by two orders of magnitude, while remaining hidden in over 88% of exposures during careful 360-degree X-ray inspection, even under best-case detection conditions, and even for large HTs exploiting upto 97% of the interconnect's width. Ultimately, we find that our HTs represent a practical and severe threat, necessitating further efforts for supply-chain assurance."

    "abstract": "Vehicle trajectory prediction is a key technology in autonomous driving systems, playing a decisive role in ensuring autonomous driving safety and improving traffic efficiency. In complex traffic environments, the dynamic interactions between vehicles and pedestrians are extremely intricate, posing great challenges for accurate trajectory prediction. Traditional physical models exhibit obvious limitations when facing the nonlinear behaviors of traffic participants, while existing deep learning methods, although improved to some extent, still struggle to meet the practical application requirements in terms of computational efficiency and multimodal prediction capabilities. To address this, this paper proposes a novel vehicle trajectory prediction method based on Group-Rational KAN Enhanced Motion Transformer (GR-KAMT). This method combines the nonlinear modeling capability of the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with the attention mechanism of Transformer, effectively enhancing the trajectory prediction ability for complex scenes. Its uniqueness lies in the introduction of the efficient GR-KAN module, which demonstrates higher efficiency and accuracy in handling complex data relationships compared to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), while supporting multimodal trajectory prediction to more comprehensively capture the behavioral patterns of traffic participants. Experiments on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate that GR-KAMT significantly outperforms existing methods in key performance indicators such as minimum average displacement error (minADE) and minimum final displacement error (minFDE), providing reliable support for safe decision-making in autonomous driving."

    "abstract": "Agriculture is crucial for food production and rural economies, yet pest infestations significantly reduce crop yields. Traditional pest management heavily relies on manual monitoring and expert experience, limiting its automation potential. While recent advances in automated pest detection have improved early identification, integrating expert knowledge to support automated decision-making remains challenging. To address these challenges, this study proposes an intelligent diagnostic framework integrating object detection, retrieval-augmented technology, and Large Language Models (LLMs). In the object detection stage, a customized YOLOv8 model is optimized through data augmentation and an Adaptive Feature Pyramid Network, achieving pest identification and lightweight optimization. Subsequently, automated online retrieval technology extracts relevant pest control information, while a locally deployed DeepSeek LLM analyzes, filters, and summarizes the retrieved content to generate professional recommendations. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the framework. In the information processing stage, retrieval-augmented LLMs effectively mitigate the \"hallucination\" phenomenon, significantly enhancing the professionalism and credibility of generated recommendations. Concurrently, the optimized object detection stage achieves remarkable results. On the Pest24 dataset, the improved YOLOv8 model demonstrates a significant performance boost, with mAP@0.5 increasing by 13%, model size reducing by 30%, and an inference speed of 275 FPS. Compared to standalone LLM-based systems, our proposed intelligent diagnostic framework demonstrates enhanced decision-making reliability through multi-stage collaborative optimization, addressing both model hallucination and detection efficiency.

However, due to complex marine environmental factors such as wave motion and tidal effects, it’s challenging to accurately model its channel characteristics. Therefore, this paper conducted a wideband shore-to-ship channel measurement experiment with 4 GHz frequency and 100 MHz bandwidth. To deeply analyze the impact of waves and tides on the channel, a ship attitude recorder was introduced for the first time to capture the real-time attitude information of the ship. Based on the measured data and combined with the Kirchhoff approximation theory, a path loss model in the nearshore area was established and proved better than the fitting effect of the two-ray model. Moreover, the delay spread of the channel was analyzed, showing that its 90% value is within 185.64 ns. The paper contributes to the development of a more realistic and detailed model of dynamic maritime channels."

Although the Indonesian government has developed the food estate program, its implementation has encountered various conflicts that have led to failures. Therefore, precise and structured planning is needed to prevent potential negative impacts. To enhance food production in Kalimantan, it is essential to understand the factors that influence production volume, one of which is harvest area. This study aims to analyze the correlation between harvest area and food production, as well as to compare the performance of the Linear Regression and Random Forest algorithms in predicting food production in Kalimantan. The research data was obtained from the official website of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Indonesia, consisting of time-series data on harvest area and production of rice and secondary crops from 1970 to 2023. The correlation analysis results indicate that harvest area significantly affects food production, and the Random Forest model produces lower MAE and RMSE values and higher R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> values compared to the Linear Regression model.

    "abstract": "The rapid development of digital technology has made social media more accessible to all. Through these platforms, users can interact and communicate freely. Freedom of speech, especially in commenting on content, is often misused by irresponsible parties to mock, insult, spread hate speech, and make negative statements related to religion, race, ethnicity, physical and sexual elements known as cyberbullying. This phenomenon raises concerns because it can have a negative impact on the victim. The variety of words in these comments makes the cyberbullying detection process more complex. Therefore, it is important to develop a system that is able to recognize online bullying comments. This research introduces a system designed in the form of chrome extension that implements K-Nearest Neighbor and TF-IDF algorithms to detect and classify cyberbullying comments on social media content. The dataset used consists of 4574 Indonesian comments from TikTok application. Evaluation using Confusion Matrix shows an accuracy rate of 79% in detection and classification based on religion, race, ethnicity, physical, and sexual categories with 91% accuracy. The system shows strong performance in detecting cyberbullying that is often ignored by moderation systems."

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight linear model architecture termed ELinear. By introducing the Linear Channel Fusion module (LCF), the Frequency-domain Multi-Period Awareness mechanism (FMPA) and the Residual Period Fusion module (RPF), we enhance the prediction accuracy of linear models.

Traditional fusion methods rely on handcrafted features such as gradients or contrasts, which usually make it difficult to distinguish between focused and defocus areas in complex scenes, while deep learning methods often produce artifacts or lose details in transition areas.FADFNet overcomes these challenges by integrating three key components: the Focus Attention (FA) block, which captures pixel-level global dependencies and dynamically adjusts feature importance through an adaptive attention mechanism; the Dual-Feature Adaptive (DA) block, which employs a bidirectional structure to globally weight and embed focused pixels, thereby enhancing focused region features; and the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), which modulates near- and far-focus feature maps to produce a high-resolution fused images. The experimental results show that FADFNet is superior to existing methods in terms of fusion quality."

By fusing feature vectors from both CNN and ViT pathways and then analyzing them through the LSTM module, the model is able to comprehensively understand texture, global context, and temporal changes.

    "abstract": "Spaceborne SAR ship detection relies on deep learning algorithms, but practical deployment necessitates Incremental Learning (IL) due to continuous introduction of new data domains (e.g., sensors, scenes). Traditional methods, such as costly full retraining or fine-tuning, are inefficient; the latter commonly suffers from catastrophic forgetting on historical data. To overcome this, this research proposes a novel CycleGAN-based incremental SAR image domain adaptation method for Domain Incremental Learning (DIL). First, the SAR Incremental Ship Detection Dataset (SAR-ISDD) was compiled, comprising 31,275 images across six phases, simulating domain shifts via dualdimensional partitioning (sensor type and scene context). The core method uses a CycleGAN to generate transition-domain pseudoimages that fuse features from initial and incremental domains. Integrating this generation with knowledge distillation creates a lightweight DIL framework that effectively mitigates domain shift and preserves knowledge. Experiments show the model significantly improves incremental domain performance (mAP<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">50</inf> of 77.5%, a 4.1 percentage point gain) while successfully minimizing knowledge decay in the initial domain (mAP<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">50</inf> decreased by only 1.9 percentage points), confirming its efficacy for fast, robust model updates."

Compared with the two dimension multiple signal classification(2D-MUSIC) and two dimension conventional beamforming(2D-CBF), the proposed algorithm does not require multi-dimensional peak search and complex matrix computations, significantly reducing computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves comparable estimation accuracy to the two classical algorithms, with significantly lower computational complexity by several orders of magnitude."

    "abstract": "Prevalent semantic segmentation methods generally adopt a vanilla classifier to categorize each pixel into specific classes. Although such a classifier learns global information from the training data, this information is represented by a set of fixed parameters (weights and biases). However, each image has a different class distribution, which prevents the classifier from addressing the unique characteristics of individual images. At the dataset level, class imbalance leads to segmentation results being biased towards majority classes, limiting the model's effectiveness in identifying and segmenting minority class regions. In this paper, we propose an Extended Context-Aware Classifier (ECAC) that dynamically adjusts the classifier using global (dataset-level) and local (image-level) contextual information. Specifically, we leverage a memory bank to learn dataset-level contextual information of each class, incorporating the class-specific contextual information from the current image to improve the classifier for precise pixel labeling. Additionally, a teacher-student network paradigm is adopted, where the domain expert (teacher network) dynamically adjusts contextual information with ground truth and transfers knowledge to the student network. Comprehensive experiments illustrate that the proposed ECAC can achieve state-of-the-art performance across several datasets, including ADE20K, COCO-Stuff10K, and Pascal-Context."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Current knowledge distillation methods typically require significant computational resources and time to train task-specific teacher candidates from scratch and identify the optimal teacher. Although self-distillation methods eliminate the dependency on the teacher by allowing the student model to learn independently, they face two challenges: the student learns correct and incorrect knowledge indiscriminately, and the student's learning scope is limited due to the lack of external teacher supervision. Spurred by these deficiencies, this work proposes a CLIP-enhanced Self-Distillation (CLIP-SD) method to overcome these problems, while almost not increasing training time. CLIP-SD comprises two main components: Prediction-oriented Self-Distillation (PSD) and Two-stage Task-guided CLIP Distillation (TTCD). PSD tackles the first challenge by assigning higher and lower weights to correct and incorrect prediction samples, respectively, during self-distillation. This component forces the student to focus on correct knowledge and minimize the impact of incorrect knowledge. Regarding the second challenge, the robust CLIP model is directly introduced into self-distillation. However, CLIP lacks task-specific knowledge and its output is overly smooth during the distillation process, prohibiting the student from learning more effectively. Therefore, TTCD refines CLIP's output through a two-stage process, endowing it with task-specific knowledge to enhance student learning. Experimental results indicate that CLIP-SD significantly improves distillation performance while maintaining training efficiency comparable to self-distillation. Specifically, on the CIFAR-100 dataset, the performance of CLIP-SD reaches 72.48% when trained with ResNet20 as the student model, which is an average improvement of 2.54% and 1.12% over the knowledge distillation and self-distillation methods. Regarding training time, CLIP-SD takes 3.91 hours, an average decrease of 2.73 hours compared to knowledge distillation and an average increase of 0.45 hours compared to self-distillation. Despite the slight increase in training time compared to self-distillation, the overhead is worthwhile and negligible considering its performance improvement."

    "abstract": "The advancement of generative artificial intelligence has led to the creation of more diverse and realistic fake facial images. This poses serious threats to personal privacy and can contribute to the spread of misinformation. Existing deepfake detection methods usually utilize prior knowledge about forged clues to design complex modules, achieving excellent performance in the intra-domain settings. However, their performance usually suffers from a significant decline in unseen forgery patterns. It is thus desirable to develop a generalized deepfake detection method using a neat network structure. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient framework to transfer a powerful large-scale vision model like ViT to the downstream deepfake detection task, namely the generalized deepfake detection framework (GenDF). Concretely, we first propose a deepfake-specific representation learning (DSRL) scheme to learn different discontinuity patterns across patches inside a fake facial image and continuity between patches within a real counterpart in a low-dimensional space. To further alleviate the distribution mismatch between generic real images and human facial images consisting of both real and fake, we introduce a feature space redistribution (FSR) scheme to separately optimize the distributions of real and fake feature space, enabling the model to learn more distinctive representations. Furthermore, to enhance the generalization performance on unseen forgery patterns produced by constantly evolving facial manipulation techniques and diverse variations on real faces, we propose a classification-invariant feature augmentation (CIFAug) function without trainable parameters. CIFAug expands the scopes of real and fake feature space along directions orthogonal to the classification direction, enabling the model to learn more generalizable features while preserving discrimination. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance in cross-domain and cross-manipulation settings with only 0.28M trainable parameters."

Specifically, the attack surface expands across all phases of the network slicing lifecycle, as well as within and between Network Slices (NSs). The standardized Network Functions (NFs) for network slicing security focus on NS management, identifier protection, and authentication of both NSs and User Equipment (UE). Nevertheless, authenticated UEs may still be impersonated at runtime, posing persistent threats to network slicing. To address this issue, this paper introduces a security-by-design NF that enables the detection of malicious UEs in network slicing environments.

By establishing a multi-objective optimization model, which incorporates UAV-related metrics such as signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), interference-to-noise ratio (INR), and adjacent channel interference power ratio (ACIR), a downtilt angle adjustment strategy is formulated for UAVs in different application scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that reasonable downtilt angle adjustments not only optimize the performance of UAV systems but also effectively reduce interference to IMT systems."

In this paper, we investigate the physical layer security enhancement of a multi-user satellite downlink transmission system assisted by hybrid reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. We aim to maximize the weighted sum secrecy rate (WSSR) of the satellite downlink transmission link subject to power constraints at both the satellite and the hybrid RIS. To resolve this non-convex optimization challenge, we propose an effective alternating optimization (AO) scheme by using the successive convex approximation (SCA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to jointly optimize the transmit beamforming matrix of the satellite and the reflection coefficient matrix of the hybrid RIS. Simulation results demonstrate the superior advantage of hybrid RIS in enhancing the secrecy performance of the satellite communication system when compared with the baseline schemes."

This paper investigates graph coloring-based frequency allocation methods for interference mitigation (IM) of mega LEO satellite communication (SatCom) systems. We reveal the characteristics of MAGS interference pattern and formulate the IM problem of mega LEO systems into a K-coloring problem using an adaptive threshold method.

    "abstract": "To address the limitations of conventional reservoir computing (RC), where linear output layers often constrain discriminative capability, this paper proposes a Random Forest-Driven Photonic Reservoir Computing (RF-RC) architecture. The physical reservoir is constructed using a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) with optical feedback, which enables high-dimensional temporal input expansion and tunable memory through masking and virtual node techniques. At the output layer, a random forest is introduced as a nonlinear ensemble decoder. This approach enhances discrimination and robustness by leveraging random feature subspaces, utilizes out-of-bag error for unbiased performance evaluation and hyperparameter selection, and facilitates interpretable analysis of reservoir representations via feature importance. Evaluations on benchmark signal modulation recognition tasks demonstrate that RF-RC outperforms representative methods in both accuracy and stability. The architecture combines physical implementation friendliness, low power consumption, and strong generalization capability, providing a deployable technical pathway for photonic-brain-inspired computing toward edge intelligence."

    "abstract": "In near-Earth space, magnetic field information may exhibit similarity across different locations, implying that single-point positioning cannot be achieved merely by using geomagnetic information. However, a correspondence exists between the correlation of geomagnetic fields and the continuity of motion trajectories. Therefore, building upon the initial navigation information provided by inertial navigation systems (INS), high-precision navigation and positioning can be realized by performing correlation matching between real-time measured geomagnetic sequences along the trajectory and pre-stored geomagnetic maps. High-precision navigation without GNSS presents significant challenges, and geomagnetic field-aided inertial navigation serves as one potential solution. The classical Magnetic Contour Matching (MAGCOM) algorithm’s effectiveness depends on its search area, which is typically fixed, resulting in limited algorithm flexibility. Meanwhile, the traditional Iterative Closest Contour Point (ICCP) algorithm demands high sensor performance, exhibits poor noise tolerance, and suffers from computational complexity and inadequate real-time performance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an inertial/geomagnetic integrated navigation algorithm based on geomagnetic maps. The complete algorithm consists of four key stages: initial position determination, coarse matching, fine matching, and integrated filtering. Firstly, the point on the contour line closest to the INS-indicated starting position is selected as the search center. This approach significantly reduces subsequent computational workload while ensuring matching reliability. During coarse matching, contour constraints are employed to limit the search area, thereby improving matching efficiency. The Mean Absolute Difference (MAD) algorithm serves as the correlation criterion for matching. Although coarse matching reduces the computational burden, residual errors from inertial calculations persist and may degrade positioning accuracy. The fine matching process further constrains inertial navigation error accumulation through additional contour line constraints. The refined matching results are then input as position observations into a State Transformation Extended Kalman Filter (ST-EKF) to correct system parameters, with the final output representing the algorithm’s ultimate navigation solution. To evaluate the algorithm’s performance, experimental validation was conducted on a UAV platform. The tests were performed along predefined flight paths within a designated area at altitudes of 450 meters, 260 meters, and 70 meters, respectively. The obtained average position estimation errors were 72.0 meters, 25.1 meters, and 21.9 meters, meeting the requirements for typical UAV autonomous navigation and positioning. The proposed algorithm demonstrates superior performance over two classical geomagnetic matching navigation algorithms in most evaluation metrics, offering a viable solution for long-endurance positioning in GNSS-denied environments."

However, manually classifying publications into the 17 SDG categories is inefficient and prone to inconsistency. This paper proposes an automated SDG classification framework based on the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, combining semantic retrieval using ChromaDB with generative reasoning via GPT-4. The system was applied to 13,511 publication titles from Universitas Telkom covering the period 2016 to 2024. The model transforms publication titles into vector representations, retrieves the top relevant SDG descriptions, and classifies the titles accordingly. Experimental evaluation shows that the RAG-based model achieved an accuracy of 80%, outperforming a traditional keyword-based classification approach that obtained 65% accuracy. These results indicate that the proposed RAG framework is effective in improving the automation of SDG classification, particularly for abstract or interdisciplinary research output"

    "abstract": "Accurate demand forecasting for products in the parts supply chain system (PSCS) is critical for enterprises to optimize production and inventory operations. To address the challenges of inadequate modeling of complex inter-product relationships and the limited accuracy of existing forecasting methods, this paper proposes a demand forecasting method based on a Graph Convolutional and LSTM Network with Embedded Multi-Head Self-Attention (GL-MHSA). The method first extracts hybrid distance features, including Euclidean and pattern distances, from product sales data in the PSCS to mine product associations and construct graph-structured relational data. A Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is then used to capture structural association features among products, while an LSTM network models the temporal dependencies in the demand sequences. The extracted features are fused through a Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) mechanism to obtain a comprehensive feature representation. This representation is concatenated with other auxiliary features to form the final input for demand prediction. Experimental results on an automotive PSCS dataset show that the proposed GL-MHSA model achieves more accurate modeling of product associations and significantly improves demand forecasting performance compared to existing approaches."

To address this, we propose LiteFBD, a resource-efficient FL framework that integrates lightweight CNN design and Federated Block-wise Knowledge Distillation (FBD). The first stage constructs a compact model by balancing width and depth based on a golden width-depth ratio, reducing both computation and communication overhead. The second stage employs block-wise knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge from a high-capacity server model to smaller client models. This enables clients to collaboratively train a model without sharing raw data, instead transmitting only intermediate representations and model updates. Through comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet, we demonstrate that LiteFBD reduces computation and communication overhead by up to 7× while achieving comparable or superior accuracy to baseline FL methods."

    "abstract": "The aero-engine, as the core system of an aircraft, has its performance degradation directly affecting flight safety. Accurate life prediction is crucial for its safe and stable operation. Different performance degradation modes of the engine and the trajectory differences under their impacts are one of the challenges faced in achieving universal modeling for life prediction and improving high-impact prediction accuracy. To address the above challenges, a method for adaptive timescale clustering of engine performance degradation trajectories under multiple fault modes and self-matching model life prediction is proposed. First, leveraging the advantage of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in measuring the similarity of curves with variable time scales, it is integrated with the K-Medoids method suitable for time-series clustering to achieve clustering of similar trajectories and performance degradation modes unaffected by trajectory length. Then, a life prediction model based on Informer is designed, utilizing its multi-head self-attention mechanism to autonomously mine sensor parameters sensitive to performance degradation and beneficial to life prediction, and to address the accuracy improvement challenge faced by medium and long-term life prediction. Verified by the C-MAPSS dataset, the proposed method has improved prediction accuracy by 25.04% compared with prediction methods without performance degradation path identification, and it has significant accuracy advantages over traditional deep learning prediction models such as LSTM and GRU."

    "abstract": "The radar interferometric absolute phase is considered essential for estimating topography and displacements. However, the conventional definition—that absolute phase is proportional to the range difference—cannot be applied to general targets. Here, a universal observational definition is proposed, which is easiest to describe for differential interferometry: The absolute phase is determined by temporally unwrapping the phase as the intermediate secondary acquisition time sweeps from the primary to the secondary acquisition time. This absolute phase is typically not directly observable because a continuous series of observations is required. The absolute phase of a point target is proportional to the range difference, matching the conventional definition. For general targets undergoing cyclic change (returning to their initial state), the absolute phase may be nonzero and cannot be interpreted as a range difference. When a phase singularity (vanishing coherence) occurs at an intermediate time, the absolute phase becomes undefined, a situation termed an absolute phase singularity. Absolute phase singularities complicate absolute phase reconstruction through multifrequency techniques and through unwrapping multidimensional interferograms. They leave no trace in an interferogram, but unwrapping paths need to avoid those across which the absolute phase jumps by nonzero integer multiples of 2π. Mathematical analyses identify conditions for unwrapping-based reconstruction up to a constant, accounting for absolute phase singularities, undersampling and noise. The general definition of the absolute phase and the mathematical analyses enable a comprehensive appraisal of InSAR processing chains and support the interpretation of observations whenever low coherence engenders phase and absolute phase singularities."

    "abstract": "The emergence of multimodal large language models has demonstrated remarkable success in general visual understanding tasks. However, directly applying them to facial Action Unit(AU) recognition still faces two major challenges. First, designing a visual module that efficiently learns highly discriminative AU representations remains difficult. Second, achieving effective vision–language semantic alignment specifically for AUs is non-trivial. To address these issues, we first introduce the concept of AU tokens, which are extracted from the original global image-patch features using a cross-attention mechanism guided by learnable query tokens. This enables the model to focus on AU-specific visual cues while maintaining a compact representation. Next, we propose a novel training strategy called “RandReAU”, which encourages the model to respond correctly to AU tokens presented in arbitrary orders and varying lengths, enhancing its robustness and generalization. Building upon these techniques, we present VisAULa, a novel Vision AUR MLLM that significantly improves both the speed and precision of AU recognition. Extensive evaluations on the BP4D and DISFA datasets demonstrate that VisAULa achieves superior AU understanding while significantly reducing computational cost and accelerating inference, achieving a 2.14×speedup in inference and a 67.9% reduction in FLOPs, highlighting its practical potential for real-world applications."

To address this challenge, we propose dielectric resonance-based MTAI (DR-MTAI), which exploits the Fabry–Pérot resonance and spatially nonuniform mode field distributions within a dielectric resonance plate (DRP) to achieve energy concentration. Through theoretical analyses and simulations, we quantify the energy concentration capabilities and optimize the performance of the DRP. Phantom experiments demonstrate that DR-MTAI achieves approximately a 4.8-fold improvement in imaging contrast. The following in vitro experiments demonstrate a threefold enhancement in TA signal amplitude at a penetration depth of 4 cm. Furthermore, the combination of DR-MTAI with raster scanning significantly boosts the imaging sensitivity over a large region of interest (ROI) <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\sim 70\\times 70$</tex-math> </inline-formula> mm.

In forward operation, both interface trap and oxide trap charge exhibit the expansion effect on depletion region. However, in inverse operation, interface trap and oxide trap charge exhibit expansion and contraction effects on depletion region, respectively. Consequently, varying generation ratios of ionization defects caused by different experimental conditions may not change the forward degradation pattern, but will change the inverse degradation pattern. Subsequently, the simulation results of various ratios and the experimental results of hydrogen pre-treatment further confirmed the relationship between the ratios of ionization defects and the degradation patterns."

    "abstract": "Quantum neural networks (QNNs) have shown remarkable potential due to their capability of representing complex functions within exponentially large Hilbert spaces. However, their application to multivariate regression tasks has been limited, primarily due to inherent constraints of traditional approaches that rely on Pauli expectation values. In this work, we introduce a novel and simple post-processing method utilizing log-ratio probabilities (LRPs) of quantum states, enabling efficient and unbounded multivariate regression within existing QNN architectures. Our approach exponentially expands the number of regression outputs relative to qubit count, thus significantly improving parameter and qubit efficiency. Additionally, by enhancing parameter dependencies in the cost function and leveraging gradient pumping effects from the log-ratio transformation, our method mitigates the well-known barren plateau phenomenon, thereby stabilizing training. We further demonstrate that this approach facilitates robust uncertainty quantification, capturing both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties simultaneously. Our findings underscore the practical potential of LRP-QNNs for complex multi-output regression tasks, particularly within current resource-constrained quantum hardware environments."

    "abstract": "Outer loop link adaptation (OLLA) refines link adaptation by offsetting the channel quality indicator report. However, its slow convergence—the time required for the algorithm to stabilize to a reliable operating point—can pose challenges for emerging sixth generation (6G) services with strict quality of service requirements. In this work, we propose an exponential decay (ED)-based enhanced OLLA (EOLLA) framework that accelerates convergence while preserving stability. The key idea is to exploit instantaneous channel measurements at the user equipment to form an enhanced quality indicator, which drives the EOLLA offset updates at the gNodeB along an ED trajectory for rapid convergence. To prevent these fast adjustments from undermining robustness, EOLLA incorporates long-term system-level a-priori statistics into its design, enabling stable offset evolution under realistic channel dynamics. Closed-form expressions and a practical implementation with inherently low complexity are provided to support real-world deployment. System-level simulations across diverse deployments and traffic models show consistent improvements: moderate gains for enhanced mobile broadband and up to 33% capacity increase for extended reality traffic (characterized with bounded latency and reliability constraints) in indoor hotspot deployment. These results highlight EOLLA as a promising candidate for future 6G systems with demanding performance constraints."

To explore the application potential of ISAC in passive target localization, we build a passive bistatic sensing system on a 26 GHz millimeter-wave communication platform and conduct measurement experiments in an open square scenario. The system estimates multipath propagation parameters from the received sensing channel and, combined with a power-weighted clustering method, extracts multipath features to jointly localize static scatterers and moving targets. Experimental results show that, without requiring any involvement of the target device, the system attains sub-meter passive localization accuracy. The study validates the feasibility and practical value of millimeter-wave ISAC for high-precision sensing and localization in complex environments."

    "abstract": "Throughput-critical teleoperation requires robust and low-latency communication to ensure safety and performance. Often, these kinds of applications are implemented in Linux-based operating systems and transmit over virtual private networks, which ensure encryption and ease of use by providing a dedicated tunneling interface (TUN) to user space applications. In this work, we identified a specific behavior in the Linux TUN driver, which results in significant performance degradation due to the sender stack silently dropping packets. This design issue drastically impacts real-time video streaming, inducing up to 29 % packet loss with noticeable video artifacts when the internal queue of the TUN driver is reduced to 25 packets to minimize latency. Furthermore, a small queue length also drastically reduces the throughput of TCP traffic due to many retransmissions. Instead, with our open-source NODROP Patch, we propose generating backpressure in case of burst traffic or network congestion. The patch effectively addresses the packet-dropping behavior, hardening real-time video streaming and improving TCP throughput by 36 % in high latency scenarios."

    "abstract": "Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations face significant challenges in distributed federated learning (FL) systems due to sporadic connectivity, which leads to prolonged communication delays and model staleness, ultimately impairing the performance of the global model. To address these inherent challenges, We propose GraphFed, a novel federated learning framework for LEO satellite networks that dynamically forms clusters of satellites (\"communities\") based on line-of-site visibility (LoSV) and link duration. Each community elects a coordinator satellite to optimize task execution. Within each community, satellites collaboratively train local models, which are then aggregated using a novel performance-aware weighting scheme that accounts for model accuracy, loss, and community size. This work is an early-stage investigation to embed graph-theoretic clustering and performance-weighted aggregation into the FL pipeline for LEO constellations. Simulation results demonstrate that GraphFed significantly improves convergence speed and model performance compared to baseline schemes, e.g., FedAvg, FedAvgM, and FedProx."

    "abstract": "The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and high-altitude platform (HAP) in hierarchical aerial computing offers mobile IoT devices enhanced computational services. However, three key challenges emerge. First, while UAVs provide faster responses than distant HAP due to mobility, their limited computing capacity and coverage require efficient task delegation. Second, UAVs’ energy constraints force periodic recharging, potentially causing service interruptions and demanding dynamic resource allocation. Third, IoT task dynamics require rapid task delegation (small-timescale), while UAV trajectory adjustments operate slowly (large-timescale), necessitating multi-timescale coordination. To address these, we propose a two-timescale optimization framework maximizing system energy efficiency. We formulate the problem as coupled multi-agent stochastic games, and then develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm, called UAV trajectory planning, replacement, task delegation and resource allocation (UTRTD). Simulations show that UTRTD is not only effective but also superior compared to counterparts."

    "abstract": "In this paper, a cloud-edge-end integrated resource allocation and task scheduling architecture for industrial meta-verse is proposed. By leveraging the digital twins (DTs) technology, the proposed architecture enables factory operators to monitor, review historical data, and adjust equipment settings via a metaverse interface. In view of the dynamic generation, offloading and processing of compute-intensive tasks, an optimization problem on minimizing the system energy consumption is formulated by adhering to the resource constraints and soft task execution deadlines. In order to solve this non-convex nonlinear programming problem that is NP-hard in general, the process of task generation and execution is first modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Then a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)-based ‘two-scale’ resource allocation and task scheduling algorithm is proposed to adapt to the varying network conditions while reducing the overhead of frequent decision makings. To be specific, the resource allocation is performed on a slot basis, whereas the task scheduling is performed as per the instantaneous requirements of tasks. Extensive simulations are conducted by comparing with Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms, where the average system energy consumption is reduced by up to 39.3%, 30.1%, and 17.9% respectively by the proposed SAC-based two-scale algorithm."

However, balancing the trade-off among measurement completeness, accuracy, and timeliness under constrained resources, while providing targeted support for communication-intensive areas consisting of critical infrastructure remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a hybrid network Performance Measurement (PM) framework for deterministic SGs in two steps. 1) To obtain PM information for the whole network without incurring overhead, passive measurement with missing data imputation is tailored for meeting the divergence of packet loss types of large-scale SGs based on the proposed Temporal-Spatial based Distinguishable Generative Adversarial Imputation Network (STD-GAIN), which explores and exploits both the spatial-temporal correlation and higher-order local correlation for refined imputation performance. 2) Regarding the circumstance that the reliability of the imputed data does not meet the requirement, active measurement is conducted at a finer granularity, i.e., along a specified path, where All-Pair Shortest Path (APSP) model is utilized to find the best paths. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed framework could achieve complete, accurate and real-time network performance measurement for SGs."

As an effective use of AI/ML for air interface, a deep learning-based pilotless transmission scheme has been proposed where AI/ML is applied to functions such as channel estimation, equalization and demodulation. Several papers have shown through simulation evaluations that the application of AI/ML to the air interface can improve spectral efficiency. However, in all AI/ML applications, it is important to verify how well they perform in real environments. In this paper, a proofof-concept for the deep learning-based pilotless transmission scheme is constructed and experimental results in real indoor environments are shown. The results of the conducted experiments at fixed and walking speeds verify that the scheme improves throughput performance by 6.5-18.2 %."

    "abstract": "With the rapid expansion of electric vehicle (EV) charging piles, anomaly detection in EV charging piles has become critical to ensure charging reliability and safety. The high-dimensional data, complex data patterns, and scarcity of anomaly samples pose significant challenges for effective detection. Unfortunately, existing machine learning and deep learning-based methods exhibit detection accuracy or computational efficiency flaws. To address these issues, we propose a successive light gradient boosting machine (SLGBM)-based anomaly detection method for EV charging piles. SLGBM comprises multiple light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) models arranged in a layered structure and successively improves detection accuracy by gradually capturing nuanced feature differences. We propose a method to successively add and pre-train a new layer of LGBMs. We also propose a method to jointly train all component LGBMs to further improve detection accuracy. The number of layers controls the detection accuracy and computation efficiency tradeoff, demonstrating SLGBM’s flexibility for anomaly detection in EV charging piles. Numerical results on a Baidu EV charging piles dataset demonstrate the proposed SLGBM’s superior advantages over existing methods such as support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and convolutional neural network-long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) in large-sample and small-sample scenarios. The significant gains show SLGBM’s practical importance for anomaly detection in EV charging piles."
