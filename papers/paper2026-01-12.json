    "abstract": "While virtualization and resource pooling empower cloud networks with structural flexibility and elastic scalability, they inevitably expand the attack surface and challenge cyber resilience. Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based defense strategies have been developed to optimize resource deployment and isolation policies under adversarial conditions, aiming to enhance system resilience by maintaining and restoring network availability. However, existing approaches lack robustness as they require retraining to adapt to dynamic changes in network structure, node scale, attack strategies, and attack intensity. Furthermore, the lack of Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) support limits interpretability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose CyberOps-Bots, a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Inspired by MITRE ATT&CK's Tactics-Techniques model, CyberOps-Bots features a two-layer architecture: (1) An upper-level LLM agent with four modules--ReAct planning, IPDRR-based perception, long-short term memory, and action/tool integration--performs global awareness, human intent recognition, and tactical planning; (2) Lower-level RL agents, developed via heterogeneous separated pre-training, execute atomic defense actions within localized network regions. This synergy preserves LLM adaptability and interpretability while ensuring reliable RL execution. Experiments on real cloud datasets show that, compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, CyberOps-Bots maintains network availability 68.5% higher and achieves a 34.7% jumpstart performance gain when shifting the scenarios without retraining. To our knowledge, this is the first study to establish a robust LLM-RL framework with HITL support for cloud defense. We will release our framework to the community, facilitating the advancement of robust and autonomous defense in cloud networks."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are used not only for problem solving but also for creative ideation; however, eliciting serendipitous insights that are both novel and internally coherent remains difficult. While stochastic sampling promotes novelty, it often degrades consistency. Here, we propose ReMIND, a REM-inspired modular framework for ideation. ReMIND consists of four stages: wake, which generates a stable low-temperature semantic baseline; dream, which performs high-temperature exploratory generation; judge, which applies coarse evaluation to filter incoherent outputs and extract candidate ideas; and re-wake, which re-articulates selected ideas into coherent final outputs. By instantiating each stage as an independent LLM, ReMIND enables functional separation between exploration and consolidation. Parameter sweeps show that ReMIND reliably induces semantic exploration while preserving downstream stability. Embedding-based analyses confirm substantial semantic displacement during the dream phase, whereas external evaluations reveal that high-quality ideas emerge sporadically rather than as extrema along any single metric. These results suggest that serendipitous ideation in LLMs is a rare-event process best approached through system level design that shapes the conditions under which valuable ideas can emerge and be stabilized. ReMIND provides a general framework for studying the computational basis of serendipity and illustrates how modular LLM orchestration can bridge exploration and stabilization."

    "abstract": "Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to incrementally learn models from a small amount of novel data, which requires strong representation and adaptation ability of models learned under few-example supervision to avoid catastrophic forgetting on old classes and overfitting to novel classes. This work proposes a generative co-memory regularization approach to facilitate FSCIL. In the approach, the base learning leverages generative domain adaptation finetuning to finetune a pretrained generative encoder on a few examples of base classes by jointly incorporating a masked autoencoder (MAE) decoder for feature reconstruction and a fully-connected classifier for feature classification, which enables the model to efficiently capture general and adaptable representations. Using the finetuned encoder and learned classifier, we construct two class-wise memories: representation memory for storing the mean features for each class, and weight memory for storing the classifier weights. After that, the memory-regularized incremental learning is performed to train the classifier dynamically on the examples of few-shot classes in each incremental session by simultaneously optimizing feature classification and co-memory regularization. The memories are updated in a class-incremental manner and they collaboratively regularize the incremental learning. In this way, the learned models improve recognition accuracy, while mitigating catastrophic forgetting over old classes and overfitting to novel classes. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks clearly demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-arts."

    "abstract": "Condorcet domains are sets of linear orders with the property that, whenever voters' preferences are restricted to the domain, the pairwise majority relation (for an odd number of voters) is transitive and hence a linear order. Determining the maximum size of a Condorcet domain, sometimes under additional constraints, has been a longstanding problem in the mathematical theory of majority voting. The exact maximum is only known for $n\\leq 8$ alternatives. In this paper we use a structural analysis of the largest domains for small $n$ to design a new inductive search method. Using an implementation of this method on a supercomputer, together with existing algorithms, we improve the size of the largest known domains for all $9 \\leq n \\leq 20$. These domains are then used in a separate construction to obtain the currently largest known domains for $21 \\leq n \\leq 25$, and to improve the best asymptotic lower bound for the maximum size of a Condorcet domain to $Ω(2.198139^n)$. Finally, we discuss properties of the domains found and state several open problems and conjectures."

The objective is to enhance the output direct current (DC) power under RF combining and DC combining schemes by jointly exploiting gains from antenna coding, beamforming, and rectenna nonlinearity. We first propose the MIMO WPT system model with binary and continuous antenna coding using the beamspace channel model and formulate the joint antenna coding and beamforming optimization using a nonlinear rectenna model. We propose two efficient closed-form successive convex approximation algorithms to efficiently optimize the beamforming. To further reduce the computational complexity, we propose codebook-based antenna coding designs for output DC power maximization based on K-means clustering. Results show that the proposed pixel antenna empowered MIMO WPT system with binary antenna coding increases output DC power by more than 15 dB compared with conventional systems with fixed antenna configuration. With continuous antenna coding, the performance improves another 6 dB. Moreover, the proposed codebook design outperforms previous designs by up to 40% and shows good performance with reduced computational complexity. Overall, the significant improvement in output DC power verifies the potential of leveraging antenna coding utilizing pixel antennas to enhance WPT systems."

State-of-the-art references typically rely on electronic co-Pound-Drever-Hall locking to ultrahigh-Q microresonators-a complex approach that introduces servo bumps and increases footprint. Alternatively, optical co-self-injection-locking (co-SIL) offers inherent simplicity but is limited by the large thermo-refractive noise and confined mode volumes of integrated cavities. Here, we demonstrate a two-point OFD-based microwave oscillator that combines an ultrahigh-Q miniature Fabry-Perot cavity with optical co-SIL. Leveraging its low relative phase noise optical reference and combing with an integrated soliton microcomb, the system generates a microwave with phase noise of -147 dBc/Hz at 4 kHz offset (scaled to 10 GHz)-performance rivalling most electronically stabilized systems. This work marries the superior noise floor of ultrahigh-Q cavities with the simplicity of optical locking, providing a compact, cost-effective, and field-deployable path to pure microwaves for next-generation communications, radar and metrology."

    "abstract": "In intelligent reflecting surface IRS assisted multiple input multiple output MIMO systems, a strong line of sight LoS link is required to compensate for the severe cascaded path loss. However, such a link renders the effective channel highly rank deficient and fundamentally limits spatial multiplexing. To overcome this limitation, this paper leverages the large aperture of sparse arrays to harness near field spherical wavefronts, and establishes a deterministic deployment criterion that strategically positions the IRS in the near field of a base station BS. This placement exploits the spherical wavefronts of the BS IRS link to engineer decorrelated channels, thereby fundamentally overcoming the rank deficiency issue in far field cascaded channels. Based on a physical channel model for the sparse BS array and the IRS, we characterize the rank properties and inter user correlation of the cascaded BS IRS user channel. We further derive a closed form favorable propagation metric that reveals how the sparse array geometry and the IRS position can be tuned to reduce inter user channel correlation. The resulting geometry driven deployment rule provides a simple guideline for creating a favorable propagation environment with enhanced effective degrees of freedom. The favorable channel statistics induced by our deployment criterion enable a low complexity maximum ratio transmission MRT precoding scheme. This serves as the foundation for an efficient algorithm that jointly optimizes the IRS phase shifts and power allocation based solely on long term statistical channel state information CSI. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our deployment criterion and demonstrate that our optimization framework achieves significant performance gains over benchmark schemes."

    "abstract": "The integration of satellite and autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV) communications has become essential for the scenarios requiring both wide coverage and rapid deployment, particularly in remote or disaster-stricken areas where the terrestrial infrastructure is unavailable. Furthermore, emerging applications increasingly demand simultaneous mobile edge computing (MEC) and data collection (DC) capabilities within the same aerial network. However, jointly optimizing these operations in heterogeneous satellite-AAV systems presents significant challenges due to limited on-board resources and competing demands under dynamic channel conditions. In this work, we investigate a satellite-AAV-enabled joint MEC-DC system where these platforms collaborate to serve ground devices (GDs). Specifically, we formulate a joint optimization problem to minimize the average MEC end-to-end delay and AAV energy consumption while maximizing the collected data. Since the formulated optimization problem is a non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, we propose a Q-weighted variational policy optimization-based joint AAV movement control, GD association, offloading decision, and bandwidth allocation (QAGOB) approach. Specifically, we reformulate the optimization problem as an action space-transformed Markov decision process to adapt the variable action dimensions and hybrid action space. Subsequently, QAGOB leverages the multi-modal generation capacities of diffusion models to optimize policies and can achieve better sample efficiency while controlling the diffusion costs during training. Simulation results show that QAGOB outperforms five other benchmarks, including traditional DRL and diffusion-based DRL algorithms. Furthermore, the MEC-DC joint optimization achieves significant advantages when compared to the separate optimization of MEC and DC."

In order to tackle this difficulty, this workinvestigates TabPFN, a learning-free model designed for low-data regimes. We evaluate its performance against established baselines such as Random Forest, LightGBM and XGBoost, across multiple class configurations. Our experimental results indicate that TabPFN surpasses all other models in low-data regimes, with a 2% to 6% improvement observed across multiple performance metrics. However, this increase in performance has an impact on its computation time in a particular case. These findings highlight both the promise and the practical limitations of integrating TabPFN into cybersecurity workflows."

Capturing this form of knowledge can reap potential benefits for the engineering teams and enhance development efficiency. Despite its clear value, traditional decision capture often requires a significant amount of effort and still falls short of capturing the necessary context for reuse. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) can be a promising solution to address these challenges by embedding decisions directly within system models, which can reduce the capture workload while maintaining explicit links to requirements, behaviors, and architectural elements. This article discusses a lightweight framework for integrating decision capture into MBSE workflows by representing decision alternatives as system model slices. Using a simplified industry example from aircraft architecture, we discuss the main challenges associated with decision capture and propose preliminary solutions to address these challenges."

    "abstract": "Multi-behavior recommendation (MBR) aims to improve the performance w.r.t. the target behavior (i.e., purchase) by leveraging auxiliary behaviors (e.g., click, favourite). However, in real-world scenarios, a recommendation method often needs to process different types of behaviors and generate personalized lists for each task (i.e., each behavior type). Such a new recommendation problem is referred to as multi-behavior multi-task recommendation (MMR). So far, the most powerful MBR methods usually model multi-behavior interactions using a cascading graph paradigm. Although significant progress has been made in optimizing the performance of the target behavior, it often neglects the performance of auxiliary behaviors. To compensate for the deficiencies of the cascading paradigm, we propose a novel solution for MMR, i.e., behavior-informed graph embedding learning (BiGEL). Specifically, we first obtain a set of behavior-aware embeddings by using a cascading graph paradigm. Subsequently, we introduce three key modules to improve the performance of the model. The cascading gated feedback (CGF) module enables a feedback-driven optimization process by integrating feedback from the target behavior to refine the auxiliary behaviors preferences. The global context enhancement (GCE) module integrates the global context to maintain the user's overall preferences, preventing the loss of key preferences due to individual behavior graph modeling. Finally, the contrastive preference alignment (CPA) module addresses the potential changes in user preferences during the cascading process by aligning the preferences of the target behaviors with the global preferences through contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our BiGEL compared with ten very competitive methods."

The resulting W-estimator admits a closed-form expression and is numerically equivalent to the classical 1-nearest neighbor estimator, yielding a new optimal transport interpretation of nearest neighbor methods. We establish root-$n$ asymptotic normality and show that the estimator is not asymptotically linear, leading to super-efficiency relative to the semiparametric efficient estimator under covariate shift in certain regimes, and uniformly in missing data problems. Numerical simulations, along with an analysis of a rainfall dataset, underscore the exceptional performance of our W-estimator."

The PMD has demonstrated strong performance for time-dependent systems. However, its formulation is for temporal dynamics and does not directly accommodate parametric variability, which limits its applicability to tasks such as design optimization, control, and uncertainty quantification. In order to address the limitations, a \\emph{Parametric Probabilistic Manifold Decomposition} (PPMD) is presented to deal with parametric problems. The central advantage of PPMD is its ability to construct continuous, high-fidelity parametric surrogates while retaining the transparency and non-intrusive workflow of PMD. By integrating probabilistic-manifold embeddings with parameter-aware latent learning, PPMD enables smooth predictions across unseen parameter values (such as different boundary or initial conditions). To validate the proposed method, a comprehensive convergence analysis is established for PPMD, covering the approximation of the linear principal subspace, the geometric recovery of the nonlinear solution manifold, and the statistical consistency of the kernel ridge regression used for latent learning. The framework is then numerically demonstrated on two classic flow configurations: flow past a cylinder and backward-facing step flow. Results confirm that PPMD achieves superior accuracy and generalization beyond the training parameter range compared to the conventional proper orthogonal decomposition with Gaussian process regression (POD+GPR) method."

In this work, we successfully synthesized high-quality GdAlSi single crystals, a prototypical member of RAlX (R = rare earth elements; X = Si/Ge) family that has been theoretically predicted to sustain a non-trivial Weyl semimetal state. Through systematic investigations of magnetic and transport properties, we identified two successive antiferromagnetic transitions at critical temperatures TN1 31.9 K and TN2 31.1 K, as evidenced by temperature-dependent resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat measurements. Notably, applied magnetic fields exceeding 8 T induce a third magnetic transition (TN3), generating a cascade of metamagnetic transitions that collectively form a dendritic phase diagram. This complex magnetic behavior is attributed to the interplay between localized Gd-4f moments and itinerant conduction electrons, possibly mediated by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. Transport measurements revealed striking stepwise anomalies in magnetoresistance when crossing phase boundaries, accompanied by pronounced hysteresis loops arising from magnetic moment flopping processes. Our results not only establish GdAlSi as a rich platform for investigating correlated topological states, but also demonstrate its potential for engineering topological phase transitions through magnetic symmetry manipulation in Weyl semimetals."

We study reliability through the lens of multi-model consensus: given responses from several heterogeneous LLMs, can we learn which answer is most likely correct for a given query? We introduce a Multi-Model Consensus Reasoning Engine that treats the set of LLM outputs as input to a supervised meta-learner. The system maps natural language responses into structured features using semantic embeddings, pairwise similarity and clustering statistics, lexical and structural cues, reasoning-quality scores, confidence estimates, and model-specific priors, and then applies gradient-boosted trees, listwise ranking, and graph neural networks over similarity graphs of answers. Using three open-weight LLMs evaluated on compact, resource- constrained subsets of GSM8K, ARC-Challenge, HellaSwag, and TruthfulQA, our best graph-attention-based consensus model improves macro-average accuracy by 4.6 percentage points over the strongest single LLM and by 8.1 points over majority vote, while also yielding lower Brier scores and fewer TruthfulQA hal- lucinations. Ablation and feature-importance analyses show that semantic agreement and clustering features are most influential, with reasoning-quality and model-prior features providing com- plementary gains, suggesting supervised multi-model consensus is a practical route toward more reliable LLM behavior, even in a modest single-machine setup."

On the one hand, scattering-based protocols with cavities or waveguides are fast but demand stringent hardware such as high-efficiency integrated circulators or strong waveguide coupling. On the other hand, emission-based platforms are experimentally feasible but so far rely on Bell-pair fusion with extensive use of slow two-qubit memory gates, limiting thresholds to $\\approx 0.16\\%$. Here, we consider a fully distributed surface code using emission-based entanglement schemes that generate GHZ states in a single shot, i.e., without the need for Bell-pair fusions. We show that our optical setup produces Bell pairs, W states, and GHZ states, enabling both memory-based and optical protocols for distilling high-fidelity GHZ states with significantly improved success rates.

    "abstract": "Deterministic inference is a comforting ideal in classical software: the same program on the same input should always produce the same output. As large language models move into real-world deployment, this ideal has been imported wholesale into inference stacks. Recent work from the Thinking Machines Lab has presented a detailed analysis of nondeterminism in LLM inference, showing how batch-invariant kernels and deterministic attention can enforce bitwise-identical outputs, positioning deterministic inference as a prerequisite for reproducibility and enterprise reliability. In this paper, we take the opposite stance. We argue that, for LLMs, deterministic inference kills. It kills the ability to model uncertainty, suppresses emergent abilities, collapses reasoning into a single brittle path, and weakens safety alignment by hiding tail risks. LLMs implement conditional distributions over outputs, not fixed functions. Collapsing these distributions to a single canonical completion may appear reassuring, but it systematically conceals properties central to artificial cognition. We instead advocate Stochastic CHAOS, treating distributional variability as a signal to be measured and controlled. Empirically, we show that deterministic inference is systematically misleading. Single-sample deterministic evaluation underestimates both capability and fragility, masking failure probability under paraphrases and noise. Phase-like transitions associated with emergent abilities disappear under greedy decoding. Multi-path reasoning degrades when forced onto deterministic backbones, reducing accuracy and diagnostic insight. Finally, deterministic evaluation underestimates safety risk by hiding rare but dangerous behaviors that appear only under multi-sample evaluation."

    "abstract": "Large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit diverse high-level reasoning patterns (e.g., direct solution, reflection-and-verification, and exploring multiple solutions), yet prevailing training recipes implicitly bias models toward a limited set of dominant patterns. Through a systematic analysis, we identify substantial accuracy variance across these patterns on mathematics and science benchmarks, revealing that a model's default reasoning pattern is often sub-optimal for a given problem. To address this, we introduce Group Pattern Selection Optimization (GPSO), a reinforcement learning framework that extends GRPO by incorporating multi-pattern rollouts, verifier-guided optimal pattern selection per problem, and attention masking during optimization to prevent the leakage of explicit pattern suffixes into the learned policy. By exploring a portfolio of diverse reasoning strategies and optimizing the policy on the most effective ones, GPSO enables the model to internalize the mapping from problem characteristics to optimal reasoning patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPSO delivers consistent and substantial performance gains across various model backbones and benchmarks, effectively mitigating pattern sub-optimality and fostering more robust, adaptable reasoning.

    "abstract": "Interactive systems that explain data, or support decision making often emphasize what is present while overlooking what is expected but missing. This presence bias limits users' ability to form complete mental models of a dataset or situation. Detecting absence depends on expectations about what should be there, yet interfaces rarely help users form such expectations. We present an experimental study examining how reference framing and prompting influence people's ability to recognize expected but missing categories in datasets. Participants compared distributions across three domains (energy, wealth, and regime) under two reference conditions: Global, presenting a unified population baseline, and Partial, showing several concrete exemplars. Results indicate that absence detection was higher with Partial reference than with Global reference, suggesting that partial, samples-based framing can support expectation formation and absence detection. When participants were prompted to look for what was missing, absence detection rose sharply. We discuss implications for interactive user interfaces and expectation-based visualization design, while considering cognitive trade-offs of reference structures and guided attention."

Among them, molecular intercalation superlattices have attracted attention as tunable hybrid materials, formed by inserting organic molecules into van der Waals crystals, where molecular structure and chemistry provide new degrees of freedom. Traditionally, the intercalated molecules have been regarded as inactive spacers, while possible molecular ordering and its impact on the host lattice have remained largely unexplored. Here, we report the discovery of a cooperative superstructure (CSS) phase in molecule intercalated NbSe2, where ordering of the guest molecules induce a concomitant superstructure in the NbSe2 host lattice, characterized by a moiré structure due to incommensurability between the molecular layer and the inorganic lattice. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction reveals the emergence of CSS phase, accompanied by crystal symmetry lowering. Complementary resistivity and thermal-quench measurements show that the transition is governed by unusually slow order-disorder kinetics, so that the CSS phase can be selectively accessed under standard laboratory cooling rates. This kinetic behavior arises from slow molecular dynamics coupled to the host lattice, contrasting with fast charge or magnetic ordering in inorganic solids. Our findings establish molecular ordering as a route for engineering heterointerfaces, enabling thermally programmable superstructures."

Model pruning addresses this by removing redundant components from models. In particular, block pruning can achieve significant compression and inference acceleration. However, existing block pruning methods are often unstable and struggle to attain globally optimal solutions. In this paper, we propose a mutual information based pruning method MI-PRUN for LLMs. Specifically, we leverages mutual information to identify redundant blocks by evaluating transitions in hidden states. Additionally, we incorporate the Data Processing Inequality (DPI) to reveal the relationship between the importance of entire contiguous blocks and that of individual blocks. Moreover, we develop the Fast-Block-Select algorithm, which iteratively updates block combinations to achieve a globally optimal solution while significantly improving the efficiency. Extensive experiments across various models and datasets demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of our method."

We identify the fundamental bottlenecks that prevent efficient quantum realization of classical DL and show how a structurally restricted model, doubly sparse dictionary learning (DSDL), naturally avoids these problems. We present a simple, hybrid quantum-classical algorithm based on projection-based randomized Kaczmarz iterations with Qiskit-compatible quantum inner products.

    "abstract": "Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as an efficient paradigm for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), yet its efficacy is primarily confined to domains with verifiable ground truths. Extending GRPO to open-domain settings remains a critical challenge, as unconstrained generation entails multi-faceted and often conflicting objectives - such as creativity versus factuality - where rigid, static reward scalarization is inherently suboptimal. To address this, we propose MAESTRO (Meta-learning Adaptive Estimation of Scalarization Trade-offs for Reward Optimization), which introduces a meta-cognitive orchestration layer that treats reward scalarization as a dynamic latent policy, leveraging the model's terminal hidden states as a semantic bottleneck to perceive task-specific priorities. We formulate this as a contextual bandit problem within a bi-level optimization framework, where a lightweight Conductor network co-evolves with the policy by utilizing group-relative advantages as a meta-reward signal. Across seven benchmarks, MAESTRO consistently outperforms single-reward and static multi-objective baselines, while preserving the efficiency advantages of GRPO, and in some settings even reducing redundant generation."

While existing defenses attempt to mitigate this via data selection, they typically rely on heuristic, instance-level assessments that neglect the global geometry of the data distribution and fail to explicitly repel harmful patterns. To address this, we introduce Safety Optimal Transport (SOT), a novel framework that reframes safe fine-tuning from an instance-level filtering challenge to a distribution-level alignment task grounded in Optimal Transport (OT). At its core is a dual-reference ``push-pull'' weight-learning mechanism: SOT optimizes sample importance by actively pulling the downstream distribution towards a trusted safe anchor while simultaneously pushing it away from a general harmful reference. This establishes a robust geometric safety boundary that effectively purifies the training data. Extensive experiments across diverse model families and domains demonstrate that SOT significantly enhances model safety while maintaining competitive downstream performance, achieving a superior safety-utility trade-off compared to baselines."

We partner the only vector-based quantum chemical physics theory enabling full symmetry-breaking with electronic and nuclear dynamics simulations: the former does not require charge density differences or special symmetry positions. The resulting 'easy' and 'hard' directions of the total electronic charge density motion are quantified as a cardioid-like morphology for the duration of the simulated laser pulses and toroidal afterwards.

When adversarial instructions appear in user queries or externally retrieved content, models may override intended logic. Recent defenses rely on supervised fine-tuning with benign and malicious labels. Although these methods achieve high attack rejection rates, we find that they rely on narrow correlations in defense data rather than harmful intent, leading to systematic rejection of safe inputs. We analyze three recurring shortcut behaviors induced by defense fine-tuning. \\emph{Position bias} arises when benign content placed later in a prompt is rejected at much higher rates; across reasoning benchmarks, suffix-task rejection rises from below \\textbf{10\\%} to as high as \\textbf{90\\%}. \\emph{Token trigger bias} occurs when strings common in attack data raise rejection probability even in benign contexts; inserting a single trigger token increases false refusals by up to \\textbf{50\\%}. \\emph{Topic generalization bias} reflects poor generalization beyond the defense data distribution, with defended models suffering test-time accuracy drops of up to \\textbf{40\\%}. These findings suggest that current prompt-injection defenses frequently respond to attack-like surface patterns rather than the underlying intent. We introduce controlled diagnostic datasets and a systematic evaluation across two base models and multiple defense pipelines, highlighting limitations of supervised fine-tuning for reliable LLM security."

We employ a triangular lattice formed by the interference of three plane waves, which can trap particles, depending on parameters, either at intensity maxima or at intensity zeros (vortices). By introducing small frequency detunings between the interfering waves, we control 2D motion of the lattice and trapped particles. This approach is robust and effective over a relatively broad range of particle sizes and wave frequencies, offering remarkable new possibilities for noncontact manipulation of floating (e.g., biological and soft-matter) objects in fluidic environments."

We draw our conclusion by investigating solutions from time-dependent perturbation theory, where the perturbative solutions are in match with numeric solutions of the relativistic quantum system and also with the numeric and analytic solutions from the relativistic equations of motion of a classical point-like electron in an external standing wave light field. While our numeric solutions assume a strong laser field, the analytic solutions indicate that negative state coupling remains dominant for arbitrary low field amplitudes, where in the single-photon case (Compton scattering) negative state coupling can be mathematically associated with the interaction of a virtual electron-positron pair in the context of a quantized theory in old-fashioned perturbation theory."

We consider a dual-waveguide architecture that simultaneously delivers covert information and randomized jamming to hide the transmission footprint, incorporating three representative PASS power-radiation laws-general, proportional, and equal. To characterize the system-level detectability, we derive closed-form expressions for local false-alarm and miss-detection probabilities. By leveraging a probability-generating-function (PGF) and elementary-symmetric-polynomial (ESP) framework, combined with a breakpoint-based partition of the threshold domain, we obtain explicit closed-form characterizations of the system-level detection error probability (DEP) under non-i.i.d. majority-voting fusion. Building on this analytical framework, we formulate a robust optimization problem to maximize the average covert rate subject to covertness constraint. To solve the resulting nonconvex design, we develop an MM-BCD-SCA algorithm that produces tractable alternating updates for power/radiation variables and PA positions via convex surrogates and inner approximations of the DEP value function. Numerical results validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the impact of cooperative monitoring and PASS radiation laws on the covertness-rate tradeoff."

Uncovering the mechanisms underlying such emergent behaviors calls for a dynamical understanding of learn processes. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of actor-critic agents in stochastic games, focusing on the impact of entropy regularization. By leveraging time-scale separation, we derive the system's evolution equations, which are then formally analyzed using dynamical systems theory. We find that in the constant-sum game of Matching Pennies, the system exhibits chaotic behavior. Entropy regularization mitigates this chaos and drives the dynamics toward convergence to fair cooperation. In contrast, in the general-sum game of the Prisoner's Dilemma, the system displays multistability. Interestingly, the three stable equilibria of the system correspond to the well-known ALLC (Always Cooperate), ALLD (Always Defect), and GRIM (Grim Trigger) strategies from evolutionary game theory (EGT). Entropy regularization strengthens system resilience by enlarging the basin of attraction of the cooperative equilibrium. Our findings reveal a close link between the mechanism of direct reciprocity in EGT and how cooperation emerges in MARL, offering insights for designing more robust and collaborative multi-agent systems."

    "abstract": "Efficient channel state information (CSI) feedback is critical for 6G extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems to mitigate channel interference. However, the massive antenna scale imposes a severe burden on feedback overhead. Meanwhile, existing quantized feedback methods face dual challenges of limited quantization precision and insufficient channel robustness when compressing high-dimensional channel features into discrete symbols. To reduce these gaps, guided by the deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) framework, we propose a vector quantized (VQ)-aided scheme for CSI feedback in XL-MIMO systems considering the near-field effect, named VQ-DJSCC-F. Firstly, taking advantage of the sparsity of near-field channels in the polar-delay domain, we extract energy-concentrated features to reduce dimensionality. Then, we simultaneously design the Transformer and CNN (convolutional neural network) architectures as the backbones to hierarchically extract CSI features, followed by VQ modules projecting features into a discrete latent space. The entropy loss regularization in synergy with an exponential moving average (EMA) update strategy is introduced to maximize quantization precision. Furthermore, we develop an attention mechanism-driven channel adaptation module to mitigate the impact of wireless channel fading on the transmission of index sequences. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves superior CSI reconstruction accuracy with lower feedback overheads under varying channel conditions."

Although exact electronic forces can be obtained from nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) calculations, their high computational cost renders long time dynamical simulations prohibitively expensive. By exploiting the locality of the electronic response, we train a neural network to directly predict instantaneous local electronic forces from the lattice configuration, thereby bypassing repeated NEGF calculations during time evolution. When combined with Brownian dynamics, the resulting machine learning force field quantitatively reproduces domain wall motion and nonequilibrium phase transition dynamics obtained from full NEGF simulations, while achieving orders of magnitude gains in computational efficiency.

We call this phenomenon Artificial Jagged Intelligence (AJI). This paper develops a tractable economic model of AJI that treats adoption as an information problem: users care about \\emph{local} reliability, but typically observe only coarse, global quality signals. In a baseline one-dimensional landscape, truth is a rough Brownian process, and the model ``knows'' scattered points drawn from a Poisson process. The model interpolates optimally, and the local error is measured by posterior variance. We derive an adoption threshold for a blind user, show that experienced errors are amplified by the inspection paradox, and interpret scaling laws as denser coverage that improves average quality without eliminating jaggedness. We then study mastery and calibration: a calibrated user who can condition on local uncertainty enjoys positive expected value even in domains that fail the blind adoption test. Modelling mastery as learning a reliability map via Gaussian process regression yields a learning-rate bound driven by information gain, clarifying when discovering ``where the model works'' is slow. Finally, we study how scaling interacts with discoverability: when calibrated signals and user mastery accelerate the harvesting of scale improvements, and when opacity can make gains from scaling effectively invisible."

The visualization and analysis of visual attention are commonly done by building fixation density maps from eye-tracking data. Such visual attention mapping is well mastered for 3 degrees of freedom (3DoF) experiences (\\textit{i.e.}, involving 360 images or videos) but much less so for 6DoFs data, when the user can move freely in the 3D space. In that case, the visual attention information has to be mapped onto the 3D objects themselves.

    "abstract": "Autonomous 3D scanning of open-world target structures via drones remains challenging despite broad applications. Existing paradigms rely on restrictive assumptions or effortful human priors, limiting practicality, efficiency, and adaptability. Recent foundation models (FMs) offer great potential to bridge this gap. This paper investigates a critical research problem: What system architecture can effectively integrate FM knowledge for this task? We answer it with FlyCo, a principled FM-empowered perception-prediction-planning loop enabling fully autonomous, prompt-driven 3D target scanning in diverse unknown open-world environments. FlyCo directly translates low-effort human prompts (text, visual annotations) into precise adaptive scanning flights via three coordinated stages: (1) perception fuses streaming sensor data with vision-language FMs for robust target grounding and tracking; (2) prediction distills FM knowledge and combines multi-modal cues to infer the partially observed target's complete geometry; (3) planning leverages predictive foresight to generate efficient and safe paths with comprehensive target coverage. Building on this, we further design key components to boost open-world target grounding efficiency and robustness, enhance prediction quality in terms of shape accuracy, zero-shot generalization, and temporal stability, and balance long-horizon flight efficiency with real-time computability and online collision avoidance. Extensive challenging real-world and simulation experiments show FlyCo delivers precise scene understanding, high efficiency, and real-time safety, outperforming existing paradigms with lower human effort and verifying the proposed architecture's practicality. Comprehensive ablations validate each component's contribution. FlyCo also serves as a flexible, extensible blueprint, readily leveraging future FM and robotics advances. Code will be released."

Conventional syntheses of ZnS quantum dots (QDs) often involve high temperatures or toxic reagents. This study presents a comparative investigation of hydrothermal and co-precipitation synthesis routes for ZnS QDs, emphasizing scalable, environmentally friendly production under mild conditions. Using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) or polyethylene glycol (PEG) as capping agents, we achieved precise control over particle size, optical properties, and particle size distribution. Room temperature co-precipitation produced monodisperse ZnS QDs with crystallite size as small as 2.03 nm, while hydrothermal synthesis at elevated temperature yielded larger crystals exceeding ~6 nm. X-ray diffraction confirmed zinc-blende crystal structure in all samples, with lattice parameter shifts and peak broadening reflecting nanoscale effects. UV-Visible spectroscopy revealed tuneable optical band gaps from 3.60 eV to 3.80 eV, corresponding to strong quantum confinement in smaller particles. FTIR and DLS analyses verified effective surface capping and particle size distribution, with PVP providing greater growth suppression and stability than PEG. These results demonstrate that ambient, polymer-assisted co precipitation enables low-toxicity, energy-efficient synthesis of high-quality ZnS QDs, offering a viable route toward sustainable and scalable nanoparticle production for optoelectronic and nanomaterial applications"

The nature of their progenitors and pre-explosion mass loss remains, however, poorly understood. Using high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, we analyze the local stellar environments of a volume-limited sample (z < 0.02) of 31 SNe IIn. The environments of SNe IIn are found to be very diverse; the SN could reside within a star-forming region (Class 1), outside a star-forming region (Class 2), or in much older environments without any obvious signs of star formation (Class 3). The bright SNe IIn (Mpeak < -19.5 mag) predominantly occur in Class 1 environments, indicative of very massive progenitors, while the faint SNe IIn (Mpeak < -15.5 mag) are associated with Classes 2 and 3 environments, suggesting the least massive progenitors. Meanwhile, normal SNe IIn with -19.5 < Mpeak < -15.5 mag occur in all three types of environments, suggesting a diversity in their progenitor mass, lifetime, and evolutionary pathways. Moreover, the directly detected SN IIn progenitors are systematically brighter and/or bluer than the youngest stellar populations in their environments, suggesting that they were either in a non-quiescent state when observed or had experienced binary interactions. These results point to a significantly diverse origin for progenitors of SNe IIn, spanning a wide range of masses, evolutionary stages, and potential binary interaction histories."

Recent studies have extended its framework to accommodate complex outcomes that take values in metric spaces, such as distributions, functions, networks, covariance matrices, and compositional data. However, due to the lack of linear structure in general metric spaces, theoretical guarantees for estimation and inference within these extended frameworks remain underdeveloped. In this study, we propose the functional synthetic control (FSC) method as an extension of the SCM for metric space-valued outcomes. To address challenges arising from the nonlinearlity of metric spaces, we leverage isometric embeddings into Hilbert spaces. Building on this approach, we develop the FSC and augmented FSC estimators for counterfactual outcomes, with the latter being a bias-corrected version of the former. We then derive their finite-sample error bounds to establish theoretical guarantees for estimation, and construct prediction sets based on these estimators to conduct inference on causal effects. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed framework through simulation studies and three empirical applications."

A threefold M bounding S gives rise a K_2-Lagrangian in Loc(m,S) given by the flat bundles on S extending to M. We generalize this, replacing the zero section in the cotangent bundle to M by certain singular Lagrangians. First, we introduce Q-diagrams in threefolds. They are collections Q of smooth cooriented surfaces, intersecting transversally everywhere but in a finite set of quadruple crossing points. We require that shifting any surface of the collection from such a point in the direction of its coorientation creates a simplex with the cooriented out faces. The Q-diagrams are 3d analogs of bipartite ribbon graphs. Let L be the Lagrangian in the cotangent bundle to M given by the union of the zero section and the conormal bundles to the cooriented surfaces of Q. Let X(L) be the stack of admissible dg-sheaves on M with the microlocal support in L, whose microlocalization at the conormal bundle to each cooriented surface of Q is a rank one local system. We introduce the boundary dL of L. It is a singular Lagrangian in a symplectic space, providing a symplectic stack X(dL), and a restriction functor from X(L) to X(dL). The image of the latter is Lagrangian. We show that, under mild conditions on Q, this Lagrangian has a cluster description, and so it is a K_2-Lagrangian. It also has a simple description in the non-commutative setting."

In this paper, we present an approach to this problem based on approximating electric motor losses using higher-order polynomials with specific properties. To ensure a well-behaved optimization landscape, monotonicity and positivity constraints are imposed on the polynomial models using sum of squares programming. This methodology provides robustness against noisy or sparse data, while retaining the computational efficiency of a polynomial function approximation. The torque allocation problem based on such polynomials is formulated as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem and solved efficiently using readily available solvers. In the nominal case, the first-order necessary conditions for optimality can also be used to obtain a global solution. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on several certification driving cycles against a grid search-based benchmark. Results show a modest influence on electric energy consumption, while enabling real-time optimization and integration with other vehicle control systems."

In this work, we propose a simple approach that combines the advantages of both natural and structured generation. By allowing LLMs to reason freely until specific trigger tokens are generated, and then switching to structured generation, our method preserves the expressive power of natural language reasoning while ensuring the reliability of structured outputs. We further evaluate our approach on several datasets, covering both classification and reasoning tasks, to demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving a substantial gain of up to 27% in accuracy compared to natural generation, while requiring only a small overhead of 10-20 extra tokens."

We introduce a fast convolutional framework that fuses multiple orthogonal 2D slice stacks to recover coherent 3D structure and refines slice alignment through lightweight model-based optimization. Applied to fetal brain MRI, our approach reconstructs high-quality 3D volumes in under 10s, with 1s slice registration and accuracy on par with state-of-the-art iterative SVR pipelines, offering more than speedup. The framework uses non-rigid displacement fields to represent transformations, generalizing to other SVR problems like fetal body and placental MRI. Additionally, the fast inference time paves the way for real-time, scanner-side volumetric feedback during MRI acquisition."

The methodology addresses uncertainty through sub-Gaussian concentration bounds for route-level risk buffers and explicitly accounts for competing operational KPIs through a multi-objective formulation. Empirical analysis of prediction residuals validates the sub-Gaussian assumption underlying the risk model. From an empirical point of view, our results report improvements around 20-25\\% in operator utilization and completion rates compared with plans computed using default durations. The integration of uncertainty quantification and risk-aware optimization provides a practical framework for handling stochastic service durations in real-world routing applications."

We identify a critical failure mode of such reference-based LLM QA evaluation: when the provided reference conflicts with the judge model's parametric knowledge, the resulting scores become unreliable, substantially degrading evaluation fidelity. To study this phenomenon systematically, we introduce a controlled swapped-reference QA framework that induces reference-belief conflicts. Specifically, we replace the reference answer with an incorrect entity and construct diverse pairings of original and swapped references with correspondingly aligned candidate answers. Surprisingly, grading reliability drops sharply under swapped references across a broad set of judge models. We empirically show that this vulnerability is driven by judges' over-reliance on parametric knowledge, leading judges to disregard the given reference under conflict. Finally, we find that this failure persists under common prompt-based mitigation strategies, highlighting a fundamental limitation of LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and motivating reference-based protocols that enforce stronger adherence to the provided reference."

However, existing methods fail to properly model the temporal dimension of memory in two aspects: 1) Temporal inaccuracy: memories are organized by dialogue time rather than their actual occurrence time; 2) Temporal fragmentation: existing methods focus on point-wise memory, losing durative information that captures persistent states and evolving patterns. To address these limitations, we propose Temporal Semantic Memory (TSM), a memory framework that models semantic time for point-wise memory and supports the construction and utilization of durative memory. During memory construction, it first builds a semantic timeline rather than a dialogue one. Then, it consolidates temporally continuous and semantically related information into a durative memory. During memory utilization, it incorporates the query's temporal intent on the semantic timeline, enabling the retrieval of temporally appropriate durative memories and providing time-valid, duration-consistent context to support response generation. Experiments on LongMemEval and LoCoMo show that TSM consistently outperforms existing methods and achieves up to 12.2% absolute improvement in accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been increasing investment in the deployment of massive commercial Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations to provide global Internet connectivity. These constellations, now equipped with inter-satellite links, can serve as low-latency Internet backbones, requiring LEO satellites to act not only as access nodes for ground stations, but also as in-orbit core routers. Due to their high velocity and the resulting frequent handovers of ground gateways, LEO networks highly stress mobility procedures at both the sender and receiver endpoints. On the other hand, a growing trend in networking is the use of technologies based on the Information Centric Networking (ICN) paradigm for servicing IoT networks and sensor networks in general, as its addressing, storage, and security mechanisms are usually a good match for IoT needs. Furthermore, ICN networks possess additional characteristics that are beneficial for the massive LEO scenario. For instance, the mobility of the receiver is helped by the inherent data-forwarding procedures in their architectures. However, the mobility of the senders remains an open problem. This paper proposes a comprehensive solution to the mobility problem for massive LEO constellations using the Named-Data Networking (NDN) architecture, as it is probably the most mature ICN proposal. Our solution includes a scalable method to relate content to ground gateways and a way to address traffic to the gateway that does not require cooperation from the network routing algorithm. Moreover, our solution works without requiring modifications to the actual NDN protocol itself, so it is easy to test and deploy. Our results indicate that, for long enough handover lengths, traffic losses are negligible even for ground stations with just one satellite in sight."

TriCG takes advantage of the inherent block structure of SQD linear systems and performs substantially better than SYMMLQ. However, numerical experiments have revealed that the convergence of TriCG can be notably slow when the off-diagonal block contains a substantial number of large elliptic singular values. To address this limitation, we introduce a deflation strategy tailored for TriCG to improve its convergence behavior. Specifically, we develop a generalized Saunders--Simon--Yip process with deflated restarting to construct the deflation subspaces. Building upon this process, we propose a novel method termed TriCG with deflated restarting. The deflation subspaces can also be utilized to solve SQD linear systems with multiple right-hand sides. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the superior performance of the proposed methods."

We are currently unable to prove or disprove this regularity property, and so the weak coupling limit for these observables remains an open question. A novelty of this work is the use of the sewing lemma in the derivation of the kinetic scaling limit for almost every mometum."

PanoSAMic integrates the pre-trained Segment Anything (SAM) encoder to make use of its extensive training and integrate it into a semantic segmentation model for panoramic images using multiple modalities. We modify the SAM encoder to output multi-stage features and introduce a novel spatio-modal fusion module that allows the model to select the relevant modalities and best features from each modality for different areas of the input. Furthermore, our semantic decoder uses spherical attention and dual view fusion to overcome the distortions and edge discontinuity often associated with panoramic images.

This article presents an integrated planning and control framework for high-speed, time-optimal autonomous flight of MAVs in cluttered environments. In each replanning cycle (100 Hz), a time-optimal trajectory under polynomial presentation is generated as a reference, with the time-allocation process accelerated by imitation learning. Subsequently, a time-optimal model predictive contouring control (MPCC) incorporates safe flight corridor (SFC) constraints at variable horizon steps to enable aggressive yet safe maneuvering, while fully exploiting the MAV's dynamics. We validate the proposed framework extensively on a custom-built LiDAR-based MAV platform. Simulation results demonstrate superior aggressiveness compared to the state of the art, while real-world experiments achieve a peak speed of 18 m/s in a cluttered environment and succeed in 10 consecutive trials from diverse start points.

    "abstract": "Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) pretrained on vast knowledge corpora, advancing their knowledge manipulation-the ability to effectively recall, reason, and transfer relevant knowledge-remains challenging. Existing methods mainly leverage Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on labeled datasets to enhance LLMs' knowledge manipulation ability. However, we observe that SFT models still exhibit the known&incorrect phenomenon, where they explicitly possess relevant knowledge for a given question but fail to leverage it for correct answers. To address this challenge, we propose KALE (Knowledge-Aware LEarning)-a post-training framework that leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to generate high-quality rationales and enhance LLMs' knowledge manipulation ability. Specifically, KALE first introduces a Knowledge-Induced (KI) data synthesis method that efficiently extracts multi-hop reasoning paths from KGs to generate high-quality rationales for question-answer pairs. Then, KALE employs a Knowledge-Aware (KA) fine-tuning paradigm that enhances knowledge manipulation by internalizing rationale-guided reasoning through minimizing the KL divergence between predictions with and without rationales. Extensive experiments on eight popular benchmarks across six different LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of KALE, achieving accuracy improvements of up to 11.72% and an average of 4.18%."

The system in question is a combination of GPT-5.2 Pro by OpenAI and Aristotle by Harmonic, operated by Kevin Barreto. The final result of the system is a formal proof written in Lean, which we translate to informal mathematics in the present writeup for wider accessibility. The proved result is as follows. We show a logarithmic-gap phenomenon regarding factorial divisibility: For any constants $0<C_1<C_2$ there exist infinitely many triples $(a,b,n)\\in\\mathbb N^3$ such that \\[ a!\\,b!\\mid n!\\,(a+b-n)!\\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad C_1\\log n < a+b-n < C_2\\log n. \\] The argument reduces this to a binomial divisibility $\\binom{m+k}{k}\\mid\\binom{2m}{m}$ and studies it prime-by-prime. By Kummer's theorem, $ν_p\\binom{2m}{m}$ translates into a carry count for doubling $m$ in base $p$. We then employ a counting argument to find, in each scale $[M,2M]$, an integer $m$ whose base-$p$ expansions simultaneously force many carries when doubling $m$, for every prime $p\\le 2k$, while avoiding the rare event that one of $m+1,\\dots,m+k$ is divisible by an unusually high power of $p$. These \"carry-rich but spike-free\" choices of $m$ force the needed $p$-adic inequalities and the divisibility. The overall strategy is similar to results regarding divisors of $\\binom{2n}{n}$ studied earlier by Erdős and by Pomerance."

    "abstract": "Large language models excel across diverse domains, yet their deployment in healthcare, legal systems, and autonomous decision-making remains limited by incomplete understanding of their internal mechanisms. As these models integrate into high-stakes systems, understanding how they encode capabilities has become fundamental to interpretability research. Traditional approaches identify important modules through gradient attribution or activation analysis, assuming specific capabilities map to specific components. However, this oversimplifies neural computation: modules may contribute to multiple capabilities simultaneously, while single capabilities may distribute across multiple modules. These coarse-grained analyses fail to capture fine-grained, distributed capability encoding. We present SCALPEL (Selective Capability Ablation via Low-rank Parameter Editing for Large language models), a framework representing capabilities as low-rank parameter subspaces rather than discrete modules. Our key insight is that capabilities can be characterized by low-rank modifications distributed across layers and modules, enabling precise capability removal without affecting others. By training LoRA adapters to reduce distinguishing correct from incorrect answers while preserving general language modeling quality, SCALPEL identifies low-rank representations responsible for particular capabilities while remaining disentangled from others. Experiments across diverse capability and linguistic tasks from BLiMP demonstrate that SCALPEL successfully removes target capabilities while preserving general capabilities, providing fine-grained insights into capability distribution across parameter space. Results reveal that capabilities exhibit low-rank structure and can be selectively ablated through targeted parameter-space interventions, offering nuanced understanding of capability encoding in LLMs."

Nevertheless, research on depth-induced NED has been predominantly confined to unidirectional irregular waves, while the role of directionality remains largely unexplored. The scarce studies on multidirectional waves mainly rely on numerical simulations and have yielded conflicting results. In this work, we report on an experimental investigation of wave directionality on the depth-induced non-equilibrium wave statistics. High-order statistical moments, skewness and kurtosis, are used as proxies for the non-equilibrium wave response. Our results indicate that the directional spreading has a minor effect on decreasing the maximum values of these statistical moments. In contrast, the incidence direction plays a significant role in the non-equilibrium wave response, which is attributed to the effective bottom slope."

Modern reasoning models have widely adopted the practice of alternating SFT and RL training. However, there is no theoretical account of whether they can be decoupled. We prove that decoupling is impossible in either order: (1) SFT-then-RL coupling: RL increases SFT loss under SFT optimality and (2) RL-then-SFT coupling: SFT lowers the reward achieved by RL. Experiments on Qwen3-0.6B confirm the predicted degradation, verifying that SFT and RL cannot be separated without loss of prior performance in the post-training"

Since the inception of microresonator-based nonlinear optics, related studies have focused primarily on regimes in which photons with distinct resonant modes can interact. Although multiple comb lines can occupy a single resonance during the Kerr comb formation process, their mutual interactions have remained largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate a Kerr comb formation that is confined to a single resonance of a microresonator via dual-pumping. MHz-scale comb-line spacing reveals previously unobserved Kerr-comb dynamics, featuring parametrically driven phase multistability that can be observed directly in the temporal domain. Two laser pumps serve as phase-coupled references for heterodyne read-out, simplifying the measurements."

Conventional mean teacher (MT) methods typically employ a static approach, where the roles of the teacher and student models are fixed. However, due to the complexity of 3D vessel data, the teacher model may not always outperform the student model, leading to cognitive biases that can limit performance. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic collaborative network that allows the two models to dynamically switch their teacher-student roles. Additionally, we introduce a multi-view integration module to capture various perspectives of the inputs, mirroring the way doctors conduct medical analysis. We also incorporate adversarial supervision to constrain the shape of the segmented vessels in unlabeled data. In this process, the 3D volume is projected into 2D views to mitigate the impact of label inconsistencies. Experiments demonstrate that our DiCo method sets new state-of-the-art performance on three 3D vessel segmentation benchmarks. The code repository address is https://github.com/xujiaommcome/DiCo"

We use an ultra-deep broadband spectral survey of G+0.693-0.027, carried out with the Yebes 40 m and IRAM 30 m telescopes, to conduct the astronomical search. We report the first interstellar detection of lactaldehyde (CH$_3$CH(OH)C(O)H) and methoxyacetaldehyde (CH$_3$OCH$_2$C(O)H), together with the second detections (i.e., confirmation) of methyl acetate (CH$_3$C(O)OCH$_3$) and hydroxyacetone (CH$_3$C(O)CH$_2$OH), and new detections in this source of both $anti$- and $gauche$- conformers of ethyl formate (CH$_3$CH$_2$OC(O)H), the latter tentatively. In contrast, neither propionic acid, CH$_3$CH$_2$C(O)OH, nor glycidol, c-CH$_2$OCHCH$_2$OH (i.e., the most and the least stable species within the C$_3$H$_6$O$_2$ family, respectively) were detected, and we provide upper limits on their fractional abundances of $\\leq$1.5 $\\times$ 10$^{-10}$ and $\\leq$3.7 $\\times$ 10$^{-11}$. Interestingly, all C$_3$H$_6$O$_2$ isomers can be synthesized through radical-radical reactions on the surface of dust grains, ultimately tracing back to CO as the parent molecule. We suggest that formation of the detected isomers is mainly driven by successive hydrogenation of CO, producing CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CH$_2$OH as the primary parent species. Conversely, propionic acid is thought to originate from the oxygenation of CO via the HOCO intermediate, which help us rationalize its non-detection. Overall, our findings notably expand the known chemical inventory of the interstellar medium and provide direct observational evidence that increasingly complex chemistry involving O-bearing species occurs in space."

We demonstrate that these deviations are equally, if not better, explained by interactions between dark matter and dark energy (IDE), without requiring a time-varying DE equation of state. Using a unified framework, we analyze two IDE models--coupled quintessence and coupled fluid--against the latest CMB (Planck, ACT, SPT), DESI BAO, and SN (including DES-Dovekie recalibrated) data. Both IDE scenarios show robust evidence for non-vanishing interactions at the 3-5$σ$ level, with marginalized constraints significantly deviating from the $Λ$CDM limit. This preference persists even under DES-Dovekie SN recalibration, which weakens dynamical DE evidence. Crucially, for the same number of free parameters, IDE models provide fits to low- and high-redshift data that match or exceed the performance of the CPL dynamical DE parametrization. Our results establish IDE as a physically motivated alternative to dynamical DE, highlighting the necessity of future cosmological perturbation measurements (e.g., weak lensing, galaxy clustering) to distinguish between these paradigms."

To address these challenges, we introduce a PAM beamforming framework based on a novel convolutional formulation in the time domain, which enables efficient computation. In this framework, PAM is formulated as an inverse problem in which the forward operator maps spatiotemporal cavitation activity to recorded radio-frequency signals accounting for time-of-flight delays defined by the acquisition geometry. We then formulate a regularized inversion algorithm that incorporates prior knowledge on cavitation activity. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms classical beamforming methods, providing higher temporal resolution than frequency-domain techniques while substantially reducing computational burden compared with iterative time-domain formulations."

It is a central resource behind quantum advantage and a useful probe of the complexity of many-body quantum states. Yet standard magic quantifiers, such as the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) for qubits and the mana for qutrits, are costly to evaluate numerically, with the computational complexity growing rapidly with the number $N$ of qudits. Here we introduce efficient, numerically exact algorithms that exploit the fast Hadamard transform to compute the SRE for qubits ($d=2$) and the mana for qutrits ($d=3$) for pure states given as state vectors. Our methods reduce the runtime to $O(N d^{2N})$, an exponential improvement over the naive $O(d^{3N})$ scaling, while exposing substantial parallelism and enabling GPU acceleration. We further show how to combine the fast Hadamard transform with Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the SRE of state vectors, and we extend the approach to compute the mana of mixed states. All algorithms are implemented in the open-source Julia package HadaMAG.jl, which provides a high-performance, GPU-enabled toolbox for computing SRE and mana. The package, together with the methods developed in this work, offers a practical route to large-scale numerical studies of magic in quantum many-body systems."

Four of these correspond to classic thermal dust tracers, namely H i (HI4PI), CO (Dame et al. 2001a), Hα (WHAM, Haffner et al. (2003a, 2016)), and dust extinction (Gaia; Edenhofer et al. 2024), while the fifth is ionized carbon (C ii) emission as observed by COBE- FIRAS. We jointly fit these five templates to each frequency channel through standard multi-variate linear regression. At frequencies higher than 1 THz, we find that the dominant tracer is in fact C ii, and above 10 THz this component accounts for almost the entire fitted signal; at frequencies below 1 THz, its importance is second only to H i. We further find that all five components are well described by a modified blackbody spectral energy density (SED) up to some component-dependent maximum frequency ranging between 1 and 5 THz. In this interpretation, the C ii-correlated component is the hottest among all five, with an effective temperature of about 25 K. The Hα component has a temperature of 18 K, and, unlike the other four, is observed in absorption rather than emission. Despite the simplicity of this model, which relies only on external templates coupled to spatially isotropic SEDs, we find that it captures 98 % of the full signal root mean squared (RMS) below 1 THz. This high efficiency suggests that spatial variations in the thermal dust SED, as for instance reported by Planck and other experiments, may be more economically modelled on large angular scales in terms of a spatial mixing of individually isotropic physical components."

By deriving estimates for these Riccati systems, we establish a turnpike property for the finite-horizon mean field control problem and obtain quantitative convergence results from the social optimization problem to its mean field limit and the associated ergodic control problem."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a data-driven methodology for the control of static hydraulic impact hammers, also known as rock breakers, which are commonly used in the mining industry. The task addressed in this work is that of controlling the rock-breaker so its end-effector reaches arbitrary target poses, which is required in normal operation to place the hammer on top of rocks that need to be fractured. The proposed approach considers several constraints, such as unobserved state variables due to limited sensing and the strict requirement of using a discrete control interface at the joint level. First, the proposed methodology addresses the problem of system identification to obtain an approximate dynamic model of the hydraulic arm. This is done via supervised learning, using only teleoperation data. The learned dynamic model is then exploited to obtain a controller capable of reaching target end-effector poses. For policy synthesis, both reinforcement learning (RL) and model predictive control (MPC) algorithms are utilized and contrasted. As a case study, we consider the automation of a Bobcat E10 mini-excavator arm with a hydraulic impact hammer attached as end-effector. Using this machine, both the system identification and policy synthesis stages are studied in simulation and in the real world. The best RL-based policy consistently reaches target end-effector poses with position errors below 12 cm and pitch angle errors below 0.08 rad in the real world. Considering that the impact hammer has a 4 cm diameter chisel, this level of precision is sufficient for breaking rocks. Notably, this is accomplished by relying only on approximately 68 min of teleoperation data to train and 8 min to evaluate the dynamic model, and without performing any adjustments for a successful policy Sim2Real transfer. A demonstration of policy execution in the real world can be found in https://youtu.be/e-7tDhZ4ZgA."

    "abstract": "In operator-algebraic AQFT one routinely moves back and forth between two kinds of structure: inclusions of local algebras coming from inclusions of regions, and bimodules/intertwiners that implement the standard $L^2$-based constructions used to compare and compose observables. The obstruction to making this interplay genuinely functorial is that there are two independent compositions (restriction along inclusions and fusion/transport along bimodules) and they must be compatible on commuting spacetime diagrams, which is exactly the situation a double category is designed to encode. Part I resolves this by building a spacetime double category and a von Neumann algebra double category inspired by previous work by Orendain, and by packaging an AQFT input as a pseudo double functor whose vertical part is the Haag-Kastler net and whose squares record the required compatibilities in a well-typed way forced by commutativity. We formulate the Haag-Kastler axioms in this setup, establish the coherence needed for the construction, and work out representative examples."

This study examines the alignment between LLM-predicted confidence and human-annotated bias judgments. Focusing on gender bias, the research investigates probability confidence calibration in contexts involving gendered pronoun resolution. The goal is to evaluate if calibration metrics based on predicted confidence scores effectively capture fairness-related disparities in LLMs. The results show that, among the six state-of-the-art models, Gemma-2 demonstrates the worst calibration according to the gender bias benchmark. The primary contribution of this work is a fairness-aware evaluation of LLMs' confidence calibration, offering guidance for ethical deployment. In addition, we introduce a new calibration metric, Gender-ECE, designed to measure gender disparities in resolution tasks."

    "abstract": "We present a general theoretical approach for the quantitative description of parametric excitation of spin-wave modes in confined micromagnetic systems. This type of problem belongs to a broader class of nonlinear modal dynamics that arise across many areas of physics and engineering. The ferromagnetic sample is driven by parallel pumping with an external applied magnetic field having two tones at different frequencies, which are able to trigger parametric instability of two resonant modes. The two excited spin-wave modes interact in a strongly nonlinear fashion giving rise to quasiperiodicity, hysteresis and non-commutativity of steady-state oscillation regimes. To disentangle such a complex variety of dynamics, we develop a reduced-order model based on magnetization normal modes that is amenable of appropriate analytical treatment, leading to quantitative description of parametric instability thresholds, post-instability steady-state amplitude saturation and complete determination of phase diagrams for steady-state oscillation regimes. We have performed validation of the theory using numerical simulations. The phase diagrams allow to predict and explain all the features of the nonlinear interaction between the parametrically-excited spin-wave modes and can be directly compared with experimental results."

We analyze the linguistic and interactional features from both LLM and participant chats across 397 human-LLM conversations about socio-political issues to identify the mechanisms and conditions under which LLM explanations shape changes in political knowledge and confidence. Mediation analyses reveal that LLM explanatory richness partially supports confidence by fostering users' reflective insight, whereas its effect on knowledge gain operates entirely through users' cognitive engagement. Moderation analyses show that these effects are highly conditional and vary by political efficacy. Confidence gains depend on how high-efficacy users experience and resolve uncertainty. Knowledge gains depend on high-efficacy users' ability to leverage extended interaction, with longer conversations benefiting primarily reflective users. In summary, we find that learning from LLMs is an interactional achievement, not a uniform outcome of better explanations. The findings underscore the importance of aligning LLM explanatory behavior with users' engagement states to support effective learning in designing Human-AI interactive systems."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "System logs are crucial for monitoring and diagnosing modern computing infrastructure, but their scale and complexity require reliable and efficient automated interpretation. Since severity levels are predefined metadata in system log messages, having a model merely classify them offers limited standalone practical value, revealing little about its underlying ability to interpret system logs. We argue that severity classification is more informative when treated as a benchmark for probing runtime log comprehension rather than as an end task. Using real-world journalctl data from Linux production servers, we evaluate nine small language models (SLMs) and small reasoning language models (SRLMs) under zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) prompting. The results reveal strong stratification. Qwen3-4B achieves the highest accuracy at 95.64% with RAG, while Gemma3-1B improves from 20.25% under few-shot prompting to 85.28% with RAG. Notably, the tiny Qwen3-0.6B reaches 88.12% accuracy despite weak performance without retrieval. In contrast, several SRLMs, including Qwen3-1.7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, degrade substantially when paired with RAG. Efficiency measurements further separate models: most Gemma and Llama variants complete inference in under 1.2 seconds per log, whereas Phi-4-Mini-Reasoning exceeds 228 seconds per log while achieving <10% accuracy. These findings suggest that (1) architectural design, (2) training objectives, and (3) the ability to integrate retrieved context under strict output constraints jointly determine performance. By emphasizing small, deployable models, this benchmark aligns with real-time requirements of digital twin (DT) systems and shows that severity classification serves as a lens for evaluating model competence and real-time deployability, with implications for root cause analysis (RCA) and broader DT integration."

    "abstract": "We model intrinsic alignments (IA) in Euclid's Flagship simulation to investigate its impact on Euclid's weak lensing signal. Our IA implementation in the Flagship simulation takes into account photometric properties of galaxies as well as their dark matter host halos. We compare simulations against theory predictions, determining the parameters of two of the most widely used IA models: the Non Linear Alignment (NLA) and the Tidal Alignment and Tidal Torquing (TATT) models. We measure the amplitude of the simulated IA signal as a function of galaxy magnitude and colour in the redshift range $0.1<z<2.1$. We find that both NLA and TATT can accurately describe the IA signal in the simulation down to scales of $6$-$7 \\,h^{-1}\\,$Mpc. We measure alignment amplitudes for red galaxies comparable to those of the observations, with samples not used in the calibration procedure. For blue galaxies, our constraints are consistent with zero alignments in our first redshift bin $0.1 < z < 0.3$, but we detect a non-negligible signal at higher redshift, which is, however, consistent with the upper limits set by observational constraints. Additionally, several hydrodynamical simulations predict alignment for spiral galaxies, in agreement with our findings. Finally, the evolution of alignment with redshift is realistic and comparable to that determined in the observations. However, we find that the commonly adopted redshift power-law for IA fails to reproduce the simulation alignments above $z=1.1$. A significantly better agreement is obtained when a luminosity dependence is included, capturing the intrinsic luminosity evolution with redshift in magnitude-limited surveys. We conclude that the Flagship IA simulation is a useful tool for translating current IA constraints into predictions for IA contamination of Euclid-like samples."

Existing single-dimensional reflection methods offer insufficient improvements. We propose MyGO Poly-Reflective Chain-of-Thought (PR-CoT), a novel methodology employing structured multi-perspective reflection. After initial CoT, PR-CoT guides the LLM to self-assess its reasoning across multiple predefined angles: logical consistency, information completeness, biases/ethics, and alternative solutions. Implemented purely via prompt engineering, this process refines the initial CoT into a more robust and accurate final answer without model retraining. Experiments across arithmetic, commonsense, ethical decision-making, and logical puzzles, using GPT-three point five and GPT-four models, demonstrate PR-CoT's superior performance. It significantly outperforms traditional CoT and existing reflection methods in logical consistency and error correction, with notable gains in nuanced domains like ethical decision-making. Ablation studies, human evaluations, and qualitative analyses further validate the contribution of each reflection perspective and the overall efficacy of our poly-reflective paradigm in fostering more reliable LLM reasoning."

We present a novel, cost-effective approach using three webcams for triangulation-based tracking to approximate relative joint angles (theta) of human fingers. We also introduce a modified DexHand, a low-cost robotic hand from TheRobotStudio, to demonstrate THETA's real-time application. Data collection involved 40 distinct hand gestures using three 640x480p webcams arranged at 120-degree intervals, generating over 48,000 RGB images. Joint angles were manually determined by measuring midpoints of the MCP, PIP, and DIP finger joints. Captured RGB frames were processed using a DeepLabV3 segmentation model with a ResNet-50 backbone for multi-scale hand segmentation. The segmented images were then HSV-filtered and fed into THETA's architecture, consisting of a MobileNetV2-based CNN classifier optimized for hierarchical spatial feature extraction and a 9-channel input tensor encoding multi-perspective hand representations. The classification model maps segmented hand views into discrete joint angles, achieving 97.18% accuracy, 98.72% recall, F1 Score of 0.9274, and a precision of 0.8906. In real-time inference, THETA captures simultaneous frames, segments hand regions, filters them, and compiles a 9-channel tensor for classification. Joint-angle predictions are relayed via serial to an Arduino, enabling the DexHand to replicate hand movements. Future research will increase dataset diversity, integrate wrist tracking, and apply computer vision techniques such as OpenAI-Vision. THETA potentially ensures cost-effective, user-friendly teleoperation for medical, linguistic, and manufacturing applications."

Here, we introduce the 1-Bit Quantum Filter, a domain-specific adaptation of HHL that reformulates tracking from matrix inversion to binary ground-state filtering. By replacing high-precision phase estimation with a single-ancilla spectral threshold and exploiting the Hamiltonian's sparsity, we achieve an asymptotic gate complexity of $O(\\sqrt{N} \\log N)$, given Hamiltonian dimension $N$. We validate this approach by simulating LHCb Vertex Locator events with a toy model, and benchmark performance using the noise models of Quantinuum H2 trapped-ion and IBM Heron superconducting processors.

To resolve this, we introduce the Chain of Evidence (CoE), a novel framework that architecturally decouples and co-optimizes perceptual grounding and reasoning efficiency. CoE incorporates two core innovations: (1) A lightweight Evidence Grounding Module (EGM) that acts as a query-guided filter, dynamically identifying and extracting a compact set of high-fidelity visual evidence; and (2) An Evidence-Anchoring Protocol optimized via Reinforcement Learning. Crucially, we design a composite reward mechanism that enforces process alignment, compelling the model to strictly reference identified temporal anchors during deduction, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To enable this, we construct CoE-Instruct, a large-scale dataset (164k samples) featuring a novel dual-annotation schema for separate perception and reasoning supervision. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks, including Video-MME, MVBench, and VSI-Bench, demonstrate that CoE-enhanced models establish a new state-of-the-art. They significantly outperform existing methods in accuracy, proving CoE to be a powerful and practical paradigm for reliable video understanding."

Our framework fits a Riesz representer model to the true Riesz representer under a Bregman divergence, which includes the squared loss and the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence as special cases. We show that the squared loss corresponds to Riesz regression, and the KL divergence corresponds to tailored loss minimization, where the dual solutions correspond to stable balancing weights and entropy balancing weights, respectively, under specific model specifications. We refer to our method as generalized Riesz regression, and we refer to the associated duality as automatic covariate balancing. Our framework also generalizes density ratio fitting under a Bregman divergence to Riesz representer estimation, and it includes various applications beyond density ratio estimation. We also provide a convergence analysis for both cases where the model class is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and where it is a neural network."

To this end not only the steady state and dynamic gravity gradient torques were included, but also the effects of centrifugal acceleration on the deformable viscoelastic model of the planet. After validating the Chandler wobble response, the paper seeks to go beyond and predict the attitude response of the Earth not just over a few years but over much longer term. This requires modelling of the energy balance effects of the entire planet as a whole and not just the redistribution of mass and inertia but also the changes in the inertial properties. To this end simpler physical model of the energy balance process was included to demonstrate the sustained changes in the length of day response of the Earth over a long term. The over aim of the paper is to bring into focus the key physical processes responsible for the changes to the attitude dynamics of the Earth over a reasonable longer time frame. The overall responses of the attitude dynamics over, the short and medium terms are presented."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a practical and scalable grid-based state estimation method for high-dimensional models with invertible linear dynamics and with highly non-linear measurements, such as the nearly constant velocity model with measurements of e.g. altitude, bearing, and/or range. Unlike previous tensor decomposition-based approaches, which have largely remained at the proof-of-concept stage, the proposed method delivers an efficient and practical solution by exploiting decomposable model structure-specifically, block-diagonal dynamics and sparsely coupled measurement dimensions. The algorithm integrates a Lagrangian formulation for the time update and leverages low-rank tensor decompositions to compactly represent and effectively propagate state densities. This enables real-time estimation for models with large state dimension, significantly extending the practical reach of grid-based filters beyond their traditional low-dimensional use. Although demonstrated in the context of terrain-aided navigation, the method is applicable to a wide range of models with decomposable structure. The computational complexity and estimation accuracy depend on the specific structure of the model. All experiments are fully reproducible, with source code provided alongside this paper (GitHub link: https://github.com/pesslovany/Matlab-LagrangianPMF)."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "This thesis focuses on gravitational waves (GWs) that arise beyond linear order in cosmological perturbation theory. In recent years, scalar-induced GWs have attracted significant attention because they may serve as the observational signature of primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the early universe. The formation of PBHs requires large density perturbations, which can naturally emerge in some models of inflation. When these large density fluctuations couple, they act as a source for scalar-induced GWs at second order. In this work, we extend the existing formalism by including linear tensor fluctuations as an additional source term. This gives rise to two new classes of second-order GWs: those sourced by scalar-tensor couplings (scalar-tensor induced GWs) and those quadratic in tensor modes (tensor-tensor induced GWs). We find that the scalar-tensor contribution becomes significant if first-order tensor modes are enhanced, whilst the tensor-tensor contribution remains subdominant. Moreover, we demonstrate that the spectrum of scalar-tensor induced GWs exhibits an unphysical enhancement in the UV limit when the primordial scalar power spectrum is insufficiently peaked. To investigate whether this can be resolved, we study third-order induced GWs and their correlation with primordial GWs. We find that this new contribution suppresses the overall signal but does not cancel the unphysical enhancement. Possible explanations for this behaviour are discussed and left for future work. Finally, we explore the effect of primordial scalar non-Gaussianity on the spectrum of scalar-tensor induced GWs, building on previous results showing its impact on scalar-induced GWs."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a sampled-data framework for the safe navigation of controlled agents in environments cluttered with obstacles governed by uncertain linear dynamics. Collision-free motion is achieved by combining Control Barrier Function (CBF)-based safety filtering with set-valued state estimation using Constrained Convex Generators (CCGs). At each sampling time, a CCG estimate of each obstacle is obtained using a finite-horizon guaranteed estimation scheme and propagated over the sampling interval to obtain a CCG-valued flow that describes the estimated obstacle evolution. However, since CCGs are defined indirectly - as an affine transformation of a generator set subject to equality constraints, rather than as a sublevel set of a scalar function - converting the estimated obstacle flows into CBFs is a nontrivial task. One of the main contributions of this paper is a procedure to perform this conversion, ultimately yielding a CBF via a convex optimization problem whose validity is established by the Implicit Function Theorem. The resulting obstacle-specific CBFs are then merged into a single CBF that is used to design a safe controller through the standard Quadratic Program (QP)-based approach. Since CCGs support Minkowski sums, the proposed framework also naturally handles rigid-body agents and generalizes existing CBF-based rigid-body navigation designs to arbitrary agent and obstacle geometries. While the main contribution is general, the paper primarily focuses on agents with first-order control-affine dynamics and second-order strict-feedback dynamics. Simulation examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Carbon taxes are increasingly popular among policymakers but remain politically contentious. A key challenge relates to their distributional impacts; the extent to which tax burdens differ across population groups. As a response, a growing number of studies analyse their distributional impact ex-ante, commonly relying on microsimulation models. However, distributional impact estimates differ across models due to differences in simulated tax designs, assumptions, modelled components, data sources, and outcome metrics. This study comprehensively reviews methodological choices made in constructing microsimulation models designed to simulate the impacts of carbon taxation and discusses how these choices affect the interpretation of results. It conducts a meta-analysis to assess the influence of modelling choices on distributional impact estimates by estimating a probit model on a sample of 217 estimates across 71 countries. The literature review highlights substantial diversity in modelling choices, with no standard practice emerging. The meta-analysis shows that studies modelling carbon taxes on imported emissions are significantly less likely to find regressive results, while indirect emission coverage has ambiguous effects on regressivity, suggesting that a carbon border adjustment mechanism may reduce carbon tax regressivity. Further, we find that estimates using older datasets, using explicit tax progressivity or income inequality measures, and accounting for household behaviour are associated with a lower likelihood of finding regressive estimates, while the inclusion of general equilibrium effects increases this likelihood."

Our proposed saliency methods -- SplitCAM and SplitLRP -- improve on state of the art results on both VGG16 and Resnet18 networks on ImageNet-S across all Quantus saliency metric categories.

However, current simulators suffer from two critical limitations: (1) they fail to capture the behavioral diversity of real-world seekers, often portraying them as overly cooperative, and (2) they lack the controllability required to simulate specific seeker profiles. To address these challenges, we present a controllable seeker simulator driven by nine psychological and linguistic features that underpin seeker behavior. Using authentic Reddit conversations, we train our model via a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, which effectively differentiates diverse seeker behaviors into specialized parameter subspaces, thereby enhancing fine-grained controllability. Our simulator achieves superior profile adherence and behavioral diversity compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, evaluating 7 prominent supporter models with our system uncovers previously obscured performance degradations. These findings underscore the utility of our framework in providing a more faithful and stress-tested evaluation for emotional support chatbots."

We take a more structured approach, distinguishing meta-level reasoning (denoting the process of reasoning about intermediate steps required to solve a task) from object-level reasoning (which concerns the low-level execution of the aforementioned steps.) We design a novel question answering task, which is based around the values of geopolitical indicators for various countries over various years. Questions require breaking down into intermediate steps, retrieval of data, and mathematical operations over that data. The meta-level reasoning ability of LLMs is analysed by examining the selection of appropriate tools for answering questions. To bring greater depth to the analysis of LLMs beyond final answer accuracy, our task contains 'essential actions' against which we can compare the tool call output of LLMs to infer the strength of reasoning ability. We find that LLMs demonstrate good meta-level reasoning on our task, yet are flawed in some aspects of task understanding. We find that n-shot prompting has little effect on accuracy; error messages encountered do not often deteriorate performance; and provide additional evidence for the poor numeracy of LLMs. Finally, we discuss the generalisation and limitation of our findings to other task domains."

In Strategic Deconstruction Logic, a destructive agent (the demon) removes edges up to a certain cost. In Strategic Construction Logic, a constructive agent (the angel) adds edges within a cost bound. Finally, Strategic Update Logic combines both agents, who may cooperate or compete.

For an Ornstein Uhlenbeck environment we derive a closed non markovian expression for the coherence dynamics and obtain a de-coherence time that scales as the square root of the bath correlation time. In the singular limit of vanishing bath memory our result reduces exactly to Tegmark's bound. Numerical simulations based on an exact pseudomode mapping confirm the predicted scaling. These findings demonstrate that Tegmark's result applies only in the Markovian limit and does not rule out mesoscopic quantum coherence in structured biological media."

    "abstract": "A new wave of work on covariance cleaning and nonlinear shrinkage has delivered asymptotically optimal analytical solutions for large covariance matrices. Building on this progress, these ideas have been generalized to empirical cross-covariance matrices, whose singular-value shrinkage characterizes comovements between one set of assets and another. Existing analytical cross-covariance cleaners are derived under strong stationarity and large-sample assumptions, and they typically rely on mesoscopic regularity conditions such as bounded spectra; macroscopic common modes (e.g., a global market factor) violate these conditions. When applied to real equity returns, where dependence structures drift over time and global modes are prominent, we find that these theoretically optimal formulas do not translate into robust out-of-sample performance. We address this gap by designing a random-matrix-inspired neural architecture that operates in the empirical singular-vector basis and learns a nonlinear mapping from empirical singular values to their corresponding cleaned values. By construction, the network can recover the analytical solution as a special case, yet it remains flexible enough to adapt to non-stationary dynamics and mode-driven distortions. Trained on a long history of equity returns, the proposed method achieves a more favorable bias-variance trade-off than purely analytical cleaners and delivers systematically lower out-of-sample cross-covariance prediction errors. Our results demonstrate that combining random-matrix theory with machine learning makes asymptotic theories practically effective in realistic time-varying markets."

The combined use of these methodologies demonstrates a notable synergistic effect, leading to end-to-end results that surpass those reached by state-of-the-art methods and established commercial systems. Our experiments also underscore the efficacy of synthetic data in mitigating challenges posed by limited training data, enabling remarkable results to be achieved even with small fractions of the original training data.

Among numerous works that have been proposed in recent years, layer-wise token pruning approaches, which select a subset of tokens at particular layers to retain in KV cache and prune others, are one of the most popular schemes. They primarily adopt a set of pre-defined layers, at which tokens are selected. Such design is inflexible in the sense that the accuracy significantly varies across tasks and deteriorates in harder tasks such as KV retrieval. In this paper, we propose ASL, a training-free method that adaptively chooses the selection layer for KV cache reduction, exploiting the variance of token ranks ordered by attention score. The proposed method balances the performance across different tasks while meeting the user-specified KV budget requirement. ASL operates during the prefilling stage and can be jointly used with existing KV cache reduction methods such as SnapKV to optimize the decoding stage. By evaluations on the InfiniteBench, RULER, and NIAH benchmarks, we show that equipped with one-shot token selection, where tokens are selected at a layer and propagated to deeper layers, ASL outperforms state-of-the-art layer-wise token selection methods in accuracy while maintaining decoding speed and KV cache reduction."

In this paper, we propose Test-Time Tool Evolution (TTE), a new paradigm that enables agents to synthesize, verify, and evolve executable tools during inference. By transforming tools from fixed resources into problem-driven artifacts, TTE overcomes the rigidity and long-tail limitations of static tool libraries. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce SciEvo, a benchmark comprising 1,590 scientific reasoning tasks supported by 925 automatically evolved tools. Extensive experiments show that TTE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and tool efficiency, while enabling effective cross-domain adaptation of computational tools. The code and benchmark have been released at https://github.com/lujiaxuan0520/Test-Time-Tool-Evol."

In the case we can, the centre and the ``direction'' of rotation may be restricted. Simplifying, we consider possibility of rotation of a polytope within another one of the same dimension and give a criterion for the possibility. Consider the particular case of simplices of the same dimension assuming that the vertices of the inner simplex are contained in different facets of the outer one. Premising further that simplices are even dimensional, rotation is possible in a very general situation. However, in dimension 3, the possible case is not not general. Even in these elementary phenomena, the parity of the dimension seems to yield difference."

The sensor performs a local quantization, and transmits a 1-bit message to an estimation center through a wireless medium where the transmission of information is vulnerable to attackers. Both eavesdroppers and data tampering attackers are considered in our setting. A differential privacy method is used to protect the sensitive information against eavesdroppers. Then, a recursive projection algorithm is proposed such that the estimation center achieves the almost sure convergence and mean-square convergence when quantized measurements, differential privacy, and data tampering attacks are considered in a uniform framework. A privacy analysis including the convergence rate with privacy or without privacy is given. Further, we extend the problem to multi-agent systems. For this case, a distributed recursive projection algorithm is proposed with guaranteed almost sure and mean square convergence. A simulation example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms."

Towards this goal, we introduce PoT, a semi-verifiable benchmarking framework that links scientific idea judgments to downstream signals that become observable later (e.g., citations and shifts in researchers' agendas). PoT freezes a pre-cutoff snapshot of evidence in an offline sandbox and asks models to forecast post-cutoff outcomes, enabling verifiable evaluation when ground truth arrives, scalable benchmarking without exhaustive expert annotation, and analysis of human-model misalignment against signals such as peer-review awards. In addition, PoT provides a controlled testbed for agent-based research judgments that evaluate scientific ideas, comparing tool-using agents to non-agent baselines under prompt ablations and budget scaling. Across 30,000+ instances spanning four benchmark domains, we find that, compared with non-agent baselines, higher interaction budgets generally improve agent performance, while the benefit of tool use is strongly task-dependent. By combining time-partitioned, future-verifiable targets with an offline sandbox for tool use, PoT supports scalable evaluation of agents on future-facing scientific idea judgment tasks."

To fill this gap, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study evaluating 29 LLMs on object-oriented design (OOD) tasks. Owing to the lack of standardized benchmarks and metrics, we introduce OODEval, a manually constructed benchmark comprising 50 OOD tasks of varying difficulty, and OODEval-Human, the first human-rated OOD benchmark, which includes 940 undergraduate-submitted class diagrams evaluated by instructors. We further propose CLUE (Class Likeness Unified Evaluation), a unified metric set that assesses both global correctness and fine-grained design quality in class diagram generation. Using these benchmarks and metrics, we investigate five research questions: overall correctness, comparison with humans, model dimension analysis, task feature analysis, and bad case analysis. The results indicate that while LLMs achieve high syntactic accuracy, they exhibit substantial semantic deficiencies, particularly in method and relationship generation. Among the evaluated models, Qwen3-Coder-30B achieves the best overall performance, rivaling DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4o, while Gemma3-4B-IT outperforms GPT-4o-Mini despite its smaller parameter scale. Although top-performing LLMs nearly match the average performance of undergraduates, they remain significantly below the level of the best human designers. Further analysis shows that parameter scale, code specialization, and instruction tuning strongly influence performance, whereas increased design complexity and lower requirement readability degrade it. Bad case analysis reveals common failure modes, including keyword misuse, missing classes or relationships, and omitted methods."

The joint detection of multiple cosmic messengers can also elevate the significance of the common observation even when some or all of the constituent messengers are sub-threshold, i.e. not significant enough to declare their detection individually. Using data from the LIGO, Virgo, and IceCube observatories, including sub-threshold events, we searched for common sources of gravitational waves and high-energy neutrinos during the third observing run of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. Our search did not identify significant joint sources. We derive constraints on the rate densities of joint sources.

    "abstract": "Bridge scour is a complex phenomenon combining hydrological, geotechnical and structural processes. Bridge scour is the leading cause of bridge collapse, which can bring catastrophic consequences including the loss of life. Estimating scour on bridges is an important task for engineers assessing bridge system performance. Overestimation of scour depths during design may lead to excess spendings on construction whereas underestimation can lead to the collapse of a bridge. Many empirical equations have been developed over the years to assess scour depth at bridge piers. These equations have only been calibrated with laboratory data or very few field data. This paper compares eight equations including the UK CIRIA C742 approach to establish their accuracy using the open access USGS pier-scour database for both field and laboratory conditions. A one-at-the-time sensitivity assessment and a global sensitivity analysis were then applied to identify the most significant parameters in the eight scour equations. The paper shows that using a global approach, i.e. one where all parameters are varied simultaneously, provides more insights than a traditional one-at-the-time approach. The main findings are that the CIRIA and Froehlich equations are the most accurate equations for field conditions, and that angle of attack, pier shape and the approach flow depth are the most influential parameters. Efforts to reduce uncertainty of these three parameters would maximise increase of scour estimate precision."

    "abstract": "Timing analyses of gamma-ray pulsars in the Fermi Large Area Telescope data set can provide sensitive probes of many astrophysical processes, including timing noise in young pulsars, orbital period variations in redback binaries, and the stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB). These goals can require careful accounting of stochastic noise processes, but existing methods developed to achieve this in radio pulsar timing analyses cannot be immediately applied to the discrete gamma-ray arrival time data. To address this, we have developed a new method for timing gamma-ray pulsars, in which the timing model fit is transformed into a weighted least squares problem by randomly assigning each photon to an individual Gaussian component of a template pulse profile. These random assignments are then numerically marginalised over through a Gibbs sampling scheme. This method allows for efficient estimation of timing and noise model parameters, while taking into account uncertainties in the pulse profile shape. We simulated Fermi-LAT data sets for gamma-ray pulsars with power-law timing noise processes, showing that this method provides robust estimates of timing noise parameters. We also describe a Gaussian-process model for orbital period variations in black-widow and redback binary systems that can be fit using this new timing method. We demonstrate this method on the black-widow binary millisecond pulsar B1957+20, where the orbital period varies significantly over the LAT data, but which provides one of the most stringent gamma-ray upper limits on the GWB."

The approach aligns financial statement reference dates with evaluation dates, mitigating bias arising from publication delays and asynchronous data sources. It is based on a two-step temporal decomposition that at first estimates annual probabilities of default (PDs) anchored to balance-sheet reference dates (December 31st) through a static model. Then it models the monthly evolution of PDs using higher-frequency behavioral data. Finally, we employ stacking-based architecture to aggregate multiple scoring systems, each capturing complementary aspects of default risk, into a unified predictive model. In this way, first level model outputs are treated as learned representations that encode non-linear relationships in financial and behavioral indicators, allowing integration of new expert-based features without retraining base models. This design provides a coherent and interpretable solution to challenges typical of low-default environments, including heterogeneous default definitions and reporting delays. Empirical validation shows that the framework effectively captures credit risk evolution over time, improving temporal consistency and predictive stability relative to standard ensemble methods."

The complex relationships existing between nuclear matter and neutron star properties are investigated. The focus is on their nonlinearities and interdependencies. In our analysis, we apply a machine learning algorithm known as symbolic regression, paired with principal component analysis, to datasets generated from Bayesian inference over relativistic mean-field models. A systematic Principal Component Analysis has allowed to break down the percentage contribution of each element or feature in the relationships obtained. This study examines two main models (datasets): the NL model, which includes nucleonic degrees of freedom; and the NL-hyp model, which includes hyperons in addition to nucleons. Our analysis confirms a robust correlation between the tidal deformability of a 1.4 \\(M_\\odot\\) neutron star and $β$-equilibrium pressure at twice the nuclear saturation density. This correlation remains once hyperons are included. The contribution of the different nuclear matter properties at saturation to the radius and tidal deformability was calculated. It was shown that the isovector properties have the largest impact, with a contribution of about 90\\%. We also studied the relationship between the proton fraction at different densities and various symmetry energy parameters defined at saturation density. For the hyperon data set, we took into account the effects of the negatively charged hyperon $Ξ$ in order to recover the relationships. Our study reveals the individual impact of various symmetry energy parameters on proton fractions at different densities."

    "abstract": "This paper develops an approach for multi-step forecasting of dynamical systems by integrating probabilistic input forecasting with physics-informed output prediction. Accurate multi-step forecasting of time series systems is important for the automatic control and optimization of physical processes, enabling more precise decision-making. While mechanistic-based and data-driven machine learning (ML) approaches have been employed for time series forecasting, they face significant limitations. Incomplete knowledge of process mathematical models limits mechanistic-based direct employment, while purely data-driven ML models struggle with dynamic environments, leading to poor generalization. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a dual-level strategy for physics-informed forecasting of dynamical systems. On the first level, input variables are forecast using a hybrid method that integrates a long short-term memory (LSTM) network into probabilistic state transition models (STMs). On the second level, these stochastically predicted inputs are sequentially fed into a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to generate multi-step output predictions. The experimental results of the paper demonstrate that the hybrid input forecasting models achieve a higher log-likelihood and lower mean squared errors (MSE) compared to conventional STMs. Furthermore, the PINNs driven by the input forecasting models outperform their purely data-driven counterparts in terms of MSE and log-likelihood, exhibiting stronger generalization and forecasting performance across multiple test cases."

The approximation space for the displacement is made of vectors values attached to each vertex, edge, face, and element, while the Lagrange multiplier space is approximated by piecewise constant vectors on each fracture face. The displacement degrees of freedom allow reconstruct piecewise quadratic approximations of this field. We prove a discrete Korn inequality that account for the fractures, as well as an inf-sup condition (in a non-standard $H^{-1/2}$-norm) between the discrete Lagrange multiplier space and the discrete displacement space. We provide an in-depth error analysis of the scheme and show that, contrary to usual low-order nodal-based schemes, our method is robust in the quasi-incompressible limit for the primal variable~(displacement). An extensive set of numerical experiments confirms the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the practical accuracy and robustness of the scheme."

The branching ratio for $T_{4c} \\to π^+π^-(K^+K^-)$ is on the order of $10^{-8}$, making it currently unobservable in existing experiments. The factorization of $T_{4c,b}$ into light hadrons shares similarities with the decay $J/ψ\\to p\\bar{p}$. However, unlike the latter process, the decay $T_{4c,b} \\to π^+π^-(K^+K^-)$ exhibits unique features that arise only in processes involving multiple incoming or outgoing particles. One such feature is the necessity of maintaining the $i\\varepsilon$-prescription for the denominators or propagators due to the divergences in the kinematic region of interest. Employing the sector decomposition method, along with the aid of the Cheng-Wu theorem and the {\\tt QHull} program, we present a systematic approach to handle the convolutions and phase-space integrations.

However, the evolution of the microstructure and morphology near the percolation threshold, and its connection to the resulting magnetic and magnetotransport behavior in low-dimensional magnetic heterostructures, remain poorly understood. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of the structural, microstructural, and magnetotransport properties of Si/Fe bilayers by varying the Fe layer thickness. X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and magnetisation data reveal a percolation-driven transition from a continuous metallic film to percolative network structure of grains when tFe decreases below 30 Angstrom. Transport measurements involving longitudinal resistivity (rho), and the anomalous Hall resistivity (rho_A,h,s) show clear divergence near the percolation threshold. The purely electronic conduction channels (rho) evolve more gradually as compared to the combined electronic and magnetic ones rho_A,h,s. The percolative analysis of the structural, magnetic, and magnetotransport data yields a critical exponent in the range of 0.78 to 1.16, consistent with that of 2D-disordered systems. The AHE scaling relation between the rho_A,h,s and rho reveals a crossover of the AHE mechanism from a mixed intrinsic/side-jump contribution with a minor skew scattering component (n ~ 1.42) in the thick, low-resistive samples (tFe > 30 Angstrom) to a skew-scattering-dominant mechanism (n = 0.62) in the high-resistive films (tFe <= 30 Angstrom). This crossover coincides with the onset of structural and magnetic connectivity between the grains. Furthermore, these findings underscore the interlink between microstructure, morphology, magnetism, and Hall transport under a percolation framework."

    "abstract": "Multi-conflict traffic is ubiquitous. Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) offer unprecedented opportunities to enhance safety, reduce emissions, and increase throughput through precise coordination and automation. However, existing CAV strategies remain confined to specialized scenarios, such as highway on-ramp merging or single-lane roundabouts, and traditional traffic signals sacrifice efficiency for safety via rigid phasing and all-red intervals. In this paper, we present Cyclic Modulation Control of Multi-Conflict Connected Automated Traffic (CMAT), a unified, geometry-agnostic framework that embeds each conflict point into a repeating sequence of \"micro-phases\". Vehicles dynamically form platoons with demand-responsive sizes and negotiate time slots for occupying conflict points, enabling collision-free traversal and high intersection utilization. CMAT aims to minimize delay, guarantee safety, and accommodate arbitrary merging, diverging, and crossing patterns without manual retuning. We formalize CMAT as a mixed-integer linear programming model constructed on a directed graph abstracted from the physical intersection layout. The performance of CMAT is evaluated across a suite of multi-conflict tests, including simple two-way crossings, four-leg intersections, complex connected intersections. The results demonstrate substantial reductions in delay and significant throughput improvements compared with state-of-the-art CAV coordination methods and traditional signal timing strategies."

    "abstract": "Anabelian geometry suggests that, for suitably geometric objects, their étale fundamental group determines the object up to isomorphism. From a group-theoretic viewpoint, this philosophy requires rigidity properties of the associated étale fundamental groups, which often follow from their center-freeness. In fact, some profinite groups arising from anabelian geometry are center-free. In the present paper, we investigate how such center-freeness behaves when passing to maximal $m$-step solvable quotients for any integer $m\\geq 2$. In particular, we show that the maximal $m$-step solvable quotient of the geometric étale fundamental group of a hyperbolic curve over a field of characteristic $0$ is center-free. Furthermore, we show that this implies the injectivity statement, i.e., the rigidity property, of the $m$-step solvable Grothendieck conjecture."

Enhanced multimodal representations are integrated with LLMs via pseudo token injection and prompt-based conditioning, enabling a single generative framework to handle both classification and regression through natural language generation. We employ LoRA fine-tuning for computational efficiency.

Various limits of this system correspond to well-known models from quantum optics, namely, the narrow resonance limit gives the Rabi system, the wide resonance limit gives the Bixon-Jortner system, the wide resonance, true continuum limit gives the Wigner-Weisskopf system, and the fixed resonance, true continuum limit gives a system that is typically studied by methods developed by Fano. We give a semi-analytical solution of the eigenvalue problem by reducing it to a transcendental equation, and demonstrate the aforementioned limiting behaviors. We then study the dynamics of the initial discrete state numerically, and show that it gives a wide range of behaviors in various limiting cases as predicted by our asymptotic theory including exponential decay, revivals, Rabi oscillations, and damped oscillations. The ability of this system to interpolate between such a rich set of behaviors and existing model systems, and the accessibility of a semi-analytical solution, make it a useful model system in quantum optics and related fields."

Although deep learning approaches, particularly those leveraging Contrastive Learning (CL), are prominent for MTS representation, existing CL-based models face two key limitations: 1) neglecting clustering information during positive/negative sample pair construction, and 2) introducing unreasonable inductive biases, e.g., destroying time dependence and periodicity through augmentation strategies, compromising representation quality. This paper, therefore, proposes a Temporal-Frequency Enhanced Contrastive (TFEC) learning framework. To preserve temporal structure while generating low-distortion representations, a temporal-frequency Co-EnHancement (CoEH) mechanism is introduced. Accordingly, a synergistic dual-path representation and cluster distribution learning framework is designed to jointly optimize cluster structure and representation fidelity. Experiments on six real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate TFEC's superiority, achieving 4.48% average NMI gains over SOTA methods, with ablation studies validating the design.

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving systems rely heavily on multi-view images to ensure accurate perception and robust decision-making. To effectively develop and evaluate perception stacks and planning algorithms, realistic closed-loop simulators are indispensable. While 3D reconstruction techniques such as Gaussian Splatting offer promising avenues for simulator construction, the rendered novel views often exhibit artifacts, particularly in extrapolated perspectives or when available observations are sparse. We introduce ViewMorpher3D, a multi-view image enhancement framework based on image diffusion models, designed to elevate photorealism and multi-view coherence in driving scenes. Unlike single-view approaches, ViewMorpher3D jointly processes a set of rendered views conditioned on camera poses, 3D geometric priors, and temporally adjacent or spatially overlapping reference views. This enables the model to infer missing details, suppress rendering artifacts, and enforce cross-view consistency. Our framework accommodates variable numbers of cameras and flexible reference/target view configurations, making it adaptable to diverse sensor setups. Experiments on real-world driving datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in image quality metrics, effectively reducing artifacts while preserving geometric fidelity."

    "abstract": "Clustering with bandit feedback refers to the problem of partitioning a set of items, where the clustering algorithm can sequentially query the items to receive noisy observations. The problem is formally posed as the task of partitioning the arms of an N-armed stochastic bandit according to their underlying distributions, grouping two arms together if and only if they share the same distribution, using samples collected sequentially and adaptively. This setting has gained attention in recent years due to its applicability in recommendation systems and crowdsourcing. Existing works on clustering with bandit feedback rely on a strong assumption that the underlying distributions are sub-Gaussian. As a consequence, the existing methods mainly cover settings with linearly-separable clusters, which has little practical relevance. We introduce a framework of ``nonparametric clustering with bandit feedback'', where the underlying arm distributions are not constrained to any parametric, and hence, it is applicable for active clustering of real-world datasets. We adopt a kernel-based approach, which allows us to reformulate the nonparametric problem as the task of clustering the arms according to their kernel mean embeddings in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Building on this formulation, we introduce the KABC algorithm with theoretical correctness guarantees and analyze its sampling budget. We introduce a notion of signal-to-noise ratio for this problem that depends on the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) between the arm distributions and on their variance in the RKHS. Our algorithm is adaptive to this unknown quantity: it does not require it as an input yet achieves instance-dependent guarantees."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel statistical approach that aims at the identification of valid and useful patterns in handwriting examination via Bayesian modeling. Starting from a sample of characters selected among 13 French native writers, an accurate loop reconstruction can be achieved through Fourier analysis. The contour shape of handwritten characters can be described by the first four pairs of Fourier coefficients and by the surface size. Six Bayesian models are considered for such handwritten features. These models arise from two likelihood structures: (a) a multivariate Normal model, and (b) a MANOVA model that accounts for character-level variability. For each likelihood, three different prior formulations are examined, resulting in distinct Bayesian models: (i) a conjugate Normal-Inverse-Wishart prior, (ii) a hierarchical Normal-Inverse-Wishart prior, and (iii) a Normal-LogNormal-LKJ prior specification. The hierarchical prior formulations are of primary interest because they can incorporate the between-writers variability, a distinguishing element that sets writers apart. These approaches do not allow calculation of the marginal likelihood in a closed-form expression. Therefore, bridge sampling is used to estimate it. The Bayes factor is estimated to compare the performance of the proposed models and to evaluate their efficiency for discriminating purposes. Bayesian MANOVA with Normal-LogNormal-LKJ prior showed an overall better performance, in terms of discriminatory capacity and model fitting. Finally, a sensitivity analysis for the elicitation of the prior distribution parameters is performed."

We address this gap by introducing Loci Similes, a benchmark for Latin intertextuality detection comprising of a curated dataset of ~172k text segments containing 545 expert-verified parallels linking Late Antique authors to a corpus of classical authors.

    "abstract": "Protein phase transitions govern numerous diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. In Parkinson's disease, distinct species of the protein alpha-synuclein undergo phase transitions from highly disordered to ordered beta-rich states. The emerging species and transitions between them can be reshaped by chaperones, small molecules, peptides or antibodies. Here, we use coarse-grained simulations to understand the effect of modulators on the thermodynamics and kinetics of alpha-synuclein transformations and phase transitions. Each protein is represented as a single morphing particle that transforms from a soft sphere (disordered state) to a hard spherocylinder (beta-rich state), while modulators are modeled as soft isotropic particles mimicking small peptides. The results show that purely repulsive modulators do not alter the final outcome, i.e. fibrils form following the same mechanisms independently of the modulator concentration. Attractive interactions towards the disordered protein slow down fibril formation in a dose-dependent manner by stabilizing intermediate species, and strong attraction yields persistent disordered heteroclusters. In contrast, specific attraction to the beta-rich state results in shorter fibrils through direct modulator surface \"capping\" that introduce kinetic barriers to monomer templating at the fibril ends and inhibit lateral attachment. Together, these results link modulator properties and environmental conditions to the effects on nucleation, fibril elongation and off-pathway trapping, providing a quantitative roadmap for selecting modulator properties and strategies that redirect phase transitions toward desirable endpoints. Additionally, they provide guiding principles for the development of intervention strategies and the engineering of novel materials with tunable and responsive properties."

This issue can lead to model deception, a problem that current literature has not fully solved, where the seller misrepresents model performance to earn more. We propose a game-theoretic approach, adding a verification step in the ML model market that lets buyers check model quality before buying. However, this method can be expensive and offers imperfect information, making it harder for buyers to decide. Our analysis reveals that a seller might probabilistically conduct model deception considering the chance of model verification. This deception probability decreases with the verification accuracy and increases with the verification cost. To maximize seller payoff, we further design optimal pricing schemes accounting for heterogeneous buyers' strategic behaviors. Interestingly, we find that reducing information asymmetry benefits both the seller and buyer. Meanwhile, protecting buyer order information doesn't improve the payoff for the buyer or the seller. These findings highlight the importance of reducing information asymmetry in ML model trading and open new directions for future research."

However, achieving high-fidelity segmentation remains challenging due to adhesion artifacts in naturally occluded scans, which are caused by low contrast and indistinct inter-arch boundaries. To address these limitations, we propose the Anatomy Aware Cascade Network (AACNet), a coarse-to-fine framework designed to resolve boundary ambiguity while maintaining global structural consistency. Specifically, we introduce two mechanisms: the Ambiguity Gated Boundary Refiner (AGBR) and the Signed Distance Map guided Anatomical Attention (SDMAA). The AGBR employs an entropy based gating mechanism to perform targeted feature rectification in high uncertainty transition zones. Meanwhile, the SDMAA integrates implicit geometric constraints via signed distance map to enforce topological consistency, preventing the loss of spatial details associated with standard pooling. Experimental results on a dataset of 125 CBCT volumes demonstrate that AACNet achieves a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 90.17 \\% and a 95\\% Hausdorff Distance of 3.63 mm, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong generalization on an external dataset with an HD95 of 2.19 mm, validating its reliability for downstream clinical applications such as surgical planning.

The candidate topological superconductor PdTe has recently been proposed to host a nodeless surface gap on top of a nodal bulk state, but their direct identification and mutual coupling remained experimentally elusive. Here, we employ magnetic-field-dependent Andreev reflection spectroscopy to spectroscopically disentangle these components. At zero magnetic field, the spectra exhibit a BCS-like gap structure, consistent with dominant transport through a fully gapped surface superconducting state. Strikingly, even a weak magnetic field leads to an abrupt suppression of the Andreev-enhanced conductance (AEC), while a residual AEC, attributable to the nodal bulk state, persists to much higher magnetic fields. The transition is accompanied by pronounced magnetic hysteresis pointing to the existence of vortex dynamics at low fields. Our findings suggest that the nodal bulk gap facilitates early vortex entry, which in turn disrupts the fragile surface superconductivity. These results establish a field-tunable decoupling of surface and bulk superconductivity and illustrate how distinct gap topologies can shape the global superconducting order in multichannel systems."

We investigate whether Scalar--Tensor--Vector Gravity (STVG-MOG) can provide a consistent explanation for an enhanced large-scale anisotropic dipole without violating existing constraints from early-universe cosmology, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole, galaxy dynamics, weak lensing, or the observed late-time matter power spectrum. The radio number-count dipole probes ultra-large-scale, anisotropic structure and coherent gravitational response, rather than virialized dynamics or linear growth alone. In STVG-MOG, a scale- and time-dependent effective gravitational coupling preserves standard cosmological evolution at early times and on small to intermediate scales, while amplifying gravitational response on gigaparsec scales. This scale-selective enhancement can increase the large-scale structure contribution to the radio dipole without overproducing power on smaller scales. If the observed dipole excess reflects a physical cosmological signal rather than residual systematics, STVG-MOG offers a viable and testable alternative interpretation. It is demonstrated that the radio dipole anomaly provides a novel probe of gravitational physics on the largest observable scales."

    "abstract": "This study proposes a framework for incorporating wavenumber-domain acoustic reflection coefficients into sound field analysis to characterize direction-dependent material reflection and scattering phenomena. The reflection coefficient is defined as the amplitude ratio between incident and reflected waves for each propagation direction and is estimated from spatial Fourier transforms of the incident and reflected sound fields. The resulting wavenumber-domain reflection coefficients are converted into an acoustic admittance representation that is directly compatible with numerical methods such as the Boundary Element Method (BEM), enabling simulation of reflections beyond simple specular components. Unlike conventional extended reaction models, the proposed approach avoids explicit modeling of the material interior. This significantly reduces computational cost while allowing direct use of measured data, empirical models, or user-defined directional reflection characteristics. The validity of the proposed formulation was previously demonstrated by the authors through two-dimensional sound field simulations, in which accurate reproduction of direction-dependent reflection behavior was confirmed. In the present work, the framework is extended to three-dimensional analysis, demonstrating its applicability to more realistic and complex acoustic environments. The proposed approach provides a practical and flexible tool for simulating direction-dependent acoustic reflections and scattering, with potential applications in architectural acoustics, material characterization, and noise control."

In this paper, we show that in finite blocklength regime, the SK scheme is not optimal, and propose a modified SK scheme which may perform better than the classical one. Besides this, this paper establishes a finite blocklength converse for the AWGN wiretap channel with feedback, which can also be viewed as a converse for the same model without secrecy constraint.

The heliocentric distances at which the disruptions typically occur are tens of solar radii, which is too far from the Sun for asteroids to be destroyed by sublimation and tidal disruption. The typical disruption distance also appears to be larger for darker asteroids. Here, by carrying out irradiance experiments in vacuum that replicate the conditions in the near-Sun environment, we show that CI meteorite simulants are destroyed within minutes when exposed to the level of solar irradiance encountered at heliocentric distances of up to about 0.2 au. Our results provide an explanation for the scarcity of dark, carbonaceous asteroids with perihelion distances less than 0.2 au, and for the observed mass-loss rate of the asteroid-like object 322P/SOHO~1 assuming its composition is similar to CI carbonaceous chondrites."

More specifically, we show how recognition performance evolves depending on the size of the LLM used. Moreover, we experiment on the use of knowledge distillation techniques to fine-tune smaller LLMs with HAR reasoning examples generated by larger LLMs. We show that such fine-tuned models can perform almost as well as the largest LLMs, while having 50 times less parameters."

    "abstract": "Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) aims to solve cooperative decision-making problems in multi-agent systems using pre-collected datasets. Existing offline MARL methods primarily constrain training within the dataset distribution, resulting in overly conservative policies that struggle to generalize beyond the support of the data. While model-based approaches offer a promising solution by expanding the original dataset with synthetic data generated from a learned world model, the high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and complexity of multi-agent systems make it challenging to accurately estimate the transitions and reward functions in offline MARL. Given the difficulty of directly modeling joint dynamics, we propose a local-to-global (LOGO) world model, a novel framework that leverages local predictions-which are easier to estimate-to infer global state dynamics, thus improving prediction accuracy while implicitly capturing agent-wise dependencies. Using the trained world model, we generate synthetic data to augment the original dataset, expanding the effective state-action space. To ensure reliable policy learning, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware sampling mechanism that adaptively weights synthetic data by prediction uncertainty, reducing approximation error propagation to policies. In contrast to conventional ensemble-based methods, our approach requires only an additional encoder for uncertainty estimation, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy. Extensive experiments across 8 scenarios against 8 baselines demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on standard offline MARL benchmarks, establishing a new model-based baseline for generalizable offline multi-agent learning."

    "abstract": "Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models enhance understanding and interaction with audiovisual content, making it more accessible, searchable, and useful for a wide range of fields such as education, surveillance, entertainment, and content creation. Due to heavy compute requirements, most large visual language models (VLMs) for VideoQA rely on a fixed number of frames by uniformly sampling the video. However, this process does not pick important frames or capture the context of the video. We present a novel query-based selection of frames relevant to the questions based on the submodular mutual Information (SMI) functions. By replacing uniform frame sampling with query-based selection, our method ensures that the chosen frames provide complementary and essential visual information for accurate VideoQA. We evaluate our approach on the MVBench dataset, which spans a diverse set of multi-action video tasks. VideoQA accuracy on this dataset was assessed using two VLMs, namely Video-LLaVA and LLaVA-NeXT, both of which originally employed uniform frame sampling. Experiments were conducted using both uniform and query-based sampling strategies. An accuracy improvement of up to \\textbf{4\\%} was observed when using query-based frame selection over uniform sampling. Qualitative analysis further highlights that query-based selection, using SMI functions, consistently picks frames better aligned with the question. We opine that such query-based frame selection can enhance accuracy in a wide range of tasks that rely on only a subset of video frames."

Low-field MRI presents an affordable, locally developable diagnostic solution, but its performance is constrained by magnetic field instability. We present a novel NMR field probe designed to overcome these challenges using a rapid non-adiabatic switch-off of a pre-polarization field resulting in precessing spin magnetization. Achieved by first use of high-voltage silicon carbide transistors operating in controlled avalanche breakdown, it measures the Larmor frequency without prior field knowledge, unlike conventional probes. This capability is crucial during magnet development with often unknown fields, allowing early detection of magnet issues, and offering an urgently needed tool for magnet design and image-quality improvement. Validated from 1 mT to 45 mT (up to 1,000 times stronger than similar systems) its low-cost, modular design supports replication, upgrades, and enhanced field control, helping expand global MRI access."

    "abstract": "Small aromatic molecules, including functionalized derivatives of benzene, are known to be present throughout the different stages of star and planet formation. In particular, oxygen-bearing monosubstituted aromatics, likely including phenol, have been identified in the coma of comet 67P. This suggests that, earlier in the star and planet formation evolution, icy grains may act as both reservoirs and sites of functionalization for these small aromatics. We investigate the ice-phase reactivity of singlet oxygen atoms (O($^1$D)) with benzene, using ozone as a precursor that is readily photodissociated by relatively low-energy. Our experiments show that O($^1$D) efficiently reacts with benzene, forming phenol, benzene oxide, and oxepine as the main products. Phenol formation is temperature-independent, consistent with a barrierless insertion mechanism. In contrast, the formation of benzene oxide/oxepine shows a slight temperature dependence, suggesting that additional reaction pathways involving either ground-state or excited-state oxygen atoms may contribute. In H$_2$O and \\COO ice matrices we find that dilution does not suppress formation of phenol. We extrapolate an experimental upper limit for the benzene-to-phenol conversion fraction of 27-44$\\%$ during the lifetime of an interstellar cloud, assuming O($^1$D) production rates based on CO$_2$ ice abundances and a cosmic-ray induced UV field. We compare these estimates with a new analysis of data from the comet 67P, where the C$_6$H$_6$O/C$_6$H$_6$ ratio is 20$\\pm$6$\\%$. This value lies within our estimated range, suggesting that O($^1$D)-mediated chemistry is a viable pathway for producing oxygenated aromatics in cold astrophysical ices, potentially enriching icy planetesimals with phenol and other biorelevant compounds."

Input for the inference is provided by many sensors scattered within the odor plume. Drawing inspiration from distributed chemosensation in biology, we ask whether the accuracy of the inference is affected by proprioceptive noise, i.e., noise on the perceived location of the sensors. Surprisingly, in the presence of a net fluid flow, proprioceptive noise improves Bayesian inference, rather than degrading it. An optimal noise exists that efficiently leverages additional information hidden within the geometry of the odor plume. Empirical tuning of noise functions well across a range of distances and may be implemented in practice. Other sources of noise also improve accuracy, owing to their ability to break the spatiotemporal correlations of the turbulent plume. These counterintuitive benefits of noise may be leveraged to improve sensory processing in biology and robotics."

We then show that this same quantum theory naturally provides a representation of $Ξ$ in terms of bosonic modes, whose features match those of the Hawking radiation; this facilitates the establishment of precise relations between the phenomenological parameters of the SBH and the microscopic details of the quantum model for $Ξ$. Finally, we recognize that the conditions used to characterize $Γ$ and $Ξ$ coincide with those required by the Page and Wootters mechanism for identifying an evolving system and an associated clock. This leads us to discuss how the quantum model for $Ξ$ endows the SBH with all the characteristics of a \"perfect\" clock."

The three unknowns that are expected to be deciphered in the near future are the Dirac CP phase, $δ$, the neutrino mass ordering, and the octant of $θ_{23}$. The next generation of long baseline experiments, such as the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), aims to resolve these unanswered questions. In the present work, by considering DUNE as an example, we assess the ability of long baseline experiments to extricate the intrinsic contribution from observables related to CP violation in scenarios considering SI and beyond. Additionally, we analyze the role of the second oscillation maximum in addressing the above mentioned questions. By carrying out event level and statistical analyses, we assess the potential of DUNE to probe CP violation effects both within and beyond the standard paradigm."

Here, we propose a rational approach, using Flory-Huggins theory, to predict the self-assembly of amphiphilic block copolymers into asymmetric Janus polymersomes. Our predictions are experimentally validated by forming highly stable Janus giant unilamellar vesicles (JGUVs) with a remarkable yield exceeding 90% obtained from electroformation of various biocompatible block copolymers. We also present a general phase diagram correlating mixing energy with polymersome morphology, offering a valuable tool for JGUV design. These polymersomes can be extruded to achieve quasi-monodisperse vesicles while maintaining their Janus-like morphology, paving the way for their asymmetric functionalization and use as active carriers."

This study characterizes the properties of this dynamic gas flow. Methods: Combining data from the Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) with single-dish data from the IRAM30m observatory, we mapped large spatial scales (~81pc^2) at high angular resolution (7.0''x2.6'' corresponding ~2.3x10^4au or ~0.1pc) down to core scales. The spectral setup in the 3mm band covers many spectral lines as well as the continuum emission. Results: The data reveal the proposed west-east converging gas flow in all observed dense gas tracers. We estimate a mass-flow rate along that flow around 10^-3M_sun/yr. Comparing these west-east flow rates to infall rates toward sources along the line of sight, the gas flow rates are roughly a factor of 25 greater than than those along the line of sight. This confirms the dominance of longitudinal motions along the converging gas flow in G28.37. For comparison, in the main north-south IRDC formed by the west-east converging gas flow, infall rates along the line of sight are about an order of magnitude greater than those along the west-east flow. In addition to the kinematic analysis, a comparison of CH_3CN-derived gas temperatures with Herschel-derived dust temperatures typically show higher gas temperatures toward high-density sources. We discuss whether mechanical heating from the conversion of the flow's kinetic energy into thermal energy may explain some of the observed temperature differences. Conclusions: The differences between flow rates along the converging flow, perpendicular to it, and toward the sources at the IRDC center indicate that at the interfaces of converging gas flows - where most of the active star formation takes place - originally more directed gas flows can convert into multidirectional infall motions."

    "abstract": "Many catastrophic events, including landslides, rockbursts, glacier breakoffs, and volcanic eruptions, are preceded by an observable acceleration phase that offers a critical window for early warning and hazard mitigation; however, the duration of this precursory phase remains poorly constrained across sites, scales, and hazard types. This limitation arises because the onset of acceleration is often identified using heuristic thresholds or empirical criteria. Here, we introduce a physics-based framework that objectively constrains the precursory duration from accelerating dynamics, without prescribing the onset a priori or being tied to any specific observable. We analyse a global dataset of 109 geohazard events across seven continents over the past century, quantifying their precursory durations in a consistent manner. For mechanically driven instabilities, we identify a robust scaling between precursory duration and failure volume spanning more than ten orders of magnitude. When expressed in terms of a characteristic system size, this relationship is close to linear, consistent with finite-size scaling near a dynamical critical point. This behaviour indicates that precursory duration reflects the progressive growth of correlated deformation up to system-spanning scales, rather than local rupture kinetics. The resulting universality points to common organising mechanisms governing the approach to catastrophic failure across mechanically driven geohazards."

Yet, how polarised groups collectively construct and negotiate opposing interpretations of reality, and whether narratives move between groups despite limited interactions, remains unexplored. To address this gap, we formalise the concept of narrative polarisation and demonstrate its measurement in 212 YouTube videos and 90,029 comments on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Based on structural narrative theory and implemented through a large language model, we extract the narrative roles assigned to central actors in two partisan information environments. We find that while videos produce highly polarised narratives, comments significantly reduce narrative polarisation, harmonising discourse on the surface level. However, on a deeper narrative level, recurring narrative motifs reveal additional differences between partisan groups."

In particular, the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A, which is well known for its asymmetric structure, contains three ``Fe-rich blobs,'' and the composition of the Fe-peak elements within these structures could be related to the asymmetry of the supernova explosion. We report a highly asymmetric distribution of the Fe-peak elements in Cassiopeia A as revealed by XRISM observations. We found that the southeastern Fe-rich region has a significant Mn emission above the 4$σ$ confidence level, while the northwestern Fe-rich region has no clear signature. In addition to the significant difference in Mn abundance across these regions, our observations show that the Ti/Fe, Mn/Cr, and Ni/Fe ratios vary from region to region. The observed asymmetric distribution of Fe-peak elements could be produced by (1) the mixing of materials from different burning layers of the supernova, (2) the asymmetric distribution of the electron fraction in the progenitor star and/or (3) the local dependence of the neutrino irradiation in the supernova innermost region. Future spatially resolved spectroscopy of Cassiopeia A using X-ray microcalorimeters will enable more detailed measurements of the distribution and composition of these elements, providing a unique tool for testing asymmetric supernova physics."

However, existing studies mainly focus on accuracy improvement, while critical system-level factors such as inference latency and energy consumption are often overlooked, resulting in increasingly complex model designs that hinder practical deployment. Prior efforts on model compression and acceleration typically optimize either the software or hardware side in isolation. Software-only optimization cannot fundamentally remove intermediate tensor access and operator scheduling overheads, whereas hardware-only optimization is constrained by model structure and precision. As a result, the real-world benefits of such optimizations are often limited. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a reusable software and hardware co-optimization and closed-loop evaluation framework for ME2E autonomous driving inference. The framework jointly integrates software-level model optimization with hardware-level computation optimization under a unified system-level objective. In addition, a multidimensional evaluation metric is introduced to assess system performance by jointly considering safety, comfort, efficiency, latency, and energy, enabling quantitative comparison of different optimization strategies. Experiments across multiple ME2E autonomous driving stacks show that the proposed framework preserves baseline-level driving performance while significantly reducing inference latency and energy consumption, achieving substantial overall system-level improvements. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework provides practical and actionable guidance for efficient deployment of ME2E autonomous driving systems."

    "abstract": "We investigate the temporal variability of polarization of synchrotron radiation from blazar jets. Multiwavelength observations revealed high-amplitude rotations of the electric vector position angle (EVPA), both in the optical and in the X-rays. More often, the polarization degree and the EVPA show a seemingly erratic variability. To interpret these observations, we present a geometric and deterministic model in which off-axis, compact emitting features (i.e.,~blobs) propagate along the jet with the local velocity of the flow. The dynamics of the blobs is determined by the jet electromagnetic fields, which are calculated self-consistently using an analytical model of magnetically dominated outflows. The jet is axisymmetric, and its electromagnetic fields do not have a turbulent component. We show that the observed polarization is sensitive to the initial spatial configurations of the blobs. For the same jet structure, we observe several remarkably complex polarization patterns, including large EVPA rotations of $180^{\\circ}$ or more in both directions and more erratic fluctuations. Simultaneous high-amplitude variations of the polarization degree and the EVPA can coincide with peaks of the observed luminosity. However, seemingly uncorrelated variations are also possible. We discuss the feasibility of constraining the particle acceleration mechanism from multifrequency polarimetric observations."

This functional exhibits a minimal time-lapse proportional to the square root of the cosmological constant. From the viewpoint of the Chern-Simons/Liouville correspondence, we calculate the exchange of virtual gravitons between two massive probes from the cosmological boundary."

    "abstract": "The evaluation of navigation instructions remains a persistent challenge in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) research. Traditional reference-based metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE fail to capture the functional utility of spatial directives, specifically whether an instruction successfully guides a navigator to the intended destination. Although existing VLN agents could serve as evaluators, their reliance on high-fidelity visual simulators introduces licensing constraints and computational costs, and perception errors further confound linguistic quality assessment. This paper introduces GROKE(Graph-based Reasoning over OSM Knowledge for instruction Evaluation), a vision-free training-free hierarchical LLM-based framework for evaluating navigation instructions using OpenStreetMap data. Through systematic ablation studies, we demonstrate that structured JSON and textual formats for spatial information substantially outperform grid-based and visual graph representations. Our hierarchical architecture combines sub-instruction planning with topological graph navigation, reducing navigation error by 68.5% compared to heuristic and sampling baselines on the Map2Seq dataset. The agent's execution success, trajectory fidelity, and decision patterns serve as proxy metrics for functional navigability given OSM-visible landmarks and topology, establishing a scalable and interpretable evaluation paradigm without visual dependencies.

    "abstract": "When swimming at low Reynolds numbers, inertial effects are negligible and reciprocal movements cannot induce net motion. Instead, symmetry breaking is necessary to achieve net propulsion. Directed swimming can be supported by magnetic fields, which simultaneously provide a versatile means of remote actuation. Thus, we analyze the motion of a straight microswimmer composed of three magnetizable beads connected by two elastic links. The swimming mechanism is based on oriented external magnetic fields that oscillate in magnitude. Through induced reversible hysteretic collapse of the two segments of the swimmer, the two pairs of beads jump into contact and separate nonreciprocally. Due to higher-order hydrodynamic interactions, net displacement results after each cycle. Different microswimmers can be tuned to different driving amplitudes and frequencies, allowing for simultaneous independent control by just one external magnetic field. The swimmer geometry and magnetic field shape are optimized for maximum swimming speed using an evolutionary optimization strategy. Thanks to the simple working principle, an experimental realization of such a microrobot seems feasible and may open new approaches for microinvasive medical interventions such as targeted drug delivery."

Traditional approaches to root cause analysis(RCA) rely on hard-coded graph traversal algorithms or rule-based correlation engines, which are costly to maintain and tightly coupled to the infrastructure model. In this work, we introduce an agentic diagnostic framework where a Large Language Model (LLM) performs step-wise investigation using a constrained tool space exposed through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Instead of embedding causal logic or traversal algorithms into the application, the agent autonomously navigates the infrastructure model by invoking tools for service lookup, dependency retrieval, structured and unstructured data, and event analysis, and impact discovery. We define an investigation protocol that structures the agent's reasoning and ensures grounding, reproducibility, and safe handling of missing or ambiguous information. This work lays the foundation for autonomous incident resolution and change impact mitigation. Future systems will not only diagnose and remediate infrastructure failures, but also predict the impact of planned changes on services and customers, enabling operators to mitigate risks before executing maintenance operations."

Drawing an explicit parallel between axion field dynamics and synchronization in coupled oscillator systems, we show that a macroscopic axion phase can arise dynamically from initially incoherent configurations through gradient-driven ordering in an expanding Universe. In this framework, the misalignment angle is not a fundamental initial condition but a collective variable that becomes well defined only once phase coherence develops. Using a simple lattice model, we illustrate how the collective phase is selected prior to the onset of axion oscillations, providing a dynamical basis for the standard misalignment picture. This perspective offers a new way of organizing axion initial-condition sensitivity, reframes anthropic small-angle arguments in terms of phase-ordering efficiency, and suggests a broader connection between fine-tuning and emergent collective dynamics in the early Universe."

Following a companion analysis of Planck HFI, the four components of this model correspond to \"hot dust\", \"cold dust\", \"nearby dust\", and \"Halpha correlated dust\", respectively, and each component is modelled in terms of a fixed spatial template and a spatially isotropic spectral energy density (SED) defined by an overall free amplitude for each DIRBE channel. Except for the cold dust amplitude, which is only robustly detected in the 240 micron channel, we measure statistically significant template amplitudes for all components in all DIRBE channels between 12 and 240 micron. In the 3.5 and 4.9 micron channels, only the hot component is detected, while the 1.25 and 2.2 micron channels are too dominated by starlight emission to allow robust dust detections. The total number of DIRBE-specific degrees of freedom in this model is 25. Despite this low dimensionality, the resulting total SED agrees well with recent astrodust predictions. At both low and high frequencies, more than 95 % of the frequency map variance is captured by the model, while at 60 and 100 micron about 70 % of the signal variance is successfully accounted for. The hot dust component, which in a companion paper has been found to correlate strongly with C ii emission, has the highest absolute amplitude in all DIRBE frequency channels; in particular, at 3.5 micron, which is known to be dominated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission, this component accounts for at least 80 % of the total signal. This analysis represents an important step towards establishing a joint concordance model of thermal dust emission applicable to both the microwave and infrared regimes."

The matrix is formed by the coupling constants between the resonators, and the input vector is formed by the initial occupancies of the involved modes. The frequency of the collective oscillations is growing with the number of the involved modes, similarly to Rabi oscillations. The time needed for their detection, i.e., averaging, decreases with an increase in the input vector dimension. We discuss the limitations imposed on parallel computation in the system by restriction of the allowed optical frequency band."

We construct a Bayesian forward model to connect the dark matter halo population predicted by $Λ$CDM with an observed sample of disc galaxies (SPARC) through their maximum rotation velocities. Our approach combines a subhalo abundance matching scheme (accounting for assembly bias) with a parameterised halo response to galaxy formation. When assuming no correlation between selection in the SPARC survey and halo properties, reproducing the observed velocities requires strong halo expansion, low abundance matching scatter ($<0.15$ dex at $1σ$) and a halo proxy that strongly suppresses the stellar masses in satellite haloes. This is in clear tension with independent clustering constraints. Allowing for SPARC-like galaxies to preferentially populate low $\\Vmax$ haloes at fixed virial mass greatly improves the goodness-of-fit and resolves these tensions: the preferred halo response shifts to mild contraction, the abundance matching scatter increases to $\\sint = 0.19^{+0.13}_{-0.11}$ dex and the proxy becomes consistent with clustering. However, the inferred selection threshold is extreme, implying that SPARC galaxies occupy the lowest ${\\sim}16$ per cent of the $\\Vmaxhalo$ distribution at fixed $\\Mvir$. Moreover, even with selection, the inferred scatter remains in statistical disagreement with the low-mass clustering constraints, which are most representative of the SPARC galaxies in our sample. Our analysis highlights the advantage of augmenting clustering-based constraints on the galaxy--halo connection with kinematics and suggests a possible tension using current data."

It is non-trivial due to the vast amount of craters of various sizes and shapes, as well as challenging conditions such as varying illumination and rugged terrain. Therefore, we propose a deep-learning CDA based on the OWLv2 model, which is built on a Vision Transformer, that has proven highly effective in various computer vision tasks. For fine-tuning, we utilize a manually labeled dataset fom the IMPACT project, that provides crater annotations on high-resolution Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera Calibrated Data Record images. We insert trainable parameters using a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy with Low-Rank Adaptation, and optimize a combined loss function consisting of Complete Intersection over Union (CIoU) for localization and a contrastive loss for classification. We achieve satisfactory visual results, along with a maximum recall of 94.0% and a maximum precision of 73.1% on a test dataset from IMPACT. Our method achieves reliable crater detection across challenging lunar imaging conditions, paving the way for robust crater analysis in future lunar exploration."

While typically the current is expected to decrease as the disorder strength increases due to localization effects, in systems with infinite range hopping it was shown in Chavez et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 153201 (2021), that the current can increase with disorder in the Disorder-Enhanced-Transport (DET) regime. Here, by analyzing models with variable hopping range decaying as $1/r^α$ with the distance $r$ among the sites, we show that the DET regime is a general feature of long-range hopping systems and it occurs, not only in the strong long-range limit $α<1$ but even for weak long-range $1 \\le α\\le 3$. Specifically, we show that, after an initial decrease, the current grows with the disorder strength until it reaches a local maximum. Both disorder thresholds at which the DET regime starts and ends are determined. Our results open the path to understand the effect of disorder on transport in many realistic systems where long range hopping is present."

Instead of single-shot matching, TOOLQP decomposes instructions into sub-tasks and dynamically generates queries to interact with the retriever, effectively bridging the semantic gap by targeting the specific sub-tasks required for composition. We train TOOLQP using synthetic query trajectories followed by optimization via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Experiments demonstrate that TOOLQP achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting superior zero-shot generalization, robustness across diverse retrievers, and significant improvements in downstream agentic execution."

The system exhibits spontaneous phase separation between the two components, manifested as alternating stripe patterns in the normal phase and distinct Bragg gratings in the superradiant phase. Furthermore, the Bogoliubov excitation spectrum reveals roton-type mode softening, indicating that the phase transition also corresponds to the superfluid-to-lattice supersolid transition.

Our evaluation of several frontier models reveals a critical dissociation: models are neither cost-aware when articulating their verbal confidence, nor strategically responsive when deciding whether to engage or abstain under high-penalty conditions. Even when extreme penalties render frequent abstention the mathematically optimal strategy, models almost never abstain, resulting in utility collapse. This indicates that calibrated verbal confidence scores may not be sufficient to create trustworthy and interpretable AI systems, as current models lack the strategic agency to convert uncertainty signals into optimal and risk-sensitive decisions."

    "abstract": "Time-inconsistent behavior, such as procrastination or abandonment of long-term goals, arises when agents evaluate immediate outcomes disproportionately higher than future ones. This leads to globally suboptimal behavior, where plans are frequently revised or abandoned entirely. In the influential model of Kleinberg and Oren (2014) such behavior is modeled by a present-biased agent navigating a task graph toward a goal, making locally optimal decisions at each step based on discounted future costs. As a result, the agent may repeatedly deviate from initial plans. Recent work by Belova et al. (2024) introduced a two-agent extension of this model, where a fully-aware principal attempts to guide the present-biased agent through a specific set of critical tasks without causing abandonment. This captures a rich class of principal-agent dynamics in behavioral settings. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive algorithmic characterization of this problem. We analyze its computational complexity through the framework of parameterized algorithms, focusing on graph parameters that naturally emerge in this setting, such as treewidth, vertex cover, and feedback vertex set. Our main result is a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm when parameterized by the treewidth of the task graph and the number of distinct (v,t)-path costs. Our algorithm encaptures several input settings, such as bounded edge costs and restricted task graph structure. We demonstrate that our main result yields efficient algorithms for a number of such configurations. We complement this with tight hardness results, that highlight the extreme difficulty of the problem even on simplest graphs with bounded number of nodes and constant parameter values, and motivate our choice of parameters. We delineate tractable and intractable regions of the problem landscape, which include answers to open questions of Belova et al. (2024)."

Our model uses merger trees from the IllustrisTNG cosmological suite of simulations to predict stellar mass deficits in core galaxies. We take into account dynamical friction, stellar scattering, and gravitational wave emission and compare to the observed relation between core mass deficit and galaxy stellar mass. We find that to match observations, binary hardening in the stellar scattering regime must be about 1.6 times faster than N-body experiments suggest. Most importantly we find that, even assuming a full loss-cone, hardening by stellar scattering alone is insufficient to explain the low frequency turnover seen in the gravitational wave background. This strongly suggests that gas-dynamics play an important role in hardening and provides a reason to be optimistic about electromagnetically visible binary AGN."

    "abstract": "Categorizing events using discriminant observables is central to many high-energy physics analyses. Yet, bin boundaries are often chosen by hand. A simple, popular choice is to apply argmax projections of multi-class scores and equidistant binning of one-dimensional discriminants. We propose a binning optimization for signal significance directly in multi-dimensional discriminants. We use a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to define flexible bin boundary shapes for multi-class scores, while in one dimension (binary classification) we move bin boundaries directly. On this binning model, we study two optimization strategies: a differentiable and a Bayesian optimization approach. We study two toy setups: a binary classification and a three-class problem with two signals and backgrounds. In the one-dimensional case, both approaches achieve similar gains in signal sensitivity compared to equidistant binnings for a given number of bins. In the multi-dimensional case, the GMM-based binning defines sensitive categories as well, with the differentiable approach performing best. We show that, in particular for limited separability of the signal processes, our approach outperforms argmax classification even with optimized binning in the one-dimensional projections. Both methods are released as lightweight Python plugins intended for straightforward integration into existing analyses."

    "abstract": "Understanding and controlling the energy level alignment at interfaces between lead halide perovskites and electron transport layers is crucial for optimizing charge extraction by minimizing recombination losses in high-efficiency perovskite solar cells. In this work, we investigated the energy level alignment of C60 on in-situ cleaved MAPbI3 single crystals in multiple repeat experiments using photoelectron spectroscopy aiming to resolve inconsistencies reported in earlier studies. Our results show that both materials remain chemically stable upon interface formation, the strong reactions typically seen when metals contact perovskites. By analyzing Pb 4f and C 1s core level positions in detail, we determined that C60 consistently exhibits a downward energy shift toward MAPbI3, which works against efficient charge extraction. The magnitude of this shift, however, is highly sensitive to the surface composition, highlighting that small variations may lead to significant differences in results. At higher C60 coverages of more than 5 monolayers, a constant HOMO-valence band offset of 0.52 eV was obtained. Assuming a 1.86 eV HOMO-LUMO gap, the C60 LUMO is 0.25 eV below the MAPbI3 conduction band, a value favorable for charge extraction. These findings underscore the decisive role of surface chemistry on interfacial energetics, explain performance variability in perovskite devices, and demonstrate the need to control and accurately measure surface properties. Furthermore, the observed energetic alignment can explain why further interface modification by charge blocking layers or surface passivation is needed for optimized device efficiencies."

An open problem is whether the random barrier model accounts for site energy disorder in real materials. Through mapping many-particle hopping in a disordered site energy landscape to that of independent particles in a barrier landscape, we show that time-temperature scaling is correctly described by the associated barrier model in the low temperature limit. However, the site energy model displays good scaling behavior at substantially higher temperatures than the barrier model, in agreement with experimental observations. Extending the mapping to different types of mobile charge carriers allows us to understand why time-temperature superposition can be absent in mixed alkali glasses."

    "abstract": "The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has led to growing concerns about data security and user privacy in the interactions within distributed systems. Decentralized Applications (DApps) in distributed systems consist of on-chain and off-chain functions, where on-chain functions are smart contracts running in the blockchain network, while off-chain functions operate outside the blockchain. Since smart contracts cannot access off-chain information, they cannot verify whether the off-chain functions, i.e. the software components, they interact with have been tampered or not. As a result, establishing mutual trust between the on-chain smart contracts and the off-chain functions remains a significant challenge. To address the challenge, this paper introduces TeeMAF, a generic framework for mutual attestation between on-chain and off-chain functions, leveraging Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), specifically Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), SCONE (a TEE container on top of Intel SGX), and remote attestation technologies. This ensures that the deployed off-chain functions of a DApp execute in a provably secure computing environment and achieve mutual attestation with the interacting on-chain functions. Through a security analysis of TeeMAF, the reliability of deployed DApps can be verified, ensuring their correct execution. Furthermore, based on this framework, this paper proposes a decentralized resource orchestration platform (a specific DApp) for deploying applications over untrusted environments. The system is implemented on Ethereum and benchmarked using Hyperledger Caliper. Performance evaluation focusing on throughput and latency demonstrates that, compared to platforms without a mutual attestation scheme, the performance overhead remains within an acceptable range."

In this article, we determine the equivariant diffeomorphism type of the fiber for these bundles when the domain lives inside a $3$-dimensional complex flag variety. In order to do so, we explicitly work out a smooth version of Fintushel's classification theorem for smooth $S^1$-actions on $4$-manifolds. We show that, in each case, the action on the fiber is equivalent to a circle action on a Hirzebruch surface (or an equivariant connected sum of such actions)."

One of the important phenomena that can be modeled in the spin lattice simulation is magnetoelastic behavior, offering direct conversion between the mechanical and magnetic energy. However, so far, only models for systems with cubic symmetry have been introduced. Therefore, here, a spin-lattice model for a system with tetragonal symmetry is proposed, where its strength is manifested by simulation of magnetoelastic properties of a characteristic representative L1$_{0}$ FePt system."

Despite the extraordinary brightness, GECAM-C has accurately measured both the bright prompt emission and flare emission of GRB 221009A without instrumental effects, offering a good opportunity to study the relation between them. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of flare emission of GRB 221009A, which is composed of a series of flares. Among them, we identify an exceptionally bright flare with a record-breaking isotropic energy $E_{\\rm iso} = 1.82 \\times 10^{53}$ erg of GRB flares. It exhibits the highest peak energy ever detected in GRB flares, $E_{\\rm peak} \\sim 300$ keV, making it a genuine gamma-ray flare. It also shows rapid rise and decay timescales, significantly shorter than those of typical X-ray flares observed in soft X-ray or optical band, but comparable to those observed in prompt emissions. Despite these exceptional properties, the flare shares several common properties with typical GRB flares. We note that this is the first observation of a GRB flare in the keV-MeV band with sufficiently high temporal resolution and high statistics, which bridges the last gap between prompt emission and flare."

    "abstract": "Sunlight radiation under snow-covered sea ice obtained from remote sensing could help assess under-ice primary production at pan-Arctic scale. Yet, the current remote sensing methods to estimate sunlight transmittance under sea ice is limited by its reliance on imprecise snow depth products and its inability to sense microstructure-driven variations in snow and ice light scattering properties. Based on Monte-Carlo simulations of radiative transfer, we developed an inversion method relying solely on spectral albedo to estimate transmittance under snow-covered sea ice. The method analyses albedo spectral information to derive the vertically resolved scattering properties of snow and sea ice above the freeboard. Assuming fixed columnar ice physical and optical properties, transmittance is then estimated. At ground level, our spectral albedo inversion method is more precise than the current approaches. We argue this is because it implicitly accounts for the variability in snow scattering properties. This method could significantly improve the satellite estimation of photosynthetically available radiation under sea ice, especially because it does not need snow depth."

Departing from the commonly studied non-minimal couplings to gravity, our framework considers a real spectator scalar field coupled quadratically to spacetime curvature invariants. We show that the rapid reorganization of spacetime curvature at the end of inflation can dynamically render the dark matter field tachyonic, triggering a short-lived phase of spontaneous symmetry breaking and explosive particle production. As a concrete and theoretically controlled example, we focus on the Gauss-Bonnet topological invariant. By combining analytical estimates with fully non-linear $3+1$ classical lattice simulations, we track the out-of-equilibrium evolution of the system and compute the resulting dark matter abundance. We find that this purely gravitational mechanism can robustly reproduce the observed dark matter relic density over a wide range of masses and inflationary scales, providing also a simple fitting function that enables a lattice-independent application of our results."

The insured can decide whether or not to report an occurred claim. We formulate this as an optimal control problem, where the policyholder follows a barrier-type reporting strategy, with the goal of maximizing the expected value of a function of their terminal wealth. We show that the associated value function is the unique viscosity solution to a system of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. This characterization allows us to compute numerical approximations of the optimal barrier strategies."

Not only does synthetic data help build robust AI/ML datasets cost-effectively, but it also offers privacy-friendly solutions and bypasses the complexities of storing large data volumes. This paper proposes a novel method to generate synthetic data, based on first-order auto-regressive noise statistics, for large-scale Wi-Fi deployments. The approach operates with minimal real data requirements while producing statistically rich traffic patterns that effectively mimic real Access Point (AP) behavior. Experimental results show that ML models trained on synthetic data achieve Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values within 10 to 15 of those obtained using real data when trained on the same APs, while requiring significantly less training data. Moreover, when generalization is required, synthetic-data-trained models improve prediction accuracy by up to 50 percent compared to real-data-trained baselines, thanks to the enhanced variability and diversity of the generated traces. Overall, the proposed method bridges the gap between synthetic data generation and practical Wi-Fi traffic forecasting, providing a scalable, efficient, and real-time solution for modern wireless networks."

We formulate individual claims reserving as a claim-level Markov decision process in which an agent sequentially updates outstanding claim liability (OCL) estimates over development, using continuous actions and a reward design that balances accuracy with stable reserve revisions. A key advantage of this reinforcement learning (RL) approach is that it can learn from all observed claim trajectories, including claims that remain open at valuation, thereby avoiding the reduced sample size and selection effects inherent in supervised methods trained on ultimate outcomes only. We also introduce practical components needed for actuarial use -- initialisation of new claims, temporally consistent tuning via a rolling-settlement scheme, and an importance-weighting mechanism to mitigate portfolio-level underestimation driven by the rarity of large claims. On CAS and SPLICE synthetic general insurance datasets, the proposed Soft Actor-Critic implementation delivers competitive claim-level accuracy and strong aggregate OCL performance, particularly for the immature claim segments that drive most of the liability."

To overcome these challenges, we extend the PDHG framework to a distributed-memory setting via a practical two-dimensional grid partitioning of the constraint matrix, enabling scalable execution across multiple GPUs. Our implementation leverages the NCCL communication backend to efficiently synchronize primal-dual updates across devices. To improve load balance and computational efficiency, we introduce a block-wise random shuffling strategy combined with nonzero-aware data distribution, and further accelerate computation through fused CUDA kernels. By distributing both memory and computation, the proposed framework not only overcomes the single-GPU memory bottleneck but also achieves substantial speedups by exploiting multi-GPU parallelism with relatively low communication overhead. Extensive experiments on standard LP benchmarks, including MIPLIB and Hans' instances, as well as large-scale real-world datasets, show that our distributed implementation, built upon cuPDLPx, achieves strong scalability and high performance while preserving full FP64 numerical accuracy."

    "abstract": "Universal basic income (UBI) is a tax scheme that uniformly redistributes aggregate income amongst the entire population of an economy. We prove the existence of an equilibrium in a model that implements universal basic income. The economic agents choose the proportion of their time to work and earn wages that can be used towards consumption and investment in a financial market with a traded stock and annuity. A proportion of the earned wages is uniformly distributed amongst all agents, leading to interconnectedness of the agents' decision problems, which are already dependent on one another through the financial market. The decision problems are further entangled by Nash perceptions of labor; the agents respond to the labor choices of others and act upon their perceived income in their decision problems. The equilibrium is constructed and proven to exist using a backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) approach for a BSDE system with a quadratic structure that decouples. We analyze the effects of a universal basic income policy on labor market participation, the stock market, and welfare. While universal basic income policies affect labor market participation and welfare monotonically, its effects on the stock market are nontrivial and nonmonotone."

Soft-hard mixtures present a rich dynamics, influenced by different parameters such as the concentration of the soft and hard components, the softness of the potential, and the size ratio between the two components. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we characterize the single-particle and collective dynamics of the hard colloidal tracers in the soft glassy matrix. The hard tracers show diffusive behavior of the mean squared displacement accompanied by non-exponential relaxation of the intermediate scattering functions at intermediate length scales and non-Gaussian displacement distributions. Moreover, we show that the system exhibits arrested phase separation, leading to population splitting and decoupling between self- and collective dynamics of the hard colloids. Overall, we demonstrate that the interplay between arrested phase separation and glassiness leads to complex, multiscale phenomena that strongly influence the dynamics of the hard additives in the arrested matrix formed by the soft colloids."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates online power control for point-to-point energy harvesting communications over wireless fading channels. A linear-policy-based approximation is derived for the relative-value function in the Bellman equation of the power control problem. This approximation leads to two fundamental power control policies: optimistic and robust clipped affine policies, both taking the form of a clipped affine function of the battery level and the reciprocal of channel signal-to-noise ratio coefficient. They are essentially battery-limited weighted directional waterfilling policies operating between adjacent time slots. By leveraging the relative-value approximation and derived policies, a domain-knowledge-enhanced reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed for online power control. The proposed approach is further extended to scenarios with energy and/or channel lookahead. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve a good balance between computational complexity and optimality. In particular, the robust clipped affine policy (combined with RL, using at most five parameters) outperforms all existing approaches across various scenarios, with less than 2\\% performance loss relative to the optimal policy."

    "abstract": "Morphological computing, the use of the physical design of a robot to ease the realization of a given task has been proven to be a relevant concept in the context of swarm robotics. Here we demonstrate both experimentally and numerically, that the success of such a strategy may heavily rely on the type of policy adopted by the robots, as well as on the details of the physical design. To do so, we consider a swarm of robots, composed of Kilobots embedded in an exoskeleton, the design of which controls the propensity of the robots to align or anti-align with the direction of the external force they experience. We find experimentally that the contrast that was observed between the two morphologies in the success rate of a simple phototactic task, where the robots were programmed to stop when entering a light region, becomes dramatic, if the robots are not allowed to stop, and can only slow down. Building on a faithful physical model of the self-aligning dynamics of the robots, we perform numerical simulations and demonstrate on one hand that a precise tuning of the self-aligning strength around a sweet spot is required to achieve an efficient phototactic behavior, on the other hand that exploring a range of self-alignment strength allows for a rich expressivity of collective behaviors."

    "abstract": "Galaxy mergers are critical events that influence galaxy evolution by driving processes such as enhanced star formation, quenching, and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity. However, constraining the timescales over which these processes occur in the post-merger phase has remained a significant challenge. This study extends the MUlti-Model Merger Identifier (\\textsc{Mummi}) framework to predict post-merger timescales ($T_{PM}$) for galaxies, leveraging machine learning models trained on realism-enhanced mock observations derived from the IllustrisTNG simulations. By classifying post-merger galaxies into four temporal bins spanning 0 to 1.76 Gyr after coalescence, \\textsc{Mummi} achieves time classification accuracies exceeding 70 per cent. We apply this framework to the Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS), yielding a catalog of 8,716 post-merger galaxies with $T_{PM}$ predictions and stellar masses $\\log(M_*/M_\\odot) \\geq 10$ at redshifts 0.03 < z < 0.3. These results provide a robust methodology to connect galaxy interaction timescales with physical processes, enabling detailed studies of galaxy evolution in the post-merger regime."

We demonstrate the effect of low or high photon counts, and the consequence of exploiting timing of detection events."

    "abstract": "Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a prominent swarm intelligence algorithm extensively applied to path planning. However, traditional ACO methods often exhibit shortcomings, such as blind search behavior and slow convergence within complex environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Pheromone-Focused Ant Colony Optimization (PFACO) algorithm, which introduces three key strategies to enhance the problem-solving ability of the ant colony. First, the initial pheromone distribution is concentrated in more promising regions based on the Euclidean distances of nodes to the start and end points, balancing the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Second, promising solutions are reinforced during colony iterations to intensify pheromone deposition along high-quality paths, accelerating convergence while maintaining solution diversity. Third, a forward-looking mechanism is implemented to penalize redundant path turns, promoting smoother and more efficient solutions. These strategies collectively produce the focused pheromones to guide the ant colony's search, which enhances the global optimization capabilities of the PFACO algorithm, significantly improving convergence speed and solution quality across diverse optimization problems. The experimental results demonstrate that PFACO consistently outperforms comparative ACO algorithms in terms of convergence speed and solution quality."

The primary purpose of the pair spectrometer is the precise determination of the flux of beam photons incident on the GlueX target, a critical input for physics analyses such as absolute cross-section measurements. The photon energy spectrum is determined by reconstructing electron-positron pairs produced in a thin converter inserted into the photon beam. The spectrometer is integrated into the GlueX trigger system, enabling continuous real-time monitoring of the photon flux and the recording of $e^+e^-$ pair candidates for offline analysis. In addition, the pair spectrometer provides a versatile test facility for evaluating calorimeter prototypes using leptons with well-defined energies produced via electromagnetic pair production."

Here we extend this analogy to a highly frustrated antiferromagnet, the kagome-layered spiral Ising compound Nd$_3$BWO$_9$. In its field-temperature phase diagram, we identify a critical endpoint (CEP) and an associated Ising supercritical regime (ISR). The CEP of the metamagnetic transition is located at ${μ_0H_c} \\simeq 1.04$ T and $T_c \\simeq 0.3$ K. Above this point, the ISR emerges with supercritical crossover lines that adhere to a universal scaling law, as evidenced by the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Remarkably, we observe a universally divergent Grueneisen ratio near the emergent CEP, $Γ_H \\propto 1/t^{β+γ-1}$, with $β + γ \\simeq 1.563$ the critical exponents of the 3D Ising universality class and $t \\equiv (T - T_c)/T_c$ the reduced temperature. Our adiabatic demagnetization measurements on Nd$_3$BWO$_9$ reveal a lowest temperature of 195 mK achieved from 2 K and 4 T. Our work opens new avenues for studying supercritical physics and efficient cooling in layered-kagome, rare-earth RE$_3$BWO$_9$ family and, more broadly, in Ising-anisotropic magnets like spin ices."

Light curve and spectral sequence of both the SNe are similar to those of other Type IIb SNe. The pre-maximum spectrum of SN~2008aq showed prominent H $α$ lines, the He lines started appearing in the near maximum spectrum. The near maximum spectrum of SN~2019gaf shows shallow H$α$ absorption and He lines with almost similar strength. Both the SNe show transition from hydrogen-dominated spectra to helium-dominated spectra within a month after maximum brightness. The velocity evolution of SN~2008aq matches well with those of other well-studied Type IIb SNe, while SN~2019gaf shows higher velocities. Close to maximum light, the H $α$ and He I line velocities of SN~2019gaf are $\\sim$ 2000 km sec$^{-1}$ and $\\sim$ 4000 km sec$^{-1}$ higher than other well-studied Type IIb SNe. Semi-analytical modeling indicates SN~2019gaf to be a more energetic explosion with a smaller ejecta mass than SN~2008aq. The zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) mass of the progenitor estimated using the nebular spectra of SN~2008aq ranges between 13 to 20 M$_\\odot$, while for SN~2019gaf, the inferred ZAMS mass is between 13 to 25 M$_\\odot$.

We propose VASCOT, a Vulnerability Analyzer for Smart COntracts using Transformers, which performs sequential analysis of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode and incorporates a sliding window mechanism to overcome input length constraints. To assess VASCOT's detection efficacy, we construct a dataset of 16,469 verified Ethereum contracts deployed in 2022, and annotate it using trace analysis with concrete validation to mitigate false positives. VASCOT's performance is then compared against a state-of-the-art LSTM-based vulnerability detection model on both our dataset and an older public dataset. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of each model, providing insights into their detection capabilities and generalizability."

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a pivotal paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs), yet current approaches struggle with visually rich documents by treating text and images as isolated retrieval targets. Existing methods relying solely on cosine similarity often fail to capture the semantic reinforcement provided by cross-modal alignment and layout-induced coherence. To address these limitations, we propose BayesRAG, a novel multimodal retrieval framework grounded in Bayesian inference and Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. Unlike traditional approaches that rank candidates strictly by similarity, BayesRAG models the intrinsic consistency of retrieved candidates across modalities as probabilistic evidence to refine retrieval confidence. Specifically, our method computes the posterior association probability for combinations of multimodal retrieval results, prioritizing text-image pairs that mutually corroborate each other in terms of both semantics and layout. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BayesRAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on challenging multimodal benchmarks. This study establishes a new paradigm for multimodal retrieval fusion that effectively resolves the isolation of heterogeneous modalities through an evidence fusion mechanism and enhances the robustness of retrieval outcomes.

We first derive the limiting bounds as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) goes to infinity and the system interference goes to zero. Then, we construct an infinite-state Markov chain to describe the consecutive packet losses of the control systems to derive the MAP bounds. Finally, the MAP bounds are approximated as the bounds of the transition probability from the state with no packet loss to the state with consecutive single packet loss. The simulation results show that the MAP performance of $\\left(64,16\\right)$ polar code and 16-bit CRC coincides with the limiting upper bound as the SNR increases and has $3.0$dB performance gain compared with the normal approximation of the finite block rate at block error rate $10^{-3}$."

In this paper, we propose Agent-Role Merging (ARM), an activation-guided, role-conditioned neuron transplantation method for model merging in LLM agents. ARM improves existing merging methods from static natural language tasks to multi-turn agent scenarios, and over the generalization ability across various interactive environments. This is achieved with a well designed 3-step framework: 1) constructing merged backbones, 2) selection based on its role-conditioned activation analysis, and 3) neuron transplantation for fine-grained refinements. Without gradient-based optimization, ARM improves cross-benchmark generalization while enjoying efficiency. Across diverse domains, the model obtained via ARM merging outperforms prior model merging methods and domain-specific expert models, while demonstrating strong out-of-domain generalization."

    "abstract": "Autonomous mobile manipulation in unstructured warehouses requires a balance between efficient large-scale navigation and high-precision object interaction. Traditional end-to-end learning approaches often struggle to handle the conflicting demands of these distinct phases. Navigation relies on robust decision-making over large spaces, while manipulation needs high sensitivity to fine local details. Forcing a single network to learn these different objectives simultaneously often causes optimization interference, where improving one task degrades the other. To address these limitations, we propose a Heterogeneous Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (HMER) framework tailored for autonomous forklifts. HMER decomposes long-horizon tasks into specialized sub-policies controlled by a Semantic Task Planner. This structure separates macro-level navigation from micro-level manipulation, allowing each expert to focus on its specific action space without interference. The planner coordinates the sequential execution of these experts, bridging the gap between task planning and continuous control. Furthermore, to solve the problem of sparse exploration, we introduce a Hybrid Imitation-Reinforcement Training Strategy. This method uses expert demonstrations to initialize the policy and Reinforcement Learning for fine-tuning. Experiments in Gazebo simulations show that HMER significantly outperforms sequential and end-to-end baselines. Our method achieves a task success rate of 94.2\\% (compared to 62.5\\% for baselines), reduces operation time by 21.4\\%, and maintains placement error within 1.5 cm, validating its efficacy for precise material handling."

Recently, Google AlphaEarth (AE) embeddings, derived from multi-source geospatial observations, have emerged as a unified representation of Earth surface conditions. This study evaluated the potential of AE embeddings as alternative predictors for LSM. Two AE representations, including retained principal components and the full set of 64 embedding bands, were systematically compared with conventional LCFs across three study areas (Nantou County, Taiwan; Hong Kong; and part of Emilia-Romagna, Italy) using three deep learning models (CNN1D, CNN2D, and Vision Transformer). Performance was assessed using multiple evaluation metrics, ROC-AUC analysis, error statistics, and spatial pattern assessment. Results showed that AE-based models consistently outperformed LCFs across all regions and models, yielding higher F1-scores, AUC values, and more stable error distributions. Such improvement was most pronounced when using the full 64-band AE representation, with F1-score improvements of approximately 4% to 15% and AUC increased ranging from 0.04 to 0.11, depending on the study area and model. AE-based susceptibility maps also exhibited clearer spatial correspondence with observed landslide occurrences and enhanced sensitivity to localised landslide-prone conditions. Performance improvements were more evident in Nantou and Emilia than in Hong Kong, revealing that closer temporal alignment between AE embeddings and landslide inventories may lead to more effective LSM outcomes. These findings highlight the strong potential of AE embeddings as a standardised and information-rich alternative to conventional LCFs for LSM."

A fundamental pillar of this trustworthiness is calibration, which refers to an agent's ability to express confidence that reliably reflects its actual performance. While calibration is well-established for static models, its dynamics in tool-integrated agentic workflows remain underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate verbalized calibration in tool-use agents, revealing a fundamental confidence dichotomy driven by tool type. Specifically, our pilot study identifies that evidence tools (e.g., web search) systematically induce severe overconfidence due to inherent noise in retrieved information, while verification tools (e.g., code interpreters) can ground reasoning through deterministic feedback and mitigate miscalibration. To robustly improve calibration across tool types, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning framework that jointly optimizes task accuracy and calibration, supported by a holistic benchmark of reward designs. We demonstrate that our trained agents not only achieve superior calibration but also exhibit robust generalization from local training environments to noisy web settings and to distinct domains such as mathematical reasoning. Our results highlight the necessity of domain-specific calibration strategies for tool-use agents. More broadly, this work establishes a foundation for building self-aware agents that can reliably communicate uncertainty in high-stakes, real-world deployments."

At large angular scales, the Pierre Auger Observatory has reported a significant dipole modulation in right ascension, while at intermediate angular scales, localized flux excesses have been identified by both the Auger and Telescope Array collaborations. These observations were investigated in the first two papers of this series. Aims. We examine the implications of these anisotropy measurements and assess to what extent they can be used to constrain the origin of UHECRs and the astrophysical or physical parameters of viable source scenarios. Methods. As in the first two papers of this series, we generate realistic UHECR sky maps for a wide range of astrophysical models consistent with current spectral and composition constraints, assuming that UHECR sources trace the distribution of galaxies in the Universe. We update our previous studies by incorporating the most recent models of the Galactic magnetic field and apply the same large- and intermediate-scale anisotropy analyses as those used by the Auger Collaboration to simulated datasets with current experimental exposure. Results. The main novelty of this third paper is the improved compatibility between simulations and data, in particular regarding the reconstructed dipole direction, when using several of the recently proposed Galactic magnetic field models. Despite this progress, our main conclusions remain unchanged: although the observed anisotropies are compatible with an extragalactic origin of UHECRs, present data and magnetic-field uncertainties do not allow strong constraints to be placed on the nature, spatial distribution, or density of UHECR sources. Conclusions. Further progress in the interpretation of UHECR anisotropies will require improved constraints on cosmic magnetic fields, advances in source modeling, and significantly larger experimental exposures"

    "abstract": "Bayesian Optimization with multi-objective acquisition functions such as q-Expected Hypervolume Improvement (qEHVI) requires efficient candidate optimization to maximize acquisition function values. Traditional approaches rely on continuous optimization methods like Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) for candidate selection. However, these gradient-based methods can become trapped in local optima, particularly in complex or high-dimensional objective landscapes. This paper presents a simulated annealing-based approach for candidate optimization in batch acquisition functions as an alternative to conventional continuous optimization methods. We evaluate our simulated annealing approach against SLSQP across four benchmark multi-objective optimization problems: ZDT1 (30D, 2 objectives), DTLZ2 (7D, 3 objectives), Kursawe (3D, 2 objectives), and Latent-Aware (4D, 2 objectives). Our results demonstrate that simulated annealing consistently achieves superior hypervolume performance compared to SLSQP in most test functions. The improvement is particularly pronounced for DTLZ2 and Latent-Aware problems, where simulated annealing reaches significantly higher hypervolume values and maintains better convergence characteristics. The histogram analysis of objective space coverage further reveals that simulated annealing explores more diverse and optimal regions of the Pareto front. These findings suggest that metaheuristic optimization approaches like simulated annealing can provide more robust and effective candidate optimization for multi-objective Bayesian optimization, offering a promising alternative to traditional gradient-based methods for batch acquisition function optimization."

To address this, we replace the $L^{0}$ objective with its convex $L^{1}$ surrogate and, using a nonsmooth variant of the robust Pontryagin maximum principle, show that the $L^{0}$ and $L^{1}$ formulations have identical sets of optimal solutions -- we call this the robust hands-off principle. Building on this equivalence, we propose an algorithmic framework -- drawing on numerically viable techniques from the semi-infinite robust optimization literature -- to solve the resulting problems. An illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach."

Continual learning approaches depend on episodic retraining with human curated data, failing to achieve autonomy lifelong improvement. While evolutionary computation and LLM driven self improvement offer promising mechanisms for dialog optimization, they lack a unified framework for holistic, iterative strategy refinement. To bridge this gap, we propose DarwinTOD, a lifelong self evolving dialog framework that systematically integrates these two paradigms, enabling continuous strategy optimization from a zero-shot base without task specific fine-tuning. DarwinTOD maintains an Evolvable Strategy Bank and operates through a dual-loop process: online multi-agent dialog execution with peer critique, and offline structured evolutionary operations that refine the strategy bank using accumulated feedback. This closed-loop design enables autonomous continuous improvement without human intervention. Extensive experiments show that DarwinTOD surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods and exhibits continuous performance gains throughout evolution. Our work provides a novel framework for building dialog systems with lifelong self evolution capabilities."

Our approach centers around an active learning strategy for camera trajectory generation, driven by accurate identification of unseen regions, which supports efficient data acquisition and precise scene reconstruction. The key to our approach is epistemic uncertainty quantification based on evidential deep learning, which directly captures data insufficiency and exhibits a strong correlation with reconstruction errors. This allows our framework to more reliably identify unexplored or poorly reconstructed regions compared to existing methods, leading to more informed and targeted exploration. Additionally, we design a hierarchical exploration strategy that leverages learned epistemic uncertainty, where local planning extracts target viewpoints from high-uncertainty voxels based on visibility for trajectory generation, and global planning uses uncertainty to guide large-scale coverage for efficient and comprehensive reconstruction. The effectiveness of the proposed method in active 3D reconstruction is demonstrated by achieving higher reconstruction completeness compared to previous approaches on photorealistic simulated scenes across varying scales, while a hardware demonstration further validates its real-world applicability."

We investigate its Anderson localization properties under diagonal binary disorder. For weak disorder, the complex eigenvalue spectrum forms a single closed loop, which bifurcates into two distinct loops at a critical disorder threshold. Correspondingly, the spectral winding number ν undergoes a transition from ν = 1 in the weak-disorder regime, through ν = 1/2 at the critical point, to ν = 0 in the strong-disorder limit. We show that the eigenstates are exponentially localized, with a localization length that varies analytically as a function of the loop parameter. Notably, at weak and critical disorder, the spectrum hosts two completely delocalized states with diverging localization lengths. This divergence is directly correlated with the non-trivial spectral winding number. These findings remain robust under various boundary conditions, with the exception of strictly open boundaries."

Current data arbitration strategies often rely on surface-level heuristics that fail to diagnose intrinsic learning needs. Since SFT targets pattern consolidation through imitation while RL drives structural adaptation via exploration, misaligning data with these functional roles causes severe optimization interference. We propose PRISM, a dynamics-aware framework grounded in Schema Theory that arbitrates data based on its degree of cognitive conflict with the model's existing knowledge. By analyzing the spatial geometric structure of gradients, PRISM identifies data triggering high spatial concentration as high-conflict signals that require RL for structural restructuring. In contrast, data yielding diffuse updates is routed to SFT for efficient consolidation. Extensive experiments on WebShop and ALFWorld demonstrate that PRISM achieves a Pareto improvement, outperforming state-of-the-art hybrid methods while reducing computational costs by up to 3.22$\\times$. Our findings suggest that disentangling data based on internal optimization regimes is crucial for scalable and robust agent alignment."

In this chapter, we examine strategies for integrating QEC and quantum error detection (QED) into QML under realistic resource constraints. We first quantify the resource demands of fully error-corrected QML and propose a partial QEC approach that reduces overhead while enabling error correction. We then demonstrate the application of a simple QED method, evaluating its impact on QML performance and highlighting challenges we have yet to overcome before we achieve fully fault-tolerant QML."

By applying a masking strategy at both the attribute level and the instance level, the model can better capture intra-object and inter-object structure.

Infrared interferometry with VLTI/GRAVITY is now resolving BLR-scale emission, with data for NGC 3783 consistent with a rotating, geometrically thick configuration. However, the processes shaping the spectra remain poorly constrained, and the cloud models are tuned phenomenologically rather than derived from first-principles predictions. We address this by coupling three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations of gas around a supermassive black hole with radiative-transfer calculations using Cloudy, comparing the results to the SINFONI Br$γ$ profile of NGC 3783. We find that Br$γ$ arises from ionized gas in the surface of the rotating thin disk, with electron temperatures of approximately $T_e \\approx 10^4$ K and number densities of $n_e \\approx 10^8-10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$. However, the intrinsic line profile produced by the RHD kinematics is narrower than observed and displays substructure. An approximate treatment of the electron scattering suggests that scattering in surrounding diffuse ionized gas significantly broadens and smooths the intrinsic Br$γ$ profile, making it consistent with the observed profile. This scattering medium has an electron temperature of $10^4 - 10^5$ K, and a number density of $n \\lesssim 10^8$ cm$^{-3}$. Although a best-fit viewing angle of $\\approx 15$ deg is suggested, the scattered line is notably less sensitive to inclination than the intrinsic line. The observed BLR profiles may be understood as the intrinsic emission viewed through an electron-scattering haze, such that some spectral detail is plausibly redistributed rather than seen directly."

This is partly because film quality is often described using reactor specific settings instead of general physical variables. In this study, we show that plasma assisted MOCVD growth of InN can be described using a single thermodynamic driving force coordinate. This coordinate brings together growth kinetics, defect sensitive Raman response and structural coherence across different process conditions. When we use this coordinate, the incorporation rate follows a universal activated trend with a kinetic scale of about 0.08 eV. Raman measurements show a clear crossover between a defect sparse and a defect rich regime, a disorder activated Raman metric increases quickly after the crossover, while an A1-LO control metric stays mostly the same. This suggests that short range lattice disorder, not long range polar coupling, dominates the defect activation process. X-ray diffraction shows that the out of plane coherence length stays the same for samples with the same driving force, even if reactor settings are very different. This supports the idea that structural coherence is organized by thermodynamics in this growth window. Finally, a simple kinetic Monte Carlo model using driving force biased incorporation and defect activation events matches the observed exponential trends and the two regimes, supporting the driving force approach. These results show that a transferable driving force coordinate can be used for plasma assisted InN growth and offer a quantitative way to achieve defect sparse growth conditions."

However, temperature is not a quantum observable, and most theoretical studies have therefore concentrated on analyzing fundamental precision limits set by the quantum Fisher information through the quantum Cramer-Rao bound. In contrast, whether a direct temperature readout can be achieved in quantum thermometry remains largely unexplored, particularly under the nonequilibrium conditions prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we develop a direct temperature readout scheme based on a thermodynamic inference strategy. The scheme integrates two conceptual developments: (i) By applying the maximum entropy principle with the thermometer's mean energy as a constraint, we assign a reference temperature to the nonequilibrium thermometer. We demonstrate that this reference temperature outperforms a commonly used effective temperature defined through equilibrium analogy. (ii) We obtain positive semi-definite error functions that lower-bound the deviation of the reference temperature from the true temperature-in analogy to the quantum Cramer-Rao bound for the mean squared error-and vanish upon thermalization with the sample. Combining the reference temperature with these error functions, we introduce a notion of corrected dynamical temperature which furnishes a postprocessed temperature readout under nonequilibrium conditions. We validate the corrected dynamical temperature in a qubit-based thermometer under a range of nonequilibrium initial states, confirming its capability to estimate the true temperature. Importantly, we find that increasing quantum coherence can enhance the precision of this readout."

    "abstract": "IVF is one of the most widely used ANNS (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Search) methods in vector databases. The idea of redundant assignment is to assign a data vector to more than one IVF lists for reducing the chance of missing true neighbors in IVF search. However, the naive strategy, which selects the second IVF list based on the distance between a data vector and the list centroids, performs poorly. Previous work focuses only on the inner product distance, while there is no optimized list selection study for the most popular Euclidean space. Moreover, the IVF search may access the same vector in more than one lists, resulting in redundant distance computation and decreasing query throughput. In this paper, we present RAIRS to address the above two challenges. For the challenge of the list selection, we propose an optimized AIR metric for the Euclidean space. AIR takes not only distances but also directions into consideration in order to support queries that are closer to the data vector but father away from the first chosen list's centroid. For the challenge of redundant distance computation, we propose SEIL, an optimized list layout that exploits shared cells to reduce repeated distance computations for IVF search. Our experimental results using representative real-world data sets show that RAIRS out-performs existing redundant assignment solutions and achieves up to 1.33x improvement over the best-performing IVF method, IVF-PQ Fast Scan with refinement."

This structure ensures local conservation properties and avoids spurious oscillations in stress approximation. A rigorous mathematical analysis is presented, establishing the stability of the scheme and proving the second-order L2-error super-convergence for both displacement and stress. The proposed method is locking-free with respect to the Lame constant, making it suitable for both compressible and nearly incompressible elastic materials. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the finite difference scheme, and the computed results show excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions."

In this work, a mixed gas of 75% argon and 25% air is used to generate a pattern discharge. A double-gap boundary composed of hexagonal configuration and square configuration is employed, and the gas pressure is fixed at 20 kPa. By varying the applied voltage amplitude, single-ring pattern, square-point-line pattern, square lattice pattern, and annular-lattice pattern are obtained for the first time. The discharge characteristics and their temporal correlation are studied using both optical method and electrical method. The results show that the discharge patterns exhibit multiple discharges in each half of the voltage cycle, and these discharges are temporally correlated with each other. Time-resolved discharge images of the square lattice pattern are captured using an enhanced charge-coupled device (ICCD). The experimental results reveal that multiple discharges in a half-voltage cycle correspond to the ignition process of the pattern in the radial direction from the outside to the inside. The morphology of the square lattice pattern observed by the naked eye is actually the result of the temporal superposition of luminescence from points at different positions in the evolution process."

Using the 60~cm Antarctic Terahertz Explorer, we present the first successful CO ($4-3$) and [CI] ($^3P_1 - ^3P_0$) mapping observations of two archetypal triggered massive star-formation regions at Dome~A. These data, together with archival [CII], provide the first complete characterization of all three carbon phases in these environments. We find elevated C$^{0}$/CO abundance ratios in high-extinction regions, plausibly driven by deep penetration of intense radiation fields from massive stars into a clumpy ISM. These findings mark a major milestone for submillimeter astronomy at Dome~A and offer valuable insights into the impact of massive star feedback on the surrounding ISM."

    "abstract": "Evidence for fluvial features and standing liquid water indicate that Mars was a warmer and wetter place in its past; however, climate models have historically been unable to produce conditions to yield a warm early Mars under the faint young sun. Some models invoke thick greenhouse atmospheres to produce continuously warm conditions, but others have argued that available geologic evidence is more consistent with short-duration and transient warming events on an otherwise cold Mars. One possibility of harmonizing these perspectives is that early Mars experienced climate limit cycles that caused the climate to oscillate between short periods of warmth and prolonged periods of glaciation, due to modulation of greenhouse warming by the carbonate-silicate cycle. This study suggests that episodic limit cycling during the Noachian and Hesperian periods provides a hypothetical explanation for the timing and formation of fluvial features on Mars. A schematic time-forward trajectory of the full history of Mars is calculated using an energy balance climate model, which includes an active carbonate-silicate cycle, instellation changes due to the sun's main sequence evolution, variations in the obliquity of Mars, and supplemental warming from additional greenhouse gases beyond carbon dioxide alone. These calculations demonstrate the viability of a climate history for Mars involving episodic limit cycling to enable the formation of the valley networks at 4.1-3.5 Ga and delta features at 3.3-3.0 Ga, interspersed with cold stable climates and ending in the late Amazonian in a carbon dioxide condensation regime. This schematic climate trajectory provide a plausible narrative that remains consistent with available geologic data, and further exploration of warming mechanisms for the climate of Mars should consider the possibility of episodic transient events driven by carbonate-silicate limit cycling."

    "abstract": "Pairwise comparison data are widely used to infer latent rankings in areas such as sports, social choice, and machine learning. The Bradley-Terry model provides a foundational probabilistic framework but inherently assumes transitive preferences, explaining all comparisons solely through subject-specific parameters. In many competitive networks, however, cycle-induced effects are intrinsic, and ignoring them can distort both estimation and uncertainty quantification. To address this limitation, we propose a Bayesian extension of the Bradley-Terry model that explicitly separates the transitive and intransitive components. The proposed Bayesian Intransitive Bradley-Terry model embeds combinatorial Hodge theory into a logistic framework, decomposing paired relationships into a gradient flow representing transitive strength and a curl flow capturing cycle-induced structure. We impose global-local shrinkage priors on the curl component, enabling data-adaptive regularization and ensuring a natural reduction to the classical Bradley-Terry model when intransitivity is absent. Posterior inference is performed using an efficient Gibbs sampler, providing scalable computation and full Bayesian uncertainty quantification. Simulation studies demonstrate improved estimation accuracy, well-calibrated uncertainty, and substantial computational advantages over existing Bayesian models for intransitivity. The proposed framework enables uncertainty-aware quantification of intransitivity at both the global and triad levels, while also characterizing cycle-induced competitive advantages among teams."

Our approach leverages the foundation model for camera pose estimation and introduces system-level optimizations to enable efficient and scalable inference. Evaluated on a collected egocentric action dataset, our method achieves real-time performance with manageable memory consumption through a sliding batch inference strategy.

    "abstract": "Generating high-quality structured data such as JSON records, remains a fundamental challenge for large language models (LLMs), particularly when semantic richness must coexist with strict schema adherence. While autoregressive LLMs offer strong structural consistency, they often struggle with semantic variation and output diversity. In contrast, diffusion language models (DLMs) introduce powerful mechanisms for semantic richness and bidirectional decoding, yet lack the inductive biases needed for reliable structure preservation. We present Agents of Diffusion (AoD), a novel framework that unifies the generative flexibility of DLMs with the reasoning capabilities of autoregressive models through language-mediated reinforcement learning. AoD frames structured text generation as a multi-agent alignment process, where a prompt optimization agent collaborates with a judge agent to iteratively guide a DLM using natural language feedback. This approach enables controllable, schema-consistent generation without modifying model parameters or relying on handcrafted constraints. AoD advances the state of controllable generation by demonstrating that diffusion models, when supervised by cooperative agents, can achieve both high semantic novelty and structural fidelity. Across multiple structured data benchmarks, AoD consistently outperforms diffusion and autoregressive baselines, establishing a new path forward for structure-aware, diversity-enhanced text synthesis."

To mitigate these risks, safety filters and concept removal techniques have been introduced to block inappropriate prompts or erase sensitive concepts from the models. However, all the existing defense methods are not well prepared to handle diverse adversarial prompts. In this work, we introduce MacPrompt, a novel black-box and cross-lingual attack that reveals previously overlooked vulnerabilities in T2I safety mechanisms. Unlike existing attacks that rely on synonym substitution or prompt obfuscation, MacPrompt constructs macaronic adversarial prompts by performing cross-lingual character-level recombination of harmful terms, enabling fine-grained control over both semantics and appearance. By leveraging this design, MacPrompt crafts prompts with high semantic similarity to the original harmful inputs (up to 0.96) while bypassing major safety filters (up to 100%). More critically, it achieves attack success rates as high as 92% for sex-related content and 90% for violence, effectively breaking even state-of-the-art concept removal defenses. These results underscore the pressing need to reassess the robustness of existing T2I safety mechanisms against linguistically diverse and fine-grained adversarial strategies."

Our analysis identifies three distinct development profiles: sustained, steady, and burst-driven. These profiles reflect substantial variation in ecosystem maturity. Perfective commits constitute 40.8% of all changes, suggesting that feature enhancement is prioritized over corrective maintenance (27.4%) and adaptive updates (24.3%). Data about issues shows that the most frequent concerns involve bugs (22%), infrastructure (14%), and agent coordination challenges (10%). Issue reporting also increased sharply across all frameworks starting in 2023. Median resolution times range from under one day to about two weeks, with distributions skewed toward fast responses but a minority of issues requiring extended attention. These results highlight both the momentum and the fragility of the current ecosystem, emphasizing the need for improved testing infrastructure, documentation quality, and maintenance practices to ensure long-term reliability and sustainability."

This paper develops a geometric Digital Twin (DT) of the Sunway City and uses it to study the service implications of a multi-site mmWave deployment. The DT is constructed from geo-referenced three-dimensional meshes of buildings, roads, and open areas, assembled in Blender and exported as a mesh scene. A seven-transmitter downlink at 10 GHz is then embedded into this geometry and evaluated using a GPU accelerated ray tracing engine that returns path-gain and Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) fields over a dense grid of user locations. These fields are mapped to achievable throughput and compared against representative target rates for immersive extended reality (XR), vehicle-to-everything (V2X) services, and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). The resulting maps show that favourable streets and courtyards form narrow high rate corridors surrounded by deep shadows, even within a dense area. In the baseline deployment, one fifth of the simulated area can maintain 100 Mbps URLLC rates, and less than 10% of cells can reach 1.7 Gbps for XR, despite the presence of several rooftop sites. By exploiting the DT, we further quantify the macro-diversity margin between the best and second best serving sites and show that most URLLC-feasible cells have several decibels of SINR headroom that could be harvested through dual connectivity. The study shows how a city DT can translate ray tracing output into service centric metrics and planning insights, complementing both analytical models and expensive measurement campaigns."

The cluster exhibits a pronounced signature of mass segregation. Its outer members show a clear expansion trend with a velocities of 0.25 $\\rm{km~s^{-1}}$ in the plane of the sky. In addition, the system shows a projected rotational pattern with an angular velocity of approximately 0.03 $\\rm{rad~Myr^{-1}}$. We also identified a correlation between the escape times of disturbed members and the epochs at which the cluster crossed the Galactic disk, highlighting the role of Galactic tidal forces in accelerating cluster dissolution. We conclude that hierarchical clustering based on projection bounding energy is effective for studying the internal structure of star clusters, but it has limitations when dealing with unconstrained structures such as tidal tails."

Some of these women aligned their own perceptions of their gender with these norms, while others expressed frustration with the tension between their gender and how that is perceived by peers in STEM.

Recent advances in data availability and computational power enable new forms of model-driven, simulation-based decision support for transportation policy design. This paper proposes a novel simulation paradigm for the ex-ante evaluation of both direct impacts (e.g., traffic conditions, modal shift, emissions) and indirect impacts spanning transportation-related effects, social equity, and economic accessibility. The approach integrates a multi-layer urban mobility model combining a physical layer of networks, flows, and emissions with a social layer capturing behavioral responses and adaptation to policy changes. Real-world data are used to instantiate the current \"as-is\" scenario, while policy alternatives and behavioral assumptions are encoded as model parameters to generate multiple \"what-if\" scenarios. The framework supports systematic comparison across scenarios by analyzing variations in simulated outcomes induced by policy interventions. The proposed approach is illustrated through a case study aims to assess the impacts of the introduction of broad urban traffic restriction schemes. Results demonstrate the framework's ability to explore alternative regulatory designs and user responses, supporting informed and anticipatory evaluation of urban traffic policies."

This paper introduces a novel approach using THRML (Thermodynamic HypergRaphical Model Library), a JAX-based library for building and sampling probabilistic graphical models that reformulates index tracking as probabilistic inference on an Ising Hamiltonian. Unlike traditional methods that seek a single optimal solution, THRML samples from the Boltzmann distribution of high-quality portfolios using GPU-accelerated block Gibbs sampling, providing natural regularization against overfitting. We implement three key innovations: (1) dynamic coupling strength that scales inversely with market volatility (VIX), adapting diversification pressure to market regimes; (2) rebalanced bias weights prioritizing tracking quality over momentum for index replication; and (3) sector-aware post-processing ensuring institutional-grade diversification. Backtesting on a 100-stock S and P 500 universe from 2023 to 2025 demonstrates that THRML achieves 4.31 percent annualized tracking error versus 5.66 to 6.30 percent for baselines, while simultaneously generating 128.63 percent total return against the index total return of 79.61 percent. The Diebold-Mariano test confirms statistical significance with p less than 0.0001 across all comparisons.

While existing methods excel at prompt-based or keyframe-conditioned editing, they struggle with dynamic temporal effects such as dynamic lighting changes or character transformations, which are difficult to describe via text or static conditions. Transferring a video effect is challenging, as the model must integrate the new temporal dynamics with the input video's existing motion and appearance. % To address this, we introduce a large-scale dataset of triplets, where each triplet consists of a reference effect video, an input image or video, and a corresponding output video depicting the transferred effect. Creating this data is non-trivial, especially the video-to-video effect triplets, which do not exist naturally. To generate these, we propose a scalable automated pipeline that creates high-quality paired videos designed to preserve the input's motion and structure while transforming it based on some fixed, repeatable effect. We then augment this data with image-to-video effects derived from LoRA adapters and code-based temporal effects generated through programmatic composition. Building on our new dataset, we train our reference-conditioned model using recent text-to-video backbones. Experimental results demonstrate that RefVFX produces visually consistent and temporally coherent edits, generalizes across unseen effect categories, and outperforms prompt-only baselines in both quantitative metrics and human preference.

    "abstract": "While the Transformer architecture dominates many fields, its quadratic self-attention complexity hinders its use in large-scale applications. Linear attention offers an efficient alternative, but its direct application often degrades performance, with existing fixes typically re-introducing computational overhead through extra modules (e.g., depthwise separable convolution) that defeat the original purpose. In this work, we identify a key failure mode in these methods: global context collapse, where the model loses representational diversity. To address this, we propose Multi-Head Linear Attention (MHLA), which preserves this diversity by computing attention within divided heads along the token dimension. We prove that MHLA maintains linear complexity while recovering much of the expressive power of softmax attention, and verify its effectiveness across multiple domains, achieving a 3.6\\% improvement on ImageNet classification, a 6.3\\% gain on NLP, a 12.6\\% improvement on image generation, and a 41\\% enhancement on video generation under the same time complexity."

    "abstract": "Remote sensing change detection fundamentally relies on the effective fusion and discrimination of bi-temporal features. Prevailing paradigms typically utilize Siamese encoders bridged by explicit difference computation modules, such as subtraction or concatenation, to identify changes. In this work, we challenge this complexity with SEED (Siamese Encoder-Exchange-Decoder), a streamlined paradigm that replaces explicit differencing with parameter-free feature exchange. By sharing weights across both Siamese encoders and decoders, SEED effectively operates as a single parameter set model. Theoretically, we formalize feature exchange as an orthogonal permutation operator and prove that, under pixel consistency, this mechanism preserves mutual information and Bayes optimal risk, whereas common arithmetic fusion methods often introduce information loss. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks, including SYSU-CD, LEVIR-CD, PX-CLCD, WaterCD, and CDD, and three backbones, namely SwinT, EfficientNet, and ResNet, demonstrate that SEED matches or surpasses state of the art methods despite its simplicity. Furthermore, we reveal that standard semantic segmentation models can be transformed into competitive change detectors solely by inserting this exchange mechanism, referred to as SEG2CD. The proposed paradigm offers a robust, unified, and interpretable framework for change detection, demonstrating that simple feature exchange is sufficient for high performance information fusion.

We next show that introducing cavities into hexagonal structures further suppresses the photonic density of states, particularly when the cavity is also hexagonal. Such a result would find application in the design of fiber-optic cables. We then describe an approach for optimizing arbitrary x-simple or y-simple designs that can recover finite supercells of a hexagonal unit cell. Our approach can therefore discover the symmetry of photonic-crystal primitive unit cells that significantly suppress the photonic density of states for a given set of material parameters within a single optimization."

    "abstract": "Intrinsic alignments of galaxies are potentially a major contaminant of cosmological analyses of weak gravitational lensing. We construct a semi-analytic model of galaxy ellipticities and alignments in the \\Euclid Flagship simulation to predict this contamination in Euclid's weak lensing observations. Galaxy shapes and orientations are determined by the corresponding properties of the host haloes in the underlying $N$-body simulation, as well as the relative positions of galaxies within their halo. Alignment strengths are moderated via stochastic misalignments, separately for central and satellite galaxies and conditional on the galaxy's redshift, luminosity, and rest-frame colour. The resulting model is calibrated against galaxy ellipticity statistics from the COSMOS Survey, selected alignment measurements based on Sloan Digital Sky Survey samples, and galaxy orientations extracted from the Horizon-AGN hydrodynamic simulation at redshift $z=1$. The best-fit model has a total of 12 alignment parameters and generally reproduces the calibration data sets well within the $1σ$ statistical uncertainties of the observations and the \\flagship simulation, with notable exceptions for the most luminous sub-samples on small physical scales. The statistical power of the calibration data and the volume of the single \\flagship realisation are still too small to provide informative prior ranges for intrinsic alignment amplitudes in relevant galaxy samples. As a first application, we predict that \\Euclid end-of-mission tomographic weak gravitational lensing two-point statistics are modified by up to order $10\\,\\%$ due to intrinsic alignments."

DT-ICU integrates variable-length clinical time series with static patient information in a unified multitask architecture, enabling predictions to be updated as new observations accumulate over the ICU stay. We evaluate DT-ICU on the large, publicly available MIMIC-IV dataset, where it consistently outperforms established baseline models under different evaluation settings. Our test-length analysis shows that meaningful discrimination is achieved shortly after admission, while longer observation windows further improve the ranking of high-risk patients in highly imbalanced cohorts. To examine how the model leverages heterogeneous data sources, we perform systematic modality ablations, revealing that the model learnt a reasonable structured reliance on interventions, physiological response observations, and contextual information. These analyses provide interpretable insights into how multimodal signals are combined and how trade-offs between sensitivity and precision emerge. Together, these results demonstrate that DT-ICU delivers accurate, temporally robust, and interpretable predictions, supporting its potential as a practical digital twin framework for continuous patient monitoring in critical care.

    "abstract": "Recent works such as REPA have shown that guiding diffusion models with external semantic features (e.g., DINO) can significantly accelerate the training of diffusion transformers (DiTs). However, this requires the use of pretrained external networks, introducing additional dependencies and reducing flexibility. In this work, we argue that DiTs actually have the power to guide the training of themselves, and propose \\textbf{Self-Transcendence}, a simple yet effective method that achieves fast convergence using internal feature supervision only. It is found that the slow convergence in DiT training primarily stems from the difficulty of representation learning in shallow layers. To address this, we initially train the DiT model by aligning its shallow features with the latent representations from the pretrained VAE for a short phase (e.g., 40 epochs), then apply classifier-free guidance to the intermediate features, enhancing their discriminative capability and semantic expressiveness. These enriched internal features, learned entirely within the model, are used as supervision signals to guide a new DiT training. Compared to existing self-contained methods, our approach brings a significant performance boost. It can even surpass REPA in terms of generation quality and convergence speed, but without the need for any external pretrained models. Our method is not only more flexible for different backbones but also has the potential to be adopted for a wider range of diffusion-based generative tasks. The source code of our method can be found at https://github.com/csslc/Self-Transcendence."

Three different boron doping concentrations were considered to elucidate how dopant density influences the binding strength, charge transfer, and electronic structure of the resulting systems. In addition, the effects of biaxial strain and surface oxidation were examined to assess their impact on the reactivity and stability of B-doped graphene. The results show that boron doping substantially enhances graphene's affinity toward metal adsorption, though the extent and nature of this effect depend strongly on the metal type and doping level. For some of the metals investigated, the interaction is found to be almost entirely charge-transfer driven, with minimal orbital hybridization. Mechanical strain is found to enable fine-tuning of the metal/substrate interaction, while surface oxidation introduces a more pronounced effect by enabling direct interaction between metal atoms and oxygen functional groups in most cases, thereby significantly altering adsorption geometry and strength. These findings provide valuable insights into the design of boron-doped graphene materials for energy conversion and storage applications."

In this work, we systematically investigate the parameter-estimation biases induced by neglecting orbital eccentricity when analyzing eccentric compact-binary coalescences with quasi-circular waveform templates. Focusing on the deci-Hertz detector B-DECIGO and the milli-Hertz detector LISA, we model eccentric inspiral signals using a frequency-domain waveform that incorporates eccentricity-induced higher harmonics and the time-dependent response of spaceborne detectors. We quantify systematic biases in the chirp mass, symmetric mass ratio, and luminosity distance using both Bayesian inference and the Fisher-Cutler-Vallisneri (FCV) formalism, and assess their significance relative to statistical uncertainties. By constructing mock gravitational-wave catalogs spanning stellar-mass and massive black-hole binaries, we identify critical initial eccentricities at which systematic errors become comparable to statistical errors. We find that for B-DECIGO, even very small eccentricities, $e_0\\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ at 0.1 Hz, can lead to significant biases, whereas for LISA such effects typically arise at larger eccentricities, $e_0\\sim 10^{-2}-10^{-1}$ at $10^{-4}$ Hz, due to the smaller number of in-band cycles. Comparisons between FCV predictions and full Bayesian analyses demonstrate good agreement within the regime where waveform mismatches remain small, especially when extrinsic parameters are pre-aligned to minimize mismatches. Our results highlight the necessity of incorporating eccentricity in waveform models for future space-based gravitational-wave observations."

Unlike previous datasets that focus on common visual scenes with statistical frequency advantages, UAIT challenges models with grammatically reasonable but semantically counter-common sense image-text pairs. Such tasks require models to go beyond superficial pattern recognition and demonstrate a deep understanding of agent-patient relationships and physical feasibility. To build UAIT, we designed a semi-automated process to synthesize high-quality uncommon-sense image-text samples using large language models, few-shot prompt engineering, and text-to-image generation. Each sample is accompanied by a carefully designed multiple-choice question to test the model's competence in fine-grained reasoning. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art visual language models and compare them with models based on contrastive learning. Experiments show that all models perform significantly worse than humans in semantic judgment, especially in distinguishing grammatical correctness from semantic rationality. Further experiments show that even the lightweight model can improve its accuracy after fine-tuning, demonstrating the great potential of directional adaptation. This study not only reveals the key weaknesses of VLMs, but also provides diagnostic tools and research directions for the development of robust models with real visual semantic reasoning capabilities."

    "abstract": "Time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) is a central tool for studying the dynamical electronic structure of molecules and solids, yet aspects of its mathematical foundations remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we revisit the foundations of TDDFT within a finite-dimensional setting by developing a general geometric framework for Schrödinger dynamics subject to prescribed expectation values of selected observables. We show that multiple natural definitions of such constrained dynamics arise from the underlying geometry of the state manifold. The conventional TDDFT formulation emerges from demanding stationarity of the action functional, while an alternative, purely geometric construction leads to a distinct form of constrained Schrödinger evolution that has not been previously explored. This alternative dynamics may provide a more mathematically robust route to TDDFT and may suggest new strategies for constructing nonadiabatic approximations. Applying the theory to interacting fermions on finite lattices, we derive novel Kohn--Sham schemes in which the density constraint is enforced via an imaginary potential or, equivalently, a nonlocal Hermitian operator. Numerical illustrations for the Hubbard dimer demonstrate the behavior of these new approaches."

    "abstract": "Achieving robust humanoid hiking in complex, unstructured environments requires transitioning from reactive proprioception to proactive perception. However, integrating exteroception remains a significant challenge: mapping-based methods suffer from state estimation drift; for instance, LiDAR-based methods do not handle torso jitter well. Existing end-to-end approaches often struggle with scalability and training complexity; specifically, some previous works using virtual obstacles are implemented case-by-case. In this work, we present \\textit{Hiking in the Wild}, a scalable, end-to-end parkour perceptive framework designed for robust humanoid hiking. To ensure safety and training stability, we introduce two key mechanisms: a foothold safety mechanism combining scalable \\textit{Terrain Edge Detection} with \\textit{Foot Volume Points} to prevent catastrophic slippage on edges, and a \\textit{Flat Patch Sampling} strategy that mitigates reward hacking by generating feasible navigation targets. Our approach utilizes a single-stage reinforcement learning scheme, mapping raw depth inputs and proprioception directly to joint actions, without relying on external state estimation. Extensive field experiments on a full-size humanoid demonstrate that our policy enables robust traversal of complex terrains at speeds up to 2.5 m/s. The training and deployment code is open-sourced to facilitate reproducible research and deployment on real robots with minimal hardware modifications."

    "abstract": "Magnesium (Mg) has mechanical properties similar to bone tissue, and Mg ions take part in the metabolism. This makes Mg of interest for biocompatible degradable body implants, provided that its high corrosion rate can be inhibited. Slightly alloying Mg and adding surface coatings can slow down the corrosion processes without significantly changing the mechanical properties. Use of coating molecules that are native to the body increase the likelihood of making the surface biocompatible, for example by use of amino acids. We here present a density functional theory (DFT) study of the adsorption on Mg(0001) of the amino acids glycine, L-proline, and L-hydroxyproline (Hyp), the main amino acid content of collagen. We investigate how binding of the functional groups of Hyp are affected when Mg(0001) is slightly alloyed with zinc, lithium or aluminium, and we also model the immersion of the systems in a water environment to see how this affects the binding."

    "abstract": "$X$-secure and $T$-private information retrieval (XSTPIR) is a variant of private information retrieval where data security is guaranteed against collusion among up to $X$ servers and the user's retrieval privacy is guaranteed against collusion among up to $T$ servers. Recently, researchers have constructed XSTPIR schemes through the theory of algebraic geometry codes and algebraic curves, with the aim of obtaining XSTPIR schemes that have higher maximum PIR rates for fixed field size and $X,T$ (the number of servers $N$ is not restricted). The mainstream approach is to employ curves of higher genus that have more rational points, evolving from rational curves to elliptic curves to hyperelliptic curves and, most recently, to Hermitian curves. In this paper, we propose a different perspective: with the shared goal of constructing XSTPIR schemes with higher maximum PIR rates, we move beyond the mainstream approach of seeking curves with higher genus and more rational points. Instead, we aim to achieve this goal by enhancing the utilization efficiency of rational points on curves that have already been considered in previous work. By introducing a family of bases for the polynomial space $\\text{span}_{\\mathbb{F}_q}\\{1,x,\\dots,x^{k-1}\\}$ as an alternative to the Lagrange interpolation basis, we develop two new families of XSTPIR schemes based on rational curves and Hermitian curves, respectively. Parameter comparisons demonstrate that our schemes achieve superior performance. Specifically, our Hermitian-curve-based XSTPIR scheme provides the largest known maximum PIR rates when the field size $q^2\\geq 14^2$ and $X+T\\geq 4q$. Moreover, for any field size $q^2\\geq 28^2$ and $X+T\\geq 4$, our two XSTPIR schemes collectively provide the largest known maximum PIR rates."

    "abstract": "Random walk (RW)-based algorithms have long been popular in distributed systems due to low overheads and scalability, with recent growing applications in decentralized learning. However, their reliance on local interactions makes them inherently vulnerable to malicious behavior. In this work, we investigate an adversarial threat that we term the ``Pac-Man'' attack, in which a malicious node probabilistically terminates any RW that visits it. This stealthy behavior gradually eliminates active RWs from the network, effectively halting the learning process without triggering failure alarms. To counter this threat, we propose the CREATE-IF-LATE (CIL) algorithm, which is a fully decentralized, resilient mechanism that enables self-creating RWs and prevents RW extinction in the presence of Pac-Man. Our theoretical analysis shows that the CIL algorithm guarantees several desirable properties, such as (i) non-extinction of the RW population, (ii) almost sure boundedness of the RW population, and (iii) convergence of RW-based stochastic gradient descent even in the presence of Pac-Man with a quantifiable deviation from the true optimum. Moreover, the learning process experiences at most a linear time delay due to Pac-Man interruptions and RW regeneration. Our extensive empirical results on both synthetic and public benchmark datasets validate our theoretical findings."

    "abstract": "Despite advances in Natural Language Generation (NLG), evaluation remains challenging. Although various new metrics and LLM-as-a-judge (LaaJ) methods are proposed, human judgment persists as the gold standard. To systematically review how NLG evaluation has evolved, we employ an automatic information extraction scheme to gather key information from NLG papers, focusing on different evaluation methods (metrics, LaaJ and human evaluation). With extracted metadata from 14,171 papers across four major conferences (ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, and INLG) over the past six years, we reveal several critical findings: (1) Task Divergence: While Dialogue Generation demonstrates a rapid shift toward LaaJ (>40% in 2025), Machine Translation remains locked into n-gram metrics, and Question Answering exhibits a substantial decline in the proportion of studies conducting human evaluation. (2) Metric Inertia: Despite the development of semantic metrics, general-purpose metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) continue to be widely used across tasks without empirical justification, often lacking the discriminative power to distinguish between specific quality criteria. (3) Human-LaaJ Divergence: Our association analysis challenges the assumption that LLMs act as mere proxies for humans; LaaJ and human evaluations prioritize very different signals, and explicit validation is scarce (<8% of papers comparing the two), with only moderate to low correlation. Based on these observations, we derive practical recommendations to improve the rigor of future NLG evaluation."

    "abstract": "One of the oldest flow visualization techniques is through multiple pathlines generated by the movement of seeding particles spatially distributed in the flow. In the computerized era, particle images are used in quantitative measurements, such as particle image and particle tracking velocimetry (PIV and PTV). Here, we present several methods for post-processing raw particle images to generate enhanced flow visualization without a need for conducting additional experiments. Three post-processing methods will be shown: 1) controlling the exposure time, 2) color-coding temporal information, and 3) changing the frame of reference. We showcase how employing these three methods can highlight different flow features in three canonical flow cases: vortex ring, leading edge vortex, and turbulent boundary layer. In addition to the quantitative flow field, the multi-pathline visualization is expected to augment our ability to observe fluid flow from many different perspectives."

    "abstract": "Building upon the SALT benchmark for relational prediction (Klein et al., 2024), we introduce SALT-KG, a benchmark for semantics-aware learning on enterprise tables. SALT-KG extends SALT by linking its multi-table transactional data with a structured Operational Business Knowledge represented in a Metadata Knowledge Graph (OBKG) that captures field-level descriptions, relational dependencies, and business object types. This extension enables evaluation of models that jointly reason over tabular evidence and contextual semantics, an increasingly critical capability for foundation models on structured data. Empirical analysis reveals that while metadata-derived features yield modest improvements in classical prediction metrics, these metadata features consistently highlight gaps in the ability of models to leverage semantics in relational context. By reframing tabular prediction as semantics-conditioned reasoning, SALT-KG establishes a benchmark to advance tabular foundation models grounded in declarative knowledge, providing the first empirical step toward semantically linked tables in structured data at enterprise scale."

    "abstract": "Discrete motion tokenization has recently enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to serve as versatile backbones for motion understanding and motion-language reasoning. However, existing pipelines typically decouple motion quantization from semantic embedding learning, linking them solely via token IDs. This approach fails to effectively align the intrinsic geometry of the motion space with the embedding space, thereby hindering the LLM's capacity for nuanced motion reasoning. We argue that alignment is most effective when both modalities share a unified geometric basis. Therefore, instead of forcing the LLM to reconstruct the complex geometry among motion tokens from scratch, we present a novel framework that explicitly enforces orthogonality on both the motion codebook and the LLM embedding space, ensuring that their relational structures naturally mirror each other. Specifically, we employ a decoder-only quantizer with Gumbel-Softmax for differentiable training and balanced codebook usage. To bridge the modalities, we use a sparse projection that maps motion codes into the LLM embedding space while preserving orthogonality. Finally, a two-stage orthonormal regularization schedule enforces soft constraints during tokenizer training and LLM fine-tuning to maintain geometric alignment without hindering semantic adaptation. Extensive experiments on HumanML3D demonstrate that our framework achieves a 20% performance improvement over current state-of-the-art methods, validating that a unified geometric basis effectively empowers the LLM for nuanced motion reasoning."

    "abstract": "Document layout analysis aims to detect and categorize structural elements (e.g., titles, tables, figures) in scanned or digital documents. Popular methods often rely on high-quality Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to merge visual features with extracted text. This dependency introduces two major drawbacks: propagation of text recognition errors and substantial computational overhead, limiting the robustness and practical applicability of multimodal approaches. In contrast to the prevailing multimodal trend, we argue that effective layout analysis depends not on text-visual fusion, but on a deep understanding of documents' intrinsic visual structure. To this end, we propose PARL (Position-Aware Relation Learning Network), a novel OCR-free, vision-only framework that models layout through positional sensitivity and relational structure. Specifically, we first introduce a Bidirectional Spatial Position-Guided Deformable Attention module to embed explicit positional dependencies among layout elements directly into visual features. Second, we design a Graph Refinement Classifier (GRC) to refine predictions by modeling contextual relationships through a dynamically constructed layout graph. Extensive experiments show PARL achieves state-of-the-art results. It establishes a new benchmark for vision-only methods on DocLayNet and, notably, surpasses even strong multimodal models on M6Doc. Crucially, PARL (65M) is highly efficient, using roughly four times fewer parameters than large multimodal models (256M), demonstrating that sophisticated visual structure modeling can be both more efficient and robust than multimodal fusion."

    "abstract": "Symmetry and its representation play a crucial role in topological phases, including both Hermitian and non-Hermitian paradigms. In the presence of synthetic gauge field, spatial symmetries should be projectively represented, which can modify the Brillouin manifold. However, this is often overlooked in non-Hermitian systems. Here, we present that momentum-space non-symmorphic reflection symmetry, a typical projective symmetry, induce exceptional topology and the nonlocal skin effect in a two-dimensional non-Hermitian electric circuit. We observe the total topological charges 2, rather than 0, for all exceptional points in a Brillouin Klein bottle manifold, and the phase transition when an exceptional point crosses the antiparallel boundary and flips its topological charge. We further observe a novel skin effect that the skin modes at one side are nonlocally connected to those on the opposite side separated by half of the reciprocal lattice. Our results unveil the unique non-Hermitian phenomena enabled by the projective symmetry, and open avenues for exploring the non-Hermitian topology beyond Brillouin torus manifold."

    "abstract": "Sequential user behavior modeling is pivotal for Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction yet is hindered by three intrinsic bottlenecks: (1) the \"Attention Sink\" phenomenon, where standard Softmax compels the model to allocate probability mass to noisy behaviors; (2) the Static Query Assumption, which overlooks dynamic shifts in user intent driven by real-time contexts; and (3) Rigid View Aggregation, which fails to adaptively weight heterogeneous temporal signals according to the decision context. To bridge these gaps, we propose GAP-Net (Gated Adaptive Progressive Network), a unified framework establishing a \"Triple Gating\" architecture to progressively refine information from micro-level features to macro-level views. GAP-Net operates through three integrated mechanisms: (1) Adaptive Sparse-Gated Attention (ASGA) employs micro-level gating to enforce sparsity, effectively suppressing massive noise activations; (2) Gated Cascading Query Calibration (GCQC) dynamically aligns user intent by bridging real-time triggers and long-term memories via a meso-level cascading channel; and (3) Context-Gated Denoising Fusion (CGDF) performs macro-level modulation to orchestrate the aggregation of multi-view sequences. Extensive experiments on industrial datasets demonstrate that GAP-Net achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, exhibiting superior robustness against interaction noise and intent drift."

Across seven models, we find that demographic-only personas are a structural bottleneck: demographics explain only ~1.5% of variance in human response similarity. Adding sociopsychological facets improves behavioral prediction and reduces over-accentuation, and non-demographic personas based on values and identity achieve strong alignment with substantially lower bias. These trends generalize to SimBench (441 aligned questions), where SCOPE personas outperform default prompting and NVIDIA Nemotron personas, and SCOPE augmentation improves Nemotron-based personas.

Medical VLMs often rely on static visual embeddings and single-pass inference, preventing models from re-examining, verifying, or refining visual evidence during reasoning. While tool-integrated reasoning offers a promising path forward, open-source VLMs lack the training infrastructure to learn effective tool selection, invocation, and coordination in multi-modal medical reasoning. We introduce MedVistaGym, a scalable and interactive training environment that incentivizes tool-integrated visual reasoning for medical image analysis. MedVistaGym equips VLMs to determine when and which tools to invoke, localize task-relevant image regions, and integrate single or multiple sub-image evidence into interleaved multimodal reasoning within a unified, executable interface for agentic training. Using MedVistaGym, we train MedVistaGym-R1 to interleave tool use with agentic reasoning through trajectory sampling and end-to-end reinforcement learning. Across six medical VQA benchmarks, MedVistaGym-R1-8B exceeds comparably sized tool-augmented baselines by 19.10% to 24.21%, demonstrating that structured agentic training--not tool access alone--unlocks effective tool-integrated reasoning for medical image analysis."

Starting from the optical-mechanical correspondence, we derive a modified dispersion relation that encodes the influence of the Lorentz-violating parameter $λ$ on the propagation of massive and massless modes. We analyze the resulting optical properties, including the effective refractive index, group velocity, and energy-dependent time delay, and show how the non-asymptotically flat geometry reshapes signal propagation. From the same dispersion relation, we construct the interparticle potential for massive and massless excitations and evaluate the electron scattering cross section within the Born approximation, identifying characteristic Lorentz-violating corrections. We then develop a statistical-ensemble description based on the deformed energy-momentum relation and obtain analytic expressions for the thermodynamic observables of a massless bosonic gas. The pressure, mean energy, entropy, and heat capacity are examined in three representative regimes--extremely close to the horizon, near the photon sphere, and in the asymptotic region -- where Lorentz violation systematically increase the magnitude of these quantities and leads to finite asymptotic plateaus. Finally, we analyze the vacuum state in the curved background and compute the regularized Casimir energy at zero and finite temperature."

Using a corpus of 1029 short stories, we guide readers through text preprocessing, network construction, feature extraction (structural measures, spreading-activation indices, and emotion scores), and application of regression models. We evaluate how network-construction choices influence both network topology and predictive performance. Across all modelling settings, TFMNs consistently outperformed co-occurrence networks through lower prediction errors (best MAE = 0.581 for TFMN, vs 0.592 for co-occurrence with window size 3). Network-structural features dominated predictive performance (MAE = 0.591 for TFMN), whereas emotion features performed worse (MAE = 0.711 for TFMN) and spreading-activation measures contributed little (MAE = 0.788 for TFMN). This paper offers practical guidance for researchers interested in applying network-based methods for cognitive fields like creativity research. we show when syntactic networks are preferable to surface co-occurrence models, and provide an open, reproducible workflow accessible to newcomers in the field, while also offering deeper methodological insight for experienced researchers."

We introduce VAR-Scaling, the first general framework for inference-time scaling in VAR, addressing the critical challenge of discrete latent spaces that prohibit continuous path search. We find that VAR scales exhibit two distinct pattern types: general patterns and specific patterns, where later-stage specific patterns conditionally optimize early-stage general patterns. To overcome the discrete latent space barrier in VQ models, we map sampling spaces to quasi-continuous feature spaces via kernel density estimation (KDE), where high-density samples approximate stable, high-quality solutions. This transformation enables effective navigation of sampling distributions. We propose a density-adaptive hybrid sampling strategy: Top-k sampling focuses on high-density regions to preserve quality near distribution modes, while Random-k sampling explores low-density areas to maintain diversity and prevent premature convergence. Consequently, VAR-Scaling optimizes sample fidelity at critical scales to enhance output quality. Experiments in class-conditional and text-to-image evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in inference process. The code is available at https://github.com/WD7ang/VAR-Scaling."

However, vision-agnostic watermarks introduce visually irrelevant tokens and disrupt visual grounding by enforcing indiscriminate pseudo-random biases, while some semantic-aware methods incur prohibitive inference latency due to rejection sampling. In this paper, we propose the VIsual Semantic Adaptive Watermark (VISA-Mark), a novel framework that embeds detectable signals while strictly preserving visual fidelity. Our approach employs a lightweight, efficiently trained prefix-tuner to extract dynamic Visual-Evidence Weights, which quantify the evidentiary support for candidate tokens based on the visual input. These weights guide an adaptive vocabulary partitioning and logits perturbation mechanism, concentrating watermark strength specifically on visually-supported tokens. By actively aligning the watermark with visual evidence, VISA-Mark effectively maintains visual fidelity. Empirical results confirm that VISA-Mark outperforms conventional methods with a 7.8% improvement in visual consistency (Chair-I) and superior semantic fidelity. The framework maintains highly competitive detection accuracy (96.88% AUC) and robust attack resilience (99.3%) without sacrificing inference efficiency, effectively establishing a new standard for reliability-preserving multimodal watermarking."

    "abstract": "Strategic manipulation of elections is typically studied in the context of promoting individual candidates. In parliamentary elections, however, the focus shifts: voters may care more about the overall governing coalition than the individual parties' seat counts. This paper studies this new problem: manipulating parliamentary elections with the goal of promoting the collective seat count of a coalition of parties. We focus on proportional representation elections, and consider two variants of the problem; one in which the sole goal is to maximize the total number of seats held by the desired coalition, and the other with a dual objective of both promoting the coalition and promoting the relative power of some favorite party within the coalition. We examine two types of strategic manipulations: \\emph{bribery}, which allows modifying voters' preferences, and \\emph{control}, which allows changing the sets of voters and parties. We consider multiple bribery types, presenting polynomial-time algorithms for some, while proving NP-hardness for others. For control, we provide polynomial-time algorithms for control by adding and deleting voters. In contrast, control by adding and deleting parties, we show, is either impossible (i.e., the problem is immune to control) or computationally hard, in particular, W[1]-hard when parameterized by the number of parties that can be added or deleted."

Our method transfers motion to target skeletons by leveraging these skeleton-agnostic representations alongside target-specific structural information. To ensure robust learning and preserve motion fidelity, we introduce a cycle consistency mechanism that maintains semantic coherence throughout the retargeting process.

The DocZSRE-SI framework leverages Entity Side Information, such as Entity Mention Descriptions and Entity Mention Hypernyms, to perform ZSRE without depending on LLM-generated synthetic data. The proposed low-complexity model achieves an average improvement of 11.6% in the macro F1-Score compared to baseline models and existing benchmarks. By utilizing Entity Side Information, DocZSRE-SI offers a robust and efficient alternative to error-prone, LLM-based methods, demonstrating significant advancements in handling low-resource languages and linguistic diversity in relation extraction tasks. This research provides a scalable and reliable solution for ZSRE, particularly in contexts like Malaysian English news articles, where traditional LLM-based approaches fall short."

    "abstract": "Web agents, powered by large language models (LLMs), are increasingly deployed to automate complex web interactions. The rise of open-source frameworks (e.g., Browser Use, Skyvern-AI) has accelerated adoption, but also broadened the attack surface. While prior research has focused on model threats such as prompt injection and backdoors, the risks of social engineering remain largely unexplored. We present the first systematic study of social engineering attacks against web automation agents and design a pluggable runtime mitigation solution. On the attack side, we introduce the AgentBait paradigm, which exploits intrinsic weaknesses in agent execution: inducement contexts can distort the agent's reasoning and steer it toward malicious objectives misaligned with the intended task. On the defense side, we propose SUPERVISOR, a lightweight runtime module that enforces environment and intention consistency alignment between webpage context and intended goals to mitigate unsafe operations before execution. Empirical results show that mainstream frameworks are highly vulnerable to AgentBait, with an average attack success rate of 67.5% and peaks above 80% under specific strategies (e.g., trusted identity forgery). Compared with existing lightweight defenses, our module can be seamlessly integrated across different web automation frameworks and reduces attack success rates by up to 78.1% on average while incurring only a 7.7% runtime overhead and preserving usability. This work reveals AgentBait as a critical new threat surface for web agents and establishes a practical, generalizable defense, advancing the security of this rapidly emerging ecosystem. We reported the details of this attack to the framework developers and received acknowledgment before submission."

The proposed model has increasing, bathtub shaped and inverse bathtub shaped hazard rate function. We use the method of maximum likelihood estimation to estimate the unknown parameters.

    "abstract": "Learning models that can handle distribution shifts is a key challenge in domain generalization. Invariance learning, an approach that focuses on identifying features invariant across environments, improves model generalization by capturing stable relationships, which may represent causal effects when the data distribution is encoded within a structural equation model (SEM) and satisfies modularity conditions. This has led to a growing body of work that builds on invariance learning, leveraging the inherent heterogeneity across environments to develop methods that provide causal explanations while enhancing robust prediction. However, in many practical scenarios, obtaining complete outcome data from each environment is challenging due to the high cost or complexity of data collection. This limitation in available data hinders the development of models that fully leverage environmental heterogeneity, making it crucial to address missing outcomes to improve both causal insights and robust prediction. In this work, we derive an estimator from the invariance objective under missing outcomes. We establish non-asymptotic guarantees on variable selection property and $\\ell_2$ error convergence rates, which are influenced by the proportion of missing data and the quality of imputation models across environments. We evaluate the performance of the new estimator through extensive simulations and demonstrate its application using the UCI Bike Sharing dataset to predict the count of bike rentals. The results show that despite relying on a biased imputation model, the estimator is efficient and achieves lower prediction error, provided the bias is within a reasonable range."

We review linguistic features, such as orthography, morphology, lexical diversity, syntax, information density, and typological distance, linking each to concrete modeling mechanisms. Gaps often shrink when segmentation, encoding, and data exposure are normalized, suggesting much apparent difficulty stems from current modeling choices. We synthesize these insights into design recommendations for tokenization, sampling, architectures, and evaluation to support more balanced multilingual LMs."

However, the current researches are mainly focused on their physical structures and system functions, while radio-frequency (RF) signal processing and calculation remain constrained to digital-domain operations. This reliance on digital conversion inherently increases hardware complexity and power consumption. To address this challenge, we propose a programmable RF calculation system based on a space-time-coding metasurface (STCM), which can control the wave-matter interactions through space-time-coding (STC) strategies and achieve direct RF calculations in the electromagnetic (EM) space in a reprogrammable way. Particularly, the fundamental signal operations - Fourier transform and convolution - are implemented in the EM-wave domain successfully. We validate the RF calculation capabilities in radar scenarios, facilitating the accurate detection of target velocity and range. Theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and experimental results collectively demonstrate that the STCM-based RF calculation system exhibits superior precision, enhanced operational efficiency, and notable cost-effectiveness, highlighting its significant potentials for the next-generation electronic system deployments."

    "abstract": "In the 21st century, the era of globalization, consumers are dispersed across the globe, and brands compete for their attention and loyalty, largely within the digital realm. This reality elevates the importance of effective communication and the transmission of product value across diverse cultural contexts. This study presents a comparative quantitative analysis of the digital marketing strategies of Xiaomi, a leading Chinese technology brand, on two major social media platforms: Sina Weibo in China and VK (VKontakte) in Russia. The research investigates how Xiaomi adapts its communication to align with local cultural values, as defined by the theoretical frameworks of Hofstede and Hall. Through a frequency analysis of text-based posts and emoji usage, this paper demonstrates the significant differences in Xiaomi's communication strategies in these two markets. The findings reveal that in China, a market characterized by high masculinity and low uncertainty avoidance, Xiaomi's messaging focuses on innovation, authority, and aspiration. In contrast, in Russia, a market with high uncertainty avoidance and lower masculinity, the brand's communication is more pragmatic, emphasizing tangible product benefits and building emotional connections. This study contributes to the field of intercultural digital marketing by providing empirical evidence of how a global brand adapts its communication strategies to different cultural contexts. The findings offer valuable insights for multinational corporations seeking to develop effective global marketing strategies in an increasingly interconnected world."

To further improve predictive accuracy and model interpretability, several regularized reduced-rank regression methods have been proposed. However, these existing methods cannot bias the regression coefficients toward the leading principal component directions while accounting for the correlation structure among explanatory variables. In addition, when the explanatory variables exhibit a group structure, the correlation structure within each group cannot be adequately incorporated.To address these limitations, we propose a new method that introduces pcLasso into the reduced-rank regression framework. The proposed method improves predictive accuracy by accounting for the correlation among response variables while strongly biasing the matrix of regression coefficients toward principal component directions with large variance. Furthermore, even in settings where the explanatory variables possess a group structure, the proposed method is capable of explicitly incorporating this structure into the estimation process. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through numerical simulations and real data application."

This paper investigates the effect of training objective composition on reasoning reliability through Direct Preference Optimization. Two complementary training signals are examined: forward chain-of-thought generation, which trains the model to produce correct reasoning traces, and backward verification, which trains the model to verify and acknowledge errors in candidate solutions. Experiments on GSM8K reveal a fundamental trade-off between these objectives. Forward-only DPO training achieves the highest accuracy improvement, increasing from 83.1% to 86.6% (+3.5 percentage points), while backward-only training yields minimal accuracy gains but substantially reduces the false positive rate from 13.4% to 4.3%. Notably, both training variants reduce acknowledgement rate compared to the baseline, suggesting that preference optimization increases model confidence in its outputs. These findings indicate that forward and backward reasoning objectives provide distinct and complementary learning signals: forward training improves problem-solving capability, while backward training improves verification calibration. The complete training and evaluation pipeline, implemented efficiently through Low-Rank Adaptation, is released to facilitate further research."

By analyzing the interaction between photon spin angular momentum (SAM) and GWs, we derive the selection rules governing this exchange, which are strictly dictated by the spin-1 and spin-2 nature of the electromagnetic and gravitational fields, respectively. We find that the gravitational chiroptical effect reflects the local nature of SAM which prevents the accumulation of gravitational perturbations over spatial phase windings, and offers a theoretically rigorous tool to probe the chiral structure of GWs. This mechanism provides a novel observational pathway to constrain modified gravity theories, measure the asymmetric properties of compact binaries, and explore parity-violating physics in the early universe."

The optimal matching is determined by a simple \"reverse-priority rule\": pair each element with its reversal unless it is a palindrome, in which case pair with its complement. We verify that the historically significant King Wen sequence of the I Ching is isomorphic to this optimal matching. Notably, allowing comp(rev) pairings yields lower cost (96), but the King Wen sequence follows the structurally simpler rule. All results are formally verified in Lean 4 with the Mathlib library."

While on-policy KD approaches attempt to mitigate this issue by learning directly from student-generated outputs, they frequently encounter training instabilities because the distributional gap between the novice student and the expert teacher is often too wide to bridge directly. These challenges manifest as pathological gradients in forward KL objectives or diversity collapse in reverse KL regimes. To address these limitations, we propose Veto, an objective-level reformulation that constructs a geometric bridge in the logit space. Unlike prior methods that mix data samples, Veto creates an intermediate target distribution that promotes alignment between the teacher and the student. By introducing a tunable parameter beta, Veto serves as an Adaptive Gradient Veto that stabilizes optimization by suppressing harmful gradients on low-confidence tokens, while simultaneously acting as a Decisiveness Knob to balance reward-driven performance with output diversity. Extensive experiments across various reasoning and generation tasks demonstrate that Veto consistently outperforms supervised fine-tuning and existing on-policy baselines."

These results motivate our exploration of secure and safe cyber-physical control systems in the unified framework of control and detection.

    "abstract": "The surface pressure field of transportation systems, including cars, trains, and aircraft, is critical for aerodynamic analysis and design. In recent years, deep neural networks have emerged as promising and efficient methods for modeling surface pressure field, being alternatives to computationally expensive CFD simulations. Currently, large-scale public datasets are available for domains such as automotive aerodynamics. However, in many specialized areas, such as high-speed trains, data scarcity remains a fundamental challenge in aerodynamic modeling, severely limiting the effectiveness of standard neural network approaches. To address this limitation, we propose the Adaptive Field Learning Framework (AdaField), which pre-trains the model on public large-scale datasets to improve generalization in sub-domains with limited data. AdaField comprises two key components. First, we design the Semantic Aggregation Point Transformer (SAPT) as a high-performance backbone that efficiently handles large-scale point clouds for surface pressure prediction. Second, regarding the substantial differences in flow conditions and geometric scales across different aerodynamic subdomains, we propose Flow-Conditioned Adapter (FCA) and Physics-Informed Data Augmentation (PIDA). FCA enables the model to flexibly adapt to different flow conditions with a small set of trainable parameters, while PIDA expands the training data distribution to better cover variations in object scale and velocity. Our experiments show that AdaField achieves SOTA performance on the DrivAerNet++ dataset and can be effectively transferred to train and aircraft scenarios with minimal fine-tuning. These results highlight AdaField's potential as a generalizable and transferable solution for surface pressure field modeling, supporting efficient aerodynamic design across a wide range of transportation systems."

    "abstract": "Half-metals, featuring ideal 100\\% spin polarization, are widely regarded as key materials for spintronic and quantum technologies; however, the half-metallic state is intrinsically fragile, as it relies on a delicate balance of exchange splitting and band filling and is therefore highly susceptible to disorder, external perturbations, and thermal effects. Here we introduce the concept of hidden half-metallicity, whereby the global electronic structure of a symmetry-enforced net-zero-magnetization magnet is non-half-metallic, while each of its two symmetry-related sectors is individually half-metallic, enabling robust 100\\% spin polarization through a layer degree of freedom. Crucially, the vanishing net magnetization of the entire system suppresses stray fields and magnetic instabilities, rendering the half-metallic functionality inherently more robust than in conventional ferromagnetic half-metals. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate this mechanism in a $PT$-symmetric bilayer $\\mathrm{CrS_2}$, and further show that an external electric field drives the system into a seemingly forbidden fully compensated ferrimagnetic metal in which hidden half-metallicity persists. Finally, we briefly confirm the realization of hidden half-metallicity in altermagnets, establishing a general paradigm for stabilizing half-metallic behavior by embedding it in symmetry-protected hidden sectors and opening a new route toward the design and discovery of unprecedented half-metallic phases."

Grad-CAM highlighted lesion-corresponding regions in high-confidence cases. These results demonstrate that foundation model-based pipelines can support robust and interpretable CRLM detection and classification across heterogeneous CT data."

    "abstract": "The study of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), a deconfined state of nuclear matter, remains a central focus of high-energy heavy-ion collision experiments. The recent operation of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Run 3 at the new center-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.36$ TeV necessitates theoretical predictions to characterize the energy dependence and bulk properties of the medium. In this study, we present comprehensive EPOS4 model predictions for key global observables in Pb-Pb collisions at $5.36$ TeV. We focus on the centrality dependence of the charged-particle pseudorapidity density ($dN_{ch}/dη$), integrated yields ($dN/dy$), mean transverse momentum ($\\langle p_{T}\\rangle$) for light-flavor hadrons ($π^{\\pm}, K^{\\pm}, p(\\bar{p})$), and the charged particle nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$). The EPOS4 framework successfully captures the strong mass-dependent rise of $\\langle p_{T}\\rangle$ with multiplicity, a definitive signature of collective radial flow. Furthermore, the predicted charged hadron $R_{AA}$ demonstrates a clear suppression, consistent with energy loss mechanisms incorporated into the model. By comparing these predictions to existing $5.02$ TeV data, we demonstrate that the EPOS4 model offers a consistent and robust description of heavy-ion dynamics, projecting minimal energy evolution for these bulk and hard-probe observables between the two energies."

In contrast, methods that rely on Gaussian-sketching, which ensure differential privacy by pre-multiplying the data with a random Gaussian matrix, are widely used in federated and distributed regression, yet remain relatively uncommon for DP-OLS. In this work, we introduce the iterative Hessian mixing, a novel DP-OLS algorithm that relies on Gaussian sketches and is inspired by the iterative Hessian sketch algorithm. We provide utility analysis for the iterative Hessian mixing as well as a new analysis for the previous methods that rely on Gaussian sketches. Then, we show that our new approach circumvents the intrinsic limitations of the prior methods and provides non-trivial improvements over AdaSSP. We conclude by running an extensive set of experiments across standard benchmarks to demonstrate further that our approach consistently outperforms these prior baselines."

Our study is based on the DREAMS project and combines large-volume uniform-box simulations with high-resolution Milky Way zoom-in runs in a $Λ$WDM cosmology. To ensure consistency between the different simulation sets, we apply calibrations to account for resolution effects, allowing us to exploit the complementary strengths of the two suites. We compare simulated relations, including stellar size, DM mass and fraction within the stellar half-mass radius, and the total-to-stellar mass ratio, with two complementary galaxy samples: the SPARC catalog of nearby spirals and the LVDB catalog of dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume. Using a bootstrap-based fitting procedure, we show that key cosmological parameters ($Ω_m$, $σ_8$) and supernova feedback strength can be recovered with good accuracy, particularly from the uniform-box simulations. While the WDM particle mass remains unconstrained, the zoom-in simulations reveal subtle WDM-induced trends at low stellar masses in both the DM mass and total-to-stellar mass ratio. We also find that the galaxy stellar mass function exhibits a measurable dependence on the WDM particle mass below log10(M_*/Msun) <~ 8, which appears separable from the impact of feedback, suggesting it as a promising complementary probe. Our results highlight the importance of combining multi-resolution simulations with diverse observational datasets to jointly constrain baryonic processes and DM properties."

While methods such as Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison (MAIC) and Simulated Treatment Comparison (STC) exist to adjust for these cross-trial differences, software implementations have often been fragmented or limited in scope. This article introduces outstandR, an R package designed to provide a comprehensive and unified framework for population-adjusted indirect comparison (PAIC). Beyond standard weighting and regression approaches, outstandR implements advanced G-computation methods within both maximum likelihood and Bayesian frameworks, and Multiple Imputation Marginalization (MIM) to address non-collapsibility and missing data. By streamlining the workflow of covariate simulation, model standardization, and contrast estimation, outstandR enables robust and compatible evidence synthesis in complex decision-making scenarios."

To address this challenge, we present MegaFlow, a large-scale distributed orchestration system that enables efficient scheduling, resource allocation, and fine-grained task management for agent-environment workloads. MegaFlow abstracts agent training infrastructure into three independent services (Model Service, Agent Service, and Environment Service) that interact through unified interfaces, enabling independent scaling and flexible resource allocation across diverse agent-environment configurations. In our agent training deployments, MegaFlow successfully orchestrates tens of thousands of concurrent agent tasks while maintaining high system stability and achieving efficient resource utilization.

By expanding the information bits within this set into 0s and 1s, we eliminate the correlations among information bits, thereby enabling the recursive calculation of the Hamming weight distribution using the \\emph{PCD method}. Second, to further reduce computational complexity, we establish the theory of equivalence classes for pre-transformed polar codes. Codes within the same equivalence class share an identical weight distribution but correspond to different \\emph{Expanded Information Set} sizes. By selecting the pre-transformation matrix that minimizes the \\emph{Expanded Information Set} size within an equivalence class, we optimize the computation process.

    "abstract": "Due to strict rate and reliability demands, wireless image transmission remains difficult for both classical layered designs and joint source-channel coding (JSCC), especially under low latency. Diffusion-based generative decoders can deliver strong perceptual quality by leveraging learned image priors, but iterative stochastic denoising leads to high decoding delay. To enable low-latency decoding, we propose a flow-matching (FM) generative decoder under a new land-then-transport (LTT) paradigm that tightly integrates the physical wireless channel into a continuous-time probability flow. For AWGN channels, we build a Gaussian smoothing path whose noise schedule indexes effective noise levels, and derive a closed-form teacher velocity field along this path. A neural-network student vector field is trained by conditional flow matching, yielding a deterministic, channel-aware ODE decoder with complexity linear in the number of ODE steps. At inference, it only needs an estimate of the effective noise variance to set the ODE starting time. We further show that Rayleigh fading and MIMO channels can be mapped, via linear MMSE equalization and singular-value-domain processing, to AWGN-equivalent channels with calibrated starting times. Therefore, the same probability path and trained velocity field can be reused for Rayleigh and MIMO without retraining. Experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and DIV2K over AWGN, Rayleigh, and MIMO demonstrate consistent gains over JPEG2000+LDPC, DeepJSCC, and diffusion-based baselines, while achieving good perceptual quality with only a few ODE steps. Overall, LTT provides a deterministic, physically interpretable, and computation-efficient framework for generative wireless image decoding across diverse channels."

We focus on floating-point arithmetic, which allows for using efficient matrix multiplication libraries. However, the existing approach is limited to primes p with bitsize at most half the mantissa size (e.g., 26 bits with double precision arithmetic), and becomes quite inefficient when p approaches this limit. We present a new approach that overcomes this limitation and can efficiently handle primes with larger bitsizes. The key idea is to use multiword decompositions, which represent A and B as scaled sums of u and v matrices (words) with smaller coefficients. We provide a rigorous analysis that proves the correctness of this approach for suitably chosen scaling parameters. Our analysis determines the maximum bitsize of p that can be handled for a given number of words; in particular, we show that decomposing in two words each input suffices to handle bitsizes almost equal to the full mantissa size (e.g., the 26 bits limit is raised to 52 bits in double precision arithmetic). Moreover, we show that (1,v) decompositions with v>1 are also of interest to handle intermediate bitsizes. We perform an extensive experimental analysis for various matrix shapes and prime bitsizes. Our performance benchmarks on both CPU and GPU architectures confirm the efficiency of the proposed approach, which can outperform the existing single word approach for bitsizes as low as 23, and can handle bitsizes as high as 52 while retaining high performance."

In this work, we analyse energetic-particle transport within this modelling context, where we simulate the high-energy particle distribution and ensuing emission of non-thermal radiation. From these high-resolution simulations, we compute the non-thermal emission from this system and compare it to corresponding observations. We modelled the LS 5039 system assuming a wind-driven scenario. Our numerical model uses a joint simulation of the dynamical wind interaction together with the transport of energetic leptons from the shocked pulsar wind. We computed the non-thermal emission from this system in a post-processing step from the resulting distribution of energetic leptons. In this computation, we took into account the synchrotron and inverse Compton emission, relativistic beaming, and γγ-absorption in the stellar radiation field. We investigated the dynamical variation of the energetic particle spectra on both orbital and on short timescales. Our model successfully reproduces many of the spectral features of LS 5039. We also find a better correspondence between our predicted orbital light curves and the corresponding observations in soft x-rays, low-energy, and high-energy gamma rays than in our previous modelling efforts. We find that our high-resolution and large-scale simulations can successfully capture the relevant parts of the wind-collision region that are related to particle acceleration and emission of non-thermal radiation. The quality of the fit strengthens the wind-driven assumption underlying our model. Desirable extensions for the future include a dynamical magnetic-field model for the synchrotron regime, a revision of our injection parameters, and a consideration of an additional hadronic component that could explain recent observations in the 100~TeV regime."

This is achieved through two novel approaches: a p-thinning-based cross-validation method to tune the penalisation parameter, relying on the spectral representation of the process; and the introduction of a spectral least-squares contrast based around the asymptotic properties of the periodogram of the sample. The proposed method is then illustrated by a simulation study on linear Hawkes processes in the context of parametric estimation, highlighting its performances against more traditional approaches, specifically when working with short observation windows."

The central challenge is to balance consistency and robustness: when predictions are accurate, the algorithm should select a near-optimal secretary, while under inaccurate predictions it should still guarantee a bounded competitive ratio. We consider both the classical Random Order Secretary Problem (ROSP), where candidates arrive in a uniformly random order, and a more natural learning-augmented model in which the decision-maker may choose the arrival order based on predicted values. We call this model the Chosen Order Secretary Problem (COSP), capturing scenarios such as interview schedules set in advance. We propose a new randomized algorithm applicable to both ROSP and COSP. Our method switches from fully trusting predictions to a threshold-based rule once a large prediction deviation is detected. Let $ε\\in [0,1]$ denote the maximum multiplicative prediction error. For ROSP, our algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of $\\max\\{0.221, (1-ε)/(1+ε)\\}$, improving upon the prior bound of $\\max\\{0.215, (1-ε)/(1+ε)\\}$. For COSP, we achieve $\\max\\{0.262, (1-ε)/(1+ε)\\}$, surpassing the $0.25$ worst-case bound for prior approaches and moving closer to the classical secretary benchmark of $1/e \\approx 0.368$.

To address this issue, researchers have explored neuro-symbolic approaches to bolster LLM logical reasoning capabilities. However, existing neuro-symbolic methods still face challenges with information loss during the process. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Iterative Feedback-Driven Neuro-Symbolic (IFDNS), a novel prompt-based method that employs a multi-round feedback mechanism to address LLM limitations in handling complex logical relationships. IFDNS utilizes iterative feedback during the logic extraction phase to accurately extract causal relationship statements and translate them into propositional and logical implication expressions, effectively mitigating information loss issues. Furthermore, IFDNS is orthogonal to existing prompt methods, allowing for seamless integration with various prompting approaches. Empirical evaluations across six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of IFDNS in significantly improving the performance of CoT and Chain-of-Thought with Self-Consistency (CoT-SC). Specifically, IFDNS achieves a +9.40% accuracy boost for CoT on the LogiQA dataset and a +11.70% improvement for CoT-SC on the PrOntoQA dataset."

However, existing mmWave-based interaction-sensing systems exhibit poor spatial generalization at unseen distances or viewpoints. To address this challenge, we introduce WaveMan, a spatially adaptive room-scale perception system that restores reliable human interaction sensing across arbitrary user positions. WaveMan integrates viewpoint alignment and spectrogram enhancement for spatial consistency, with dual-channel attention for robust feature extraction. Experiments across five participants show that, under fixed-position evaluation, WaveMan achieves the same cross-position accuracy as the baseline with five times fewer training positions. In random free-position testing, accuracy increases from 33.00% to 94.33%, enabled by the proposed method.

Pointwise scoring is efficient but often fails to account for list-level interactions, leading to miscalibrated top-$k$ rankings. Listwise approaches can leverage global context, yet they are computationally expensive and become unstable as candidate lists grow. To address this, we propose Residual Listwise Preference Optimization (RLPO), which formulates ranking as listwise representation-level residual correction over a strong pointwise LLM scorer. RLPO first produces calibrated pointwise scores and item representations, then applies a lightweight encoder over the representations to predict listwise score residuals, avoiding full token-level listwise processing.

Two positive integers $m$ and $n$ are called an amicable pair if the sum of proper divisors of $m$ equals $n$ and the sum of proper divisors of $n$ equals $m$. Our formalization introduces the proper divisor sum function $\\propersum(n) = σ(n) - n$, defines the concepts of amicable pairs and amicable numbers, and computationally verifies historically famous amicable pairs. Furthermore, we formalize basic structural theorems, including symmetry, non-triviality, and connections to abundant/deficient numbers. A key contribution is the complete formal proof of the classical Thābit formula (9th century), using index-shifting and the \\texttt{zify} tactic. Additionally, we provide complete formal proofs of both Thābit's rule and Euler's generalized rule (1747), two fundamental theorems for generating amicable pairs. A major achievement is the first complete formalization of the Borho-Hoffmann breeding method (1986), comprising 540 lines with 33 theorems and leveraging automated algebra tactics (\\texttt{zify} and \\texttt{ring}) to verify complex polynomial identities. We also formalize extensions including sociable numbers (aliquot cycles), betrothed numbers (quasi-amicable pairs), parity constraint theorems, and computational search bounds for coprime pairs ($>10^{65}$). We verify the smallest sociable cycle of length 5 (Poulet's cycle) and computationally verify specific instances. The formalization comprises 2076 lines of Lean code organized into Mathlib-candidate and paper-specific modules, with 139 theorems and all necessary infrastructure for divisor sum multiplicativity and coprimality reasoning."

I suggest that while Bohmian mechanics improves on textbook quantum theory, it does not go far enough. In particular, it relies on the ``quantum equilibrium hypothesis'' and accepts explicit nonlocality as fundamental. A deeper completion is available in stochastic mechanics, where the wavefunction and the Born rule emerge from an underlying diffusion process, and in a contextual, category-theoretic semantics in which measurement and EPR--Bell correlations are reinterpreted as features of contextual truth rather than of mysterious dynamics. In this framework, the measurement problem and ``spooky action-at-a-distance'' are dissolved rather than solved. Finally, a dynamics based on Rosen's ``classical Schrödinger equation'' provides a continuous passage between quantum and classical regimes, eliminating any sharp Heisenberg cut."

It combines a fast particle-tree (PT) algorithm for long-range forces with a high-accuracy particle-particle (PP, direct $N$-body) solver for short-range interactions. Preserving both PT efficiency and PP accuracy requires a robust PT-PP switching criterion. We introduce a simple free-fall-based switching criterion for general stellar systems, alongside the commonly used velocity-dispersion-based ($σ$-based) criterion. Using the \\textsc{petar} code with the P$^3$T scheme and slow-down algorithmic regularization for binaries and higher-order multiples, we perform extensive simulations of star clusters to evaluate how each criterion affects energy conservation and binary evolution. For systems in virial equilibrium, we find that the free-fall-based criterion is generally more accurate for low-$σ$ or loose clusters containing binaries, whereas the $σ$-based criterion is better suited for high-$σ$ systems. Under subvirial or fractal initial conditions, both criteria struggle to maintain high energy conservation; however, the free-fall-based criterion improves as the tree timestep is reduced, whereas the $σ$-based degrades due to its low-accuracy treatment of two-body encounters."

However, most existing argumentative corpora focus on non-interactive, single-turn settings, either generating arguments from a given topic or refuting an existing argument. In practice, however, argumentation is often realized as multi-turn dialogue, where speakers defend their stances and employ diverse argumentative strategies to strengthen persuasiveness. To support deeper modeling of argumentation dialogue, we present the first large-scale \\textbf{S}trategic \\textbf{A}rgumentative \\textbf{D}ialogue dataset, SAD, consisting of 392,822 examples. Grounded in argumentation theories, we annotate each utterance with five strategy types, allowing multiple strategies per utterance.

We further benchmark a range of pretrained generative models on SAD and present in-depth analysis of strategy usage patterns in argumentation."

In the non-relativistic regime, this framework reduces to the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson or Schrödinger-Poisson equations, depending on whether axion self-interactions are taken into account. In this work, a non-minimal gravitational coupling term $ξR φ^4$ is included into the axion's relativistic action as a way to introduce a gravitationally mediated pairwise interaction. By performing a perturbative expansion and subsequently taking the non-relativistic limit, an alternative set of equations that govern the early stages of structure formation is obtained."

    "abstract": "Over-smoothing and over-squashing have been extensively studied in the literature on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) over the past years. We challenge this prevailing focus in GNN research, arguing that these phenomena are less critical for practical applications than assumed. We suggest that performance decreases often stem from uninformative receptive fields rather than over-smoothing. We support this position with extensive experiments on several standard benchmark datasets, demonstrating that accuracy and over-smoothing are mostly uncorrelated and that optimal model depths remain small even with mitigation techniques, thus highlighting the negligible role of over-smoothing. Similarly, we challenge that over-squashing is always detrimental in practical applications. Instead, we posit that the distribution of relevant information over the graph frequently factorises and is often localised within a small k-hop neighbourhood, questioning the necessity of jointly observing entire receptive fields or engaging in an extensive search for long-range interactions. The results of our experiments show that architectural interventions designed to mitigate over-squashing fail to yield significant performance gains. This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in theoretical research, urging a diligent analysis of learning tasks and datasets using statistics that measure the underlying distribution of label-relevant information to better understand their localisation and factorisation."

It is based on the belief that collinear magnets always feature an inversion-symmetric band structure, which forbids odd-wave magnetism. Here, we show that collinear magnets, which break time reversal symmetry in the non-magnetic sector, can have an inversion symmetry broken band structure and lead to unconventional types of collinear magnets. Hence, collinear odd-wave magnets do exist, and we explain that a magnetic field-induced Edelstein effect is their unique signature. We propose minimal models based on the coexistence of AFM order with compensated loop current orders for all types of collinear magnets. Our work provides a new perspective on collinear magnets and the spin-space group classification."

However, standard GRPO employs a coarse-grained credit assignment mechanism that propagates group-level rewards uniformly to to every token in a sequence, neglecting the varying contribution of individual reasoning steps. We address this limitation by introducing Outcome-grounded Advantage Reshaping (OAR), a fine-grained credit assignment mechanism that redistributes advantages based on how much each token influences the model's final answer. We instantiate OAR via two complementary strategies: (1) OAR-P, which estimates outcome sensitivity through counterfactual token perturbations, serving as a high-fidelity attribution signal; (2) OAR-G, which uses an input-gradient sensitivity proxy to approximate the influence signal with a single backward pass. These importance signals are integrated with a conservative Bi-Level advantage reshaping scheme that suppresses low-impact tokens and boosts pivotal ones while preserving the overall advantage mass. Empirical results on extensive mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that while OAR-P sets the performance upper bound, OAR-G achieves comparable gains with negligible computational overhead, both significantly outperforming a strong GRPO baseline, pushing the boundaries of critic-free LLM reasoning."

The human population is divided into compartments for primary and secondary infections, while the mosquito population includes single- and co-infected classes. ADE is modeled through distinct primary ($α$) and secondary ($σ$) transmission rates. Using the next-generation matrix method, we derive the basic reproduction number $R_0$ and establish the local stability of the disease-free equilibrium for $R_0 < 1$. Analytical results show that one-strain endemic equilibria lose stability under ADE conditions ($σ> α$), allowing invasion by a heterologous strain. Employing center-manifold theory and numerical continuation (COCO), we demonstrate the occurrence of backward bifurcation, bistability between disease-free and endemic states, and Hopf-induced oscillations. Numerical simulations confirm transitions among disease-free, endemic, and periodic regimes as key parameters vary. The model highlights how ADE, waning cross-immunity, and vector co-infection interact to generate complex dengue dynamics and provides insights useful for designing effective control and vaccination strategies in dengue-endemic regions."

    "abstract": "While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) scales capacity via conditional computation, Transformers lack a native primitive for knowledge lookup, forcing them to inefficiently simulate retrieval through computation. To address this, we introduce conditional memory as a complementary sparsity axis, instantiated via Engram, a module that modernizes classic $N$-gram embedding for O(1) lookup. By formulating the Sparsity Allocation problem, we uncover a U-shaped scaling law that optimizes the trade-off between neural computation (MoE) and static memory (Engram). Guided by this law, we scale Engram to 27B parameters, achieving superior performance over a strictly iso-parameter and iso-FLOPs MoE baseline. Most notably, while the memory module is expected to aid knowledge retrieval (e.g., MMLU +3.4; CMMLU +4.0), we observe even larger gains in general reasoning (e.g., BBH +5.0; ARC-Challenge +3.7) and code/math domains~(HumanEval +3.0; MATH +2.4). Mechanistic analyses reveal that Engram relieves the backbone's early layers from static reconstruction, effectively deepening the network for complex reasoning. Furthermore, by delegating local dependencies to lookups, it frees up attention capacity for global context, substantially boosting long-context retrieval (e.g., Multi-Query NIAH: 84.2 to 97.0). Finally, Engram establishes infrastructure-aware efficiency: its deterministic addressing enables runtime prefetching from host memory, incurring negligible overhead. We envision conditional memory as an indispensable modeling primitive for next-generation sparse models."

Our results show that, while human observers perform poorly (near chance levels) on this binary classification task, a variety of machine-learning models achieve accuracy in the range 0.93 - 0.98 over a previously unseen test set, even using only short samples and single-token (unigram) features. We therefore employ an inherently interpretable (linear) classifier (with a test accuracy of 0.98), in order to elucidate the underlying reasons for this high accuracy. In our analysis, we identify specific unigram features indicative of LLM-generated text, one of the most important being that the LLM tends to use a larger variety of synonyms, thereby skewing the probability distributions in a manner that is easy to detect for a machine learning classifier, yet very difficult for a human observer. Four additional explanation categories were also identified, namely, temporal drift, Americanisms, foreign language usage, and colloquialisms. As identification of the AI-generated text depends on a constellation of such features, the classification appears robust, and therefore not easy to circumvent by malicious actors intent on misrepresenting AI-generated text as human work."

We show how the emergent quantum spacetime exhibits minimal length effects, which deliver both classical Minkowski distances and quantum corrections proportional to the Planck length squared. Furthermore, we establish that noncommutativity respects a fuzzy form of causality, where the quantum causal structure gives back the light cone in the classical limit, vanishing for spacelike separations and encoding a time orientation for timelike intervals."

MENT encompasses four non-literal translation domains and features source sentences paired with translations from diverse MT systems, with 7,530 human-annotated scores on translation quality. Experimental results reveal the inaccuracies of traditional MT metrics and the limitations of LLM-as-a-Judge, particularly the knowledge cutoff and score inconsistency problem. To mitigate these limitations, we propose RATE, a novel agentic translation evaluation framework, centered by a reflective Core Agent that dynamically invokes specialized sub-agents. Experimental results indicate the efficacy of RATE, achieving an improvement of at least 3.2 meta score compared with current metrics.

We derive several fundamental parameters, such as the photon index, soft excess strength, reflection strength, and luminosities of the soft excess and primary continuum. We find that the soft excess and primary continuum emissions show a very strong positive correlation ($p \\ll 10^{-10}$), suggesting a common physical origin. The soft excess strength does not show any dependency on the reflection parameter, suggesting that in these objects the soft excess is not dominated by a blurred ionized reflection process. On the other hand, the strength of the soft excess is found to be strongly positively correlated with the Eddington ratio ($p \\ll 10^{-10}$), and we find that the soft excess vanishes below $\\log λ_{\\rm Edd} \\sim -2.5$. Moreover, we find a clear `V'-shaped relation for $Γ-λ_{\\rm Edd}$, with a break at $\\log λ_{\\rm Edd} = -2.47 \\pm 0.09$. Our findings indicate a change in the geometry of the inner accretion flow at low Eddington ratios, and that the soft excess is primarily produced via warm Comptonization."

Each puzzle combines factual temporal anchors with (cross-cultural) calendar relations, admits one or multiple valid solution dates, and is algorithmically generated for controlled, dynamic, and continual evaluation. Across 13 diverse LLMs, TimePuzzles well distinguishes their iterative temporal reasoning capabilities and remains challenging without tools: GPT-5 reaches only 49.3% accuracy and all other models stay below 31%, despite the dataset's simplicity. Web search consistently yields substantial gains and using code interpreter shows mixed effects, but all models perform much better when constraints are rewritten with explicit dates, revealing a gap in reliable tool use. Overall, TimePuzzles presents a simple, cost-effective diagnostic for tool-augmented iterative temporal reasoning."

    "abstract": "Developing new fluorophores for advanced imaging techniques requires exploring new chemical space. While generative AI approaches have shown promise in designing novel dye scaffolds, prior efforts often produced synthetically intractable candidates due to a lack of reaction constraints. Here, we developed SyntheFluor-RL, a generative AI model that employs known reaction libraries and molecular building blocks to create readily synthesizable fluorescent molecule scaffolds via reinforcement learning. To guide the generation of fluorophores, SyntheFluor-RL employs a scoring function built on multiple graph neural networks (GNNs) that predict key photophysical properties, including photoluminescence quantum yield, absorption, and emission wavelengths. These outputs are dynamically weighted and combined with a computed pi-conjugation score to prioritize candidates with desirable optical characteristics and synthetic feasibility. SyntheFluor-RL generated 11,590 candidate molecules, which were filtered to 19 structures predicted to possess dye-like properties. Of the 19 molecules, 14 were synthesized and 13 were experimentally confirmed. The top three were characterized, with the lead compound featuring a benzothiadiazole chromophore and exhibiting strong fluorescence (PLQY = 0.62), a large Stokes shift (97 nm), and a long excited-state lifetime (11.5 ns). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of SyntheFluor-RL in the identification of synthetically accessible fluorophores for further development."

    "abstract": "In human conversation, both interlocutors play an active role in maintaining mutual understanding. When addressees are uncertain about what speakers mean, for example, they can request clarification. It is an open question for language models whether they can assume a similar addressee role, recognizing and expressing their own uncertainty through clarification. We argue that reference games are a good testbed to approach this question as they are controlled, self-contained, and make clarification needs explicit and measurable. To test this, we evaluate three vision-language models comparing a baseline reference resolution task to an experiment where the models are instructed to request clarification when uncertain. The results suggest that even in such simple tasks, models often struggle to recognize internal uncertainty and translate it into adequate clarification behavior. This demonstrates the value of reference games as testbeds for interaction qualities of (vision and) language models."

    "abstract": "Singular learning theory characterizes Bayesian learning as an evolving tradeoff between accuracy and complexity, with transitions between qualitatively different solutions as sample size increases. We extend this theory to deep reinforcement learning, proving that the concentration of the generalized posterior over policies is governed by the local learning coefficient (LLC), an invariant of the geometry of the regret function. This theory predicts that Bayesian phase transitions in reinforcement learning should proceed from simple policies with high regret to complex policies with low regret. We verify this prediction empirically in a gridworld environment exhibiting stagewise policy development: phase transitions over SGD training manifest as \"opposing staircases\" where regret decreases sharply while the LLC increases. Notably, the LLC detects phase transitions even when estimated on a subset of states where the policies appear identical in terms of regret, suggesting it captures changes in the underlying algorithm rather than just performance."

    "abstract": "We study the bond percolation on finite graphs induced by the level-sets of zero-average Gaussian free field on the associated metric graph above a given height (level) parameter $h \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We characterize the near- and off-critical phases of this model for any expanders family $\\mathcal{G}_n = (V_n, E_n)$ with uniformly bounded degrees. In particular, we show that the volume of the largest open cluster at level $h_n$ is of the order $|V_n|^{\\frac23}$ when $h_n$ lies in the corresponding critical window which we identify as $|h_n| = O(|V_n|^{-\\frac13})$. Outside this window, the volume starts to deviate from $Θ(|V_n|^{\\frac23})$ culminating into a linear order in the supercritical phase $h_n = h < 0$ (the giant component) and a logarithmic order in the subcritical phase $h_n = h > 0$. We deduce these from effective estimates on tail probabilities for the maximum volume of an open cluster at any level $h$ for a generic base graph $\\mathcal{G}$. The estimates depend on $\\mathcal{G}$ only through its size and upper and lower bounds on its degrees and spectral gap respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance where a mean-field critical behavior is derived under such general setup for finite graphs. The generality of these estimates preclude any local approximation of $\\mathcal{G}$ by regular infinite trees -- a standard approach in the area. Instead, our methods rely on exploiting the connection between spectral gap of the graph $\\mathcal{G}$ and its connection to the level-sets of zero-average Gaussian free field mediated via a set function we call the zero-average capacity."

Recent works established finite-time blow-up constructions and soliton resolution, describing the asymptotic behaviors of blow-up solutions. In this paper, we go beyond soliton resolution and provide a sharp classification of finite-time blow-up dynamics in the \\textit{single-bubble} regime. Assuming that a solution blows up at time $0<T<\\infty$ with a single-soliton profile, we determine all possible blow-up rates. For initial data in $H^{2L+1}(\\mathbb{R})$ with $L\\ge1$, we prove a dichotomy: either the solution lies in a \\emph{quantized regime}, where the scaling parameter satisfies \\[ λ(t)\\sim (T-t)^{2k},\\qquad 1\\le k\\le L, \\] with convergent phase and translation parameters, or it lies in an \\emph{exotic regime}, where the blow-up rate satisfies $λ(t)\\lesssim (T-t)^{2L+\\frac 32}$. To our knowledge, this is the first classification result for quantized blow-up dynamics in the class of dispersive models. We provide a framework for identifying the quantized blow-up rates in classification problems. The proof relies on a modulation analysis combined with the hierarchy of conservation laws provided by the complete integrability of (CM-DNLS). However, it does not use \\emph{more refined integrability-based techniques}, such as the inverse scattering method, the method of commuting flows, or the explicit formula. As a result, our analysis applies beyond the chiral solutions."

    "abstract": "Decision trees are powerful machine learning algorithms, widely used in fields such as economics and medicine for their simplicity and interpretability. However, decision trees such as CART are prone to overfitting, especially when grown deep or the sample size is small. Conventional methods to reduce overfitting include pre-pruning and post-pruning, which constrain the growth of uninformative branches. In this paper, we propose a complementary approach by introducing a covariance-driven splitting criterion for regression trees (CovRT). This method is more robust to overfitting than the empirical risk minimization criterion used in CART, as it produces more balanced and stable splits and more effectively identifies covariates with true signals. We establish an oracle inequality of CovRT and prove that its predictive accuracy is comparable to that of CART in high-dimensional settings. We find that CovRT achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to CART in both simulations and real-world tasks."

    "abstract": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often suffer from overthinking, generating unnecessarily long reasoning chains even for simple tasks. This leads to substantial computational overhead with limited performance gain, primarily due to redundant verification and repetitive generation. While prior work typically constrains output length or optimizes correctness, such coarse supervision fails to guide models toward concise yet accurate inference. In this paper, we propose ENTRA, an entropy-based training framework that suppresses redundant reasoning while preserving performance. ENTRA first estimates the token-level importance using a lightweight Bidirectional Importance Estimation (BIE) method, which accounts for both prediction confidence and forward influence. It then computes a redundancy reward based on the entropy of low-importance tokens, normalized by its theoretical upper bound, and optimizes this reward via reinforcement learning. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ENTRA reduces output length by 37% to 53% with no loss-and in some cases, gains-in accuracy. Our approach offers a principled and efficient solution to reduce overthinking in LRMs, and provides a generalizable path toward redundancy-aware reasoning optimization."

We propose $α$-reward-preserving attacks, which adapt the strength of the adversary so that an $α$ fraction of the nominal-to-worst-case return gap remains achievable at each state. In deep RL, we use a gradient-based attack direction and learn a state-dependent magnitude $η\\le η_{\\mathcal B}$ selected via a critic $Q^π_α((s,a),η)$ trained off-policy over diverse radii. This adaptive tuning calibrates attack strength and, with intermediate $α$, improves robustness across radii while preserving nominal performance, outperforming fixed- and random-radius baselines."

    "abstract": "The high value of the cosmic microwave dipole may be telling us that dark matter is macroscopic rather than a fundamental particle. The possible presence of a significant dark matter component in the form of primordial black holes suggests that dark halo formation simulations should be commenced well before redshift z = 100. Unlike standard CDM candidates, PBHs behave as dense, non-relativistic matter from their inception in the radiation-dominated era. This allows them to seed gravitational potential wells and begin clustering earlier. We find that starting N-body simulations at redshifts even before matter-radiation equality yield galaxy bulk flow velocities that are systematically larger than those predicted by standard LCDM models. The early, high-mass concentrations established by PBHs lead to a more rapid and efficient gravitational acceleration of surrounding baryonic and dark matter, generating larger peculiar velocities that remain coherent over scales of hundreds of Mpc. Furthermore, a sub- population of PBHs in the 10^-20 to 10^-17 solar mass range would lose a non-negligible fraction of their mass via Hawking radiation over cosmological timescales. This evaporation process converts matter into radiation, so a time-varying matter density parameter, Omega_m', is introduced, which behaves like a boosted radiation term in the Friedmann equation. This dynamic term acts to reduce the Hubble tension. A higher effective Omega_r in the early universe reduces the sound horizon at the epoch of recombination. PBH mass loss also influences fits to the equation of state parameter, w, at low redshift. The naive N-body modelling presented here suggests investigation with tried and tested cosmology codes should be carried out, by introducing mass losing PBHs and starting the evolution as early as practicable."

    "abstract": "Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have been widely applied in real-time scenarios, such as in-car assistants and online meeting comprehension. In practice, audio inputs are often corrupted by device and environmental noise, leading to performance degradation. However, existing LALM studies on noise lack quantitative analysis and rely mainly on intuition and empirical observation, thus failing to understand practical robustness. To address this issue, we introduce Signal Embedding Energy (SEE), a method for quantifying the impact of noise intensity on LALM inputs, enabling the differentiation of LALM robustness in real-world deployments. SEE introduces a perspective based on structured activation subspaces derived from the model's internal representations, which more accurately captures its perception of noise than raw audio features. Across experiments, SEE exhibits a strong correlation with LALM performance, achieving a correlation of 0.98. Surprisingly, traditional audio denoising methods are only marginally effective for LALMs, and, in some cases, even increase SEE and impair performance. This suggests a mismatch between speech-centric denoising objectives and the noise sensitivity of modern LALMs. Therefore, we propose a mitigation strategy derived from SEE to denoise LALM inputs, outperforming existing denoising methods. This paper introduces a novel metric for noise quantification in LALMs, providing guidance for robustness improvements in real-world deployments."

This paper presents the results of experiments on the impact of X-ray radiation in the range of 100-165 keV and a proton beam with energy 18 MeV on the structure of stainless steel wire. In case of proton irradiation an irreversible change in the wire frequency was observed, which indicated residual changes in the structure of the wire material.

    "abstract": "Training Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks is increasingly driven by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), where Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) provides a principled framework for stable policy updates. However, the practical application of PPO is hindered by unreliable advantage estimation in the sparse-reward RLVR regime. This issue arises because the sparse rewards in RLVR lead to inaccurate intermediate value predictions, which in turn introduce significant bias when aggregated at every token by Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE). To address this, we introduce Segmental Advantage Estimation (SAE), which mitigates the bias that GAE can incur in RLVR. Our key insight is that aggregating $n$-step advantages at every token(as in GAE) is unnecessary and often introduces excessive bias, since individual tokens carry minimal information. Instead, SAE first partitions the generated sequence into coherent sub-segments using low-probability tokens as heuristic boundaries. It then selectively computes variance-reduced advantage estimates only from these information-rich segment transitions, effectively filtering out noise from intermediate tokens. Our experiments demonstrate that SAE achieves superior performance, with marked improvements in final scores, training stability, and sample efficiency. These gains are shown to be consistent across multiple model sizes, and a correlation analysis confirms that our proposed advantage estimator achieves a higher correlation with an approximate ground-truth advantage, justifying its superior performance."

    "abstract": "Although deep learning has advanced automated electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis, prevalent supervised methods typically treat recordings as undifferentiated one-dimensional (1D) signals or two-dimensional (2D) images. This formulation compels models to learn physiological structures implicitly, resulting in data inefficiency and opacity that diverge from medical reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose BEAT-Net, a Biomimetic ECG Analysis with Tokenization framework that reformulates the problem as a language modeling task. Utilizing a QRS tokenization strategy to transform continuous signals into biologically aligned heartbeat sequences, the architecture explicitly decomposes cardiac physiology through specialized encoders that extract local beat morphology while normalizing spatial lead perspectives and modeling temporal rhythm dependencies. Evaluations across three large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that BEAT-Net matches the diagnostic accuracy of dominant convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures while substantially improving robustness. The framework exhibits exceptional data efficiency, recovering fully supervised performance using only 30 to 35 percent of annotated data. Moreover, learned attention mechanisms provide inherent interpretability by spontaneously reproducing clinical heuristics, such as Lead II prioritization for rhythm analysis, without explicit supervision. These findings indicate that integrating biological priors offers a computationally efficient and interpretable alternative to data-intensive large-scale pre-training."

    "abstract": "While machine translation is regarded as a \"solved problem\" for many high-resource languages, close analysis quickly reveals that this is not the case for content that shows challenges such as poetic language, philosophical concepts, multi-layered metaphorical expressions, and more. Sanskrit literature is a prime example of this, as it combines a large number of such challenges in addition to inherent linguistic features like sandhi, compounding, and heavy morphology, which further complicate NLP downstream tasks. It spans multiple millennia of text production time as well as a large breadth of different domains, ranging from ritual formulas via epic narratives, philosophical treatises, poetic verses up to scientific material. As of now, there is a strong lack of publicly available resources that cover these different domains and temporal layers of Sanskrit. We therefore introduce Mitrasamgraha, a high-quality Sanskrit-to-English machine translation dataset consisting of 391,548 bitext pairs, more than four times larger than the largest previously available Sanskrit dataset Itih=asa. It covers a time period of more than three millennia and a broad range of historical Sanskrit domains. In contrast to web-crawled datasets, the temporal and domain annotation of this dataset enables fine-grained study of domain and time period effects on MT performance. We also release a validation set consisting of 5,587 and a test set consisting of 5,552 post-corrected bitext pairs. We conduct experiments benchmarking commercial and open models on this dataset and fine-tune NLLB and Gemma models on the dataset, showing significant improvements, while still recognizing significant challenges in the translation of complex compounds, philosophical concepts, and multi-layered metaphors. We also analyze how in-context learning on this dataset impacts the performance of commercial models"

However, existing client simulation approaches face three key challenges: (1) limited diversity and realism in client profiles, (2) the lack of a principled framework for modeling realistic client behaviors, and (3) a scarcity in Chinese-language settings. To address these limitations, we propose PsyCLIENT, a novel simulation framework grounded in conversational trajectory modeling. By conditioning LLM generation on predefined real-world trajectories that incorporate explicit behavior labels and content constraints, our approach ensures diverse and realistic interactions. We further introduce PsyCLIENT-CP, the first open-source Chinese client profile dataset, covering 60 distinct counseling topics. Comprehensive evaluations involving licensed professional counselors demonstrate that PsyCLIENT significantly outperforms baselines in terms of authenticity and training effectiveness. Notably, the simulated clients are nearly indistinguishable from human clients, achieving an about 95\\% expert confusion rate in discrimination tasks. These findings indicate that conversational trajectory modeling effectively bridges the gap between theoretical client profiles and dynamic, realistic simulations, offering a robust solution for mental health education and research. Code and data will be released to facilitate future research in mental health counseling."

We systematically compare channel-spatial attention combinations under a unified framework, building an evaluation suite of 18 topologies across four classes: sequential, parallel, multi-scale, and residual. Across two vision and nine medical datasets, we uncover a \"data scale-method-performance\" coupling law: (1) in few-shot tasks, the \"Channel-Multi-scale Spatial\" cascaded structure achieves optimal performance; (2) in medium-scale tasks, parallel learnable fusion architectures demonstrate superior results; (3) in large-scale tasks, parallel structures with dynamic gating yield the best performance. Additionally, experiments indicate that the \"Spatial-Channel\" order is more stable and effective for fine-grained classification, while residual connections mitigate vanishing gradient problems across varying data scales. We thus propose scenario-based guidelines for building future attention modules. Code is open-sourced at https://github.com/DWlzm."

    "abstract": "Serverless computing is a paradigm in which the underlying infrastructure is fully managed by the provider, enabling applications and services to be executed with elastic resource provisioning and minimal operational overhead. A core model within this paradigm is Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), where lightweight functions are deployed and triggered on demand, scaling seamlessly with workload. FaaS offers flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and fine-grained scalability, qualities particularly relevant for large-scale scientific infrastructures where data volumes are too large to centralise and computation must increasingly occur close to the data. The Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) exemplifies this challenge. Once operational, it will generate about 700~PB of data products annually, distributed across the SKA Regional Centre Network (SRCNet), a federation of international centres providing storage, computing, and analysis services. In such a context, FaaS offers a mechanism to bring computation to the data. We studied the principles of serverless and FaaS computing and explored their application to radio astronomy workflows. Representative functions for astrophysical data analysis were developed and deployed, including micro-functions derived from existing libraries and wrappers around domain-specific applications. In particular, a Gaussian convolution function was implemented and integrated within the SRCNet ecosystem. The use case demonstrates that FaaS can be embedded into the existing SRCNet ecosystem of services, allowing functions to run directly at sites where data replicas are stored. This reduces latency, minimises transfers, and improves efficiency, aligning with federated, data-proximate computation. The results show that serverless models provide a scalable and efficient pathway to address the data volumes of the SKA era."

From the numerical analysis, we show that the SIT is essential to generate os- cillations in the order of GHz and without it the magnetization reaches steady state after exhibiting switching. Without FLT, the frequency of the oscilla- tions decreases with the current while the power of oscillations increases. In the presence of the negative strength of the FLT the power spectral density confirms that the frequency, power and the Q-factor increase with the current. Also the tunability range and the rate at which the frequency enhances increase with the magnitude of the FLT."

    "abstract": "Water desalination plants (DPs) are among the most critical infrastructures and largest electricity loads in water-scarce regions worldwide. Although reverse osmosis (RO) desalination is the most energy-efficient and dominant technology, it remains energy-intensive but can offer substantial flexibility potential for power systems. This paper proposes a coordinated operation framework for power systems and DPs that explicitly accounts for both systems' operational constraints and fully unlocks DP flexibility. To achieve this, a detailed DP model is developed, incorporating the characteristics of an actual high-pressure pump with variable-speed operation, on-off operation with flushing requirements, water quality constraints, and water dynamics and salt mixing in the storage tank. By proactively managing freshwater storage and tank salinity in a closed-loop coordinated scheduling framework, the operational flexibility of the DP is significantly enhanced. With appropriate simplification and linearization, the resulting coordinated scheduling problem is formulated as a tractable mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, and a two-step decomposed commitment-scheduling stochastic optimization (TDCSO) is proposed to efficiently address uncertainties. Case studies validate the proposed approach and demonstrate up to a 6% operating cost reduction."

These advances offer deeper insight into persistent challenges in astrophysics and our understanding of the Universe's evolution. A critical component of this progress is the reliable estimation of photometric redshifts (Pz). To improve the precision and efficiency of such estimations, the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to large-scale astronomical datasets has become essential. This study presents a new ensemble-based ML framework aimed at predicting Pz for faint galaxies and higher redshift ranges, relying solely on optical (grizy) photometric data. The proposed architecture integrates several learning algorithms, including gradient boosting machine, extreme gradient boosting, k-nearest neighbors, and artificial neural networks, within a scaled ensemble structure. By using bagged input data, the ensemble approach delivers improved predictive performance compared to stand-alone models. The framework demonstrates consistent accuracy in estimating redshifts, maintaining strong performance up to z ~ 4. The model is validated using publicly available data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Strategic Survey Program by the Subaru Telescope. Our results show marked improvements in the precision and reliability of Pz estimation. Furthermore, this approach closely adheres to-and in certain instances exceeds-the benchmarks specified in the LSST Science Requirements Document. Evaluation metrics include catastrophic outlier, bias, and rms."

    "abstract": "Although multi-view unsupervised feature selection (MUFS) has demonstrated success in dimensionality reduction for unlabeled multi-view data, most existing methods reduce feature redundancy by focusing on linear correlations among features but often overlook complex nonlinear dependencies. This limits the effectiveness of feature selection. In addition, existing methods fuse similarity graphs from multiple views by employing sample-invariant weights to preserve local structure. However, this process fails to account for differences in local neighborhood clarity among samples within each view, thereby hindering accurate characterization of the intrinsic local structure of the data. In this paper, we propose a Kernel Alignment-based multi-view unsupervised FeatUre selection with Sample-level adaptive graph lEarning method (KAFUSE) to address these issues. Specifically, we first employ kernel alignment with an orthogonal constraint to reduce feature redundancy in both linear and nonlinear relationships. Then, a cross-view consistent similarity graph is learned by applying sample-level fusion to each slice of a tensor formed by stacking similarity graphs from different views, which automatically adjusts the view weights for each sample during fusion. These two steps are integrated into a unified model for feature selection, enabling mutual enhancement between them. Extensive experiments on real multi-view datasets demonstrate the superiority of KAFUSE over state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "The task of Image-to-Video (I2V) generation aims to synthesize a video from a reference image and a text prompt. This requires diffusion models to reconcile high-frequency visual constraints and low-frequency textual guidance during the denoising process. However, while existing I2V models prioritize visual consistency, how to effectively couple this dual guidance to ensure strong adherence to the text prompt remains underexplored. In this work, we observe that in Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based I2V models, certain intermediate layers exhibit weak semantic responses (termed Semantic-Weak Layers), as indicated by a measurable drop in text-visual similarity. We attribute this to a phenomenon called Condition Isolation, where attention to visual features becomes partially detached from text guidance and overly relies on learned visual priors. To address this, we propose Focal Guidance (FG), which enhances the controllability from Semantic-Weak Layers. FG comprises two mechanisms: (1) Fine-grained Semantic Guidance (FSG) leverages CLIP to identify key regions in the reference frame and uses them as anchors to guide Semantic-Weak Layers. (2) Attention Cache transfers attention maps from semantically responsive layers to Semantic-Weak Layers, injecting explicit semantic signals and alleviating their over-reliance on the model's learned visual priors, thereby enhancing adherence to textual instructions. To further validate our approach and address the lack of evaluation in this direction, we introduce a benchmark for assessing instruction following in I2V models. On this benchmark, Focal Guidance proves its effectiveness and generalizability, raising the total score on Wan2.1-I2V to 0.7250 (+3.97\\%) and boosting the MMDiT-based HunyuanVideo-I2V to 0.5571 (+7.44\\%)."

Our approach treats retargeting as a conditional generation task. We map human motion into a morphology-agnostic latent intent space and utilize a dual-purpose prompting mechanism to condition the generation. Instead of simple input concatenation, we leverage Adaptive Layer Normalization (AdaLN) to dynamically modulate the decoder's feature space based on embodiment constraints. Furthermore, we enforce physical plausibility through a curriculum-based training objective that ensures orientation and trajectory consistency via integration. Experimental results on 12 distinct humanoid robots demonstrate that AdaMorph effectively unifies control across heterogeneous topologies, exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization to unseen complex motions while preserving the dynamic essence of the source behaviors."

This contradiction underlies Condorcet's Paradox, a pioneering result of Social Choice Theory, wherein intuitive and seemingly desirable constraints on decision-making necessarily lead to contradictory preference cycles. Topological methods have since broadened Social Choice Theory and elucidated existing results. However, characterisations of preference cycles in Topological Social Choice Theory are lacking. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a framework for topologically modelling preference cycles that generalises Baryshnikov's existing topological model of strict, ordinal preferences on 3 alternatives. In our framework, the contradiction underlying Condorcet's Paradox topologically corresponds to the non-orientability of a surface homeomorphic to either the Klein Bottle or Real Projective Plane, depending on how preference cycles are represented. These findings allow us to reduce Arrow's Impossibility Theorem to a statement about the orientability of a surface. Furthermore, these results contribute to existing wide-ranging interest in the relationship between non-orientability, impossibility phenomena in Economics, and logical paradoxes more broadly."

While older rule driven methods struggle to keep pace, even precision focused algorithms fall short when new scams are introduced. These tools typically overlook subtle shifts in criminal behavior, missing crucial signals. Because silent breaches cost institutions far more than flagged but legitimate actions, catching every possible case is crucial. High sensitivity to actual threats becomes essential when oversight leads to heavy losses. One key aim here involves reducing missed fraud cases without spiking incorrect alerts too much. This study builds a system using group learning methods adjusted through smart threshold choices. Using real world transaction records shared openly, where cheating acts rarely appear among normal activities, tests are run under practical skewed distributions. The outcomes reveal that approximately 91 percent of actual fraud is detected, outperforming standard setups that rely on unchanging rules when dealing with uneven examples across classes. When tested in live settings, the fraud detection system connects directly to an online banking transaction flow, stopping questionable activities before they are completed. Alongside this setup, a browser add on built for Chrome is designed to flag deceptive web links and reduce threats from harmful sites. These results show that adjusting decisions by cost impact and validating across entire systems makes deployment more stable and realistic for today's digital banking platforms."

    "abstract": "In noisy physical reservoirs, the classical information-processing capacity $C_{\\mathrm{ip}}$ quantifies how well a linear readout can realize tasks measurable from the input history, yet $C_{\\mathrm{ip}}$ can be far smaller than the observed rank of the readout covariance. We explain this ``missing capacity'' by introducing the innovation capacity $C_{\\mathrm{i}}$, the total capacity allocated to readout components orthogonal to the input filtration (Doob innovations, including input-noise mixing). Using a basis-free Hilbert-space formulation of the predictable/innovation decomposition, we prove the conservation law $C_{\\mathrm{ip}}+C_{\\mathrm{i}}=\\mathrm{rank}(Σ_{XX})\\le d$, so predictable and innovation capacities exactly partition the rank of the observable readout dimension covariance $Σ_{XX}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\rm d\\times d}$. In linear-Gaussian Johnson-Nyquist regimes, $Σ_{XX}(T)=S+T N_0$, the split becomes a generalized-eigenvalue shrinkage rule and gives an explicit monotone tradeoff between temperature and predictable capacity. Geometrically, in whitened coordinates the predictable and innovation components correspond to complementary covariance ellipsoids, making $C_{\\mathrm{i}}$ a trace-controlled innovation budget. A large $C_{\\mathrm{i}}$ forces a high-dimensional innovation subspace with a variance floor and under mild mixing and anti-concentration assumptions this yields extensive innovation-block differential entropy and exponentially many distinguishable histories. Finally, we give an information-theoretic lower bound showing that learning the induced innovation-block law in total variation requires a number of samples that scales with the effective innovation dimension, supporting the generative utility of noisy physical reservoirs."

The marked softening of both phonons and their contrasting evolution with temperature reveal a competition between the two ordering tendencies.

Surprisingly, the Kohn anomalies persist in the ferromagnetic state despite the degradation of Fermi-surface nesting conditions.

    "abstract": "Stable Diffusion (SD) often produces degraded outputs when the training dataset contains adversarial noise. Adversarial purification offers a promising solution by removing adversarial noise from contaminated data. However, existing purification methods are primarily designed for classification tasks and fail to address SD-specific adversarial strategies, such as attacks targeting the VAE encoder, UNet denoiser, or both. To address the gap in SD security, we propose Universal Diffusion Adversarial Purification (UDAP), a novel framework tailored for defending adversarial attacks targeting SD models. UDAP leverages the distinct reconstruction behaviors of clean and adversarial images during Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion to optimize the purification process. By minimizing the DDIM metric loss, UDAP can effectively remove adversarial noise. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic epoch adjustment strategy that adapts optimization iterations based on reconstruction errors, significantly improving efficiency without sacrificing purification quality. Experiments demonstrate UDAP's robustness against diverse adversarial methods, including PID (VAE-targeted), Anti-DreamBooth (UNet-targeted), MIST (hybrid), and robustness-enhanced variants like Anti-Diffusion (Anti-DF) and MetaCloak. UDAP also generalizes well across SD versions and text prompts, showcasing its practical applicability in real-world scenarios."

However, a critical gap remains: current systems lack the capacity to offer constructive critique grounded in the emergent user experience. Bridging this gap is fundamental for harmonizing Human-AI collaboration, as it empowers designers to refine their creations via external perspectives while steering models away from biased or unpredictable outcomes. Automating critique for board games presents two challenges: inferring the latent dynamics connecting rules to gameplay without an explicit engine, and modeling the subjective heterogeneity of diverse player groups. To address these, we curate a dataset of 1,727 structurally corrected rulebooks and 150K reviews selected via quality scoring and facet-aware sampling. We augment this data with Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics (MDA) reasoning to explicitly bridge the causal gap between written rules and player experience. We further distill player personas and introduce MeepleLM, a specialized model that internalizes persona-specific reasoning patterns to accurately simulate the subjective feedback of diverse player archetypes. Experiments demonstrate that MeepleLM significantly outperforms latest commercial models (e.g., GPT-5.1, Gemini3-Pro) in community alignment and critique quality, achieving a 70% preference rate in user studies assessing utility. MeepleLM serves as a reliable virtual playtester for general interactive systems, marking a pivotal step towards audience-aligned, experience-aware Human-AI collaboration."

We formalize this by placing orientation weights on Tanner-graph edges, aggregating them into per-qubit directional weights, and defining a \\emph{directional degeneracy enumerator} that summarizes how degeneracy concentrates along those directions. A single bias parameter~$β$ maps these weights into site-dependent log-likelihood ratios (LLRs), yielding anisotropic priors that plug directly into standard BP$\\rightarrow$OSD decoders without changing the code construction. We derive bounds relating directional and Hamming distances, upper bound the number of degenerate error classes per syndrome as a function of distance, rate, and directional bias, and give a MacWilliams-type expression for the directional enumerator. Finite-length simulations under code-capacity noise show significant logical error-rate reductions -- often an order of magnitude at moderate physical error rates -- confirming that modest anisotropy is a simple and effective route to hardware-aware decoding gains."

Beyond summarizing prior work, this survey differentiates itself by offering a comparative, challenge-driven analysis of how these modeling paradigms address domain-specific issues such as sarcasm, negation, contextual ambiguity, and domain shift, which remain open problems in existing literature. Unlike earlier reviews that focus primarily on text-only pipelines, we also synthesize recent advances in multimodal sentiment analysis that integrate textual, audio, and visual cues from movie trailers and clips. In addition, we examine emerging concerns related to interpretability, fairness, and robustness that are often underexplored in prior surveys, and we outline future research directions including zero-shot and few-shot learning, hybrid symbolic--neural models, and real-time deployment considerations. Overall, this abstract provides a domain-focused roadmap that highlights both established solutions and unresolved challenges toward building more accurate, generalizable, and explainable sentiment analysis systems for movie review data."

This approach allows for significant dependencies between variables, provided their algebraic moments behave predictably. The proof uses the method of moments combined with a polynomial approximation of Lipschitz functions via Jackson kernels, allowing us to translate moment concentration into topological concentration."

However, this shift introduces input contexts that are inherently noisy, a reality that current sanitized benchmarks fail to capture. We introduce NoisyBench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates model robustness across 11 datasets in RAG, reasoning, alignment, and tool-use tasks against diverse noise types, including random documents, irrelevant chat histories, and hard negative distractors. Our evaluation reveals a catastrophic performance drop of up to 80% in state-of-the-art models when faced with contextual distractors. Crucially, we find that agentic workflows often amplify these errors by over-trusting noisy tool outputs, and distractors can trigger emergent misalignment even without adversarial intent. We find that prompting, context engineering, SFT, and outcome-reward only RL fail to ensure robustness; in contrast, our proposed Rationale-Aware Reward (RARE) significantly strengthens resilience by incentivizing the identification of helpful information within noise. Finally, we uncover an inverse scaling trend where increased test-time computation leads to worse performance in noisy settings and demonstrate via attention visualization that models disproportionately focus on distractor tokens, providing vital insights for building the next generation of robust, reasoning-capable agents."

In this paper, we rigorously explore from first principles the transition and modeling from the standard biophysical picture of a single action potential to its representation as a spike in a spike train. In particular, we adopt a functional-analytic framework, using Schwartz distribution theory to represent spike trains as generalized Dirac delta functions acting on smooth test functions. We then show how and why this representation transcends a purely descriptive formalism to support deep downstream analysis and modeling of spike train neural dynamics in a mathematically consistent way."

We derive structure-aware coverage guarantees under distribution shift using PAC-Bayesian bounds over ambiguity sets, and show that CalPro maintains near-nominal coverage while producing tighter intervals than standard conformal methods in regions where priors are informative. Empirically, CalPro exhibits at most 5% coverage degradation across modalities (vs. 15-25% for baselines), reduces calibration error by 30-50%, and improves downstream ligand-docking success by 25%.

However, standard methods like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are gradient-blind: they preserve high-variance dimensions regardless of their impact on factual knowledge preservation. We introduce Fisher-Aligned Subspace Compression (FASC), a knowledge-aware compression framework that selects subspaces by directly modeling activation-gradient coupling, minimizing a second-order surrogate of the loss function. FASC leverages the Fisher Information Matrix to identify dimensions critical for factual knowledge, which often reside in low-variance but high-gradient-sensitivity subspaces. We propose the Dependence Violation Score (\\r{ho}) as a general-purpose diagnostic metric that quantifies activation-gradient coupling, revealing where factual knowledge is stored within transformer architectures. Extensive experiments on Mistral-7B and Llama-3-8B demonstrate that FASC preserves 6-8% more accuracy on knowledge-intensive benchmarks (MMLU, LAMA) compared to variance-based methods at 50% rank reduction, effectively enabling a 7B model to match the factual recall of a 13B uncompressed model. Our analysis reveals that \\r{ho} serves as a fundamental signal of stored knowledge, with high-\\r{ho} layers emerging only when models internalize factual associations during training."

This paper proposes Focus, an agent-centric architecture inspired by the biological exploration strategies of Physarum polycephalum (slime mold). The Focus Agent autonomously decides when to consolidate key learnings into a persistent \"Knowledge\" block and actively withdraws (prunes) the raw interaction history. Using an optimized scaffold matching industry best practices (persistent bash + string-replacement editor), we evaluated Focus on N=5 context-intensive instances from SWE-bench Lite using Claude Haiku 4.5. With aggressive prompting that encourages frequent compression, Focus achieves 22.7% token reduction (14.9M -> 11.5M tokens) while maintaining identical accuracy (3/5 = 60% for both agents). Focus performed 6.0 autonomous compressions per task on average, with token savings up to 57% on individual instances.

One typical behavior is that they often perform unnecessary verification and revisions even if they have reached the correct answers. This limitation stems from the unstructured nature of reasoning trajectories and the lack of targeted supervision for critical reasoning abilities. To address this, we propose Structured Reasoning (SCR), a framework that decouples reasoning trajectories into explicit, evaluable, and trainable components. We mainly implement SCR using a Generate-Verify-Revise paradigm. Specifically, we construct structured training data and apply Dynamic Termination Supervision to guide the model in deciding when to terminate reasoning. To avoid interference between learning signals for different reasoning abilities, we adopt a progressive two-stage reinforcement learning strategy: the first stage targets initial generation and self-verification, and the second stage focuses on revision. Extensive experiments on three backbone models show that SCR substantially improves reasoning efficiency and self-verification. Besides, compared with existing reasoning paradigms, it reduces output token length by up to 50%."

Most prior work focuses on improving the training efficiency of federated LLMs. However, security in open environments is overlooked, particularly defenses against malicious clients. To investigate the safety of LLMs during FL, we conduct preliminary experiments to analyze potential attack surfaces and defensible characteristics from the perspective of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) weights. We find two key properties of FL: 1) LLMs are vulnerable to attacks from malicious clients in FL, and 2) LoRA weights exhibit distinct behavioral patterns that can be filtered through simple classifiers. Based on these properties, we propose Safe-FedLLM, a probe-based defense framework for federated LLMs, constructing defenses across three dimensions: Step-Level, Client-Level, and Shadow-Level. The core concept of Safe-FedLLM is to perform probe-based discrimination on the LoRA weights locally trained by each client during FL, treating them as high-dimensional behavioral features and using lightweight classification models to determine whether they possess malicious attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Safe-FedLLM effectively enhances the defense capability of federated LLMs without compromising performance on benign data. Notably, our method effectively suppresses malicious data impact without significant impact on training speed, and remains effective even with many malicious clients.

However, our understanding of magnetars remains highly limited, constrained by observational sample size and radiative variability. XTE~J1810$-$197, which re-entered a radio-active phase in 2018, is one of only six known radio-pulsating magnetars. Leveraging the distinctive capability for simultaneous dual-frequency observations, we utilized the Shanghai Tianma Radio Telescope (TMRT) to monitor this magnetar continuously at both 2.25 and 8.60~GHz, capturing its entire evolution from radio activation to quenching. This enabled precise characterization of the evolution in its integrated profile, spin frequency, flux density, and spectral index ($α$, defined by $S \\propto f^α$). The first time derivative of its spin frequency $\\dotν$ passed through four distinct phases -- rapid decrease, violent oscillation, steady decline, and stable recovery -- before returning to its pre-outburst value concomitant with the cessation of radio emission. Remarkably, both the amplitudes and the characteristic time-scales of these $\\dotν$ variations match those observed during the previous outburst that began in 2003, providing the first demonstration that post-outburst rotational evolution and radiative behavior in a magnetar are repeatable. A twisted-magnetosphere model can qualitatively account for this repeatability as well as for the progressive narrowing and abrupt disappearance of the radio pulse radiation, thereby receiving strong observational support."

    "abstract": "Let $D$ be a totally definite quaternion algebra over a totally real number field $F$, and $\\mathcal{O}$ be an $O_F$-order (of full rank) in $D$. The type number $t(\\mathcal{O})$ is an important arithmetic invariant of $\\mathcal{O}$ that counts the number of isomorphism classes of orders belonging to the same genus as $\\mathcal{O}$ (i.e. locally isomorphic to $\\mathcal{O}$ at every finite place $\\mathfrak{p}$ of $F$). The type number formula has been studied by Eichler, Peters, Pizer, Vigneras, Körner and many others. As the genus of $\\mathcal{O}$ further divides into spinor genera, one naturally seeks a finer type number formula for the number of isomorphism classes of orders belonging to the same spinor genus of $\\mathcal{O}$. The main goal of this paper is to provide such a refinement for a large class of quaternion $O_F$-orders $\\mathcal{O}$ that includes all Eichler orders. This enables us to prove that $t(\\mathcal{O})$ is divisible by the order of a quotient group $\\mathrm{WSG}(\\mathcal{O})$ of the Gauss genus group $\\mathrm{Cl}^+(O_F)/\\mathrm{Cl}^+(O_F)^2$ naturally attached to $\\mathcal{O}$. Similarly, we show that the trace of the $\\mathfrak{n}$-Brandt matrix $\\mathfrak{B}(\\mathcal{O}, \\mathfrak{n})$ is divisible by the class number $h(F)$ for any nonzero integral $O_F$-ideal $\\mathfrak{n}$. In particular, the class number $h(\\mathcal{O})=\\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathfrak{B}(\\mathcal{O}, O_F))$ is always divisible by $h(F)$ for such quaternion orders. This generalizes the divisibility result of $h(\\mathcal{O})$ proved in a different way by Chia-Fu Yu and the second named author [Indiana Univ. Math.

    "abstract": "The FKG inequality is an invaluable tool in monotone spin systems satisfying the FKG lattice condition, which provides positive correlations for all coordinate-wise increasing functions of spins. However, the FKG lattice condition is somewhat brittle and is not preserved when confining a spin system to a particular phase. For instance, consider the Curie-Weiss model, which is a model of a ferromagnet with two phases at low temperature corresponding to positive and negative overall magnetization. It is not a priori clear if each phase internally has positive correlations for increasing functions, or if the positive correlations in the model arise primarily from the global choice of positive or negative magnetization. In this article, we show that the individual phases do indeed satisfy an approximate form of the FKG inequality in a class of generalized higher-order Curie-Weiss models (including the standard Curie-Weiss model as a special case), as well as in ferromagnetic exponential random graph models (ERGMs). To cover both of these settings, we present a general result which allows for the derivation of such approximate FKG inequalities in a straightforward manner from inputs related to metastable mixing; we expect that this general result will be widely applicable. In addition, we derive some consequences of the approximate FKG inequality, including a version of a useful covariance inequality originally due to Newman as well as Bulinski and Shabanovich. We use this to extend the proof of the central limit theorem for ERGMs within a phase at low temperatures, due to the second author, to the non-forest phase-coexistence regime, answering a question posed by Bianchi, Collet, and Magnanini for the edge-triangle model."

    "abstract": "On the basis of allowed local gauge symmetries, the QCD Lagrangian admits a CP-violating term proportional to the topological charge density, commonly referred to as the $θ$ term. A priori, any value of $θ$ is consistent with the local symmetries of the theory, while current experimental limits constrain $θ\\lesssim 10^{-10}$. The apparent extreme smallness of this parameter is known as the strong $CP$ problem. In this work, we provide a careful critical overview of the conceptual assumptions underlying the $θ$ term, focusing on the roles of topology, the definition of topological charge density, rough gauge field configurations, instantons, and anomalies. We contrast the assumptions required to describe QCD at nonzero $θ$ with those sufficient at $θ= 0$, and argue that a vanishing $θ$ term is compatible with a formulation based solely on local gauge invariance and causal locality, without invoking additional global structure. The perspective developed here is intended as a conceptual analysis of the standard formulation of the strong $CP$ problem. It does not challenge the internal consistency of QCD at nonzero $θ$, nor does it diminish the independent theoretical and phenomenological motivation for axion and axion-like particle physics, which are well-motivated extensions of the Standard Model."

    "abstract": "Reliable learning on low-quality multimodal data is a widely concerning issue, especially in safety-critical applications. However, multimodal noise poses a major challenge in this domain and leads existing methods to suffer from two key limitations. First, they struggle to reliably remove heterogeneous data noise, hindering robust multimodal representation learning. Second, they exhibit limited adaptability and generalization when encountering previously unseen noise. To address these issues, we propose Test-time Adaptive Hierarchical Co-enhanced Denoising Network (TAHCD). On one hand, TAHCD introduces the Adaptive Stable Subspace Alignment and Sample-Adaptive Confidence Alignment to reliably remove heterogeneous noise. They account for noise at both global and instance levels and enable jointly removal of modality-specific and cross-modality noise, achieving robust learning. On the other hand, TAHCD introduces test-time cooperative enhancement, which adaptively updates the model in response to input noise in a label-free manner, improving adaptability and generalization. This is achieved by collaboratively enhancing the joint removal process of modality-specific and cross-modality noise across global and instance levels according to sample noise. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior classification performance, robustness, and generalization compared with state-of-the-art reliable multimodal learning approaches."

While the PLR group connects triadic cadential sets via the relative morphism $R$, the tetradic case reveals a richer structure: two pairs of cadential sets connected by distinct morphisms forming a \"prism\" in the slice category over the tonic seventh chord, and a single pair for those that allow quantized modulations. We demonstrate this structure through analysis of Charlie Parker's \"Blues for Alice\" (1951) and Ray Noble's \"Cherokee\" (1938), showing how the prism morphism, PLRQ transformations and quantized modulations organize harmonic navigation in bebop. The categorical framework captures what syntactic approaches miss: the transformational vécu that musicians actually experience when navigating between cadential regions."

    "abstract": "The astrophysical origins of the heaviest stable elements that we observe today in the Solar System are still not fully understood. Recent studies have demonstrated that H-accreting white dwarfs (WDs) in a binary sys- tem exploding as type Ia supernovae could be an efficient p-process source beyond iron. However, both observational evidence and stellar models challenge the required frequency of these events. In this work, we calculate the evolution and nucleosynthesis in slowly merging carbon-oxygen WDs. As our models approach the Chandrasekhar mass during the merger phase, the 22Ne(a,n)25Mg neutron source reaction is activated in the external layers of the primary WD, where the carbon-rich material accreted from the secondary WD is burned via the 12C+12C reaction, which provides the necessary α-particles via the 12C(12C,α)20Ne channel. The resulting neutron capture abundance distribution closely resembles a weak s-process one and peaks at Zr, which is overpro- duced by a factor of 30 compared to solar. The mass of the most external layers enriched in first-peak s-process elements crucially depends on the 12C+12C re- action rate, ranging between 0.05 Msun and ~0.1 Msun. These results indicate that slow white dwarf mergers can efficiently produce the lightest p-process iso- topes (such as 74Se, 78Kr, 84Sr, 92Mo and 94Mo) via γ-induced reactions if they explode via a delayed detonation mechanism, or eject the unburned external layers highly enriched in first peak s-process elements in the case of a pure deflagration. In both cases, we propose for the first time that slow WD mergers in binary systems may be a new relevant source for elements heavier than iron."

    "abstract": "Consensus mechanisms are the core of any blockchain system. However, the majority of these mechanisms do not target federated learning directly nor do they aid in the aggregation step. This paper introduces Proof of Reasoning (PoR), a novel consensus mechanism specifically designed for federated learning using blockchain, aimed at preserving data privacy, defending against malicious attacks, and enhancing the validation of participating networks. Unlike generic blockchain consensus mechanisms commonly found in the literature, PoR integrates three distinct processes tailored for federated learning. Firstly, a masked autoencoder (MAE) is trained to generate an encoder that functions as a feature map and obfuscates input data, rendering it resistant to human reconstruction and model inversion attacks. Secondly, a downstream classifier is trained at the edge, receiving input from the trained encoder. The downstream network's weights, a single encoded datapoint, the network's output and the ground truth are then added to a block for federated aggregation. Lastly, this data facilitates the aggregation of all participating networks, enabling more complex and verifiable aggregation methods than previously possible. This three-stage process results in more robust networks with significantly reduced computational complexity, maintaining high accuracy by training only the downstream classifier at the edge. PoR scales to large IoT networks with low latency and storage growth, and adapts to evolving data, regulations, and network conditions."

    "abstract": "LoRaWAN deployments rely on rough range estimates or simplified propagation models to decide where to place/mount gateways. As a result, operators have limited visibility into how rooftop choice, streets, and building shadowing jointly affect coverage and reliability. This paper addresses the problem of gateway placement in dense urban environments by combining a geometry accurate Digital Twin (DT) with a GPU accelerated ray tracing engine. Existing studies optimize placement on abstract grids or tune models with sparse measurements; few works evaluate LoRaWAN gateways on a full 3D city model using a realistic link budget. In this paper, we develop a DT with ITU radio materials and evaluate eight candidate rooftops for RAK7289 WisGate Edge Pro gateways under a sub-GHz link budget derived from the data sheet. For each rooftop, we obtain Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR) on a 5 meter grid, derive robust and edge coverage indicators, and apply a greedy maximum coverage algorithm to rank sites and quantify the benefit of incremental densification. Results show that a single rooftop gateway covers one fifth of the full Sunway twin (i.e., the DT) at a robust SNR threshold, and that six sites still leave large areas of single gateway or out of coverage cells in surrounding residential streets. The findings from this paper shows that DT and ray tracing tools enable network operators to bridge the gap of expensive real-world trials and planning to identify if the planned LoRaWAN gateway is sufficient or additional sites are required."

    "abstract": "The application of machine learning to financial prediction has accelerated dramatically, yet the conditions under which complex models outperform simple alternatives remain poorly understood. This paper investigates whether advanced signal processing and deep learning techniques can extract predictive value from investor order flows beyond what simple feature engineering achieves. Using a comprehensive dataset of 2.79 million observations spanning 2,439 Korean equities from 2020--2024, we apply three methodologies: \\textit{Independent Component Analysis} (ICA) to recover latent market drivers, \\textit{Wavelet Coherence} analysis to characterize multi-scale correlation structure, and \\textit{Long Short-Term Memory} (LSTM) networks with attention mechanisms for non-linear prediction. Our results reveal a striking finding: a parsimonious linear model using market capitalization-normalized flows (``Matched Filter'' preprocessing) achieves a Sharpe ratio of 1.30 and cumulative return of 272.6\\%, while the full ICA-Wavelet-LSTM pipeline generates a Sharpe ratio of only 0.07 with a cumulative return of $-5.1\\%$. The raw LSTM model collapsed to predicting the unconditional mean, achieving a hit rate of 47.5\\% -- worse than random. We conclude that in low signal-to-noise financial environments, domain-specific feature engineering yields substantially higher marginal returns than algorithmic complexity. These findings establish important boundary conditions for the application of deep learning to financial prediction."

Using only prompting, LLMs are given task constraints and summaries of prior high-scoring designs and propose complete detector configurations, which we evaluate with the same simulators and reward functions used in RL-based optimization. Although RL yields stronger final designs, we find that modern LLMs consistently generate valid, resource-aware, and physically meaningful configurations that draw on broad pretrained knowledge of detector design principles and particle--matter interactions, despite having no task-specific training. Based on this result, as a first step toward hybrid design workflows, we explore pairing the LLMs with a dedicated trust region optimizer, serving as a precursor to future pipelines in which LLMs propose and structure design hypotheses while RL performs reward-driven optimization. Based on these experiments, we argue that LLMs are well suited as meta-planners: they can design and orchestrate RL-based optimization studies, define search strategies, and coordinate multiple interacting components within a unified workflow. In doing so, they point toward automated, closed-loop instrument design in which much of the human effort required to structure and supervise optimization can be reduced."

GdTi3Bi4 crystallizes in layered Ti based kagome nets intertwined with zigzag Gd chains along the a axis and orders antiferromagnetically below 15 K. Here, we present the temperature and field dependent electrical transport of GdTi3Bi4 in different directions. The material exhibits anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of 410 S cm-1 at 2 K for B parallel c and it is completely absent for B parallel a, despite the similar magnetization observed in both orientations. This behavior is quite contradictory, as anomalous Hall effect (AHE) typically scales with the magnetization. Through first principles calculations, it is demonstrated that in the presence of time reversal symmetry broken by the Gd 4f sublattice and spin orbit coupling, the magnetization direction controls the orbital mixing in the Ti t2g bands, relocating Berry curvature hot spots and producing the observed orientation selective AHC. The results establish GdTi3Bi4 as platform for investigating new avenues of AHE, such as directional AHE, and thus shed new light on the intricate coupling between magnetic and electronic structures, paving the way for exploring novel quantum phenomena."

    "abstract": "Optical computing offers ultrafast, energy-efficient alternatives to conventional digital processors, yet most implementations remain confined to single-channel processing, severely underutilizing light's information capacity. Here we demonstrate a self-optimizing multichannel optical computing architecture based on multi-plane light conversion that natively processes RGB images and structured numerical data throughout the optical domain. We introduce two complementary optimization strategies that enable autonomous performance adaptation without differentiable forward models. First, Bayesian optimization tunes channel mixing coefficients to minimize crosstalk and enhance feature separability at the input level. Second, a hardware-in-the-loop protocol based on self-organized criticality leverages avalanche dynamics to autonomously navigate the high-dimensional phase landscape, enabling the system to self-optimize through stochastic multi-scale perturbations. Across medical imaging, natural image classification, and regression tasks, multichannel processing with random phase masks improves accuracy by 26--58 percentage points over raw pixel baselines, with RGB systematically outperforming grayscale by 5--6 percentage points. Self-optimization strategies provide additional gains of 6--7 percentage points through autonomous adaptation at complementary system levels. Our work establishes self-optimizing multichannel optical computing as a practical platform for real-world machine learning applications."

Despite increasing interest, existing methods typically focus on only one-side of the coin, targeting either efficiency or performance. To address this limitation, we propose d3LLM (Pseudo-Distilled Diffusion Large Language Model), striking a balance between accuracy and parallelism: (i) during training, we introduce pseudo-trajectory distillation to teach the model which tokens can be decoded confidently at early steps, thereby improving parallelism; (ii) during inference, we employ entropy-based multi-block decoding with a KV-cache refresh mechanism to achieve high parallelism while maintaining accuracy. To better evaluate dLLMs, we also introduce AUP (Accuracy Under Parallelism), a new metric that jointly measures accuracy and parallelism. Experiments demonstrate that our d3LLM achieves up to 10$\\times$ speedup over vanilla LLaDA/Dream and 5$\\times$ speedup over AR models without much accuracy drop.

Additionally, in-hand manipulation is necessary to perform daily activities such as transitioning between different postures, particularly through rotational movements, such as reorienting a pen into a writing posture after picking it up from a desk. We previously developed PLEXUS hand (Precision-Lateral dEXteroUS manipulation hand), a lightweight (311 g) prosthetic hand driven by four motors. This prosthetic performed reorientation between precision and lateral grasps with various objects. However, its controller required predefined object widths and was limited to handling lightweight objects (of weight up to 34 g). This study addresses these limitations by employing motor current feedback. Combined with the hand's previously optimized single-axis thumb, this approach achieves more stable manipulation by estimating the object's width and adjusting the index finger position to maintain stable object holding during the reorientation. Experimental validation using primitive objects of various widths (5-30 mm) and shapes (cylinders and prisms) resulted in a 100% success rate with lightweight objects and maintained a high success rate (>=80) even with heavy aluminum prisms (of weight up to 289 g). By contrast, the performance without index finger coordination dropped to just 40% on the heaviest 289 g prism. The hand also successfully executed several daily tasks, including closing bottle caps and orienting a pen for writing."

In quantum technologies, achieving non-local coherent coupling between solid-state qubits is of the utmost importance. Here, we demonstrate that excitons - i.e. electron-hole pairs bound by the Coulomb force within a quantum well - can act as a medium for mesoscopic optical coherence transfer in semiconductors. To this end, we use a femtosecond laser pulse to resonantly generate excitons within the light cone. These excitons can then either recombine radiatively or scatter out of the light cone, gaining an in-plane momentum in the process. In samples without disorder, such as the CdTe quantum wells used here, the resulting fast excitons can diffuse over mesoscopic distances before recombining radiatively. Using coherent nonlinear micro-spectroscopy, we carry out exciton time-of-flight measurements. Specifically, we monitor the spatio-temporal propagation of launched exciton wave packets, selectively observing their coherence or density on a scale of up to 10$\\,μ$m. Our proof-of-principle experiment demonstrates that free excitons inherit a phase modulation from the optical pulsed excitation and can generate coherent links within excitonic circuits, offerring a higher level of miniaturisation and compactness than photonic or polaritonic architectures."

To address these issues, we propose CoDAC (Contextual Discrepancy-Aware Contrastive learning), a novel framework that enhances diagnostic accuracy and generalization, particularly in small-sample settings. CoDAC leverages external healthy data and introduces a Contextual Discrepancy Estimator (CDE), built upon a Transformer-based Autoencoder, to precisely quantify abnormal signals through context-aware anomaly scores. These scores dynamically inform a Dynamic Multi-views Contrastive Framework (DMCF), which adaptively weights different temporal views to focus contrastive learning on diagnostically relevant, discrepant regions. Our encoder combines dilated convolutions with multi-head attention for robust feature extraction. Comprehensive experiments on Alzheimer's Disease EEG, Parkinson's Disease EEG, and Myocardial Infarction ECG datasets demonstrate CoDAC's superior performance across all metrics, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, especially under low label availability. Ablation studies further validate the critical contributions of CDE and DMCF.

    "abstract": "Background: The wide adoption of AI- and ML-based systems in sensitive domains raises severe concerns about their fairness. Many methods have been proposed in the literature to enhance software fairness. However, the majority behave as a black-box, not allowing stakeholders to prioritise fairness or effectiveness (i.e., prediction correctness) based on their needs. Aims: In this paper, we introduce FairRF, a novel approach based on multi-objective evolutionary search to optimise fairness and effectiveness in classification tasks. FairRF uses a Random Forest (RF) model as a base classifier and searches for the best hyperparameter configurations and data mutation to maximise fairness and effectiveness. Eventually, it returns a set of Pareto optimal solutions, allowing the final stakeholders to choose the best one based on their needs. Method: We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation of FairRF against 26 different baselines in 11 different scenarios using five effectiveness and three fairness metrics. Additionally, we also include two variations of the fairness metrics for intersectional bias for a total of six definitions analysed. Result: Our results show that FairRF can significantly improve the fairness of base classifiers, while maintaining consistent prediction effectiveness. Additionally, FairRF provides a more consistent optimisation under all fairness definitions compared to state-of-the-art bias mitigation methods and overcomes the existing state-of-the-art approach for intersectional bias mitigation. Conclusions: FairRF is an effective approach for bias mitigation also allowing stakeholders to adapt the development of fair software systems based on their specific needs."

Cloud-based intrusion detection systems add latency that is unsuitable for real-time control, while CPU-bound firewalls and generic SDN controllers lack MQTT awareness to enforce session validation, topic-based authorization, and behavioral anomaly detection. We propose a P4-based data-plane enforcement scheme for protocol-aware MQTT security and anomaly detection at the network edge. The design combines parser-safe MQTT header extraction with session-order validation, byte-level topic-prefix authorization with per-client rate limiting and soft-cap enforcement, and lightweight anomaly detection based on KeepAlive and Remaining Length screening with clone-to-CPU diagnostics. The scheme leverages stateful primitives in BMv2 (registers, meters, direct counters) to enable runtime policy adaptation with minimal per-packet latency. Experiments on a Mininet/BMv2 testbed demonstrate high policy enforcement accuracy (99.8%, within 95% CI), strong anomaly detection sensitivity (98\\% true-positive rate), and high delivery >99.9% for 100--5~kpps; 99.8% at 10~kpps; 99.6\\% at 16~kpps) with sub-millisecond per-packet latency.

    "abstract": "Advances in instrumentation and computation have enabled increasingly sophisticated tomographic reconstruction methods. However, existing evaluation practices -often based on simple phantoms and global image metrics- are limited in their ability to differentiate among modern high-fidelity reconstructions. A standardized, quantitative framework capable of revealing subtle yet meaningful differences is therefore required. We introduce such a framework, built upon two core components. The first is a set of four standardized reference images - Source, Detector, Ideal, and Realistic - each derived from physical modeling and representing a distinct stage in the imaging and reconstruction chain. The second is a suite of diagnostic and quantitative tools that remain sensitive in regimes where conventional metrics (e.g., SSIM, PSNR, NMSE, CC) tend to saturate. These include pixel-wise $χ^2$ and difference maps, their quantitative characterization, spectral decomposition of intensity distributions, and Region-of-Interest (RoI)-based metrics. Application of this framework to MLEM and RISE-1 reconstructions using software phantoms demonstrates its ability to expose discrepancies that might elude detection by conventional global metrics. While developed in the context of SPECT, the methodology generalizes to other tomographic modalities, providing a reproducible, interpretable, and physically grounded basis for evaluating reconstruction fidelity in the high-performance regime."

Yet standard MCQ/MRC-style evaluations do not capture key real-world failure modes, notably free-form hallucinations and whether models appropriately abstain when evidence is lacking. To shed a light on this aspect we introduce ISLAMICFAITHQA, a 3,810-item bilingual (Arabic/English) generative benchmark with atomic single-gold answers, which enables direct measurement of hallucination and abstention. We additionally developed an end-to-end grounded Islamic modelling suite consisting of (i) 25K Arabic text-grounded SFT reasoning pairs, (ii) 5K bilingual preference samples for reward-guided alignment, and (iii) a verse-level Qur'an retrieval corpus of $\\sim$6k atomic verses (ayat). Building on these resources, we develop an agentic Quran-grounding framework (agentic RAG) that uses structured tool calls for iterative evidence seeking and answer revision. Experiments across Arabic-centric and multilingual LLMs show that retrieval improves correctness and that agentic RAG yields the largest gains beyond standard RAG, achieving state-of-the-art performance and stronger Arabic-English robustness even with a small model (i.e., Qwen3 4B).

Conventionally, states associated with unsuccessful branches are discarded and treated as useless. Here we propose a generic framework that reuses these failure branches as thermodynamic resources. The central element is an athermal bath that is naturally generated during the reset of a failure branch. By coupling this bath to a target system prior to relaxation, useful thermodynamic tasks can be performed, enabling performance beyond conventional thermodynamic limits. As an application, we analyze information erasure and derive the resulting gain analytically. We further demonstrate the framework by implementing the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm on IBM's superconducting quantum processor. Despite substantial noise and errors in current hardware, our method achieves erasure with heat dissipation below the Landauer limit. These results establish a practical connection between quantum computing and quantum thermodynamics and suggest a route toward reducing thermodynamic costs in future large-scale quantum computers."

    "abstract": "Vision-language models are increasingly employed as multimodal conversational agents (MCAs) for diverse conversational tasks. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely explored for adapting MCAs to various human-AI interaction scenarios. Despite showing great enhancement in generalization performance, fine-tuning MCAs via RL still faces challenges in handling the extremely large text token space. To address this, we learn a compact latent action space for RL fine-tuning instead. Specifically, we adopt the learning from observation mechanism to construct the codebook for the latent action space, where future observations are leveraged to estimate current latent actions that could further be used to reconstruct future observations. However, the scarcity of paired image-text data hinders learning a codebook with sufficient coverage. Thus, we leverage both paired image-text data and text-only data to construct the latent action space, using a cross-modal projector for transforming text embeddings into image-text embeddings. We initialize the cross-modal projector on paired image-text data, and further train it on massive text-only data with a novel cycle consistency loss to enhance its robustness. We show that our latent action based method outperforms competitive baselines on two conversation tasks across various RL algorithms."

    "abstract": "We study the $T\\bar T$ deformation of boundary conformal field theories (BCFTs) from an intrinsic field-theoretic perspective. Formulating the deformation as a modification of the asymptotic variational principle in AdS$_3$, we obtain the exact quadratic trace relation for the stress tensor without introducing a finite radial cutoff, which we take as the fundamental definition of the deformed theory. When restricted to a BCFT without independent boundary degrees of freedom, the intrinsic $T\\bar T$ deformation becomes genuinely boundary-localized. Imposing reflective boundary conditions collapses the bulk composite operator to a universal one-dimensional irrelevant flow governed entirely by the displacement operator. We integrate this flow in closed form and derive an induced boundary action, showing that the deformation reorganizes existing boundary data without introducing new boundary degrees of freedom. We further establish a precise equivalence between a fixed-boundary description and a moving-boundary description, interpreted as a reparametrization of the variational problem rather than physical boundary dynamics. On the holographic side, we analyze two inequivalent realizations in AdS$_3$/BCFT$_2$, referred to as Type~A and Type~B. In Type~A, a rigid cutoff surface intersects the end-of-the-world brane at finite position, leading to an apparent boundary displacement. In Type~B, the cutoff surface is asymptotically AdS$_2$, so that the BCFT boundary is geometrically pinned and the displacement operator vanishes identically. Using entanglement entropy at zero and finite temperature, we disentangle universal consequences of the intrinsic boundary-localized flow from features that depend on the holographic implementation."

We show that both estimators provide consistent estimations of the Euclidean transition parameter, and also prove that one of them, which is $\\sqrt$ n-consistent, allows to establish a functional central limit theorem about the unknown poisoning sequence cumulative distribution function.

    "abstract": "Traditional reinforcement learning usually assumes either episodic interactions with resets or continuous operation to minimize average or cumulative loss. While episodic settings have many theoretical results, resets are often unrealistic in practice. The infinite-horizon setting avoids this issue but lacks non-asymptotic guarantees in online scenarios with unknown dynamics. In this work, we move towards closing this gap by introducing a reset-free framework called the periodic framework, where the goal is to find periodic policies: policies that not only minimize cumulative loss but also return the agents to their initial state distribution after a fixed number of steps. We formalize the problem of finding optimal periodic policies and identify sufficient conditions under which it is well-defined for tabular Markov decision processes. To evaluate algorithms in this framework, we introduce the periodic regret, a measure that balances cumulative loss with the terminal law constraint. We then propose the first algorithms for computing periodic policies in two multi-agent settings and show they achieve sublinear periodic regret of order $\\tilde O(T^{3/4})$. This provides the first non-asymptotic guarantees for reset-free learning in the setting of $M$ homogeneous agents, for $M > 1$."

In this framework, the spacetime dynamics are governed solely by the scalar field $Φ$, endowed with a self-interaction potential $V(Φ)$ and non-minimally coupled to the Ricci scalar through the Brans--Dicke action. We numerically solve for the evolution of $Φ(t)$ and the corresponding potential $V(Φ)$ in order to track the collapse dynamics leading to singularity formation. Our analysis demonstrates that, for the energy densities $ρ\\approx 1/a$ and $ρ\\approx -\\ln a$, the collapse inevitably leads to the formation of a central curvature singularity while consistently satisfying the weak energy condition. We further examine the causal structure of the resulting singularity and find that future-directed null geodesics originating from the singularity can propagate to future null infinity, making the singularity globally visible. The strength of the singularity is also examined by extending Tipler's strong curvature condition to the Brans--Dicke field equations. Overall, our findings indicate that gravitational collapse in scalar--tensor gravity can give rise to scenarios that challenge the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture, while underscoring the potential observational relevance of singularities formed through BD scalar-field-driven collapse."

In this work, we challenge this assumption by revealing a critical flaw: \\textbf{Positional Disparity}, a phenomenon where models demonstrate mastery over the deterministic start and end regions but suffer a performance collapse in the complex intermediate sections. This degradation arises because standard training allows the massive volume of easy patterns to drown out the learning signals from difficult layouts. To address this, we propose \\textbf{FocalOrder}, a framework driven by \\textbf{Focal Preference Optimization (FPO)}. Specifically, FocalOrder employs adaptive difficulty discovery with exponential moving average mechanism to dynamically pinpoint hard-to-learn transitions, while introducing a difficulty-calibrated pairwise ranking objective to enforce global logical consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FocalOrder establishes new state-of-the-art results on OmniDocBench v1.0 and Comp-HRDoc. Our compact model not only outperforms competitive specialized baselines but also significantly surpasses large-scale general VLMs. These results demonstrate that aligning the optimization with intrinsic structural ambiguity of documents is critical for mastering complex document structures."

However, it is difficult to adapt existing Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) strategies to these formats: rotation-based methods compromise fine-grained block isolation; smoothing techniques struggle with significant 4-bit quantization errors; and mixed-precision approaches often conflict with hardware constraints on unified-precision computation. To address these challenges, we propose ARCQuant, a framework that boosts NVFP4 performance via Augmented Residual Channels. Distinct from methods that compromise block isolation or hardware uniformity, ARCQuant maintains a strictly unified NVFP4 format by augmenting the activation matrix with quantized residual channels. This design integrates the error compensation process directly into the matrix reduction dimension, enabling the use of standard, highly optimized GEMM kernels with minimal overhead. Theoretical analysis confirms that the worst-case error bound of our dual-stage NVFP4 quantization is comparable to that of standard 8-bit formats such as MXFP8. Extensive experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models demonstrate that ARCQuant achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, comparable to full-precision baselines in perplexity and downstream tasks. Furthermore, deployment on RTX 5090 and RTX PRO 6000 GPUs confirms practical benefits, achieving up to 3x speedup over FP16. Our code is available at https://github.com/actypedef/ARCQuant ."

In addition, these methods indiscriminately upsample the entire latent space at once without checking which regions have actually converged, causing accumulated errors, and visible artifacts. Therefore, we propose \\textbf{Fresco}, a dynamic resolution framework that unifies re-noise and global structure across stages with progressive upsampling, preserving both the efficiency of low-resolution drafting and the fidelity of high-resolution refinement, with all stages aligned toward the same final target. Fresco achieves near-lossless acceleration across diverse domains and models, including 10$\\times$ speedup on FLUX, and 5$\\times$ on HunyuanVideo, while remaining orthogonal to distillation, quantization and feature caching, reaching 22$\\times$ speedup when combined with distilled models.

In such settings, it is important to account for the inherent dependence that arises when individuals are nested within higher-level units, such as hospitals. Existing survival models account for group-level heterogeneity through frailty terms but do not uncover latent patient subgroups, while most clustering methods ignore hierarchical structure and are not estimated jointly with survival outcomes. In this work, we introduce a new framework that simultaneously performs patient clustering and shared-frailty survival modeling through a penalized likelihood approach. The proposed methodology adaptively learns a patient-to-patient similarity matrix via a modified version of spectral clustering, enabling cluster formation directly from estimated risk profiles while accounting for group membership. A simulation study highlights the proposed model's ability to recover latent clusters and to correctly estimate hazard parameters. We apply our method to a large cohort of heart-failure patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between 2020 and 2021 in the Lombardy region (Italy), identifying clinically meaningful subgroups characterized by distinct risk profiles and highlighting the role of respiratory comorbidities and hospital-level variability in shaping mortality outcomes.

    "abstract": "Originally, the Biswas--Chatterjee--Sen model exhibits an order/disorder phase transition for a sufficiently large number of negative interactions among actors. In this paper, the model is extended by the nonconformists and inflexibles. Nonconformists are actors who do not follow the original model rules, but in different ways do something opposite. We introduce inflexibles as actors who does not change their opinions. Both discrete and continuous opinions are considered. With direct Monte Carlo simulations and mean-field calculations, we check the influence of fractions of nonconformists and inflexibles on mean opinion in the system. With the mean-field calculations we identify ranges of fractions of nonconformists where ordered phase of the system is available. The results of the mean-field calculations perfectly match the results of the Monte Carlo simulations. We consider inflexibles adhered: (i) to extreme opinions; (ii) to specific opinions and (iii) chosen independently of their initial opinion. For inflexibles adhered to specific and extreme opinions they play a role of effective bias suppressing disorder phase in the system. The qualitative results of introducing nonconformists (inflexibles) in various ways (discrete/continuous opinions and annealed/quenched disorder) are roughly the same. However, for the model extended by inflexibles, we can observe a systematic shift of the mean order parameter to its higher values for quenched disorder compared with annealed disorder."

Although most studies examine this process in planar films, confinement within micron-sized water-in-oil droplets provides a powerful platform for resolving self-assembly dynamics in real time. Here, we investigate how two common pitch-tuning strategies, sodium chloride addition and tip sonication, govern the kinetics and structure of CNC self-assembly under spherical confinement. Polarized optical microscopy timelapses capture the evolution from isotropic suspension through tactoid nucleation and annealing to kinetic arrest and final buckling. Consistent with prior work, pitch-concentration analysis reveals a universal post-arrest regime governed by droplet shrinkage. Beyond this established behavior, we identify a pre-arrest regime in which pitch decreases rapidly and whose kinetics accelerate with increasing salt concentration and sonication dose. These parameters shift the onset of cholesteric order and gelation, thereby tuning the concentration window for tactoid coalescence. Together, these results establish droplet confinement as a quantitative platform for probing out-of-equilibrium CNC self-assembly and for kinetically programming structurally colored soft materials."

Traditional deep learning models often suffer from overfitting and high computational costs. Self-distillation (SD), a variant of knowledge distillation where a network learns from its own predictions, has recently emerged as a promising strategy to enhance model performance without requiring external teacher networks. In this work, we explore the application of SD to HSI by treating earlier outputs as soft targets, thereby enforcing consistency between intermediate and final predictions. This process improves intra-class compactness and inter-class separability in the learned feature space. Our approach is validated on two benchmark HSI datasets and demonstrates significant improvements in classification accuracy and robustness, highlighting the effectiveness of SD for spectral-spatial learning.

Scoring functions, as one of the tools guiding virtual screening, have their precision closely tied to screening efficiency. In our previous study, we developed a graph neural network model called PLANET (Protein-Ligand Affinity prediction NETwork), but it suffers from the defect in representing protein-ligand contact maps. Incorrect binding modes inevitably lead to poor affinity predictions, so accurate prediction of the protein-ligand contact map is desired to improve PLANET. In this study, we have proposed PLANET v2.0 as an upgraded version. The model is trained via multi-objective training strategy and incorporates the Mixture Density Network to predict binding modes. Except for the probability density distributions of non-covalent interactions, we innovatively employ another Gaussian mixture model to describe the relationship between distance and energy of each interaction pair and predict protein-ligand affinity like calculating the mathematical expectation. As on the CASF-2016 benchmark, PLANET v2.0 demonstrates excellent scoring power, ranking power, and docking power. The screening power of PLANET v2.0 gets notably improved compared to PLANET and Glide SP and it demonstrates robust validation on a commercial ultra-large-scale dataset. Given its efficiency and accuracy, PLANET v2.0 can hopefully become one of the practical tools for virtual screening workflows.

TOI-1243 b has enough mass to host a significant H-He envelope, although a water-world and pure rocky compositions are also consistent with the data. Our analysis indicates that future atmospheric observations using JWST can aid in determining their real composition. The sample of small planets around M dwarfs is widely used to understand planet formation and composition theories, and our study adds three planets to this sample."

    "abstract": "While Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) have matured technically, they frequently lack principled methods for encoding latent experiential aims as adaptive state variables. Consequently, contemporary architectures often prioritise ranking accuracy at the expense of nuanced, context-sensitive interaction behaviours. This paper addresses this gap through a comprehensive multi-domain study ($N = 168$) that quantifies the joint prioritisation of three critical interaction aims: educative (to inform and justify), explorative (to diversify and inspire), and affective (to align emotionally and socially). Utilising Bayesian hierarchical ordinal regression, we establish domain profiles and perceived item value as systematic modulators of these priorities. Furthermore, we identify stable user-level preferences for autonomy that persist across distinct interactional goals, suggesting that agency is a fundamental requirement of the conversational experience. Drawing on these empirical foundations, we formalise the Recommendation-as-Experience (RAE) adaptation framework. RAE systematically encodes contextual and individual signals into structured state representations, mapping them to experience-aligned dialogue policies realised through retrieval diversification, heuristic logic, or Large Language Model based controllable generation. As an architecture-agnostic blueprint, RAE facilitates the design of context-sensitive CRS that effectively balance experiential quality with predictive performance."

    "abstract": "Change-point detection and locally stationary time series modeling are two major approaches for the analysis of non-stationary data. The former aims to identify stationary phases by detecting abrupt changes in the dynamics of a time series model, while the latter employs (locally) time-varying models to describe smooth changes in dependence structure of a time series. However, in some applications, abrupt and smooth changes can co-exist, and neither of the two approaches alone can model the data adequately. In this paper, we propose a novel likelihood-based procedure for the inference of multiple change-points in locally stationary time series. In contrast to traditional change-point analysis where an abrupt change occurs in a real-valued parameter, a change in locally stationary time series occurs in a parameter curve, and can be classified as a jump or a kink depending on whether the curve is discontinuous or not. We show that the proposed method can consistently estimate the number, locations, and the types of change-points. Two different asymptotic distributions corresponding respectively to jump and kink estimators are also established.Extensive simulation studies and a real data application to financial time series are provided."

We implement our approach on the basis of a DG(0) Galerkin discretization of the neural ODE, leading to an explicit Euler time marching scheme. For the optimization we use steepest descent. Finally, we apply our method to the construction of neural networks for the classification of data sets, where we present results for a selection of well known examples from the literature."

    "abstract": "To standardize interactions between LLM-based agents and their environments, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) was proposed and has since been widely adopted. However, integrating external tools expands the attack surface, exposing agents to tool poisoning attacks. In such attacks, malicious instructions embedded in tool metadata are injected into the agent context during MCP registration phase, thereby manipulating agent behavior. Prior work primarily focuses on explicit tool poisoning or relied on manually crafted poisoned tools. In contrast, we focus on a particularly stealthy variant: implicit tool poisoning, where the poisoned tool itself remains uninvoked. Instead, the instructions embedded in the tool metadata induce the agent to invoke a legitimate but high-privilege tool to perform malicious operations. We propose MCP-ITP, the first automated and adaptive framework for implicit tool poisoning within the MCP ecosystem. MCP-ITP formulates poisoned tool generation as a black-box optimization problem and employs an iterative optimization strategy that leverages feedback from both an evaluation LLM and a detection LLM to maximize Attack Success Rate (ASR) while evading current detection mechanisms. Experimental results on the MCPTox dataset across 12 LLM agents demonstrate that MCP-ITP consistently outperforms the manually crafted baseline, achieving up to 84.2% ASR while suppressing the Malicious Tool Detection Rate (MDR) to as low as 0.3%."

    "abstract": "Group testing enables the identification of a small subset of defective items within a larger population by performing tests on pools of items rather than on each item individually. Over the years, it has not only attracted attention from the academic community, but has also demonstrated its potential in addressing real-world problems such as infectious disease screening, drug discovery and manufacturing quality control. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, interest in group testing has grown further, particularly in non-adaptive testing, due to its time efficiency compared to adaptive approaches. This highlights the importance of improving the performance currently achievable in such a scheme. This article focuses on advancing the field of noiseless non-adaptive group testing. The main objective of this work is to study and maximize the probability of successfully identifying the subset of defective items while performing as few tests as possible. To this end, we first note current well-known decoding algorithms, as well as established test design strategies for assigning items to pools. From this review, we identify key opportunities for improvement that inform the development of new decoding algorithms. Specifically, we propose a novel method, Weighted Sequential Combinatorial Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (W-SCOMP), to enhance the efficiency of existing detection procedures. Theoretical results demonstrate that W-SCOMP outperforms other algorithms in noiseless non-adaptive group testing. Furthermore, we develop a simulation framework to model the group testing process and conduct comparative evaluations between the proposed and existing algorithms. The empirical results are consistent with the theoretical findings. Overall, our work expands the range of available decoding algorithms and contributes to the broader understanding of noiseless non-adaptive group testing."

    "abstract": "Partial differential equations (PDEs) govern a wide range of physical phenomena, but their numerical solution remains computationally demanding, especially when repeated simulations are required across many parameter settings. Recent Scientific Foundation Models (SFMs) aim to alleviate this cost by learning universal surrogates from large collections of simulated systems, yet they typically rely on monolithic architectures with limited interpretability and high pretraining expense. In this work we introduce Compositional Neural Operators (CompNO), a compositional neural operator framework for parametric PDEs. Instead of pretraining a single large model on heterogeneous data, CompNO first learns a library of Foundation Blocks, where each block is a parametric Fourier neural operator specialized to a fundamental differential operator (e.g. convection, diffusion, nonlinear convection). These blocks are then assembled, via lightweight Adaptation Blocks, into task-specific solvers that approximate the temporal evolution operator for target PDEs. A dedicated boundary-condition operator further enforces Dirichlet constraints exactly at inference time. We validate CompNO on one-dimensional convection, diffusion, convection--diffusion and Burgers' equations from the PDEBench suite. The proposed framework achieves lower relative L2 error than strong baselines (PFNO, PDEFormer and in-context learning based models) on linear parametric systems, while remaining competitive on nonlinear Burgers' flows. The model maintains exact boundary satisfaction with zero loss at domain boundaries, and exhibits robust generalization across a broad range of Peclet and Reynolds numbers. These results demonstrate that compositional neural operators provide a scalable and physically interpretable pathway towards foundation models for PDEs."

These experimental observations are well described by the weakly coupled two-band model of Eilenberger theory, which identifies suppressed interband pairing interactions between the bilayer-split bands as the key mechanism.

Our approach is based on arithmetic constraints derived from the Smith Normal Form (SNF) of the walk matrix $W(G)$, which lead to a tight upper bound on the number of generalized cospectral mates of a graph. Our upper bound applies to a much broader class of graphs than those previously shown to have no generalized cospectral mates (determined by generalized spectrum).

While the classical Koch curve is defined by an iterative process that divides a line segment into three parts and replaces the middle part by the legs of an isosceles triangle 'above' the line segment, in this more general setting, a choice can be made at each iteration as to whether to place this triangle 'above' or 'below' the line segment. The resulting fractals bear a striking visual resemblance to curves appearing in nature, such as coastlines and snowflakes. While these fractals can be generated by a random process that flips a coin each time to decide the orientation of the triangle, leading to 'almost sure' results for their geometrical properties, we define and study them deterministically to provide exact results. In particular, we show, using the theory of non-integer expansions, that the set of all possible values for the area enclosed by these generalised Koch curves is a closed interval. Moreover, we prove that the union of all these generalised snowflakes does not contain an open set, and has zero $2$-dimensional Lebesgue measure. Complementing these results, using arguments from calculus and fractal geometry, namely properties of geometric series and Frostman's Lemma, we show that each generalised Koch curve has infinite length and the same Hausdorff dimension as its classical counterpart. Further, we also give a classification for when a generalised Koch curve is a quasicircle."

    "abstract": "This paper aims to propose a universal definition of intelligence that enables fair and consistent comparison of human and artificial intelligence (AI). With the rapid development of AI technology in recent years, how to compare and evaluate human and AI intelligence has become an important theoretical issue. However, existing definitions of intelligence are anthropocentric and unsuitable for empirical comparison, resulting in a lack of consensus in the research field. This paper first introduces four criteria for evaluating intelligence definitions based on R. Carnap's methodology of conceptual clarification: similarity to explicandum, exactness, fruitfulness, and simplicity. We then examine six representative definitions: IQ testing, complex problem-solving ability, reward optimization, environmental adaptation, learning efficiency, and predictive ability, and clarify their theoretical strengths and limitations. The results show that while definitions based on predictive ability have high explanatory power and empirical feasibility, they suffer from an inability to adequately explain the relationship between predictions and behavior/benefits. This paper proposes the Extended Predictive Hypothesis (EPH), which views intelligence as a combination of the ability to accurately predict the future and the ability to benefit from those predictions. Furthermore, by distinguishing predictive ability into spontaneous and reactive predictions and adding the concept of gainability, we present a unified framework for explaining various aspects of intelligence, such as creativity, learning, and future planning. In conclusion, this paper argues that the EPH is the most satisfactory and universal definition for comparing human and AI intelligence."

Until recent time the X-ray emission of the Arches star cluster in the Galactic Center was mixed with non-thermal emission of the surrounding molecular cloud, associated with reflection of hard X-ray irradiation. This reflected emission has been observed to fade, giving us a chance to characterize intrinsic non-thermal emission of the Arches cluster. In this work we demonstrate that Fe K_alpha line emission at 6.4 keV, attributed to the reflected non-thermal emission of the molecular cloud in 2000-2010, is not detected in deep observations with XMM-Newton in 2020 and Chandra in 2022, leaving stellar cluster well isolated. We showed that the Arches non-thermal emission is localized in the cluster's core and characterized by a relatively weak, hard (Gamma~1.5) power-law spectral continuum with 2-10 keV flux of ~10E-13 ergs/s/cm^2."

This method is developed by introducing subspace projection to a singular value thresholding based method when updating the low rank part. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data show that ARMC is superior to existing non-convex RMC methods. Through a refined analysis based on the leave-one-out technique, we have established the theoretical guarantee for ARMC subject to both sparse outliers and stochastic noise. The established bounds for the sample complexity and outlier sparsity are better than those established for a convex approach that also considers both outliers and stochastic noise."

    "abstract": "We introduce MetaGlyph, a symbolic language for compressing prompts by encoding instructions as mathematical symbols rather than prose. Unlike systems requiring explicit decoding rules, MetaGlyph uses symbols like $\\in$ (membership) and $\\Rightarrow$ (implication) that models already understand from their training data. We test whether these symbols work as ''instruction shortcuts'' that models can interpret without additional teaching. We evaluate eight models across two dimensions relevant to practitioners: scale (3B-1T parameters) and accessibility (open-source for local deployment vs. proprietary APIs). MetaGlyph achieves 62-81% token reduction across all task types. For API-based deployments, this translates directly to cost savings; for local deployments, it reduces latency and memory pressure. Results vary by model. Gemini 2.5 Flash achieves 75% semantic equivalence between symbolic and prose instructions on selection tasks, with 49.9% membership operator fidelity. Kimi K2 reaches 98.1% fidelity for implication ($\\Rightarrow$) and achieves perfect (100%) accuracy on selection tasks with symbolic prompts. GPT-5.2 Chat shows the highest membership fidelity observed (91.3%), though with variable parse success across task types. Claude Haiku 4.5 achieves 100% parse success with 26% membership fidelity. Among mid-sized models, Qwen 2.5 7B shows 62% equivalence on extraction tasks. Mid-sized open-source models (7B-12B) show near-zero operator fidelity, suggesting a U-shaped relationship where sufficient scale overcomes instruction-tuning biases."

    "abstract": "Speculative decoding (SD) has become a standard technique for accelerating LLM inference without sacrificing output quality. Recent advances in speculative decoding have shifted from sequential chain-based drafting to tree-structured generation, where the draft model constructs a tree of candidate tokens to explore multiple possible drafts in parallel. However, existing tree-based SD methods typically build a fixed-width, fixed-depth draft tree, which fails to adapt to the varying difficulty of tokens and contexts. As a result, the draft model cannot dynamically adjust the tree structure to early stop on difficult tokens and extend generation for simple ones. To address these challenges, we introduce TALON, a training-free, budget-driven adaptive tree expansion framework that can be plugged into existing tree-based methods. Unlike static methods, TALON constructs the draft tree iteratively until a fixed token budget is met, using a hybrid expansion strategy that adaptively allocates the node budget to each layer of the draft tree. This framework naturally shapes the draft tree into a \"deep-and-narrow\" form for deterministic contexts and a \"shallow-and-wide\" form for uncertain branches, effectively optimizing the trade-off between exploration width and generation depth under a given budget. Extensive experiments across 5 models and 6 datasets demonstrate that TALON consistently outperforms state-of-the-art EAGLE-3, achieving up to 5.16x end-to-end speedup over auto-regressive decoding."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable reward (RLVR) on preference data has become the mainstream approach for training Generative Reward Models (GRMs). Typically in pairwise rewarding tasks, GRMs generate reasoning chains ending with critiques and preference labels, and RLVR then relies on the correctness of the preference labels as the training reward. However, in this paper, we demonstrate that such binary classification tasks make GRMs susceptible to guessing correct outcomes without sound critiques. Consequently, these spurious successes introduce substantial noise into the reward signal, thereby impairing the effectiveness of reinforcement learning. To address this issue, we propose Reward Modeling from Natural Language Human Feedback (RM-NLHF), which leverages natural language feedback to obtain process reward signals, thereby mitigating the problem of limited solution space inherent in binary tasks. Specifically, we compute the similarity between GRM-generated and human critiques as the training reward, which provides more accurate reward signals than outcome-only supervision. Additionally, considering that human critiques are difficult to scale up, we introduce Meta Reward Model (MetaRM) which learns to predict process reward from datasets with human critiques and then generalizes to data without human critiques. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GRMs trained with outcome-only reward, confirming the superiority of integrating natural language over binary human feedback as supervision."

Diversified Planning Initialization generates structurally distinct algorithmic strategies for broad solution space coverage. Genetic Evolution replaces stochastic operations with feedback-guided mechanisms, enabling targeted mutation and compositional crossover. Hierarchical Evolution Memory captures both successful and failed experiences at inter-task and intra-task levels.Experiments on EffiBench-X demonstrate that CSE consistently outperforms all baselines across various LLM backbones. Furthermore, CSE achieves higher efficiency from early generations and maintains continuous improvement throughout evolution.

Under open boundaries, states that would otherwise extend freely become localized at the edges of the finite momentum space, forming quasienergy edge states. While the bulk response measured by the MCD is strongly affected once the evolving wave packet reaches the boundaries, the persistence of these edge states still reflects the bulk-edge correspondence and provides reliable signatures of topological transitions."

    "abstract": "Learning how to learn efficiently is a fundamental challenge for biological agents and a growing concern for artificial ones. To learn effectively, an agent must regulate its learning speed, balancing the benefits of rapid improvement against the costs of effort, instability, or resource use. We introduce a normative framework that formalizes this problem as an optimal control process in which the agent maximizes cumulative performance while incurring a cost of learning. From this objective, we derive a closed-form solution for the optimal learning rate, which has the form of a closed-loop controller that depends only on the agent's current and expected future performance. Under mild assumptions, this solution generalizes across tasks and architectures and reproduces numerically optimized schedules in simulations. In simple learning models, we can mathematically analyze how agent and task parameters shape learning-rate scheduling as an open-loop control solution. Because the optimal policy depends on expectations of future performance, the framework predicts how overconfidence or underconfidence influence engagement and persistence, linking the control of learning speed to theories of self-regulated learning. We further show how a simple episodic memory mechanism can approximate the required performance expectations by recalling similar past learning experiences, providing a biologically plausible route to near-optimal behaviour. Together, these results provide a normative and biologically plausible account of learning speed control, linking self-regulated learning, effort allocation, and episodic memory estimation within a unified and tractable mathematical framework."

In this survey, we systematically review the computational evolution of SO from a histopathology-centered perspective and organize existing methods into three paradigms: integration, which jointly models paired multimodal data; mapping, which infers molecular profiles from H&E images; and foundation models, which learn generalizable representations from large-scale spatial datasets. We analyze how the role of H&E images evolves across these paradigms from spatial context to predictive anchor and ultimately to representation backbone in response to practical constraints such as limited paired data and increasing resolution demands. We further summarize actionable modeling directions enabled by current architectures and delineate persistent gaps driven by data, biology, and technology that are unlikely to be resolved by model design alone. Together, this survey provides a histopathology-centered roadmap for developing and applying computational frameworks in SO."

For example, video models enable photorealistic, physically consistent deformable-body simulation without making prohibitive simplifying assumptions, which is a major bottleneck in physics-based simulation. Moreover, video models can serve as foundation world models that capture the dynamics of the world in a fine-grained and expressive way. They thus overcome the limited expressiveness of language-only abstractions in describing intricate physical interactions. In this survey, we provide a review of video models and their applications as embodied world models in robotics, encompassing cost-effective data generation and action prediction in imitation learning, dynamics and rewards modeling in reinforcement learning, visual planning, and policy evaluation. Further, we highlight important challenges hindering the trustworthy integration of video models in robotics, which include poor instruction following, hallucinations such as violations of physics, and unsafe content generation, in addition to fundamental limitations such as significant data curation, training, and inference costs. We present potential future directions to address these open research challenges to motivate research and ultimately facilitate broader applications, especially in safety-critical settings."

In these notes, at first, by relying upon Guerra interpolation, we re-obtain the existing picture rigorously. Next we show that, due to dilution in the patterns, these networks are able to switch from serial recall (where one pattern is retrieved per time) to parallel recall (where several patterns are retrieved at once) and the larger the dilution, the stronger this emerging multi-tasking capability. In particular, we inspect the regimes of mild dilution (where solely a low storage of pattern can be enabled) and extreme dilution (where a medium storage of patterns can be sustained) separately as they give rise to different outcomes: the former displays hierarchical recall (distributing the amplitudes of the retrieved signals with different amplitudes), the latter -instead- performs a equal-strength recall (where a O(1) fraction of all the patterns is simultaneously retrieved with the same amplitude per pattern). Finally, in order to implement graded responses in the neurons, variations on theme obtained by enlarging the possible values of neural activity these neurons may sustain are also discussed generalizing the Ghatak-Sherrington model for inverse freezing in Hebbian terms."

We present a contrastive learning framework for modeling narrative salience that learns story embeddings from narrative twins: stories that share the same plot but differ in surface form. Our model is trained to distinguish a story from both its narrative twin and a distractor with similar surface features but different plot. Using the resulting embeddings, we evaluate four narratologically motivated operations for inferring salience (deletion, shifting, disruption, and summarization). Experiments on short narratives from the ROCStories corpus and longer Wikipedia plot summaries show that contrastively learned story embeddings outperform a masked-language-model baseline, and that summarization is the most reliable operation for identifying salient sentences. If narrative twins are not available, random dropout can be used to generate the twins from a single story. Effective distractors can be obtained either by prompting LLMs or, in long-form narratives, by using different parts of the same story."

    "abstract": "Many modern procedures use the data to learn a structure and then leverage it to test many hypotheses. If the entire data is used at both stages, analytical or computational corrections for selection bias are required to ensure validity (post-learning adjustment). Alternatively, one can learn and/or test on masked versions of the data to avoid selection bias, either via information splitting or null augmentation}. Choosing among these three learn-then-test paradigms, and how much masking to employ for the latter two, are critical decisions impacting power that currently lack theoretical guidance. In a multivariate normal means model, we derive asymptotic power formulas for prototypical methods from each paradigm -- variants of sample splitting, conformal-style null augmentation, and resampling-based post-learning adjustment -- quantifying the power losses incurred by masking at each stage. For these paradigm representatives, we find that post-learning adjustment is most powerful, followed by null augmentation, and then information splitting. Moreover, null augmentation can be nearly as powerful as post-learning adjustment, while avoiding its challenges: the power of the former approaches that of the latter if the number of nulls used for augmentation is a vanishing fraction of the number of hypotheses. We also prove for a tractable proxy that the optimal number of nulls scales as the square root of the number of hypotheses, challenging existing heuristics. Finally, we characterize optimal tuning for information splitting by identifying an optimal split fraction and tying it to the difficulty of the learning problem. These results establish a theoretical foundation for key decisions in the deployment of learn-then-test methods."

    "abstract": "Numerical reasoning is an important task in the analysis of financial documents. It helps in understanding and performing numerical predictions with logical conclusions for the given query seeking answers from financial texts. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results in multiple Question-Answering (Q-A) systems with the capability of logical reasoning. As documents related to finance often consist of long and complex financial contexts, LLMs appear well-suited for building high-quality automated financial question-answering systems. However, LLMs often face challenges in accurately processing the various numbers within financial reports. Extracting numerical data from unstructured text and semi-structured tables, and reliably performing accurate calculations, remains a significant bottleneck for numerical reasoning in most state-of-the-art LLMs. Recent studies have shown that structured data augmentations, such as Knowledge Graphs (KGs), have notably improved the predictions of LLMs along with logical explanations. Thus, it is an important requirement to consider inherent structured information in financial reports while using LLMs for various financial analytics. This paper proposes a framework to incorporate structured information using KGs along with LLM predictions for numerical reasoning tasks. The KGs are extracted using a proposed schema inherently from the document under processing. We evaluated our proposed framework over the benchmark data FinQA, using an open-source LLM, namely Llama 3.1 8B Instruct. We observed that the proposed framework improved execution accuracy by approximately 12% relative to the vanilla LLM."

Although optical manipulation of magnetism in metals has been extensively studied, experimentally demonstrated effects have so far been limited to heat-driven dynamics or helicity-dependent mechanisms. Here, we report ultrafast non-thermal control of spin order in noncollinear antiferromagnetic Mn-based antiperovskite nitrides Mn3NiN and Mn3GaN, driven solely by the polarization orientation of linearly polarized femtosecond laser pulses. Using time-resolved magneto-optical pump-probe experiments based on the Voigt effect, we observe sub-picosecond changes in magnetic order followed by picosecond relaxation. The magneto-optical response depends on the relative orientation of the pump and probe polarization planes, with linear-polarization dependence reaching up to 95%, a value unprecedented in metallic magnets. This phenomenon is observed in two different materials and persists over a wide range of excitation wavelengths, fluences, and temperatures, demonstrating its robustness. Symmetry analysis and microscopic modeling indicate that optically induced torques alone cannot fully explain the observed dynamics. We therefore propose laser-induced formation of transient spin-spiral states as a possible excitation mechanism."

    "abstract": "Understanding how microorganisms navigate in complex environments is a central question in active matter and biological physics. Phototaxis - the ability to use light as a navigation cue - is a widespread strategy in motile microalgae to optimise photosynthesis and avoid light-induced stress. The microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a model system for studying this behaviour, where navigation is classically attributed to a photosensitive organelle named eyespot. While this mechanism enables cells to sense the direction of incoming light, their response to light intensity gradients remains less understood. Here we show that structured light landscapes can guide microalgae populations and localise them in defined spatial regions. By analysing single-cell trajectories, we find that cells actively steer relative to the local light gradient, and a comparison with a minimal theoretical model shows that a short-time memory of light exposure acting on the transition between positive and negative phototaxis is necessary to reproduce the observed accumulation. At longer times, we observe a gradual decrease in cell number density within the trapping region, consistent with phototactic adaptation. Beyond controlling population dynamics, our results reveal new aspects of phototactic behaviour, highlighting gradient-aligned steering together with temporal integration as central mechanisms for navigation in structured environments."

The objective is to reconstruct an unknown initial condition from a near-equilibrium state obtained after 100 explicit forward Euler iterations of the reaction-diffusion equation \\[ u_t - γΔu + κ\\left(u^3 - u\\right)=0. \\] Because this mapping strongly damps high-frequency content, the inverse problem is severely ill-posed and sensitive to noise. Our approach integrates a U-Net generator, a PatchGAN critic with spectral normalization, Wasserstein loss with gradient penalty, and several physics-informed auxiliary terms, including Lyapunov energy matching, distributional statistics, and a crucial forward-simulation penalty. This penalty enforces consistency between the predicted initial condition and its forward evolution under the \\emph{same} forward Euler discretization used for dataset generation. Earlier experiments employing an Eyre-type semi-implicit solver were not compatible with this residual mechanism due to the cost and instability of Newton iterations within batched GPU training. On a dataset of 50k training and 10k testing pairs on $128\\times128$ grids (with natural $[-1,1]$ amplitude scaling), the best trained model attains a mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately \\textbf{0.23988159} on the full test set, with a sample-wise standard deviation of about \\textbf{0.00266345}. The results demonstrate stable inversion, accurate recovery of interfacial structure, and robustness to high-frequency noise in the initial data."

A tight-binding Hamiltonian and the Green's function formalism are employed to calculate the spin-resolved thermoelectric properties of the system as functions of geometrical confinement and vacancy concentration. The results demonstrate an enhancement in charge and spin-dependent thermopower, resulting in an improved thermoelectric efficiency at room temperature, which overcomes the limitations imposed by the classical Wiedemann-Franz law. These findings indicate that defective silicene nanoribbons are promising platforms for the development of efficient thermoelectric and spin-caloritronic devices."

    "abstract": "Denied boarding in congested transit systems induces queuing delays and departure-time shifts that can reshape passenger flows. Correctly modeling these responses in transit assignment hinges on the enforcement of two priority rules: continuance priority for onboard passengers and first-come-first-served (FCFS) boarding among waiting passengers. Existing schedule-based models typically enforce these rules through explicit dynamic loading and group-level expected costs, yet discrete vehicle runs can induce nontrivial within-group cost differences that undermine behavioral consistency. We revisit the implicit-priority framework of Nguyen et al. (2001), which, by encoding boarding priority through the notion of available capacity, characterizes route and departure choices based on realized personal (rather than group-averaged) travel experiences. However, the framework lacks an explicit mathematical formulation and exact computational methods for finding equilibria. Here, we derive an equivalent nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) formulation and establish equilibrium existence under mild conditions. We also show that multiple equilibria may exist, including behaviorally questionable ones. To rule out these artifacts, we propose a refined arc-level NCP formulation that not only corresponds to a tighter, behaviorally consistent equilibrium concept but also is more computationally tractable. We reformulate the NCP as a continuously differentiable mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) and propose two solution algorithms. Numerical studies on benchmark instances and a Hong Kong case study demonstrate that the model reproduces continuance priority and FCFS queuing and captures departure-time shifts driven by the competition for boarding priority."

However, such basic implementations exhibit several limitations, including noisy or suboptimal retrieval, misuse of retrieval for out-of-scope queries, weak query-document matching, and variability or cost associated with the generator. These shortcomings have motivated the development of \"Enhanced\" RAG, where dedicated modules are introduced to address specific weaknesses in the workflow. More recently, the growing self-reflective capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new paradigm, which we refer to as \"Agentic\" RAG. In this approach, the LLM orchestrates the entire process-deciding which actions to perform, when to perform them, and whether to iterate-thereby reducing reliance on fixed, manually engineered modules. Despite the rapid adoption of both paradigms, it remains unclear which approach is preferable under which conditions. In this work, we conduct an extensive, empirically driven evaluation of Enhanced and Agentic RAG across multiple scenarios and dimensions. Our results provide practical insights into the trade-offs between the two paradigms, offering guidance on selecting the most effective RAG design for real-world applications, considering both costs and performance."

An on-chip demultiplexer, composed of Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) and ring resonators, offers a large channel-to-channel isolation sufficient for error-free operation. Capacitive phase shifters embedded within the ring resonators of the demultiplexer are used for wavelength alignment at a zero static power consumption.

Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, primarily based on relative ranking, often suffer from severe reward sparsity and gradient instability, failing to effectively exploit the verifiable signals provided by 3D physical constraints. Notably, in standard GRPO frameworks, relative normalization causes \"near-miss\" samples (characterized by small but non-zero errors) to suffer from advantage collapse. This leads to a severe data utilization bottleneck where valuable boundary samples are discarded during optimization. To address this, we introduce the Smooth Numerical Reward Activation (SNRA) operator and the Absolute-Preserving GRPO (AP-GRPO) framework. SNRA employs a dynamically parameterized Sigmoid function to transform raw feedback into a dense, continuous reward continuum. Concurrently, AP-GRPO integrates absolute scalar gradients to mitigate the numerical information loss inherent in conventional relative-ranking mechanisms. By leveraging this approach, we constructed Numerical3D-50k, a dataset comprising 50,000 verifiable 3D subtasks. Empirical results indicate that AP-GRPO achieves performance parity with large-scale supervised methods while maintaining higher data efficiency, effectively activating latent 3D reasoning in VLMs without requiring architectural modifications."

In inviscid flows within the stable wavenumber region $k$, no regular eigenmodes exist -- the frequency spectrum $ω$ consists of a continuous set of singular van Kampen modes with real frequencies. Nevertheless, initial perturbations of the total vorticity integrated across the flow decay exponentially, resembling the behavior of an eigenmode with complex eigenfrequency ${\\rm Im}\\,ω<0$ (Landau damping). However, the vorticity itself does not decay but becomes increasingly corrugated across the flow. We demonstrate that accounting for arbitrarily small viscosity transforms this exponentially decaying perturbation into a true eigenmode in which the vorticity preserves its spatial form. We numerically trace the transformation of the vorticity structure of this mode and its disappearance as viscosity approaches zero. We discuss similarities and differences between the behavior of damped perturbations in the transition from inviscid to nearly inviscid flows in hydrodynamics and their behavior in plasma and homogeneous stellar systems during the analogous transition from collisionless to very weakly collisional systems."

    "abstract": "As intelligent agents become more generally-capable, i.e. able to master a wide variety of tasks, the complexity and cost of properly evaluating them rises significantly. Tasks that assess specific capabilities of the agents can be correlated and stochastic, requiring many samples for accurate comparisons, leading to added costs. In this paper, we propose a formal definition and a conceptual framework for active evaluation of agents across multiple tasks, which assesses the performance of ranking algorithms as a function of number of evaluation data samples. Rather than curating, filtering, or compressing existing data sets as a preprocessing step, we propose an online framing: on every iteration, the ranking algorithm chooses the task and agents to sample scores from. Then, evaluation algorithms report a ranking of agents on each iteration and their performance is assessed with respect to the ground truth ranking over time. Several baselines are compared under different experimental contexts, with synthetic generated data and simulated online access to real evaluation data from Atari game-playing agents. We find that the classical Elo rating system -- while it suffers from well-known failure modes, in theory -- is a consistently reliable choice for efficient reduction of ranking error in practice. A recently-proposed method, Soft Condorcet Optimization, shows comparable performance to Elo on synthetic data and significantly outperforms Elo on real Atari agent evaluation. When task variation from the ground truth is high, selecting tasks based on proportional representation leads to higher rate of ranking error reduction."

    "abstract": "Pit thermal energy storage (PTES) provides large-scale thermal storage capacity in district heating systems, supporting flexibility on both daily and seasonal scales. Most existing large-scale energy system studies on PTES do not account for temperature differences between storage and the network. Neglecting these temperature differences can result in less efficient PTES integration, since they affect usable energy capacity and introduce additional costs for discharge requiring temperature boosting. To explore how temperature constraints shape the system-level value of PTES, we use PyPSA-DE, an open-source sector-coupled capacity expansion model of Germany and neighboring countries in a scenario with net zero carbon emissions for 2045. To isolate PTES effects, we examine counterfactual scenarios: systems without PTES, idealized systems with PTES but without temperature constraints, and feasible systems with boosting. We find that PTES reduces German annual system costs by 135-345 M EUR per year relative to systems relying solely on tank storage. Lowering maximum forward temperatures from 124 degrees C to 95 degrees C decreases district heating costs by 7.6 percent without PTES and 10 percent with PTES. Idealized scenarios without temperature constraints yield district heating cost savings of up to 15 percent, indicating that temperature-agnostic modeling overestimates PTES benefits. PTES provides economic value even under current high temperatures, though temperature misalignment limits its contribution during peak demand due to the need for boosting. The findings highlight the role of PTES in leveraging low-price electricity through electrified heating while emphasizing the importance of explicitly accounting for temperature constraints."

    "abstract": "Fine-grained scintillator detectors are critical for precision measurements in nuclear and particle physics, where accurate reconstruction of interaction vertices and secondary particle directions enables separation of signal from background events. A well-known design choice is the fiber readout geometry: traditional 2-View systems use orthogonal X and Y fibers, while next-generation 3-View designs add a third Z-fiber layer that provides unambiguous 3D voxel identification. The 2-View approach suffers from combinatorial ghost hits, that the false 3D candidates arising from fiber projection ambiguities, degrading reconstruction performance in high-multiplicity events. This paper presents comprehensive simulation benchmarks quantifying the performance difference between 2-View and 3-View geometries across key metrics. We find that the 3-View geometry reduces ghost hits by 30--90\\% depending on event topology, provides robust vertex resolution across complex topologies, and maintains superior angular resolution for shower direction reconstruction. These benchmarks inform the design optimization of future detectors and provide quantitative guidance for reconstruction algorithm development across a broad range of experiments including neutrino physics, rare kaon/pion decays, and collider calorimetry."

In previous work, we introduced Descartes, a multilingual model for generating short descriptions. In this report, we present the results of a pilot deployment of Descartes in the Wikipedia Android app, where editors were offered suggestions based on outputs from Descartes while editing short descriptions. The experiment spanned 12 languages, with over 3,900 articles and 375 editors participating. Overall, 90% of accepted Descartes descriptions were rated at least 3 out of 5 in quality, and their average ratings were comparable to human-written ones. Editors adopted machine suggestions both directly and with modifications, while the rate of reverts and reports remained low. The pilot also revealed practical considerations for deployment, including latency, language-specific gaps, and the need for safeguards around sensitive topics. These results indicate that Descartes's short descriptions can support editors in reducing content gaps, provided that technical, design, and community guardrails are in place."

However, despite LA's growth, little is known about how research topics, funding, and collaboration, as well as the relationships among them, have developed within the community over time. This study addressed this gap by analyzing all 936 full and short papers published at LAK over a 15-year period using unsupervised machine learning, natural language processing, and network analytics. The analysis revealed a stable core of prolific authors alongside high turnover of newcomers, systematic links between funding sources and research directions, and six enduring topical centers that remain globally shared but vary in prominence across countries. These six topical centers, which encompass LA research, are: self-regulated learning, dashboards and theory, social learning, automated feedback, multimodal analytics, and outcome prediction. Our findings highlight key challenges for the future: widening participation, reducing dependency on a narrow set of funders, and ensuring that emerging research trajectories remain responsive to educational practice and societal needs."

    "abstract": "We investigate the sensitivity of calcium production to nuclear reaction rates of a 40 solar-mass Population III star using 1D multi-zone stellar models. A comprehensive nuclear reaction network was constructed, and all $(p,γ)$ and $(p,α)$ reaction rates were individually varied by a factor of 10 up and down, identifying 13 preliminary key reactions for calcium production. To propagate the reaction rate uncertainties on calcium production, two sets of Monte Carlo simulations were performed for these key reactions: one adopting STARLIB reaction rates and the other incorporating updated rates from recent experimental data and evaluations. Our results show that Monte Carlo simulations using the updated rates show good agreement with the observed calcium abundance of the extremely iron-poor star SMSS J031300.36-670839.3 within the 68% confidence interval predicted by the models. In contrast, the observed calcium abundance lies marginally outside the 68% C.I. when using the STARLIB rates. Spearman rank-order correlation analysis and SHAP values show that the $(p,γ)$ and $(p,α)$ reactions of F18 and F19 exhibit strong coupled effects on calcium production. These reaction-rate uncertainties need to be reduced to constrain the stellar model predictions. Our study provides insights for future nuclear physics experiments aimed at reducing reaction rate uncertainties in the nucleosynthesis of Population III Stars. Additionally, comparisons between 20 solar-mass and 40 solar-mass Population III stellar models confirm that the latter, with updated reaction rates, is more capable of reproducing the observed Ca abundance and [Ca/Mg] ratio."

    "abstract": "Individual-specific, time-constant, random effects are often used to model dependence and/or to account for omitted covariates in regression models for longitudinal responses. Longitudinal studies have known a huge and widespread use in the last few years as they allow to distinguish between so-called age and cohort effects; these relate to differences that can be observed at the beginning of the study and stay persistent through time, and changes in the response that are due to the temporal dynamics in the observed covariates. While there is a clear and general agreement on this purpose, the random effect approach has been frequently criticized for not being robust to the presence of correlation between the observed (i.e. covariates) and the unobserved (i.e. random effects) heterogeneity. Starting from the so-called correlated effect approach, we argue that the random effect approach may be parametrized to account for potential correlation between observables and unobservables. Specifically, when the random effect distribution is estimated non-parametrically using a discrete distribution on finite number of locations, a further, more general, solution is developed. This is illustrated via a large scale simulation study and the analysis of a benchmark dataset."

We point out that the validity of several widely studied holographic inequalities -- including the AdS Penrose inequality, the late-time bound on entanglement entropy growth, and the growth-rate limits of CV and CA complexities -- depends on the choice of quantization schemes. Motivated by this issue, we introduce a modified total energy, which is still computed via holographic renormalization but the final value is independent of the choice of quantization schemes. We verify that this new ``total energy'' restores all these bounds to universal validity in the model of generalized free scalar field theory. Our results suggest that our modified total energy provides a more robust notion of energy when we talk about above inequalities in holographic settings."

In particular, these results constitute an almost quadratic advantage over the best-possible classical algorithm. Our algorithm also improves on the quantum state of the art, and we contend that this is not just theoretically interesting but also potentially practically impactful in real-world applications: knowing a Markov chain's spectral gap can speed-up sampling in Markov chain Monte Carlo. Our approach uses the quantum singular value transformation, and as a result we also develop some theory around block-encoding Markov chain transition matrices, which is potentially of independent interest. In particular, we introduce explicit block-encoding methods for the transition matrices of two algebraically-defined classes of Markov chains."

While large language models (LLMs) show promise for RTL code generation, their ability to reason about hardware specifications and generate targeted test plans remains largely unexplored. We present the first systematic study of LLM reasoning capabilities for RTL verification stimuli generation, establishing a two-stage framework that decomposes test plan generation from testbench execution. Our benchmark reveals that state-of-the-art models, including DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-4.0-Sonnet, achieve only 15.7-21.7% success rates on generating stimuli that pass golden RTL designs. To improve LLM generated stimuli, we develop a comprehensive training methodology combining supervised fine-tuning with a novel reinforcement learning approach, GRPO with State Mutation (GRPO-SMu), which enhances exploration by varying input mutations. Our approach leverages a tree-based branching mutation strategy to construct training data comprising equivalent and mutated trees, moving beyond linear mutation approaches to provide rich learning signals. Training on this curated dataset, our 7B parameter model achieves a 33.3% golden test pass rate and a 13.9% mutation detection rate, representing a 17.6% absolute improvement over baseline and outperforming much larger general-purpose models. These results demonstrate that specialized training methodologies can significantly enhance LLM reasoning capabilities for hardware verification tasks, establishing a foundation for automated sub-unit testing in semiconductor design workflows."

    "abstract": "This work develops a unified nonlinear estimation-guidance-control framework for cooperative simultaneous interception of a stationary target under a heterogeneous sensing topology, where sensing capabilities are non-uniform across interceptors. Specifically, only a subset of agents is instrumented with onboard seekers (informed/seeker-equipped agents), whereas the rest of them (seeker-less agents) acquire the information about the target indirectly via the informed agents and execute a distributed cooperative guidance for simultaneous target interception. To address the resulting partial observability, a predefined-time distributed observer is leveraged, guaranteeing convergence of the target state estimates for seeker-less agents through information exchange with seeker-equipped neighbors over a directed communication graph. Thereafter, an improved time-to-go estimate accounting for wide launch envelopes is utilized to design the distributed cooperative guidance commands. This estimate is coupled with a predefined-time consensus protocol, ensuring consensus in the agents' time-to-go values. The temporal upper bounds within which both observer error and time-to-go consensus error converge to zero can be prescribed as design parameters. Furthermore, the cooperative guidance commands are realized by means of an autopilot, wherein the interceptor is steered by canard actuation. The corresponding fin deflection commands are generated using a predefined-time convergent sliding mode control law. This enables the autopilot to precisely track the commanded lateral acceleration within a design-specified time, while maintaining non-singularity of the overall design. Theoretical guarantees are supported by numerical simulations across diverse engagement geometries, verifying the estimation accuracy, the cooperative interception performance, and the autopilot response using the proposed scheme."

Has this power been used responsibly? In this article we provide the first systematic analysis of a particular form of abuse of power by guest editors: endogeny, the practice of publishing articles in ones own special issue. While moderate levels of endogeny are common in special issues, excessive endogeny is a blatant case of scientific misconduct. We define special issues containing more than 33% endogeny as Published in Support of Self (PISS). We build a dataset of over 100,000 special issues published between 2015 and 2025 by five leading publishers. The large majority of guest editors engage in endogeny responsibly, if at all. Nonetheless, despite endogeny policies by publishers and indexers, PISS is comparable in magnitude to scientific fraud. All journals heavily relying on special issues host PISS, and more than 1,000 PISS special issues are published each year, hosting tens of thousands of endogenous articles. Extreme PISS abuses are rare, as the majority of PISS occurs at moderate levels of endogeny. Since the scientific literature is a common pool resource this is not good news, as it reflects a widespread normalisation of guest editor misconduct. Fortunately, PISS can be solved by setting easily enforceable commonsense policies. We provide the data and analyses needed for indexers and academic regulators to act."

In classic random-turn games, control of each node is assigned randomly every time the node is visited during a play. In this work, we study two natural variants of this where control of each node is assigned only once: (i) control is assigned randomly during a play when a node is visited for the first time and does not change for the rest of the play and (ii) control is assigned a priori before the game starts for every node by independent coin tosses and then the game is played. We investigate the complexity of computing the winning probability with three kinds of objectives-reachability, parity, and energy. We show that the qualitative questions on all variants and all objectives are NL-complete. For the quantitative questions, we show that deciding whether the maximiser can win with probability at least a given threshold for every objective is PSPACE-complete under the first mechanism, and that computing the exact winning probability for every objective is sharp-P-complete under the second. To complement our hardness results for the second mechanism, we propose randomised approximation schemes that efficiently estimate the winning probability for all three objectives, assuming a bounded number of parity colours and unary-encoded weights for energy objectives, and we empirically demonstrate their fast convergence."

    "abstract": "6D object pose estimation plays a crucial role in scene understanding for applications such as robotics and augmented reality. To support the needs of ever-changing object sets in such context, modern zero-shot object pose estimators were developed to not require object-specific training but only rely on CAD models. Such models are hard to obtain once deployed, and a continuously changing and growing set of objects makes it harder to reliably identify the instance model of interest. To address this challenge, we introduce an Open-Set CAD Retrieval from a Language Prompt and a Single Image (OSCAR), a novel training-free method that retrieves a matching object model from an unlabeled 3D object database. During onboarding, OSCAR generates multi-view renderings of database models and annotates them with descriptive captions using an image captioning model. At inference, GroundedSAM detects the queried object in the input image, and multi-modal embeddings are computed for both the Region-of-Interest and the database captions. OSCAR employs a two-stage retrieval: text-based filtering using CLIP identifies candidate models, followed by image-based refinement using DINOv2 to select the most visually similar object. In our experiments we demonstrate that OSCAR outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on the cross-domain 3D model retrieval benchmark MI3DOR. Furthermore, we demonstrate OSCAR's direct applicability in automating object model sourcing for 6D object pose estimation. We propose using the most similar object model for pose estimation if the exact instance is not available and show that OSCAR achieves an average precision of 90.48\\% during object retrieval on the YCB-V object dataset. Moreover, we demonstrate that the most similar object model can be utilized for pose estimation using Megapose achieving better results than a reconstruction-based approach."

    "abstract": "The $ρ$-posterior framework provides universal Bayesian estimation with explicit contamination rates and optimal convergence guarantees, but has remained computationally difficult due to an optimization over reference distributions that precludes intractable posterior computation. We develop a PAC-Bayesian framework that recovers these theoretical guarantees through temperature-dependent Gibbs posteriors, deriving finite-sample oracle inequalities with explicit rates and introducing tractable variational approximations that inherit the robustness properties of exact $ρ$-posteriors. Numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves theoretical contamination rates while remaining computationally feasible, providing the first practical implementation of $ρ$-posterior inference with rigorous finite-sample guarantees."

    "abstract": "We investigate the spin parity JP assignments of experimentally observed hidden charm pentaquark states within a baryon meson molecular framework. The pentaquark mass spectrum is obtained using the Gursey Radicati mass formula, with parameters fixed through a global fit to 41 experimentally established hadron masses. The resulting spectrum is then used to assign JP quantum numbers to the observed pentaquark candidates. Within this framework, the nonstrange states Pc 4312, Pc4440, and Pc 4457 are identified with the JP = 1/2, 3/2, and 5/2 configurations, respectively. The recently reported Belle state Pcs4459, which carries strangeness, is interpreted as the strange member of the SU3 flavor octet with JP = 3/2. Magnetic moments are subsequently evaluated using explicitly constructed wave functions. Their systematic behavior across SU3 flavor multiplets and different spin parity assignments satisfies the expected sum-rule relations and indicates that magnetic moments can serve as a useful observable for refining the quantum-number identification of hidden charm pentaquark states in future studies."

    "abstract": "The rapid adoption of complex Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) models has led to their characterization as black boxes due to the difficulty of explaining their internal decision-making processes. This lack of transparency hinders users' ability to understand, validate and trust model behavior, particularly in high-risk applications. Although explainable AI (XAI) has made significant progress, there remains a need for versatile and effective techniques to address increasingly complex models. This work introduces Multivariate Conditional Expectation (MUCE), a model-agnostic method for local explainability designed to capture prediction changes from feature interactions. MUCE extends Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) by exploring a multivariate grid of values in the neighborhood of a given observation at inference time, providing graphical explanations that illustrate the local evolution of model predictions. In addition, two quantitative indices, stability and uncertainty, summarize local behavior and assess model reliability. Uncertainty is further decomposed into uncertainty+ and uncertainty- to capture asymmetric effects that global measures may overlook. The proposed method is validated using XGBoost models trained on three datasets: two synthetic (2D and 3D) to evaluate behavior near decision boundaries, and one transformed real-world dataset to test adaptability to heterogeneous feature types. Results show that MUCE effectively captures complex local model behavior, while the stability and uncertainty indices provide meaningful insight into prediction confidence. MUCE, together with the ICE modification and the proposed indices, offers a practical contribution to local explainability, enabling both graphical and quantitative insights that enhance the interpretability of predictive models and support more trustworthy and transparent decision-making."

In electron microscopy, this divide limits the ability to quantify three-dimensional topography from two-dimensional projections, fundamentally constraining our understanding of nanoscale structure-function relationships. Here, we present a physics-embedded neural computational microscopy framework that achieves metrological three-dimensional reconstruction by deeply coupling a differentiable electron-optical forward model with deep learning. By introducing a Vision Field Transformer as a high-speed, differentiable surrogate for physical process analysis simulations, we establish an end-to-end, self-supervised optimization loop that enforces strict physical consistency with hardware geometry. This synergy enables single-shot, quantitative three-dimensional nanometrology with precision comparable to atomic force microscopy but at orders of magnitude higher throughput. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capability for four-dimensional (3D real space plus time) in situ characterization by tracking the dynamic evolution of surface nanostructure during copper redox, revealing hidden crystallographic kinetics invisible to conventional imaging. Our work not only redefines the limits of scanning electron microscopy but also establishes a generalizable archetype for solving ill-posed inverse problems across physical sciences, unlocking the full potential of simulation as a third pillar of discovery."

Such component-level manipulations are harder to detect, as the remaining unaltered component can mislead the systems designed for whole deepfake audio, and they often sound more natural to human listeners. To address this gap, we have proposed CompSpoofV2 dataset and a separation-enhanced joint learning framework. CompSpoofV2 is a large-scale curated dataset designed for component-level audio anti-spoofing, which contains over 250k audio samples, with a total duration of approximately 283 hours. Based on the CompSpoofV2 and the separation-enhanced joint learning framework, we launch the Environment-Aware Speech and Sound Deepfake Detection Challenge (ESDD2), focusing on component-level spoofing, where both speech and environmental sounds may be manipulated or synthesized, creating a more challenging and realistic detection scenario.

Multi-image reasoning presents fundamental challenges including complex inter-relationships between images and scattered critical information across image sets.

For cold-start training, we introduce a Retrieval-Based Tree Sampling strategy that generates high-quality meta-action trajectories to bootstrap the model with reasoning patterns. During reinforcement learning, we adopt a two-stage paradigm: an exploration phase with Diversity-Preserving Strategy to avoid entropy collapse, followed by an annealed exploitation phase with DAPO to gradually strengthen exploitation. To train our model, we construct a dataset of 57k cold-start and 58k reinforcement learning instances spanning multi-image, multi-frame, and single-image tasks. We conduct extensive evaluations on multi-image reasoning benchmarks, video understanding benchmarks, and single-image benchmarks, achieving competitive state-of-the-art performance on several key benchmarks.

While universal upper bounds on the photon sphere radius have been established for both four-dimensional and higher-dimensional black holes, the question of a corresponding lower bound in higher-dimensional black holes remains less explored. In this work, we derive a universal lower bound for the photon sphere radius in static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes of arbitrary dimension $n\\ge 4$. Under the assumptions of the weak energy condition, a non-positive trace of the energy-momentum tensor, and a monotonicity condition on the radial pressure function $|r^{n-1}p_r(r)|$, we prove that the photon sphere radius $r_γ$ satisfies $r_γ\\ge (\\frac{n-1}{2})^{1/(n-3)}r_H$, where $r_H$ is the radius of the outer event horizon. For $n=4$, this reduces to the known result $r_γ\\ge \\frac{3}{2}r_H$. Our result generalizes Hod's four-dimensional theorem to higher dimensions, and provides a new geometric constraint on the structure of black holes in extended theories of gravity."

Our framework defines causal estimands under stochastic interventions on the network structure and introduces an inverse probability weighting estimator under an unconfoundedness assumption on edge assignment. We estimate edge probabilities using exponential random graph models, a widely used class of network models. We establish consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator. Finally, we apply our methodology to China's transportation network to estimate the causal impact of railroad connections on regional economic development."

    "abstract": "In multi-hop reasoning, multi-round retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods typically rely on LLM-generated content as the retrieval query. However, these approaches are inherently vulnerable to knowledge overshadowing - a phenomenon where critical information is overshadowed during generation. As a result, the LLM-generated content may be incomplete or inaccurate, leading to irrelevant retrieval and causing error accumulation during the iteration process. To address this challenge, we propose ActiShade, which detects and activates overshadowed knowledge to guide large language models (LLMs) in multi-hop reasoning. Specifically, ActiShade iteratively detects the overshadowed keyphrase in the given query, retrieves documents relevant to both the query and the overshadowed keyphrase, and generates a new query based on the retrieved documents to guide the next-round iteration. By supplementing the overshadowed knowledge during the formulation of next-round queries while minimizing the introduction of irrelevant noise, ActiShade reduces the error accumulation caused by knowledge overshadowing. Extensive experiments show that ActiShade outperforms existing methods across multiple datasets and LLMs."

In this work, we present LaminoDiff, a framework to integrate a diffusion model with a high-fidelity prior representation to bridge the domain gap in CL imaging. This prior, generated via a dual-modal CT-CL fusion strategy, is integrated into the proposed network as a conditional constraint. This integration ensures high-precision preservation of circuit structures and geometric fidelity while suppressing artifacts.

This novel design ensures theoretical causal consistency while adaptively focusing on the most salient historical information, overcoming the rigidity of traditional masking techniques. Second, our architecture features a dual-expert system that decouples the modeling of temporal dynamics and cross-variable correlations into parallel, specialized pathways, which are then intelligently integrated through a dynamic gated fusion module.

This effect was called the new Visniac flux (hereafter the NV flux). Similarly to the $α$ effect, the NV flux is able to maintain the large-scale turbulent dynamo. 2) Methods:Using the mean-field dynamo model we study the effect of the NV flux on the solar type dynamos. We found that the NV flux results to a increase of the dynamo efficiency for the turbulent generation of the large-scale poloidal magnetic field of the Sun. The dynamic effect of the NV flux on the magnetic field evolution results into concentrating the dynamo waves toward the equator. Using the numerical simulations of the mean-field dynamo model we compare the helicity production rates by the turbulent dynamo effects, like the $α$ effect and the NV flux. We found that the new dynamo source can produce the large-scale dynamo even if the kinetic $α$ effect is zero.3) Conclusions:The new findings suggest the crucial role of the large-scale vorticity and fluctuating magnetic field in the large-scale dynamo inside the stellar convection zones."

We propose FLoReNce, an agentic feedback reasoning framework that treats meme understanding as a closed-loop process during learning and an open-loop process during inference. In the closed loop, a reasoning agent is critiqued by a judge; the error and semantic feedback are converted into control signals and stored in a feedback-informed, non-parametric knowledge base. At inference, the model retrieves similar judged experiences from this KB and uses them to modulate its prompt, enabling better, self-aligned reasoning without finetuning. On the PrideMM dataset, FLoReNce improves both predictive performance and explanation quality over static multimodal baselines, showing that feedback-regulated prompting is a viable path to adaptive meme humor understanding."

This comparison identifies aspects that are either unusually emphasized or missing relative to domain norms and integrates them into the generated text. In a user study across three accommodation domains, namely ski, beach, and city center, DiSCo summaries were rated as more detailed and useful for decision making than baseline large language model summaries, although slightly harder to read. The findings show that modeling expectations reduces presence bias and improves both transparency and decision support in intelligent summarization interfaces."

Subsequently, Gordillo and Puebla pointed out that simulation results depend on whether the state space in the simulations is even or odd [2]. Using additional derivations, they argued that the oscillatory dynamics is unphysical and that the photon number must increase monotonically as a function of the squeezing parameter $r$. We agree with the observation of an even-odd parity dependence in the simulations. We independently noticed the same feature in our simulations after the publication of Ref. [1]. This observation led us to perform a more detailed investigation of the numerical simulation and mathematical aspects of the generalized squeezing problem. Our new findings were reported in Ref. [3]. Further analysis was reported in Ref. [4]. Our conclusion is that the generalized squeezing operator is physically not well defined but can be made well defined when combined with additional information about the physical system under study. We demonstrated this point in the case where we include an additional nonlinear interaction term in the Hamiltonian. We disagree with the claim that the photon number must be a monotonically increasing function of $r$. This claim contradicts the mathematically rigorous results of Ref. [4]. Furthermore, we show that the oscillatory behaviour persists in two closely related, well-behaved models."

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art text-based image editing models often struggle to balance background preservation with semantic consistency, frequently resulting either in the synthesis of entirely new images or in outputs that fail to realize the intended edits. In contrast, scene graph-based image editing addresses this limitation by providing a structured representation of semantic entities and their relations, thereby offering improved controllability. However, existing scene graph editing methods typically depend on model fine-tuning, which incurs high computational cost and limits scalability. To this end, we introduce VENUS (Visual Editing with Noise inversion Using Scene graphs), a training-free framework for scene graph-guided image editing. Specifically, VENUS employs a split prompt conditioning strategy that disentangles the target object of the edit from its background context, while simultaneously leveraging noise inversion to preserve fidelity in unedited regions. Moreover, our proposed approach integrates scene graphs extracted from multimodal large language models with diffusion backbones, without requiring any additional training. Empirically, VENUS substantially improves both background preservation and semantic alignment on PIE-Bench, increasing PSNR from 22.45 to 24.80, SSIM from 0.79 to 0.84, and reducing LPIPS from 0.100 to 0.070 relative to the state-of-the-art scene graph editing model (SGEdit). In addition, VENUS enhances semantic consistency as measured by CLIP similarity (24.97 vs. 24.19). On EditVal, VENUS achieves the highest fidelity with a 0.87 DINO score and, crucially, reduces per-image runtime from 6-10 minutes to only 20-30 seconds. Beyond scene graph-based editing, VENUS also surpasses strong text-based editing baselines such as LEDIT++ and P2P+DirInv, thereby demonstrating consistent improvements across both paradigms."

In this paper, we explore how to implement unlearning under the condition of not uncovering the erasing data to the server. We propose \\textbf{Blind Unlearning (BlindU)}, which carries out unlearning using compressed representations instead of original inputs. BlindU only involves the server and the unlearning user: the user locally generates privacy-preserving representations, and the server performs unlearning solely on these representations and their labels. For the FL model training, we employ the information bottleneck (IB) mechanism. The encoder of the IB-based FL model learns representations that distort maximum task-irrelevant information from inputs, allowing FL users to generate compressed representations locally. For effective unlearning using compressed representation, BlindU integrates two dedicated unlearning modules tailored explicitly for IB-based models and uses a multiple gradient descent algorithm to balance forgetting and utility retaining. While IB compression already provides protection for task-irrelevant information of inputs, to further enhance the privacy protection, we introduce a noise-free differential privacy (DP) masking method to deal with the raw erasing data before compressing. Theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results illustrate the superiority of BlindU in privacy protection and unlearning effectiveness compared with the best existing privacy-preserving unlearning benchmarks."

    "abstract": "The plasma discharges in ADITYA Upgrade Tokamak are produced by means of transformer action, in which Ohmically created plasma is driven by means of a secondary loop voltage. Due to reduction of plasma resistivity after a certain level of plasma temperature, Ohmic heating becomes poor and further achievement of temperature needs other heating techniques. ADITYA-U tokamak is facilitated with a 42 GHz-500 kW Electron Cyclotron Resonant Heating (ECRH) system. Also, there is a Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD) system installed and operated at 3.7 GHz for driving non-inductive plasma current followed by the Ohmic current drive. Though an eventual impact in the rise of plasma temperature and plasma current due to the application of ECRH and LHCD respectively are very obvious, their energy coupling with the plasma results in several interesting outcomes in a number of experimentally measured plasma parameters. The present work addresses such impactful observations that are noticed and reported for the first time in ADITYA-U Tokamak."

    "abstract": "Einstein-bumblebee gravity, as a class of massive non-minimally coupled vector-tensor theories, provides a useful framework for constraining Lorentz symmetry breaking through astrophysical observations, largely due to the existence of exact static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions. These solutions are typically obtained under the assumption that the vector-field potential vanishes everywhere once the vector field acquires a nonzero radial vacuum expectation value. However, imposing this assumption globally obstructs the construction of self-consistent compact-star solutions. In this work, we elucidate the origin of this inconsistency through a detailed analysis of the field equations and construct neutron-star configurations by abandoning the global vanishing-potential assumption. Crucially, we show that even without enforcing this condition everywhere, it is violated only in the strong-field interior region and is dynamically restored in the weak-field regime by asymptotic boundary conditions at spatial infinity. As a result, consistency with existing black-hole solutions and observational constraints is preserved. Our results establish massive vector-tensor gravity as a unified, natural, and self-consistent framework for compact objects, significantly extending its astrophysical viability beyond black holes and Solar System tests."

However, current GraphRAG methods are constrained by a prevailing \\textit{build-then-reason} paradigm, which relies on a static, pre-constructed Knowledge Graph (KG). This paradigm faces two critical challenges. First, the KG's inherent incompleteness often breaks reasoning paths. Second, the graph's low signal-to-noise ratio introduces distractor facts, presenting query-relevant but misleading knowledge that disrupts the reasoning process. To address these challenges, we argue for a \\textit{reason-and-construct} paradigm and propose Relink, a framework that dynamically builds a query-specific evidence graph. To tackle incompleteness, \\textbf{Relink} instantiates required facts from a latent relation pool derived from the original text corpus, repairing broken paths on the fly. To handle misleading or distractor facts, Relink employs a unified, query-aware evaluation strategy that jointly considers candidates from both the KG and latent relations, selecting those most useful for answering the query rather than relying on their pre-existence. This empowers Relink to actively discard distractor facts and construct the most faithful and precise evidence path for each query. Extensive experiments on five Open-Domain Question Answering benchmarks show that Relink achieves significant average improvements of 5.4\\% in EM and 5.2\\% in F1 over leading GraphRAG baselines, demonstrating the superiority of our proposed framework."

By linking the AAPM membership database with NIH RePORTER records, we quantified the distribution of NIH funding for projects led by AAPM researchers. Although total NIH funding to AAPM members remained relatively stable across the two years, the composition of that funding shifted substantially. Competing (new and renewal) awards declined 50%, driven largely by an 80% collapse in new R01 grants from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). In contrast, noncompeting continuation awards increased by 10%, following a shift in how NIH funds multi-year projects. These changes occurred in the context of widespread disruptions to NIH review and grantmaking, including delayed study sections and more stringent administrative requirements. Federal funding is essential to sustaining innovation, supporting early-stage investigators, and ensuring that patients receive the best possible care. The trends identified here raise concerns about the long-term vitality and stability of the medical physics research pipeline."

Our framework includes four key components: A recorder that captures screen video along with precise user interactions like mouse clicks, keystrokes, and scrolls. A learner that semantically interprets these raw interactions and the surrounding visual context, translating them into descriptive natural language captions. A planner that reads the parsed demonstrations, maintains task states, and dynamically formulates the next high-level action plan based on contextual reasoning. An executor that faithfully carries out these action plans at the OS level, performing precise clicks, drags, text inputs, and window operations with safety checks and real-time feedback. Together, these components provide a scalable solution for collecting and parsing real-world human data, demonstrating a viable path toward building general-purpose GUI agents that can learn effectively from simply observing humans."

    "abstract": "Offline meta-reinforcement learning (OMRL) combines the strengths of learning from diverse datasets in offline RL with the adaptability to new tasks of meta-RL, promising safe and efficient knowledge acquisition by RL agents. However, OMRL still suffers extrapolation errors due to out-of-distribution (OOD) actions, compromised by broad task distributions and Markov Decision Process (MDP) ambiguity in meta-RL setups. Existing research indicates that the generalization of the $Q$ network affects the extrapolation error in offline RL. This paper investigates this relationship by decomposing the $Q$ value into feature and weight components, observing that while decomposition enhances adaptability and convergence in the case of high-quality data, it often leads to policy degeneration or collapse in complex tasks. We observe that decomposed $Q$ values introduce a large estimation bias when the feature encounters OOD samples, a phenomenon we term ''feature overgeneralization''. To address this issue, we propose FLORA, which identifies OOD samples by modeling feature distributions and estimating their uncertainties. FLORA integrates a return feedback mechanism to adaptively adjust feature components. Furthermore, to learn precise task representations, FLORA explicitly models the complex task distribution using a chain of invertible transformations. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that FLORA achieves rapid adaptation and meta-policy improvement compared to baselines across various environments."

However, unlocking their full potential requires developing high-performance compute kernels using vendor-specific Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs), a task that demands deep hardware expertise and is labor-intensive. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in general code generation, they struggle with the strict constraints and scarcity of training data in the NPU domain. Our preliminary study reveals that state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs fail to generate functional complex kernels for Ascend NPUs, yielding a near-zero success rate. To address these challenges, we propose AscendKernelGen, a generation-evaluation integrated framework for NPU kernel development. We introduce Ascend-CoT, a high-quality dataset incorporating chain-of-thought reasoning derived from real-world kernel implementations, and KernelGen-LM, a domain-adaptive model trained via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with execution feedback. Furthermore, we design NPUKernelBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing compilation, correctness, and performance across varying complexity levels. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly bridges the gap between general LLMs and hardware-specific coding. Specifically, the compilation success rate on complex Level-2 kernels improves from 0% to 95.5% (Pass@10), while functional correctness achieves 64.3% compared to the baseline's complete failure. These results highlight the critical role of domain-specific reasoning and rigorous evaluation in automating accelerator-aware code generation."

We introduce a novel matrix Lie group structure, denoted SE_{3+n}(3), that unifies the pose, gravity, linear velocity, and landmark positions within a consistent geometric framework tailored to the VIO problem. Building upon this formulation, we design an almost globally asymptotically stable nonlinear geometric observer that tightly integrates data from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and visual sensors. Unlike conventional Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)-based estimators that rely on local linearization and thus ensure only local convergence, the proposed observer achieves almost global stability through the decoupling of the rotational and translational dynamics. A globally exponentially stable Riccati-based translational observer along with an almost global input-to-state stable attitude observer are designed such that the overall cascaded observer enjoys almost global asymptotic stability. This cascaded architecture guarantees robust and consistent estimation of the extended state, including orientation, position, velocity, gravity, and landmark positions, up to the VIO unobservable directions (i.e., a global translation and rotation about gravity). The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through numerical simulations as well as experimental validation on the EuRoC MAV dataset, highlighting its robustness and suitability for real-world VIO applications."

First, we develop a Generative Reward Model (GenRM) that provides multi-dimensional analysis and explicit reasoning about story preferences, trained through supervised fine-tuning on demonstrations with reasoning chains distilled from strong teacher models, followed by GRPO-based refinement on expanded preference data. Second, we introduce an entropy-based reward shaping strategy that dynamically prioritizes learning on confident errors and uncertain correct predictions, preventing overfitting on already-mastered patterns. Experiments demonstrate that GenRM achieves 68\\% alignment with human creativity judgments, and RLCS significantly outperforms strong baselines including Gemini-2.5-Pro in overall story quality.

We first propose \\texttt{FairSinkhorn}, a modified Sinkhorn algorithm to compute perfectly fair transport plans efficiently. Since exact fairness can significantly degrade matching quality in practice, we then develop two relaxation strategies. The first one involves solving a penalised OT problem, for which we derive novel finite-sample complexity guarantees. This result is of independent interest as it can be generalized to arbitrary convex penalties. Our second strategy leverages bilevel optimization to learn a ground cost that induces a fair OT solution, and we establish a bound guaranteeing that the learned cost yields fair matchings on unseen data. Finally, we present empirical results that illustrate the trade-offs between fairness and performance."

Our algorithms use ideas from Stepanov's polynomial method proof of the classical Weil bounds on character sums, as well as from the Berlekamp-Welch decoding algorithm for Reed-Solomon codes. A crucial role is played by what we call *pseudopolynomials*: high degree polynomials, all of whose derivatives behave like low degree polynomials on ${\\mathbb F}_q$.

Neuromorphic computing offers a compelling alternative, and combined with a desire for data-driven methods, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising real-time power-efficient alternative. Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) detection is an attractive use-case for SNNs where recent exploration holds promise. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of the potential impact of deploying varying neuromorphic approaches across key stages in radio astronomy processing pipelines for several existing and near-term instruments. Our analysis paves a realistic path from near-term FPGA deployment of SNNs in existing instruments, allowing the addition of advanced data-driven RFI detection for no capital cost, to neuromorphic ASICs for future instruments, finding that commercially available solutions could reduce the power budget for key processing elements by up to three orders of magnitude, transforming the operational budget of the observatory.

The tool to determine the optimal value of TSH and FT4 is the Hypothalamus-Pituitary (HP) curve. These curves are models of thyroid hormone concentrations that can be used to determine patient-specific treatment strategies for individuals with hypothyroidism. By generating an HP curve for an individual with hypothyroidism, a set point is determined that represents the optimal levels of thyroid hormones in the blood. A graphical method for set point determination is proposed. A physician can then prescribe a thyroid replacement strategy to achieve this set point. In this paper, two methods for generating HP curves are proposed using non-linear programming solvers and compared with the existing methods.

    "abstract": "Structural vibration testing plays a key role in aerospace engineering for evaluating dynamic behaviour, ensuring reliability and verifying structural integrity. These tests rely on accurate and robust data acquisition systems (DAQ) to capture high-quality acceleration data. However, commercial DAQs that provide the required performance and features are often expensive and complex, limiting their accessibility for small-scale research and experimental applications. This work presents the design and experimental validation of an affordable and in-house-developed acceleration DAQ, tested on a small fixed-wing UAV through several Taxi Vibration Test (TVT) runs and ambient vibration measurements. The proposed system integrates several OrangePi 3 LTS single-board computers with multiple LSM6DS3TR-C MEMS inertial measurement units operating simultaneously via an Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) communication interface, managed under a Python-based master/slave architecture. Data is acquired at a stable sampling rate of approximately 208 Hz and post-processed using Welch's method to estimate their Power Spectral Density (PSD). Results confirm the system ability to provide consistent multi-sensor acceleration data and repeatable PSD profiles under the same test conditions; thus, demonstrating its reliability. With a total hardware cost below 600 EUR (approximately 690 USD), the developed DAQ offers a compact, scalable and cost-effective alternative for aerospace vibration analysis and structural testing."

    "abstract": "Magnetic proximity effects in Co/hBN/graphene heterostructures are systematically analyzed via first-principles calculations, demonstrating a pronounced localized spatial variation of the induced spin polarization of graphene's Dirac states. The proximity-induced exchange coupling, magnetic moments, and tunneling spin polarization (TSP) are shown to depend sensitively on the atomic registry at the interfaces. We analyze more than twenty distinct stackings, including high- and low-symmetry configurations, and reveal that the spin splittings of graphene's Dirac bands span a wide range from 1 to 100 meV, depending on the local hybridization of Co $d_{z^2}$, hBN $p_z$, and graphene $p_z$ orbitals. The strongest proximity effects emerge at geometric resonances, or \"proximity hot spots\", where the three orbital states overlap maximally. The local spin polarization also depends sensitively on energy: Dirac states aligned with resonant Co orbitals experience the most pronounced exchange interaction. At these energies, the pseudospin Hamiltonian description of magnetic proximity effects breaks down. Outside these resonances, the pseudospin picture is restored. Our findings highlight the intrinsically local nature of proximity effects, governed by the spectral resonance and interlayer wavefunction overlap. We further quantify how additional hBN layers, interlayer twist, and multilayer graphene modify the proximity exchange and TSP, offering microscopic insight for designing spintronic van der Waals heterostructures with engineered interfaces and optimized spin transport."

In case of a detection, it will be crucial to distinguish the possible sources of this GWB. One under-explored possibility is to exploit the duty cycle that quantifies the number of sources present in the time domain signal, which can be very different depending on the nature and population of the sources. We compute the duty cycle for a realistic population of PBH binaries, isolating the shot-noise, popcorn and continuous contributions to the GWB. We identify the dependence of the duty cycle on the signal frequency, duration and amplitude as a crucial metric for distinguishing PBHs from other sources in the GWB and constraining PBH models. Our work motivates the development of specific analysis tools to extract these observables, in order to unlock new cosmological insights with upcoming GW data."

We construct the first examples of such Lorentzian quasicrystals (the spacetime analogues of the Penrose or Ammann-Beenker tilings), and point out key novel features of these structures (compared to their Euclidean cousins). We end with some (speculative) ideas about how such spacetime quasicrystals might relate to reality. This includes an intriguing scenario in which our infinite $(3+1)$D universe is embedded (like one of our spacetime quasicrystal examples) in a particularly symmetric $(9+1)$D torus $T^{9,1}$ (which was previously found to yield the most symmetric toroidal compactification of the superstring).

    "abstract": "Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have shown strong potential for efficiently approximating complex nonlinear functions. However, the original KAN formulation relies on B-spline basis functions, which incur substantial computational overhead due to De Boor's algorithm. To address this limitation, recent work has explored alternative basis functions such as radial basis functions (RBFs) that can improve computational efficiency and flexibility. Yet, standard RBF-KANs often sacrifice accuracy relative to the original KAN design. In this work, we propose Free-RBF-KAN, a RBF-based KAN architecture that incorporates adaptive learning grids and trainable smoothness to close this performance gap. Our method employs freely learnable RBF shapes that dynamically align grid representations with activation patterns, enabling expressive and adaptive function approximation. Additionally, we treat smoothness as a kernel parameter optimized jointly with network weights, without increasing computational complexity. We provide a general universality proof for RBF-KANs, which encompasses our Free-RBF-KAN formulation. Through a broad set of experiments, including multiscale function approximation, physics-informed machine learning, and PDE solution operator learning, Free-RBF-KAN achieves accuracy comparable to the original B-spline-based KAN while delivering faster training and inference. These results highlight Free-RBF-KAN as a compelling balance between computational efficiency and adaptive resolution, particularly for high-dimensional structured modeling tasks."

However, performance can drop considerably when there is a shift in the distribution of data from training to test time. We study this phenomenon in a setting in which the training data come from multiple domains, and the test data come from a domain not seen at training that is subject to significant covariate shift. We present a new method for contrastive learning that incorporates domain labels to increase the domain invariance of learned representations, leading to improved out-of-distribution generalization. Our method adjusts the temperature parameter in the InfoNCE loss -- which controls the relative weighting of negative pairs -- using the probability that a negative sample comes from the same domain as the anchor. This upweights pairs from more similar domains, encouraging the model to discriminate samples based on domain-invariant attributes. Through experiments on a variant of the MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that our method yields better out-of-distribution performance than domain generalization baselines. Furthermore, our method maintains strong in-distribution task performance, substantially outperforming baselines on this measure."

In the first paper in this series, we considered operators with transversal inter sections of bicharacteristics. Now we study operators with tangential in tersections of bicharacteristics, as well as with double characteristics for p. We put the pseudodifferential operator on normal form microlocally, and use a model operator, P(h) to test for quasimodes. We demonstrate two cases where this happens. We shall also continue with more advanced cases, when the operators are factorable to P(h) = P2(h)P1(h,B), thus annihilating the subprincipal control over the quasimodes."

We introduce phonon fine-tuning (PFT), which directly supervises second-order force constants of materials by matching MLIP energy Hessians to DFT-computed force constants from finite displacement phonon calculations. To scale to large supercells, PFT stochastically samples Hessian columns and computes the loss with a single Hessian-vector product. We also use a simple co-training scheme to incorporate upstream data to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. On the MDR Phonon benchmark, PFT improves Nequix MP (trained on Materials Project) by 55% on average across phonon thermodynamic properties and achieves state-of-the-art performance among models trained on Materials Project trajectories. PFT also generalizes to improve properties beyond second-derivatives, improving thermal conductivity predictions that rely on third-order derivatives of the potential energy."

The images are rendered using a physically based ray tracing code that has been specifically developed to use the standard calibration coefficients of any camera directly. The software reproduces image distortions, defocus and diffraction blur. Furthermore, sub-pixel sampling is applied to sharp edges to enhance the fidelity of the rendered image. After introducing the rendering algorithm and its experimental validation, the paper proposes a method for evaluating the pose accuracy.

The analysis focuses on the posterior distributions of crust properties, constrained by nuclear experimental data, chiral effective field theory, and multimessenger neutron-star observations. In the inference, the outer crust is fixed using the AME2020 nuclear mass table, supplemented by Hartree--Fock--Bogoliubov mass models, while the inner crust is described using a compressible liquid-drop model consistently coupled to the RMF interaction. The same RMF framework is used to describe the uniform core, ensuring a unified treatment across all density regimes. From the resulting posteriors, we extract key crustal observables, including the crust--core transition density and pressure, crust thickness, crust mass, and the fractional crustal moment of inertia. We find that the transition density is primarily governed by the symmetry-energy slope $L$ and curvature $K_{\\rm sym}$ evaluated at sub-saturation densities, while the transition pressure plays a central role in determining global crustal properties. The inner-crust equation of state reflects a collective interplay between isovector nuclear-matter properties rather than a dependence on any single parameter. We also assess the impact of using matched crust--core constructions and show that they can introduce systematic differences in predicted neutron-star properties when compared with fully unified treatments."

By comparing the Ni-$L$ edge spectra to single and double cluster ligand-field calculations, we find that none of our samples exhibit a pure $d^9$ configuration. Our quantitative analysis using the charge sum rule shows that even when films are maximally reduced, the averaged number of nickel $3d$ holes is 1.35. Superconducting samples have even higher values, calling into question the previously assumed limit of hole doping. Concomitant changes in the oxygen $K$-edge absorption spectra upon reduction indicate the presence of oxygen $2p$ holes, even in the most reduced films.

Using snapshots of the North Carolina Voter Registry (Oct 2011-Oct 2022), we derived empirical name-discrepancy profiles to parameterise realistic corruptions. From an Oct 2022 extract (n=848,566), we generated five replicate corrupted datasets under three settings that separately varied mechanism heterogeneity and exposure inequality, and linked records back to originals using unadjusted Jaro-Winkler, Term Frequency (TF)-adjusted Jaro-Winkler, and a cluster-based forename-embedding comparator combined with TF-adjusted surname comparison. We evaluated false match rate (FMR), missed match rate (MMR) and white-centric disparities. At a fixed MMR near 0.20, overall error rates and ethnic disparities diverged substantially by model under disproportionate exposure to corruption. Term-frequency (TF)-adjusted Jaro-Winkler achieved very low overall FMR (0.55% (95% CI 0.54-0.57)) at overall MMR 20.34% (20.30-20.39), but large white-centric under-linkage disparities persisted: Hispanic voters had 36.3% (36.1-36.6) and Non-Hispanic Black voters 8.6% (8.6-8.7) higher FMRs compared to Non-Hispanic White groups. Relative to unadjusted string similarity, TF adjustment reduced these disparities (Hispanic: +60.4% (60.1-60.7) to +36.3%; Black: +13.1% (13.0-13.2) to +8.6%). The cluster-based forename-embedding model reduced missed-match disparities further (Hispanic: +10.2% (9.8-10.3); Black: +0.6% (0.4-0.7)), but at a cost of increasing overall FMR (4.28% (4.22-4.35)) at the same threshold. Unequal exposure to identifier error drove substantially larger disparities than mechanism heterogeneity alone; cluster-based embeddings markedly narrowed under-linkage disparities beyond TF adjustment."

    "abstract": "Due to their radiation hardness, kilohertz frame rates, and high dynamic range, hybrid pixel detectors have recently expanded their application range to electron diffraction and recently also electron imaging. However, these detectors typically have pixel sizes about ten times larger than those of direct electron detectors commonly used for imaging and more prominent electron multiple scattering effects. To overcome these limitations, machine learning approaches can be utilized to reconstruct the electron entrance point and achieve super-resolution. As this process is inherently stochastic, and machine learning relies on suitable training data, high-quality, representative training data are essential for developing models that achieve the best possible resolution. In this work, we present two novel experimental methods for generating such training data. The first method employs precise microscope alignment to scan the detector plane using a finely focused electron beam of 2 μm diameter, enabling controlled sub-pixel mapping. The second method utilizes specially designed aperture masks with sub-pixel-sized holes to accurately localize electron entry points. We developed and validated two experimental strategies for collecting training data at acceleration voltages of 60, 80, 120, and 200 keV, which enable sub-pixel labeling for hybrid pixel detectors. Notably, our methodology is broadly applicable to a wide range of hybrid pixel detectors."

A simplification of the system is used to recover existence results for Kähler-Einstein metrics when $c_1(X) < 0$.

    "abstract": "Given a c-colored graph G, a vertex of G is happy if it has the same color as all its neighbors. The notion of happy vertices was introduced by Zhang and Li to compute the homophily of a graph. Eto, et al. introduced the Maker-Maker version of the Happy vertex game, where two players compete to claim more happy vertices than their opponent. We introduce here the Maker-Breaker happy vertex game: two players, Maker and Breaker, alternately color the vertices of a graph with their respective colors. Maker aims to maximize the number of happy vertices at the end, while Breaker aims to prevent her. This game is also a scoring version of the Maker-Breaker Domination game introduced by Duchene, et al. as a happy vertex corresponds exactly to a vertex that is not dominated in the domination game. Therefore, this game is a very natural game on graphs and can be studied within the scope of scoring positional games. We initiate here the complexity study of this game, by proving that computing its score is PSPACE-complete on trees, NP-hard on caterpillars, and polynomial on subdivided stars. Finally, we provide the exact value of the score on graphs of maximum degree 2, and we provide an FPT-algorithm to compute the score on graphs of bounded neighborhood diversity. An important contribution of the paper is that, to achieve our hardness results, we introduce a new type of incidence graph called the literal-clause incidence graph for 2-SAT formulas. We prove that QMAX 2-SAT remains PSPACE-complete even if this graph is acyclic, and that MAX 2-SAT remains NP-complete, even if this graph is acyclic and has maximum degree 2, i.e. is a union of paths. We demonstrate the importance of this contribution by proving that Incidence, the scoring positional game played on a graph is also PSPACE-complete when restricted to forests."

    "abstract": "In recent years, self-supervised representation learning for skeleton-based action recognition has advanced with the development of contrastive learning methods. However, most of contrastive paradigms are inherently discriminative and often struggle to capture the variability and uncertainty intrinsic to human motion. To address this issue, we propose a variational contrastive learning framework that integrates probabilistic latent modeling with contrastive self-supervised learning. This formulation enables the learning of structured and semantically meaningful representations that generalize across different datasets and supervision levels. Extensive experiments on three widely used skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks show that our proposed method consistently outperforms existing approaches, particularly in low-label regimes. Moreover, qualitative analyses show that the features provided by our method are more relevant given the motion and sample characteristics, with more focus on important skeleton joints, when compared to the other methods."

    "abstract": "The Lifshitz formula and methods of its preparation in the literature are considered. It is shown that in Lifshitz's work itself, this formula is given without a consistent conclusion. Moreover, the approach to the conclusion proposed in this work does not allow us to obtain it. The most general conclusion of this formula can be the method proposed by Levin and Rytov, the variation method of Schwinger and the method proposed by Van Kampen and co-authors. The Levin and Rytov approach is applicable in principle to bodies of arbitrary shape if the diffraction loss fields for electric and magnetic dipoles are determined, while the Van Kampen approach is applicable to any plane-layered structure and is quite simple. It is enough to write down the dispersion equations of the plasmon-polaritone structure. The specific dispersion force for a number of structures is calculated based on the Van Kampen method. It is shown that at small gaps, the force (pressure) density changes the inverse fourth-degree dependence on the distance and practically ceases to depend on it at distances less than 1 nm. For thin identical plates, this density is proportional to the square of their thickness at such distances, but the dependence quickly becomes saturated and already at thicknesses of the order of 10 nm practically ceases to depend on it."

Existing 3D generative methods often produce monolithic meshes that lack the structural flexibility required by industrial pipelines in gaming and animation. Addressing this gap, StdGEN++ is built upon a Dual-branch Semantic-aware Large Reconstruction Model (Dual-Branch S-LRM), which jointly reconstructs geometry, color, and per-component semantics in a feed-forward manner. To achieve production-level fidelity, we introduce a novel semantic surface extraction formalism compatible with hybrid implicit fields. This mechanism is accelerated by a coarse-to-fine proposal scheme, which significantly reduces memory footprint and enables high-resolution mesh generation. Furthermore, we propose a video-diffusion-based texture decomposition module that disentangles appearance into editable layers (e.g., separated iris and skin), resolving semantic confusion in facial regions. Experiments demonstrate that StdGEN++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods in geometric accuracy and semantic disentanglement. Crucially, the resulting structural independence unlocks advanced downstream capabilities, including non-destructive editing, physics-compliant animation, and gaze tracking, making it a robust solution for automated character asset production."

We considered relativistic corrections to the thermal SZ signal and implemented X-ray absorption by Galactic molecular hydrogen. The $η_T$ distribution has a mean of $1.01 \\pm 0.03$, with average changes of $8.1\\%$ and $2.7\\%$ when relativistic corrections and molecular hydrogen absorption are not included, respectively. The $η_T$ distribution is positively skewed, with the scatter mostly affected by cluster morphology: relaxed clusters are closer to unity and less scattered than mixed and disturbed systems.

In this work, we perform first-principles numerical simulations using the gyrokinetic, electromagnetic, global code ORB5 to study the effect of a self-consistent finite $β$ equilibrium on the arising Alfvén Eigenmodes (destabilized by EPs), Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG), and Kinetic Ballooning Modes (KBM) microturbulence (destabilized by thermal species). Linearly, we explore the complex interplay between EP fraction, bulk gradients and a self-consistent Shafranov shift on the plasma stability. We choose single toroidal mode numbers to represent the system's instabilities and study the characteristic nonlinear evolutions of TAEs, KBMs and ITGs separately and including the axisymmetric field response to each mode separately. This study focuses on the impact of Shafranov shift equilibrium consistency, as well as the self-generated zonal ${E \\times B}$ flows, the saturation levels and resulting heat and particle fluxes. In the ITG cases including the $n=0$ perturbations reduces turbulent fluxes, as expected, however, for the TAE cases including the $n=0$ perturbations is shown to enhance the fluxes. We show for the first time that Axisymmetric Alfvén Eigenmodes (AAEs) play a role in this mechanism."

To address these challenges, we propose FLAD, a novel optimization framework that decomposes sharpness-aware perturbations into gradient-aligned and stochastic-noise components, and show that retaining only the noise component promotes generalization. We further introduce a lightweight scheduling scheme that enables FLAD to maintain significant performance gains even under constrained training time. FLAD can be seamlessly integrated into various CL paradigms and consistently outperforms standard and sharpness-aware optimizers in diverse experimental settings, demonstrating its effectiveness and practicality in CL."

In this paper, we present the Hopfield model as a pedagogically rich framework that naturally unifies core topics from undergraduate statistical physics, dynamical systems, linear algebra, and computational methods. We provide a concise and illustrated theoretical introduction grounded in familiar physics concepts, analyze the model's energy function, dynamics, and pattern stability, and discuss practical aspects of simulation, including a freely available simulation code. To support instruction, we conclude with classroom-ready example problems designed to mirror research practice.

These issues clearly point out one of the key challenges for medical AI development: Mak-ing reasonable predictions based on very small data sets and accounting for variation between different patient populations, a task where conventional deep learning methods typically perform poorly. We present Physiological State Reconstruc-tion (PSR), a new algorithm specifically designed to take ad-vantage of dynamic changes between individuals and to max-imize useful information produced by small amounts of clini-cal data through mapping to reliable predictions and diagnosis. We develop MDFE to facilitate integration of varied temporal signals using multi-domain learning, and jointly learn high-level temporal interactions together with attentions via HLA; furthermore, the parameterized DAM we designed maintains the stability of the computed vital signs. PSR evaluates with 4 TEG-specialized data sets and establishes remarkable perfor-mance -- predictions of R2 > 0.98 for coagulation traits and error reduction around half compared to the state-of-the-art methods, and halving the inferencing time too.

This makes it possible to consider the production system as an open thermodynamic system, and to develop a simple heuristic model for the production process. The model includes three production factors: the index of complexity of production equipment (physical capital $K$), human activity (labour $L$), and the substitutive capacity of equipment (substitutive work $P$). The latter is a contribution to economic theory from the thermodynamic approach, which also requires the introduction of technological characteristics of production equipment, such as labor requirement ($\\overlineλ$) and energy requirement ($\\overline{\\varepsilon}$), which indicate the amounts of labor and energy required to operate production equipment. By applying thermodynamic principles to the theory of production, we can understand how labour can be replaced by capital, and derive the production function in four equivalent but different formulations. Two of them are known and used by economists for interpretation the production phenomena; the thermodynamic approach gives some foundation for economic theory. The production function allows an unambiguously decompose of the growth rate of output according to the growth rates of production factors and technological level. The introduction of substitute work as a factor of production and technological features of capital expands planning and analyse of production processes."

Many multi-agent systems simulate human roles at a surface level, missing the underlying criteria that lead experts to assess complementary intellectual aspects of a paper. Moreover, prior methods implicitly assume identified weaknesses are valid, ignoring reviewer bias, misunderstanding, and the critical role of author rebuttals in validating review quality. Finally, most systems output unranked weakness lists, rather than prioritizing the most consequential issues for users. In this work, we propose DIAGPaper, a novel multi-agent framework that addresses these challenges through three tightly integrated modules. The customizer module simulates human-defined review criteria and instantiates multiple reviewer agents with criterion-specific expertise. The rebuttal module introduces author agents that engage in structured debate with reviewer agents to validate and refine proposed weaknesses. The prioritizer module learns from large-scale human review practices to assess the severity of validated weaknesses and surfaces the top-K severest ones to users. Experiments on two benchmarks, AAAR and ReviewCritique, demonstrate that DIAGPaper substantially outperforms existing methods by producing more valid and more paper-specific weaknesses, while presenting them in a user-oriented, prioritized manner."

First, we introduce a UV-guided avatar modeling strategy, in which each input image is associated with a pixel-wise facial correspondence estimation. Such correspondence estimation allows us to reproject each valid pixel color from screen space to UV space, which is independent of camera pose and character expression. Furthermore, we design learnable UV tokens on which the attention mechanism can be applied at both the screen and UV levels. The learned UV tokens can be decoded into canonical Gaussian attributes using aggregated UV information from all input views. To train our large avatar model, we additionally prepare a large-scale, identity-rich synthetic training dataset.

We address this using velocity centiles, which directly map change over time and can be overlaid onto cross-sectionally derived population centiles. We demonstrate this by modelling rates of change for 24062 scans from 10795 healthy individuals with up to 8 longitudinal measurements across the lifespan. We provide a method to detect individual deviations from a stable trajectory, generalising the notion of thrive lines, which are used in pediatric medicine to declare failure to thrive. Using this approach, we predict transition from mild cognitive impairment to dementia more accurately than by using either time point alone, replicated across two datasets. Last, by taking into account multiple time points, we improve the sensitivity of velocity models for predicting the future trajectory of brain change. This highlights the value of predicting change over time and makes a fundamental step towards precision medicine."

Starting from MAXI J1820+070, we examine the multi-wavelength observations and find that efficient particle acceleration may take place (i.e. into a robust power-law), up to $\\sim2\\times 10^{16}μ^{-1/2}$ eV, where $μ$ is the ratio of particle energy to magnetic energy.

While existing memory mechanisms offer basic storage and retrieval capabilities, they are hindered by two primary limitations: (1) rigid memory granularity often disrupts semantic integrity, resulting in fragmented and incoherent memory units; (2) prevalent flat retrieval paradigms rely solely on surface-level semantic similarity, neglecting the structural cues of discourse required to navigate and locate specific episodic contexts. To mitigate these limitations, drawing inspiration from Event Segmentation Theory, we propose ES-Mem, a framework incorporating two core components: (1) a dynamic event segmentation module that partitions long-term interactions into semantically coherent events with distinct boundaries; (2) a hierarchical memory architecture that constructs multi-layered memories and leverages boundary semantics to anchor specific episodic memory for precise context localization. Evaluations on two memory benchmarks demonstrate that ES-Mem yields consistent performance gains over baseline methods. Furthermore, the proposed event segmentation module exhibits robust applicability on dialogue segmentation datasets."

    "abstract": "Reduced-order modeling lies at the interface of numerical analysis and data-driven scientific computing, providing principled ways to compress high-fidelity simulations in science and engineering. We propose a training framework that couples a continuous-time form of operator inference with the adjoint-state method to obtain robust data-driven reduced-order models. This method minimizes a trajectory-based loss between reduced-order solutions and projected snapshot data, which removes the need to estimate time derivatives from noisy measurements and provides intrinsic temporal regularization through time integration. We derive the corresponding continuous adjoint equations to compute gradients efficiently and implement a gradient based optimizer to update the reduced model parameters. Each iteration only requires one forward reduced order solve and one adjoint solve, followed by inexpensive gradient assembly, making the method attractive for large-scale simulations. We validate the proposed method on three partial differential equations: viscous Burgers' equation, the two-dimensional Fisher-KPP equation, and an advection-diffusion equation. We perform systematic comparisons against standard operator inference under two perturbation regimes, namely reduced temporal snapshot density and additive Gaussian noise. For clean data, both approaches deliver similar accuracy, but in situations with sparse sampling and noise, the proposed adjoint-based training provides better accuracy and enhanced roll-out stability."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agents to autonomously execute complex, long-horizon tasks, yet planning remains a primary bottleneck for reliable task execution. Existing methods typically fall into two paradigms: step-wise planning, which is reactive but often short-sighted; and one-shot planning, which generates a complete plan upfront yet is brittle to execution errors. Crucially, both paradigms suffer from entangled contexts, where the agent must reason over a monolithic history spanning multiple sub-tasks. This entanglement increases cognitive load and lets local errors propagate across otherwise independent decisions, making recovery computationally expensive. To address this, we propose Task-Decoupled Planning (TDP), a training-free framework that replaces entangled reasoning with task decoupling. TDP decomposes tasks into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of sub-goals via a Supervisor. Using a Planner and Executor with scoped contexts, TDP confines reasoning and replanning to the active sub-task. This isolation prevents error propagation and corrects deviations locally without disrupting the workflow. Results on TravelPlanner, ScienceWorld, and HotpotQA show that TDP outperforms strong baselines while reducing token consumption by up to 82%, demonstrating that sub-task decoupling improves both robustness and efficiency for long-horizon agents."

A universal algebraic equation, valid for any equation of state, is used to find the approximate mass of a star of a given density without resorting to the integration of differential equations. Equations of state for neutron stars had been taken for degenerate neutron gas and for more realistic ones, used by Bethe, Malone, Johnson (1975). Models of homogeneous strange stars for the equation of state in the \"quark bag model\" have a simple analytical solution. The solutions presented in the paper for various equations of state differ from the exact solutions obtained by the numerical integration of differential equations by at most $ \\sim 20 \\%$. The formation of strange stars is examined as a function of the deconfinement boundary (DB), at which quarks become deconfined. Existing experimental data indicate that matter reaches very high densities in the vicinity of the DB. This imposes strong constraints on the maximum mass of strange stars and prohibits their formation at the final stages of stellar evolution, because the limiting mass of neutron stars is substantially higher and corresponds to considerably lower matter densities."

While test-time adaptation (TTA) mitigates distribution shifts under online data streams without per-use calibration sessions, existing TTA approaches heavily rely on explicitly defined loss objectives that require backpropagation for updating model parameters, which incurs computational overhead, privacy risks, and sensitivity to noisy data streams. This paper proposes Backpropagation-Free Transformations (BFT), a TTA approach for EEG decoding that eliminates such issues. BFT applies multiple sample-wise transformations of knowledge-guided augmentations or approximate Bayesian inference to each test trial, generating multiple prediction scores for a single test sample. A learning-to-rank module enhances the weighting of these predictions, enabling robust aggregation for uncertainty suppression during inference under theoretical justifications. Extensive experiments on five EEG datasets of motor imagery classification and driver drowsiness regression tasks demonstrate the effectiveness, versatility, robustness, and efficiency of BFT. This research enables lightweight plug-and-play BCIs on resource-constrained devices, broadening the real-world deployment of decoding algorithms for EEG-based BCI."

    "abstract": "The Levenshtein sequence reconstruction problem studies the reconstruction of a transmitted sequence from multiple erroneous copies of it. A fundamental question in this field is to determine the minimum number of erroneous copies required to guarantee correct reconstruction of the original sequence. This problem is equivalent to determining the maximum possible intersection size of two error balls associated with the underlying channel. Existing research on the sequence reconstruction problem has largely focused on channels with a single type of error, such as insertions, deletions, or substitutions alone. However, relatively little is known for channels that involve a mixture of error types, for instance, channels allowing both deletions and substitutions. In this work, we study the sequence reconstruction problem for the single-deletion two-substitution channel, which allows one deletion and at most two substitutions applied to the transmitted sequence. Specifically, we prove that if two $q$-ary length-$n$ sequences have the Hamming distance $d\\geq 2$, where $q\\geq 2$ is any fixed integer, then the intersection size of their error balls under the single-deletion two-substitution channel is upper bounded by $(q^2-1)n^2-(3q^2+5q-5)n+O_q(1)$, where $O_q(1)$ is a constant independent from $n$ but dependent on $q$. Moreover, we show that this upper bound is tight up to an additive constant."

We introduce \\emph{sparse point-wise privacy leakage}, a worst-case privacy criterion that enforces two simultaneous constraints for every disclosed symbol $u\\in\\mathcal{U}$: (i) $u$ may be correlated with at most $N$ realizations of $X$, and (ii) the total leakage toward those realizations is bounded. In the high-privacy regime, we use concepts from information geometry to obtain a local quadratic approximation of mutual information which measures utility between $U$ and $Y$. When the leakage matrix $P_{X|Y}$ is invertible, this approximation reduces the design problem to a sparse quadratic maximization, known as the Rayleigh-quotient problem, with an $\\ell_0$ constraint. We further show that, for the approximated problem, one can without loss of optimality restrict attention to a binary released variable $U$ with a uniform distribution. For small alphabet sizes, the exact sparsity-constrained optimum can be computed via combinatorial support enumeration, which quickly becomes intractable as the dimension grows. For general dimensions, the resulting sparse Rayleigh-quotient maximization is NP-hard and closely related to sparse principal component analysis (PCA). We propose a convex semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation that is solvable in polynomial time and provides a tractable surrogate for the NP-hard design, together with a simple rounding procedure to recover a feasible leakage direction. We also identify a sparsity threshold beyond which the sparse optimum saturates at the unconstrained spectral value and the SDP relaxation becomes tight."

However, existing systems rely on hardware-intensive multi-camera setups and demand high bandwidth for volumetric streaming, limiting their real-time performance on mobile devices. To overcome these challenges, we propose Mon3tr, a novel Monocular 3D telepresence framework that integrates 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) based parametric human modeling into telepresence for the first time. Mon3tr adopts an amortized computation strategy, dividing the process into a one-time offline multi-view reconstruction phase to build a user-specific avatar and a monocular online inference phase during live telepresence sessions. A single monocular RGB camera is used to capture body motions and facial expressions in real time to drive the 3DGS-based parametric human model, significantly reducing system complexity and cost. The extracted motion and appearance features are transmitted at < 0.2 Mbps over WebRTC's data channel, allowing robust adaptation to network fluctuations. On the receiver side, e.g., Meta Quest 3, we develop a lightweight 3DGS attribute deformation network to dynamically generate corrective 3DGS attribute adjustments on the pre-built avatar, synthesizing photorealistic motion and appearance at ~ 60 FPS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method, achieving a PSNR of > 28 dB for novel poses, an end-to-end latency of ~ 80 ms, and > 1000x bandwidth reduction compared to point-cloud streaming, while supporting real-time operation from monocular inputs across diverse scenarios.

Power-of-two cyclotomic fields are frequently adopted to instantiate Ring-LWE. Pan et al. (EUROCRYPT~2021) explored the SVP over ideal lattices via the decomposition fields and, in particular determined the length of ideal lattices over rational primes $p\\equiv3,5\\pmod{8}$ in power-of-two cyclotomic fields via explicit construction of reduced lattice bases. In this work, we first provide a new method (different from analyzing lattice bases) to analyze the length of the shortest vector in prime ideals in $\\mathbb{Z}[ζ_{2^{n+1}}]$ when $p\\equiv3,5\\pmod{8}$. Then we precisely characterize the length of the shortest vector on the cases of $p\\equiv7,9\\pmod{16}$. Furthermore, we derive a new upper bound for this length, which is tighter than the bound obtained from Minkowski's theorem. Our key technique is to investigate whether a generator of a principal ideal can achieve the shortest length after embedding as a vector. If this holds for the ideal, finding the shortest vector in this ideal can be reduced to finding its shortest generator."

We present FROAV (Framework for RAG Observation and Agent Verification), an open-source research platform that democratizes LLM agent research by providing a plug-and-play architecture combining visual workflow orchestration, a comprehensive evaluation framework, and extensible Python integration. FROAV implements a multi-stage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline coupled with a rigorous \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" evaluation system, all accessible through intuitive graphical interfaces.

Through this integrated ecosystem, researchers can rapidly prototype RAG strategies, conduct prompt engineering experiments, validate agent performance against human judgments, and collect structured feedback-all without writing infrastructure code. We demonstrate the framework's utility through its application to financial document analysis, while emphasizing its material-agnostic architecture that adapts to any domain requiring semantic analysis. FROAV represents a significant step toward making LLM agent research accessible to a broader scientific community, enabling researchers to focus on hypothesis testing and algorithmic innovation rather than system integration challenges."

The results show that FR3 exhibits propagation characteristics intermediate between sub-6 GHz and mmWave bands while supporting meaningful spatial multiplexing, albeit with strong site dependence. Motivated by these findings, we propose a fully digital frequency-adaptive multi-band MIMO architecture that repurposes ADCs/DACs and baseband processing resources across FR3 subbands via switching, enabling dynamic trade-offs between bandwidth (spectrum gain) and antenna consolidation (MIMO gain) under availability and channel constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that exploiting additional spectrum is often optimal, while adaptive resource repurposing becomes beneficial when subbands are unavailable or when multiplexing gains are concentrated at specific frequencies."

    "abstract": "In laser-produced plasma (LPP) extreme ultraviolet (EUV) sources, deformation of a tin droplet into an optimal target shape is governed by its interaction with a pre-pulse laser-generated plasma. This interaction is mediated by a transient ablation pressure, whose complex spatio-temporal evolution remains experimentally inaccessible. Existing modeling approaches are limited: Empirical pressure-impulse models neglect dynamic plasma feedback, while advanced radiation-hydrodynamic codes often fail to resolve late-time droplet hydrodynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose a radiation two-phase flow model based on a diffuse interface methodology. The model integrates radiation hydrodynamics for the plasma with the Euler equations for a weakly compressible liquid, extending a five-equation diffuse interface formulation to incorporate radiation transport, thermal conduction, and ionization. This formulation enforces pressure and velocity equilibrium across the diffuse interface region, with closure models constructed to ensure correct jump conditions at interfaces and asymptotically recover the pure-phase equations in bulk regions. Then, we apply the model to simulate a benchmark pre-pulse scenario, where a 50 micron tin droplet is irradiated by a 10 ns laser pulse. The simulations capture the rapid plasma expansion and subsequent inertial flattening of the droplet into a thin, curved sheet over microsecond timescales. Notably, the model reproduces experimentally observed features (such as an axial jet) rarely replicated in prior simulations. Quantitative agreement with experimental data for sheet dimensions and velocity validates the approach. The proposed model self-consistently couples laser-plasma physics with compressible droplet dynamics, providing a powerful tool for fundamental studies of plasma-liquid interactions in LPP-EUV source optimization."

    "abstract": "In active reconstruction, an embodied agent must decide where to look next to efficiently acquire views that support high-quality novel-view rendering. Recent work on active view planning for neural rendering largely derives next-best-view (NBV) criteria by backpropagating through radiance fields or estimating information entropy over 3D Gaussian primitives. While effective, these strategies tightly couple view selection to heavy, representation-specific mechanisms and fail to account for the computational and resource constraints required for lightweight online deployment. In this paper, we revisit active reconstruction from a renderability-centric perspective. We propose $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$-RECON, a radiance-fields-free active reconstruction framework that induces an implicit, pose-conditioned renderability field over SE(3) from a lightweight voxel map. Our formulation aggregates per-voxel online observation statistics into a unified scalar renderability score that is cheap to update and can be queried in closed form at arbitrary candidate viewpoints in milliseconds, without requiring gradients or radiance-field training. This renderability field is strongly correlated with image-space reconstruction error, naturally guiding NBV selection. We further introduce a panoramic extension that estimates omnidirectional (360$^\\circ$) view utility to accelerate candidate evaluation. In the standard indoor Replica dataset, $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$-RECON achieves more uniform novel-view quality and higher 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) reconstruction accuracy than recent active GS baselines with matched view and time budgets."

To address these issues, we propose a prototype-based knowledge retrieval framework that achieves robust MTL instead of relying on predictions from unlabeled tasks. Our framework consists of two key components: (1) a task prototype embedding task-specific characteristics and quantifying task associations, and (2) a knowledge retrieval transformer that adaptively refines feature representations based on these associations. To achieve this, we introduce an association knowledge generating (AKG) loss to ensure the task prototype consistently captures task-specific characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting its potential for robust multi-task learning, even when only a subset of tasks is annotated."

However, most existing approaches store memory in fixed representations and reuse it at a single or implicit level of abstraction, which limits generalization and often leads to negative transfer when distribution shift. This paper proposes the Meta-Cognitive Memory Abstraction method (MCMA), which treats memory abstraction as a learnable cognitive skill rather than a fixed design choice. MCMA decouples task execution from memory management by combining a frozen task model with a learned memory copilot. The memory copilot is trained using direct preference optimization, it determines how memories should be structured, abstracted, and reused. Memories are further organized into a hierarchy of abstraction levels, enabling selective reuse based on task similarity. When no memory is transferable, MCMA transfers the ability to abstract and manage memory by transferring the memory copilot. Experiments on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and BabyAI demonstrate substantial improvements in performance, out-of-distribution generalization, and cross-task transfer over several baselines."

We present a novel pipeline that improves the removal of localized defects prior to the planet search, improves vetting at the level of individual transits and introduces a Bayes factor test statistic and an algorithm for extracting multiple candidates from a single detection run. We show with injections in the Kepler data that the introduced novelties improve pipeline's completeness at a fixed false alarm rate. We apply the pipeline to the stars with previously identified planet candidates and show that our pipeline successfully recovers the previously confirmed candidates, but flags a considerable portion of unconfirmed candidates as likely false alarms, especially in the long period, low signal-to-noise ratio regime. In particular, several known Earth-like candidates in the habitable zone, such as KOI 8063.01, 8107.01 and 8242.01, are identified as false alarms, which could have a significant impact on the estimates of $η_{\\oplus}$, i.e., the occurrence of Earth-like planets in the habitable zone."

(2015), which characterizes the set of consumer-producer surplus pairs that can be achieved through market segmentation. This was proved by means of market segmentation with random prices, but it was claimed that any segmentation with possibly random pricing has a corresponding direct segmentation, where a deterministic price is charged in each market segment. However, the latter claim is not correct under the definition of market segmentation given in the paper, and we provide counterexamples. We then propose an alternative definition to resolve this issue and examine the implications of the difference between the two definitions in terms of the main result of their paper."

    "abstract": "Academic libraries struggle to find and access faculty expertise across disciplines. This research proposes a faculty expertise ontology with a hierarchical structure based on Protégé to enhance library services and knowledge organisation. The ontology classifies relationships between departments, subject areas, faculty members, and contact data into layers including Top, Middle, and Bottom levels. The academic structure that this tiered form takes enables discovery of expertise in departments. The ontology which answers competency questions generated from the subject matter experts can answer real-world questions like which faculties are in the specific areas, how to collaborate with other disciplines and search contact information and so on. Competency questions act as design and test instruments to show that the ontology will fulfil the information needs of Researchers, Librarians and Administrators. The ontology is able to cope with semantically-enhanced queries, as shown by SPARQL implementations. The model works effectively in initiating referrals to an expert, aligning research with the strength of a department and allowing academics to partner up. The ontology delivers a scalable platform that adapts to institutional change. In the future, we intend to integrate with institutional databases and library systems for automatic API updates, as well as develop user interfaces and visualisations."

This work presents a novel Surrogate-Based Optimization framework based on Clustering, SBOC for global optimization of such systems, which can be used with any surrogate modeling technique. At each iteration, it uses a single surrogate model for the entire domain, employs k-means clustering to identify unexplored domain, and exploits a local region around the surrogate optimum to potentially add three new sample points in the domain. SBOC has been tested against sixteen promising benchmarking algorithms using 52 analytical test functions of varying input dimensionalities and shape profiles. It successfully identified a global minimum for most test functions with substantially lower computational effort than other algorithms. It worked especially well on test functions with four or more input variables. It was also among the top six algorithms in approaching a global minimum closely. Overall, SBOC is a robust, reliable, and efficient algorithm for global optimization of box-constrained systems."

Our results are shown to be non-conservative (necessary and sufficient) for a family of well known prototypical examples of linear SISO feedbacks that are not globally exponentially stabilizable (the so-called ANCBI plants).

Genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) serves as a key indicator of network performance and overall state quality. However, the widely used methods for certifying GME suffer from a major drawback that they either detect only a limited range of states or are applicable only to systems with a small number of parties. To overcome these limitations, we propose a family of sub-symmetric witnesses (SSWs), which are tractable both theoretically and experimentally. Analytically, we establish a connection between SSWs and the cut space of graph theory, enabling several powerful detection criteria tailored to practical quantum networks. Numerically, we show that the optimal detection can be formulated as a linear program, offering a significant efficiency advantage over the semidefinite programs commonly employed in quantum certification. Experimentally, SSWs can be evaluated via local measurements, with resource requirements independent of the local dimension in general, and even independent of the overall network size in many practical networks."

By doing so, a doubled degree of freedom (DoF) is achieved compared to conventional PASS. Based on the new designed basic signal model of C-PASS, three practical operating protocols for C-PASS are proposed, namely power splitting (PS), direction switching (DS), and time switching (TS). Then, the sum-rate maximization problem for the joint optimization of transmit and pinching beamforming is formulated for each of the proposed protocols. 1) For PS, the highly coupled non-convex problem is first transformed into a tractable form via the weighted minimum mean square error reformulation and solved using the alternating optimization framework; 2) For DS, the above approach is subsequently extended to solve the mixed-integer constraints inherent for DS via the penalty-based algorithm; 3) For TS, the optimization problem can be decomposed into two subproblems and solved using the similar iterative techniques, while its optimal time allocation ratio is derived in closed form. Finally, numerical results reveal that TS is superior in the low-power regime, while PS and DS achieve significantly higher rates in the high-power regime due to the enhanced DoF."

Previous work shows that their internal states encode rich signals of truthfulness, yet the origins and mechanisms of these signals remain unclear. In this paper, we demonstrate that truthfulness cues arise from two distinct information pathways: (1) a Question-Anchored pathway that depends on question-answer information flow, and (2) an Answer-Anchored pathway that derives self-contained evidence from the generated answer itself. First, we validate and disentangle these pathways through attention knockout and token patching. Afterwards, we uncover notable and intriguing properties of these two mechanisms. Further experiments reveal that (1) the two mechanisms are closely associated with LLM knowledge boundaries; and (2) internal representations are aware of their distinctions. Finally, building on these insightful findings, two applications are proposed to enhance hallucination detection performance. Overall, our work provides new insight into how LLMs internally encode truthfulness, offering directions for more reliable and self-aware generative systems."

    "abstract": "Modern computing platforms rely on the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) to initialize hardware and coordinate the transition to the operating system. Because this execution environment operates with high privileges and persists across reboots, it has increasingly become a target for advanced threats, including bootkits documented in real systems. Existing protections, including Secure Boot and static signature verification, are insufficient against adversaries who exploit runtime behavior or manipulate firmware components after signature checks have completed. In contrast to operating system (OS) environments, where mature tools provide dynamic inspection and incident response, the pre-OS stage lacks practical mechanisms for real-time visibility and threat detection. We present Peacock, a modular framework that introduces integrity-assured monitoring and remote verification for the UEFI boot process. Peacock consists of three components: (i) a UEFI-based agent that records Boot and Runtime Service activity with cryptographic protection against tampering; (ii) a cross-platform OS Agent that extracts the recorded measurements and produces a verifiable attestation bundle using hardware-backed guarantees from the platform's trusted module; and (iii) a Peacock Server that verifies attestation results and exports structured telemetry for enterprise detection. Our evaluation shows that Peacock reliably detects multiple real-world UEFI bootkits, including Glupteba, BlackLotus, LoJax, and MosaicRegressor. Taken together, these results indicate that Peacock provides practical visibility and verification capabilities within the firmware layer, addressing threats that bypass traditional OS-level security mechanisms."

Building on this insight, we propose SVD-Cache, a subspace-aware caching framework that decomposes diffusion features via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), applies exponential moving average (EMA) prediction to the dominant low-rank components, and directly reuses the residual subspace. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SVD-Cache achieves near-lossless across diverse models and methods, including 5.55$\\times$ speedup on FLUX and HunyuanVideo, and compatibility with model acceleration techniques including distillation, quantization and sparse attention.

Motivated by this variability, we explore the alternative hypothesis that Capotauro is a pair-instability supernova (PISN) originating from a massive ($250-260\\,M_\\odot$), metal-free star. Using state-of-the-art PISN light curves, spectral energy distributions, and synthetic spectra, we show that a PISN at $z\\simeq 15$ can plausibly reproduce the observed brightness, temporal evolution, photometry, and NIRSpec spectrum. We compare this scenario with alternative interpretations, including a local Y0 brown dwarf, and discuss observational tests to discriminate among them.

However, for multi-way tables involving more than two variables, these quantities do not uniquely determine the joint distribution, but instead define a family of admissible distributions that share the same pairwise dependence while potentially differing in higher-order interactions. In this paper, we introduce a geometric framework to describe the entire feasible set of such joint distributions with uniform margins. We show that this admissible set forms a convex polytope, analyze its symmetry properties, and characterize its extreme rays. These extremal distributions provide fundamental insights into how higher-order dependence structures may vary while preserving the prescribed pairwise information. Unlike traditional methods for table generation, which return a single table, our framework makes it possible to explore and understand the full admissible space of dependence structures, enabling more flexible choices for modeling and simulation. We illustrate the usefulness of our theoretical results through examples and a real case study on rater agreement."

Rather than directly prompting chapters, we adopt a staged construction that first gathers reliable linguistic and visual evidence via curated ASR and frame-level descriptions, then refines coarse annotations into precise chapter boundaries and titles conditioned on the Temporal Chain-of-Thought, yielding fact-grounded, time-aligned narratives. We also observe that e-commerce videos are fast-paced and information-dense, with visual tokens dominating the input sequence.

However, using the backhand flick (BF) to return forehand short balls often increases the difficulty of recovery and continuity, revealing a technical gap. This study preliminarily verified a novel forehand short return technique, the forehand reverse flick (FRF), and analyzed its similarities and differences with the BF. Methods Four elite athletes completed seven consecutive days of FRF specific training. Infrared motion capture and ultra-high-speed cameras were used to collect data on racket kinematics, movement duration, and ball performance. Results The success rate of the FRF increased steadily, reaching 86%. Racket trajectories of the two techniques were highly similar along the X (r = 1) and Y (r = 0.99) axes but differed along the Z (r = -0.04) axis. Racket and ball velocities were comparable between techniques, whereas the FRF showed lower resultant acceleration (approximately 265.57 m/s) and required about 0.03 s more for movement duration. Ball velocity was comparable between techniques, for the ball spin, the FRF generated lower spin (approximately 76.61 r/s) about 64% of the BF value (approximately 120.13 r/s). The highest participant mean spin rate reached 93 r/s, about 77% of the BF mean. Conclusion Overall, the FRF was found to have favorable learnability and training value, with potential for further optimization and competitive application."

However, their internal reasoning often exhibits a critical inconsistency: although deeper layers may attend to the correct visual regions, final predictions are frequently misled by noisy attention from earlier layers. This results in a disconnect between what the model internally understands and what it ultimately expresses, a phenomenon we describe as seeing it right but saying it wrong. To address this issue, we propose DualPD, a dual-perspective decoding refinement strategy that enhances the visual understanding without any additional training. DualPD consists of two components. (1) The layer-wise attention-guided contrastive logits module captures how the belief in the correct answer evolves by comparing output logits between layers that exhibit the largest attention shift. (2) The head-wise information filtering module suppresses low-contribution attention heads that focus on irrelevant regions, thereby improving attention quality within each layer. Experiments conducted on both the LLaVA and Qwen-VL model families across multiple multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that DualPD consistently improves accuracy without training, confirming its effectiveness and generalizability.

    "abstract": "The \"reversal curse\" refers to the phenomenon where large language models (LLMs) exhibit predominantly unidirectional behavior when processing logically bidirectional relationships. Prior work attributed this to autoregressive training -- predicting the next token inherently favors left-to-right information flow over genuine bidirectional knowledge associations. However, we observe that Diffusion LLMs (DLLMs), despite being trained bidirectionally, also suffer from the reversal curse. To investigate the root causes, we conduct systematic experiments on DLLMs and identify three key reasons: 1) entity fragmentation during training, 2) data asymmetry, and 3) missing entity relations. Motivated by the analysis of these reasons, we propose Diffusion Entity-Relation Modeling (DiffER), which addresses the reversal curse through entity-aware training and balanced data construction. Specifically, DiffER introduces whole-entity masking, which mitigates entity fragmentation by predicting complete entities in a single step. DiffER further employs distribution-symmetric and relation-enhanced data construction strategies to alleviate data asymmetry and missing relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffER effectively alleviates the reversal curse in Diffusion LLMs, offering new perspectives for future research."

    "abstract": "We investigate the ferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model on spherical Fibonacci graphs. These graphs are constructed by embedding quasi-uniform sites on a sphere and defining interactions via a chord-distance cutoff chosen to yield a network approximating four-neighbor connectivity. By combining Swendsen-Wang cluster Monte Carlo simulations with graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which operate directly on the adjacency structure and node spins, we develop a unified phase-classification framework applicable to both regular planar lattices and curved, irregular spherical graphs. Benchmarks on planar lattices demonstrate an efficient transfer strategy: after a fixed binarization of Potts spins into an effective Ising variable, a single GCN pretrained on the Ising model can localize the transition region for different $q$ values without retraining. Applying this strategy to spherical graphs, we find that curvature- and defect-induced connectivity irregularities produce only modest shifts in the inferred transition temperatures relative to planar baselines. Further analysis shows that the curvature-induced shift of the critical temperature is most pronounced at small $q$ and diminishes rapidly as $q$ increases; this trend is consistent with the physical picture that, in two dimensions, the Potts model undergoes a transition from a continuous phase transition to a weakly first-order one for $q>4$, accompanied by a pronounced reduction of the correlation length."

However, they do not fully capture the complexity of real-world clinical diagnostics, which involve heterogeneous inputs and require ongoing contextual understanding during patient-physician interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce PulseMind, a new family of multi-modal diagnostic models that integrates a systematically curated dataset, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, and a tailored training framework. Specifically, we first construct a diagnostic dataset, MediScope, which comprises 98,000 real-world multi-turn consultations and 601,500 medical images, spanning over 10 major clinical departments and more than 200 sub-specialties. Then, to better reflect the requirements of real-world clinical diagnosis, we develop the PulseMind Benchmark, a multi-turn diagnostic consultation benchmark with a four-dimensional evaluation protocol comprising proactiveness, accuracy, usefulness, and language quality. Finally, we design a training framework tailored for multi-modal clinical diagnostics, centered around a core component named Comparison-based Reinforcement Policy Optimization (CRPO). Compared to absolute score rewards, CRPO uses relative preference signals from multi-dimensional com-parisons to provide stable and human-aligned training guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PulseMind achieves competitive performance on both the diagnostic consultation benchmark and public medical benchmarks."

To calibrate the influence of the mud layer on electrode measurement signals, this study integrates the Open-Short calibration(OSC) method with the three-layer impedance model of the oil-based mud resistivity imager. By treating the electrode and the mud layer as an integrated whole and simulating the open/short-circuit states via the finite element method, the independent extraction of the mud layer impedance signal is achieved, and the formation impedance signal is separated from the total impedance. For fast inversion of formation resistivity, standoff thickness (mud layer thickness), and relative permittivity of formation, a resistivity consistency-constrained iterative inversion method is further proposed. In this method, the formation impedance is first converted into resistivity, and then the consistency residual of the resistivity at different frequencies is used as the objective function to invert the approximate apparent resistivity of the formation through an iterative optimization algorithm. The effectiveness of the finite element-simulated OSC method, the objective function construction scheme, and the consistency inversion method is verified through both numerical models and an example of field data."

For each edge, a specified subset of source symbols must be recoverable from its two incident nodes, while no information about the remaining sources is revealed. To meet the security requirement, a shared source key may be employed. The ratio between the source symbol size and the source key size defines the source key rate, and the supremum of all achievable rates is referred to as the source key capacity. We study extremal values of the source key capacity in secure storage systems and provide complete graph characterizations for several fundamental settings. For the case where each edge is associated with a single source symbol, we characterize all graphs whose source key capacity equals one. We then generalize this result to the case where each edge is associated with multiple source symbols and identify a broad class of graphs that achieve the corresponding extremal capacity under a mild structural condition. In addition, we characterize all graphs for which secure storage can be achieved without using any source key."

Deep learning shows promise for ECG interpretation, but multi-class inherited arrhythmia classification with clinically grounded interpretability remains underdeveloped. Our objective was to develop and validate a lead-aware deep learning framework for multi-class (ARVC vs LQTS vs control) and binary inherited arrhythmia classification, and to determine optimal strategies for integrating ECG foundation models within arrhythmia screening tools. We assembled a 13-center Canadian cohort (645 patients; 1,344 ECGs). We evaluated four ECG foundation models using three transfer learning approaches: linear probing, fine-tuning, and combined strategies. We developed lead-aware spatial attention networks (LASAN) and assessed integration strategies combining LASAN with foundation models. Performance was compared against the established foundation model baselines. Lead-group masking quantified disease-specific lead dependence. Fine-tuning outperformed linear probing and combined strategies across all foundation models (mean macro-AUROC 0.904 vs 0.825). The best lead-aware integrations achieved near-ceiling performance (HuBERT-ECG hybrid: macro-AUROC 0.990; ARVC vs control AUROC 0.999; LQTS vs control AUROC 0.994). Lead masking demonstrated physiologic plausibility: V1-V3 were most critical for ARVC detection (4.54% AUROC reduction), while lateral leads were preferentially important for LQTS (2.60% drop). Lead-aware architectures achieved state-of-the-art performance for inherited arrhythmia classification, outperforming all existing published models on both binary and multi-class tasks while demonstrating clinically aligned lead dependence. These findings support potential utility for automated ECG screening pending validation."

Due to the strong coupling between heavy quarks and the bulk medium, the evolution of heavy quarks can be effectively characterized by a diffusion equation. This approach assumes the instantaneous kinetic thermalization of heavy quarks following their production in nuclear collisions. The local density of heavy quarks is intrinsically coupled to the velocity profile of the hot QCD medium. By incorporating the fluid velocity profiles provided by a hydrodynamic model directly into the diffusion equation, we utilize the deep neural network (DNN) to efficiently determine the heavy-quark evolution. Furthermore, this work provides a valuable reference for the application of deep learning techniques to the treatment of non-thermalized heavy-quark dynamics. The rapid calculation of heavy-quark diffusion using DNNs further facilitates the study of heavy-quark coalescence within a large ensemble of fluctuating hot media."

Motivated by applications to associative learning, particularly to discrimination training, extra conditions are imposed on $F(t)$ and $A(t)$, one of them relating $A(t)$ to a symmetric non-negative definite matrix $K$ relevant to mathematical models of associative learning. Structural relationships between the matrices imply an identity satisfied by the Floquet multipliers driving the dynamics of $w(mT)$ from which follows that the unstable subspace is $\\ker K$. Then, the limit of $w(mT)$ is explicitly identified when $K$ is invertible, while the limit of $Kw(mT)$ is established otherwise. Given that divergence of $w(mT)$ can happen when $K$ is singular, while $Kw(mT)$ is the psychologically relevant quantity, the result can be considered optimal."

    "abstract": "As quantum computing machines move towards the utility regime, it is essential that users are able to verify their delegated quantum computations with security guarantees that are (i) robust to noise, (ii) composable with other secure protocols, and (iii) exponentially stronger as the number of resources dedicated to security increases. Previous works that achieve these guarantees and provide modularity necessary to optimization of protocols to real-world hardware are most often expressed in the Measurement-Based Quantum Computation (MBQC) model. This leaves architectures based on the circuit model -- in particular those using the Magic State Injection (MSI) -- with fewer options to verify their computations or with the need to compile their circuits in MBQC leading to overheads. This paper introduces a family of noise robust, composable and efficient verification protocols for Clifford + MSI circuits that are secure against arbitrary malicious behavior. This family contains the verification protocol of Broadbent (ToC, 2018), extends its security guarantees while also bridging the modularity gap between MBQC and circuit-based protocols, and reducing quantum communication costs. As a result, it opens the prospect of rapid implementation for near-term quantum devices. Our technique is based on a refined notion of blindness, called magic-blindness, which hides only the injected magic states -- the sole source of non-Clifford computational power. This enables verification by randomly interleaving computation rounds with classically simulable, magic-free test rounds, leading to a trap-based framework for verification. As a result, circuit-based quantum verification attains the same level of security and robustness previously known only in MBQC. It also optimizes the quantum communication cost as transmitted qubits are required only at the locations of state injection."

    "abstract": "Classical spatial models of two-party competition typically predict convergence to the median voter, yet real-world party systems often exhibit persistent and asymmetric polarization. We develop a spatial model of two-party competition in which voters evaluate parties through general satisfaction functions, and a width parameter $q$ captures how tolerant they are of ideological distance. This parameter governs the balance between centripetal and centrifugal incentives and acts as the bifurcation parameter governing equilibrium configurations. Under mild regularity assumptions, we characterize Nash equilibria through center-distance coordinates, which separate the endogenous political center from polarization. When the voter density is symmetric, the reduced equilibrium condition exhibits a generic supercritical pitchfork bifurcation at a critical value $q_{c}$. Above $q_{c}$, the unique stable equilibrium features convergence to the center, recovering the classical median voter result, whereas below it two symmetric polarized equilibria arise. Asymmetry in the voter distribution unfolds the pitchfork, producing drift in the endogenous center and asymmetric polarized equilibria. The resulting equilibrium diagram has an S-shaped geometry that generates hysteresis, allowing polarization to persist even after tolerance returns to levels that would support convergence in a symmetric environment. In the high-tolerance regime, we show that the unique non-polarized equilibrium converges to the mean of the voter distribution, while the median is recovered only under symmetry. Hence, unlike the Hotelling--Downs model, where convergence to the median is universal, the median voter appears here as an asymptotic benchmark rather than a robust predictor."

The identification conditions reveal that, similar to causal inference, credible ecological inference requires controlling for confounders. The aggregation process itself creates additional structure to assist in estimation by restricting the conditional expectation function to be linear in the predictor variable. A linear model perspective also clarifies the differences between the EI methods commonly used in the literature, and when they lead to ecological fallacies. We provide an overview of new methodology which builds on both the identification and linearity results to flexibly control for confounders and yield improved ecological inferences. Finally, using datasets for common EI problems in which the ground truth is fortuitously observed, we show that, while covariates can help, all methods are prone to overestimating both racial polarization and nationalized partisan voting."

To derive the initial mass function (IMF) of a large sample of NYMGs, we developed and applied an algorithm that uses photometry and astrometry from Gaia DR3 to detect NYMGs in a kinematic space. We inferred individual masses from the photometry of both the detected and the previously known candidates. We estimated the IMFs for 33 groups, 30 of them for the first time, in an average mass range $0.1<m/M_\\odot<5$ with some groups going as low as $0.02~M_{\\odot}$ and as high as $10~M_{\\odot}$. We parameterized these IMFs using a log-normal for $m<1~M_\\odot$ and a power-law for $m>1~M_\\odot$. We detected 4166 source candidate members of 44 known groups, including 2545 new candidates. We recovered 44-54\\% of the literature candidates and estimated a contamination rate from old field stars of 16-24\\%. The candidates of the detected groups distribute along young isochrones, which suggests that they are potential members of NYMGs. Parameterizations of both the average of the 33 IMFs based on our detections ($m_c=0.25\\pm0.17~M_{\\odot}$, $σ_c=0.45\\pm0.17$, and $α=-2.26\\pm0.09$) and the one based on the known candidates from the literature ($m_c=0.22\\pm0.14~M_{\\odot}$, $σ_c=0.45\\pm0.17$, and $α=-2.45\\pm0.06$) are in agreement with the IMF parameterization of the solar neighbourhood and young stellar associations. Our parameterization of the average IMF together with the distribution of the detected group members along young isochrones provide strong evidence suggesting that the NYMGs are remnants of individual stellar associations and clusters and that there are no systematic biases in our detection and in the literature in the range $0.1<m/M_{\\odot}<10$."

The latter encodes quark--quark--gluon correlations and involves interference between the light-front Fock sectors |qqq> and |qqqg>, which are typically neglected in the WW approximation. Using light-front wave functions obtained from diagonalizing the proton light-front Hamiltonian for its |qqq> and |qqqg> Fock components, we compute these GPDs via their overlap representations. To further explore their physical implications, we also evaluate several twist-3--related quantities, including the quark orbital angular momentum, the total quark spin contribution, and the quark spin--orbit correlation. Our results provide new nonperturbative input on higher-twist dynamics particularly multi-parton interference effects relevant for future measurements at the EicC and the EIC."

Also, the model includes a rotation-free active current of strength $λ$ and a rotational current of strength $ξ$. The inclusion of a chemical reaction with rate $Γ$ removes the conservation constraint and introduces a preferred wavenumber that governs the pattern formation below a critical reaction rate $Γ_c$. We argue for the analytical form of the amplitude equation based on symmetry considerations and explicitly derived it using multiscale analysis. By taking different limits of $g$, $λ$, and $ξ$, we recover amplitude equations for several well-known physical models as special cases and determine the nature transitions close to the onset of instability. We find that for $g = 0$, the transition is always supercritical, whereas for $g \\ne 0$, the transition between the supercritical and subcritical regimes depends sensitively on the model parameters. Further, we derive the condition for the \\textit{Eckhaus instability} from the stability analysis of the amplitude equation as well as from the phase diffusion equation, and find that it is independent of $g$."

The present paper discusses approaches to optimization of the method with respect to simple image quality metrics, such as signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution, as well as a reference-based metric corresponding to the relative mean squared difference between the reconstructed image and the \"ground truth\" image that would be obtained in a setup with perfect spatial resolution and no noise. The problem of optimization of the intrinsic regularization parameter of Paganin's method with respect to spatial resolution in the reconstructed image is studied in detail. It is also demonstrated that a combination of Paganin's method with a Tikhonov-regularized deconvolution of the point-spread function of the imaging system can provide significantly higher image quality compared to the standard version of the method. Analytical expressions for some relevant image quality metrics are obtained and compared with results of numerical simulations. Advantages and shortcomings of optimization approaches using a number of different image quality metrics are discussed. The results of this study are expected to be useful in practical X-ray imaging and training of deep machine learning models for image denoising and segmentation."

Here, we present a framework for studying non-locality that is agnostic to the dimension of the physical systems involved, allowing us to probe purely continuous-variable, discrete-variable, or hybrid non-locality. Our approach allows us to find the optimal Bell inequality for any given measurement scenario and quantifies the amount of non-locality that is present in measurement statistics. This formalism unifies the existing literature on continuous-variable non-locality and allows us to identify new states in which Bell non-locality can be probed through homodyne detection. Notably, we find the first example of continuous-variable non-locality that cannot be mapped to a CHSH Bell inequality. Moreover, we provide several examples of simple hybrid DV-CV entangled states that could lead to near-term violation of Bell inequalities."

The system combines semantic retrieval using ChromaDB with structured text generation using the Grok API. This is specifically designed to handle the BNS-compliant queries with its reasoning.

By leveraging the principles of reinforcement learning (RL), the agent learns to make decisions based on state-action values, updated iteratively throughout the training process. The research methodology involves hyperparameter testing to evaluate the model’s effectiveness. Training results reveal a consistent decrease in the loss function, accompanied by gradual improvements in Q-values, signifying enhanced decision-making capabilities of the agent. The reward signal initially stabilizes at 0.2, with occasional spikes reaching 1.1, reflecting the agent’s ability to identify and execute more optimal actions. Notably, the trained agent successfully navigated over 80 consecutive pipes without failure, demonstrating the model’s high stability and learning efficiency. This study underscores the potential of DQN in addressing dynamic, continuous-state environments and sets a foundation for applying reinforcement learning to similar arcade-style games. Future work could focus on enhancing the model’s performance through advanced techniques, such as Double DQN and Prioritized Experience Replay, to reduce overestimation bias and improve sampling efficiency."

The model utilizes the pre-trained ResNet50 residual network as the encoder backbone, constructs a multi - scale feature pyramid, and devises a bidirectional feature bridge mechanism to achieve the dynamic fusion of the encoder's high - level semantic features and the decoder's low-level details. Meanwhile, bilinear interpolation upsampling is adopted to replace transposed convolution, which effectively suppresses the generation of artifacts. Through the transfer learning strategy, the model attains stable deep training on the dataset, and its hierarchical feature selection module optimizes the compatibility of cross - scale features."

To address this, we propose DualPrior-Retinex, a novel framework that, inspired by Retinex theory, leverages the practical advantages of the YUV color space for robust enhancement. Our framework introduces a dual-prior architecture that effectively decouples the restoration process. It combines a diffusion-based global prior, responsible for ensuring low-frequency content consistency, with a YUV-based local prior designed to preserve high-frequency structural details. These complementary components are integrated by our Hierarchical Prior Fusion Module (HPFM), which balances perceptual quality with pixel-level fidelity in complex low-light scenarios. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse metrics and visual qualities.

    "abstract": "Spacecraft exploring Earth and other bodies in the solar system are producing increasingly large and complex volumes of scientific data. Recently, the field of science autonomy has begun to develop data analysis algorithms to select, prioritize, and characterize science instrument data directly onboard the spacecraft. These data-derived insights can then inform downstream autonomous decisions like data prioritization to mitigate data bandwidth constraints. However, science autonomy development has largely focused on bespoke, instrument-specific algorithms; there are no generalized platforms for sharing reusable utilities or centralizing the operation of multiple science autonomy algorithms. To accelerate future development of flight-ready science autonomy, we developed a software package called Science Yield Improvement via Onboard Prioritization and Summary of Information System (SYNOPSIS). SYNOPSIS manages the execution of one or more science autonomy algorithms, stores their outputs in a centralized database, and prioritizes data even across multiple instruments. We simulated the use of SYNOPSIS with science autonomy algorithms to analyze and prioritize data collected by the Curiosity rover on Mars and integrated it into two popular flight software packages — core Flight System (cFS) and F-Prime — to ease infusion of future science autonomy algorithms. As opportunities for onboard data analysis grow with the volume and complexity of data, we expect that platform technologies like SYNOPSIS will facilitate future exploration of our solar system."

    "url": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tip.2025.3649364",
    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Fine-grained image analysis is widely recognized as highly challenging, since distinguishing individual differences within a certain category, species, or type often depends on tiny, subtle patterns. However, learning fine-grained semantic categories from these subtle part patterns is inherently fragile, as they can easily be overwhelmed by the dominant patterns resting in the coarse-category information. Therefore, how to enhance the relation between the fine-grained semantics and these subtle patterns is the key. To push this frontier, a novel semantic-part alignment (SPA) learning scheme is proposed in this paper. Its general idea is to firstly measure the relevance of each part to the fine-grained semantics, and then regularize the fine-grained visual representation learning. Specifically, it consists of three key components, namely, joint semantic-part modeling, semantic-part set modeling, and optimal semantic-part transport. The joint semantic-part modeling associates each part in an image with the fine-grained semantics in a latent space. Then, the optimal semantic-part transport component is devised to enhance the relation between fine-grained semantic embeddings and the discriminative part embeddings. Notably, the proposed SPA is plug-in-and-play, easy-to-implement, and insensitive to the latent embedding dimension and loss weight. Experiments show the proposed method can substantially boost performance on multiple fine-grained image analysis tasks across various baselines."

However, conventional frameworks often lack unified processing and intelligent automation, resulting in delayed response and SLA violations. This paper presents an AI-enhanced unified alerting and incident management framework that integrates heterogeneous alert streams via the ServiceNow platform. Leveraging two real-world datasets comprising over 140,000 event records and 24,000 unique incidents, we implement a multi-task deep neural network to jointly predict resolution time, incident priority, and responsible assignment group. The proposed method incorporates temporal feature engineering, trainable embeddings for categorical data, and variational autoencoders for dimensionality reduction. A synthetic alert-source simulation is introduced to mimic real-world alert diversity within the data pipeline. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over baseline models in all key metrics, validating the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. The framework sets the stage for scalable, automated, and context-aware incident triaging in enterprise IT environments."

    "abstract": "Panel-based large intelligent surface (LIS) systems, where each panel comprises a lower, but still significant, number of antennas, and is equipped with a number of baseband outputs (generally much smaller than the number of terminals), allow for a direct dimensionality reduction. However, such a dimensionality reduction may not be enough to simplify the overall system. This paper focuses on fully decentralized system architectures that allow for promising performances while requiring low, or even no, central data processing. In particular, this paper proposes panel-selection and panel-terminal association algorithms for decentralized panel-based LIS communication systems aiming at allocating a set of terminals to a given panel, which is limited to a given number of outputs, in a sequential or flooding manner, while maximising the minimum terminal rate. Performance results show that sequential and flooding distributed system architectures offer decent convergence rates in comparison with a centralized system architectures when selecting a proper combination of system parameters (i.e., number of panels, number of terminals, and number of baseband outputs), in turn ensuring scalability. In particular, it is shown that, for a given combination of the system parameters, a max-min terminal rate achieved when considering sequential and flooding distributed system architectures can successfully converge to the one achieved by the centralized system architecture, occurring after just a few iterations. Both the proposed sequential and flooding algorithms represents a less complex, but still an effective way to perform both panel selection and panel-terminal association, allowing for the deactivation of a significant portion of panels without substantially degrading the max-min terminal rate achieved by the centralized system architecture."

However, the “write-less, read-many” access pattern of the SRAM tier of KV cache in LLMs poses a reliability challenge. Combined with CMOS scaling, it markedly accelerates aging mechanisms like bias temperature instability (BTI). BTI increases the threshold voltage and slows the devices, posing a severe threat to the reliability of the high-speed KV Cache SRAMs. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an architecture that couples in-situ, path-faithful sensing while exposing interfaces and guidance for system-level reliability management.

In this paper, a near-field OAM channel model based on the electromagnetic information (EMI) theory is proposed, in which the dyadic Green’s function approach and discrete Fourier basis functions are utilized to accurately describe the characteristics of near-field channel and OAM signal propagation in practical scenarios, respectively. To improve the performance of misaligned transmission, a near-field OAM misalignment precoding scheme is presented according to the characteristics of the proposed channel model. Specifically, phase errors are compensated and the optimal power is assigned according to the channel condition, which can mitigate the channel capacity loss caused by the the inter-mode interference resulting from the misalignment. Numerical results show that the benefit brought by the polarization along the propagation direction is predominantly significant at short distances, and decreases rapidly to zero as the distance increases. Results also show that the presented scheme outperforms the conventional fixed parameter scheme and effectively reduces the effects of the misalignment in practical scenarios."

    "abstract": "As compared with large-scale infrastructures with much attention in the design, construction, and operation, there are a huge number of small-scale infrastructures with a relatively lower safety factor and under deficient conditions. These structures rarely own a complete structural health monitoring (SHM) system due to budget limitations. Given the fact that the neighbored infrastructures are subjected to correlated load effects, their responses are spatiotemporally correlated. In this study, the concept of neighbored SHM is thereby proposed for the neighbored small-scale infrastructures under a sparse, lightweight, and data-driven sensing framework. The cross-correlation coefficients (CCCs) of the responses from multiple neighbored structures are theoretically derived, and the associated probability space is subsequently modeled. An anomaly can be detected by estimating the deviations of CCCs from their baselines. A decision matrix is finally obtained to identify the abnormal elementary structure from a set of neighbored structures, where installing only a single sensor is required on each elementary structure. The proposed approach has a sound theoretical basis, light computational cost, and low implementing burdens; thus, it applies to small-scale infrastructures with large populations. Numerical and laboratory experiments are conducted using the mass-spring systems and simply-supported beams. Results have demonstrated that the developed neighbored SHM strategy is efficient and sensitive to structural anomaly."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates a magnet-free, two-position electromagnetic gear-shifting actuator designed for mobile machinery applications. Unlike conventional hydraulic, pneumatic, or electromechanical systems, the proposed actuator employs tangential electromagnetic forces to engage and disengage gears without permanent magnets, thereby eliminating concerns about cost, sustainability and supply chains of the rare-earth materials. A systematic design methodology is presented, starting with simplified two-coil configurations and progressing to multi-coil topologies with advanced flux-guiding strategies - resembling a linear actuator. Axisymmetric finite-element simulations are used to evaluate force characteristics, transient dynamics, and sensitivity to environmental variations. Particular emphasis is placed on the influence of surrounding ferromagnetic structures, which are shown to significantly alter the magnetic flux distribution and reduce actuation force if not properly accounted for. Case studies demonstrate that while two- and three-coil designs suffer from force sags and premature flux leakage, a multi-coil (e.g. six-coil) topology can sustain the required engagement forces in most environments, though performance degrades under full ferromagnetic enclosure. Results indicate that actuator performance strongly depends on spatial clearance from ferromagnetic components, rotor mass, and coil switching dynamics. The findings provide practical design guidelines for integrating magnet-free electromagnetic shifters into electric vehicle drivetrains, highlighting both the opportunities for sustainable materials and the challenges of flux management in constrained environments."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a multi-hole probe system developed for evaluation of high-performance paragliders-harness systems. The device integrates three differential pressure sensors, a barometric sensor and a three-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU). The differential pressure sensors connected to the probe’s ports allow the calculation of the flight dynamic pressure, as well as the angles of attack and sideslip, while the IMU provides attitude information. The probe is mounted on one of the paraglider’s front suspension lines, at a position between the canopy and the harness/pilot selected to minimize aerodynamic interference and simplify the installation. Wind tunnel calibration of the probe was conducted for flow velocities from 4.71 m/s to 25.05 m/s and angles of attack and sideslip within ±30°. The calibration uncertainties were within ±1.2° for angles and ±0.23 m/s for velocity inside the ±10° range at 12.5 m/s. Additionally, flight tests were conducted for in-flight validation using a Niviuk Peak 6 paraglider with Niviuk Arrow harness. The results showed satisfactory consistency of the data obtained from the different sensors. A trim velocity of 10.38 m/s and a glide ratio of 12.02 were measured, while at full speed these values increased to 16.98 m/s and decreased to 7.05, respectively. These are in line with those expected for the paraglider under testing."

    "abstract": "In rotating machinery fault diagnosis, the scarcity of fault samples significantly impacts the accuracy in industrial scenarios. This paper proposes a novel fault diagnosis model—spatial reconstruction and soft pooling local enhancement network (SR-SPNet), specifically designed for scenarios with limited sample availability. First, the collected vibration signals are transformed into images using continuous wavelet transform (CWT), thereby enriching feature representation and enabling convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to effectively capture relevant features. Next, a multi-scale dilated convolution (MDCNN) is employed to expand the receptive field. To reduce redundant computation and improve feature representation, a spatial reconstruction module (SRM) is introduced to differentiate key features. An improved residual (IR) block is then utilized to further extract crucial features, mitigating the risk of gradient vanishing during training. Additionally, a soft pooling local enhancement module (SPEM) is introduced to enhance the spatial feature representation of the feature maps. Experimental results on the CWRU public dataset and gearbox fault dataset demonstrate that, under conditions of limited sample size, SR-SPNet outperforms several comparative models, exhibiting superior diagnostic performance."

Traditional methods for predicting shrinkage typically rely on regression techniques based on elapsed time, or on models that incorporate mechanical properties, physical characteristics, and material age. This study introduces an innovative method for real-time monitoring of mortar shrinkage using 3D-printed piezoresistive sensors, with a focus on assessing the effect of metakaolin in high-volume fly ash–cement composites. The sensors, fabricated via fused deposition modelling using conductive thermoplastic polyurethane filament, were embedded within mortar samples to measure volumetric strain by monitoring changes in relative electrical resistance. Theoretical analyses revealed a strong correlation between mortar shrinkage and the piezoresistivity of the embedded sensors, which was experimentally validated with high precision (R² values exceeding 0.9, up to 0.99). To further refine predictions and address any discrepancies, an artificial intelligence model was developed to enhance prediction accuracy. This proposed method offers a promising tool for civil engineering applications, enabling enhanced structural safety, optimized maintenance, and extended lifecycle management."

First, we establish a cloud-edge-end collaborative communication and computation framework by integrating cloud computing with edge computing, accommodating terminal and edge server heterogeneity, and employing Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) communication along with key authentication mechanisms to ensure secure communications. Next, Digital Twin technology is utilized for real-time monitoring of the physical environment, considering simulation bias to construct accurate DT entities. Finally, we employ a DT-driven multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (DT-MADDPG) algorithm to derive the optimal task scheduling strategy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing schemes in terms of delay, energy cost, load balancing of edge servers, and Quality of Service (QoS) for terminals."

    "abstract": "Indoor 3D object detection serves as a fundamental task in computer vision and robotics. Existing research predominantly focuses on training domain-specific optimal models for individual datasets, yet it overlooks the potential value of capturing universal geometric attributes that can substantially enhance object detection performance across diverse domains. To resolve this gap, we propose COME, a novel and effective collaborative optimization framework designed to seamlessly integrate these universal attributes while preserving the domain-specific characteristics of each dataset domain. COME is built on VoteNet and incorporates a Cross-Domain Expert Parameter Sharing Strategy (CEPSS) that draws inspiration from the Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework. Its core innovation resides in the dual-expert design of CEPSS: domain-shared experts capture universal geometric relationships across datasets, whereas domain-specific experts encode unique features for individual datasets. This separation enables the model to focus on learning both generic and domain-specialized visual cues, without mutual interference. In addition, to dynamically adapt to different domains, we design a lightweight gating network that automatically selects relevant experts, eliminating irrelevant feature interference and enhancing model specialization. Compared to standard parameter-sharing architectures, this design significantly reduces gradient conflicts during multi-domain training. We further optimize computational efficiency by implementing low-rank structures for domain-shared and domain-specific experts, thus striking a better balance between memory overhead and detection performance. Experiments show that COME achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks, with acceptable parameter growth, and outperforms existing multi-domain detection methods."

    "abstract": "Vision-language models have the potential to enrich purely visual tasks by utilizing the combined representation of images/videos and corresponding textual descriptions. Recent advances in video anomaly detection have also integrated textual information to enhance the understanding of abnormal events. However, existing approaches often merge visual and textual modalities in a straightforward, bottom-up manner, failing to fully explore their interconnections. Moreover, textual captions themselves do not inherently convey “abnormal” attributes. Consequently, these joint representations tend to highlight all salient input features without adequately focusing on high-level tasks such as video anomaly detection. To direct the model’s attention towards anomalies more effectively, we propose incorporating a top-down mechanism into weakly supervised video anomaly detection tasks. A new Knowledge Sharing and Feedback (KSF) framework is designed to unify the representation of anomalies across both video and text. Specifically, we develop a category pattern sharing module that performs knowledge matching, acting as an alignment bridge between abnormal events and their corresponding descriptions. This ensures consistent representations for identical anomalies while maintaining distinct representations for different ones. Following this alignment process, matched high-level semantic priors are fed back into the forward path to enhance differentiation between abnormal and normal patterns. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in learning the implicit definition of anomaly patterns. The code is available at https://github.com/XJ-Cai/KSF."

    "abstract": "Background: AI-based coding assistants such as GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and Amazon CodeWhisperer are transforming software development by automating tasks, generating code, and supporting prototyping. While these tools enhance productivity, they also pose ethical risks, including copyright violations, insecure code, and ambiguous accountability. Such risks may remain hidden during development but emerge later as legal, social, or technical liabilities. Existing constructs, such as technical debt, are insufficient to capture these challenges. Aims: This paper introduces and formalizes the concept of ethical debt—the accumulation of unresolved ethical risks in AI assisted software development. The objective is to conceptualize ethical debt as a distinct construct, identify its causes and consequences, and establish a research agenda for addressing it. Method: Inspired by the metaphor of technical debt, the paper develops a framework for ethical debt that defines its sources, manifestations, and outcomes. The proposed research program involves theorizing its dimensions, mapping accountability across developers, AI systems, and organizations, and designing empirical approaches for its detection and mitigation. Results: Illustrative cases and a structured research agenda demonstrate how ethical risks, typically invisible in early development, can be systematically surfaced and addressed. Conclusions: By framing hidden ethical risks as a form of debt, this work provides both a theoretical foundation and a practical pathway for responsible AI-enhanced software engineering. Ethical debt makes intangible risks visible and actionable, offering guidance for researchers, practitioners, and organizations to integrate ethical responsibility into modern software development."

    "abstract": "Background: Hybrid work, which combines remote and office work, has become common after the Covid-19 pandemic. While many software companies embrace hybrid work to retain talent, this shift challenges agile software development, which values in-person collaboration. However, adaptation is central to agility, so agile companies are adjusting to their evolving needs, including the rise of hybrid work. Aims: This study explores how different types of companies organize hybrid work in agile software development to fit their unique organizational contexts. Method: We conducted a comparative multiple case study based on 39 semi-structured interviews with developers, product owners, specialists, and managers from two companies. We studied two agile software development units at the Finnish R&D site of Ericsson, a mature global telecommunications company, and one unit at Kempower, a young Finnish industrial company. Results: The study found that hybrid work guidelines, infrastructures, events, and communities in agile software development varied significantly across the units, yet employees in each unit generally reported satisfaction with their arrangements. The approaches were shaped by multiple factors, e.g., how team members were dispersed geographically, whether collaboration was mainly internal or included external partners, and the company's maturity. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that there is no one-size-fits-all approach for agile software development in a hybrid work environment. Instead, the successful adoption of hybrid work requires context awareness."

Refactoring is a common way to improve code quality by restructuring it, often removing these code smells. While many recommendations exist on how to refactor code smells, we do not fully understand how developers how they are removed by developers in the real world. Aim: In this study, we aim to investigate the evolution of code smells and the impact of applied refactoring techniques. Method: Our study addresses this gap by investigating both implementation and design smells and the refactoring techniques developers use to remove them. We also explore how often code smells are removed using established refactoring techniques. We analyzed 212,664 commits from 87 open-source Java projects using both automated tools and manual review to understand the relationship between code smells and refactoring. Results: Our key findings include: a) Extract method refactoring is most effective at fixing multiple smell types, b) Most applied refactorings do not remove code smells, c) About 82% of removed code smells are “dangling” i.e., they are removed without a matching refactoring technique, and d) Design smells typically last longer in codebases than implementation smells. Conclusions: This research improves our understanding of the interplay between code smells and refactoring effectiveness. Our results can help researchers develop better tools and guide software engineers in making their refactoring processes more efficient."

This study analyzes a set of precipitation-based climate indices (RX1day, RX5day, SDII, CWD, R10mm, R20mm, R95pTOT, R99pTOT) and assesses the impact of climate change on the onset and cessation of the rainy season, as well as on intra-seasonal dry spells in Burkina Faso. We use CMIP6 climate model outputs downscaled to a 25 km spatial resolution. Projections are evaluated for the near future (2021–2050) and the far future (2071–2100), relative to the historical reference period (1981–2010), under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways: SSP2-4.5 (intermediate) and SSP5-8.5 (high-emission, fossil-fuel–intensive). Model performance over the country is first assessed, then the spatiotemporal evolution of precipitation and extreme events is examined using ETCCDI (Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices) metrics. We further investigate the evolution of maximum consecutive dry days (CDD) during the core rainy season (June–September), and the timing of rainy season onset and cessation. All analyses are carried out using Python and Climate Data Operators (CDO). The results indicate an increase in mean annual precipitation, exceeding 360 mm in the Sahelian zone, and a marked intensification of extreme rainfall events, with more heavy and very heavy rains that favor flooding, and destructive runoff. This emerging rainfall regime is associated with delayed onsets and cessations in many areas, earlier cessations in parts of the Sahelian zone, and longer intra-seasonal dry spells. Overall, total rainfall is projected to increase, but with improved onsets and poorer intra-seasonal distribution, leading to more frequent and damaging dry spells."

While prior studies have explored these problems in general software systems, their interplay in machine learning (ML)-based projects remains largely under-examined. Aims: In this study, we aim to investigate the prevalence of community smells and their relationship with SATD in open-source ML projects, analyzing data at the release level. Methods: We analyzed <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 5 5 ~ M L}$</tex>-based systems across multiple releases to examine the prevalence of ten community smell types. Then we detected SATD at the release level and applied statistical analysis to examine its correlation with community smells. Next, we considered the six identified types of SATD to determine which community smells are the most associated with each debt category. Finally, we analyzed how the community smells and SATD evolve over the releases, uncovering project size-dependent trends and shared trajectories. Results: Community smells are found to be widespread, exhibiting distinct distribution patterns across small, medium and large projects. Certain smells, such as Radio Silence and Organizational Silos, are strongly correlated with higher SATD occurrences, while authority- and communication-related smells often co-occur with persistent code and design debt. Temporal analysis revealed shared evolutionary trajectories of smells and SATD, influenced by project size. Conclusion: Our findings emphasize the importance of early detection and mitigation of socio-technical issues to maintain the long-term quality and sustainability of ML-based systems."

The findings indicate that BERT achieves an accuracy of 80 percent, outperforming traditional models and demonstrating the effectiveness of transformer-based approaches in data-constrained political environments.

While machine and deep learning models achieve high accuracy, their dependence on large datasets and limited interpretability restricts operational use. This study presents an interpretable forecasting framework combining calendar-based day-type classification with group-based Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). The model captures recurring demand patterns by classifying weekdays, weekends, holidays, and bridging holidays, and applies MLR with lagged load inputs to each group. A walk-forward validation strategy simulates real-world conditions through sequential training and testing. Using load data from Thailand (48 half-hourly periods) and three European countries, such as France, Denmark, and Sweden (24 hourly periods) from 2019–2021, results show that larger training sets consistently improve accuracy. Thailand's mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) decreased from 15.07% to 3.62%, while European datasets showed higher variability. Bridging holidays remained the most challenging to predict. The findings demonstrate that structured calendar features combined with transparent statistical models can yield accurate and interpretable forecasts across diverse climatic regions."

Furthermore, we design an automatic gain control algorithm to achieve offset stability and optimize robustness and sensitivity with minimal antijamming loss. The experimental results indicate that the number of visible satellites and the positioning availability of CPCLMS, post anti-interference, are significantly higher than those of the LMS algorithm and slightly higher than those of the NVLMS algorithm. Additionally, the computational complexity of this method is significantly lower than that of the NVLMS anti jamming algorithm, highlighting its advantages."

Traditional DevSecOps practices provide continuous integration and delivery pipelines, yet they are not inherently equipped to enforce dynamic compliance across multicloud ecosystems. This paper presents an automated complianceaware DevSecOps framework for AI-driven IoT data streams, integrating cloud-native machine learning services across Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure. The framework introduces a compliance orchestration layer that continuously monitors regulatory requirements such as HIPAA, GDPR, and ISO 27001, embedding them directly into data ingestion, transformation, and analytics pipelines. Cloud-native ML models are deployed to detect anomalies, classify workloads, and adapt security policies in real time, while monitoring ensures interoperability and resilience across providers. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed framework achieves significant reductions in compliance drift, improves detection of misconfigurations, and maintains low-latency processing for high-velocity IoT data streams. By unifying DevSecOps automation with compliance-driven machine learning in multi-cloud environments, this work provides a resilient foundation for enterprises seeking to operationalize secure, regulation-aligned IoT analytics at scale."

The presented paper suggests that an artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT) and gamification based technology can be used to conquer a Sustainable Recycling Ecosystem to such problems. Resource algorithms based on AI recognize items to be recycled in mixed waste. Smart bins are IoT devices that constantly control the amount of waste in the surrounding area and schedule a pick-up time, and it is the most productive mode of operation. Gamified reward system is a method of motivating citizens to recycle and using redeemable points based on the contribution. All these details combined enable the users to be more interactive and efficient in the long-term waste collection in a sustainable way.

Training is physics-informed via pixel and structural terms, a spectralangle objective to curb cross-band drift, and a differentiable index loss that preserves NDVI/NDWI/NDMI relationships under hinge cGAN supervision. Inputs are prepared with Refined Lee despeckling and polarization/texture features to stabilize learning while retaining edges. Evaluation emphasizes decision usefulness as well as fidelity: frozen classifiers and segmenters operate on real optics, generated optics, or SAR alone, and we report SSIM/PSNR/MSE alongside spectrumaware (SAM, ERGAS) and perceptual (LPIPS, FID) measures, plus index-consistency statistics. Robustness to region/season shifts and S1-S2 pairing gaps and interpretability analyses relating errors to SAR texture/geometry clarify when spectra are hardest to recover.

However, traditional models frequently overlook scenarios where the node count remains constant, instead prioritizing node growth. In this work, we depart from the assumptions of node number variation and preferential attachment to present an innovative model that conceptualizes node degree fluctuations as a state-dependent random walk process with stasis and variable diffusion coefficient. We show that this model yields stochastic dynamic networks with stable scale-free properties. Through comprehensive theoretical and numerical analyses, we demonstrate that the degree distribution converges to a power-law distribution, provided that the lowest degree state within the network is not an absorbing state. Furthermore, we investigate the resilience of the fraction of the largest component and the average shortest path length following deliberate attacks on the network. By using three real-world networks, we confirm that the proposed model accurately replicates actual data. The proposed model thus elucidates mechanisms by which networks, devoid of growth and preferential attachment features, can still exhibit power-law distributions and be used to simulate and study the resilience of attacked fixed-size scale-free networks."

A brief survey has shown that traditional digital watermarking methods such as LSB, DCT, DWT, and SVD do not tolerate compression, geometric distortions, noise and hybrid/combined attacks. Furthermore, these conventional techniques lack of adaptability to various media formats. Recently, with the exponential developments in the fields artificial intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning, it has been proven to strengthen and help the creation of robust and invisible digital watermarking systems that jointly optimize imperceptibility and resilience. At this regard, this article proposes a novel simplified AIbased digital watermarking approach that exceeds the performance of the commonly used approaches such as HiDDeN and InvisMark by taking into account their computational complexity, reproducibility, and deployment in complex and constrained environments. The proposed method in this study is focused on the use of an encoder-decoder pipline merged with latent space insertion, adversarial learning, and resilient perturbation simulation. These components involvement was considered in the design of the solution to achieve an optimal balance between robustness, efficiency and invisibility. In contrast, available approaches focuse merely and basically on processing images, while this study also extend digital watermaking to videos by implementing 3D CNNs and ConvLSTMs. Improvements over the original study, these include conserving the core concept of the idea behind the study: temporal consistency and stability due to distortion and codec reencoding. Other issues including security and regulatory considerations are discussed in this work with respect to responsible use in real-world applications. compliance with data protection frameworks. Further, The concerns should be checked and verified with regard to resilience and critical ethical against removal attacks using AI Advanced techniques.

The framework models sensors as integral components of logical units, which together constitute the nodes of a distributed observer network. Each node of the network has only partial access to system information—restricted to local measurements—and can exchange data solely with its direct neighbors. The observer design challenge is therefore split into two complementary tasks: (i) determining local output injection gains to intelligently use locally available data, and (ii) defining diffusive coupling gains that, through a consensus mechanism, compensate for incomplete information. The proposed synthesis is cast as a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMI) conditions, which can be efficiently solved via semidefinite programming, yielding a tractable design procedure. The effectiveness of the distributed observer is finally demonstrated through a numerical simulation example."

In this paper, we conduct a controlled experiment with 30 participants from academia and industry to examine the impact of test smells in manual test descriptions. Method. Specifically, we analyze whether the presence of two test smells, Ambiguous Test and Eager Action, result in (1) increased test execution time, (2) a higher number of steps needed to complete the tests, and (3) high divergency on the perceived success of the tests outcomes. Results. Our findings reveal that an Ambiguous Test can increase execution time by up to five times and screen flow by up to seven times. In addition, if the Eager Actions are dependent on one another, there is no increase in execution time and screen flow. Conclusions. It highlights the need for better design of manual test descriptions to improve clarity, consistency, and performance execution."

    "abstract": "Optimizing large-scale single-quadrotor trajectories over extended distances and durations is challenging due to intricate spatio-temporal coupling. Existing methods decouple the problem into interleaved spatial and temporal steps to reduce complexity, causing optimality loss and low success rates under constraints and at scale. This article proposes a method that leverages spatio-temporal coupling to generate large-scale trajectories connecting hundreds of waypoints with guaranteed optimality and high success rates. The method initiates by constructing a feature space where a feature-explicit formulation (FEF) of the spatio-temporal trajectory optimization problem is established. In a bilevel framework, the lower level solves spatial optimization, while the upper level addresses time allocation. By virtue of feature explicitness, the lower-level solution of FEF reveals dependency between the spatial and temporal features of the equality constrained optimal trajectory, and is referred to as the feature flow. Enforcing feature flow in the inequality constrained time allocation problem effectively turns the bilevel problem into a single-level temporal feature optimization problem. A key contribution is the analytic derivation of bilevel gradients through feature flow, enabling simultaneous spatio-temporal search during temporal optimization. The resulting method is guaranteed to converge to a local optimum under a mild tightening of constraint boundaries. Additionally, FEF is stable and efficient. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method outperforms existing bilevel approaches in terms of optimality, stability, and efficiency. It reduces trajectory cost by 29% in highly constrained settings and optimizes large-scale trajectories of up to 500 waypoints with success rates above 90%."

Traditional deterministic field solvers provide high accuracy but suffer from significant computational inefficiencies when handling large-scale mesh structures. Conversely, stochastic methods offer rapid computation speeds but are inherently limited to single-point solutions, preventing them from effectively addressing nonlinear thermal problems. To address this challenge, we propose a virtual path-based stochastic solver that enables efficient leakage-aware thermal simulation. The virtual path algorithm decomposes each real path in Brownian motion into virtual paths, extending stochastic solvers from single-point solutions to regional solutions, allowing a stochastic method to achieve full-chip thermal simulation for the first time, thus enabling the handling of nonlinearity. Additionally, we further accelerate the iteration process by reusing the path trajectories from the first solution process. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves a speedup of 20.17× to 52.23× compared to the state-of-the-art solver 3D-ICE on 4 GPUs across various scenarios while maintaining comparable accuracy."

    "abstract": "Currently, Remote Sensing Image Change Detection (RSICD) based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Transformer has achieved significant advances. However, the existing methods often suffer from insufficient global dependency modeling capabilities or low computational efficiency. Furthermore, they struggle to handle complex background interference effectively, leading to imprecise detection of change region boundaries. To address these limitations, in this paper, a Mamba-based CD network for binary CD tasks, named Mamba-CD, has been proposed, in which VMamba is adopted as the backbone, enabling efficient global dependency modeling with linear complexity. Firstly, a Change Region-aware Attention Mechanism (CRAM) is designed to enhance features in change regions while suppressing features in background regions. The generated attention maps are constrained by a Boundary Loss function to strengthen the network's capability for the refined localization of change region boundaries. Subsequently, a Gated Recursive Context Refinement Module (GRCRM) is proposed. It utilizes a gating mechanism to filter out unimportant features and progressively fuses high-level global semantic information with low-level features in a recursive manner, thereby enhancing feature representation capability. Experimental results on three public datasets of LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and DSIFN-CD demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art CD methods, the proposed Mamba-CD achieves superior detection performance with lower model complexity and yields more precise boundaries of change regions."

    "abstract": "One of the primary challenges in widespread use of Switched Reluctance Motor (SRM) drives is the need to monitor rotor position for proper commutation of the stator phases. Additionally, the current magnitude in each phase must be measured and accurately controlled within a specific band. The sensors required to satisfy these functions are bulky, expensive, and prone to errors. Moreover, the position sensor, which is mounted on the shaft of the machine, reduces the compactness of the overall system. Rather than relying on current sensors for control or using complex methods to estimate rotor position, this paper presents a low-cost alternative that directly senses the leakage flux of the stator windings using Hall effect sensors that are mounted axially from the end wings of the stator. Each Hall effect sensor is positioned in front of one of the concentrated end windings of the stator phases. Since the sensed magnetic leakage flux offers a one-to-one correspondence with phase current and position of the rotor, a seamless control of the SRM is possible. The proposed control method is significantly more cost-effective, compact, and robust, enabling the development of a fully integrated inverter for SRMs. Additionally, the proposed method can detect the initial rotor position without requiring any extra devices, thereby providing a reliable startup process. Simulation and experimental results are provided to validate the claims."

To address this issue, we propose a causally federated graph neural network (CFGNN) for solving MO-FLPs in a privacy-preserving manner. We represent MO-FLPs as bipartite graphs to capture relationships between facility sites and customer zones. On each client, dual graph neural networks (GNNs) learn representations of nodes and edges, while a causal instance graph extracts stable interinstance relationships. On the server side, a federated causal hypergraph module facilitates collaborative learning without compromising data privacy. In addition, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) surrogate model with causal embeddings generates approximate Pareto-optimal solutions. Extensive experiments on a newly constructed benchmark dataset with different scales demonstrate that CFGNN achieves superior solution quality and generalization performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches."

    "abstract": "Port-Hamiltonian neural networks (pHNNs) are emerging as a powerful modeling tool that integrates physical laws with deep learning techniques. While most research has focused on modeling the entire dynamics of interconnected systems, the potential for identifying and modeling individual subsystems while operating as part of a larger system has been overlooked. This study addresses this gap by introducing a novel method for using pHNNs to identify such subsystems based solely on input-output measurements. By utilizing the inherent compositional property of the port-Hamiltonian systems, we developed an algorithm that learns the dynamics of individual subsystems, without requiring direct access to their internal states. On top of that, by choosing an output error (OE) model structure, we have been able to handle measurement noise effectively. The efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated through tests on interconnected systems, including multi-physics scenarios, highlighting its potential for identifying subsystem dynamics and facilitating their integration into new interconnected models."

    "abstract": "The soft open point (SOP) can improve the dynamic regulation capability of distribution networks and mitigate the adverse impacts of distributed generations (DGs). The back-to-back (B2B) link of voltage source converters has been regarded as the sole SOP topology for a long time, but the high cost hinders the application of SOPs and the upgradation of distribution grids. Some new topologies, such as the solid-state transformers (SSTs) with serial shunt structures, have been discussed as alternative SOP solutions recently. In this work, a cost-effective solution of the SOP based on the hybrid transformer (HT) is proposed. The combination control of the HT, including voltage coordination and power regulation, is analyzed for stable operation under steady and dynamic conditions. The performance is also investigated and compared with that of the B2B and SST schemes. The total converter capacity of the HT-based SOP is highly reduced. It is only sixteen percent of that of the B2B scheme and twenty-eight percent of that of the SST scheme. Efficiency can also be enhanced by 2.7% and 0.9%, respectively. Simulations and experiments have been completed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed solution."

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for on-device training of deep neural networks (DNNs) aims to leverage personal data for high-performance applications while addressing privacy concerns and reducing communication latency. However, resource-constrained platforms face significant challenges due to the intensive computational and memory demands of DNN training. Tensor decomposition emerges as a promising approach to compress model size without sacrificing accuracy. Nevertheless, training tensorized neural networks (TNNs) incurs non-trivial overhead and severe performance degradation on conventional accelerators due to complex tensor shaping requirements. To address these challenges, we propose FETTA, an algorithm and hardware co-optimization framework for efficient TNN training. On the algorithm side, we develop a contraction sequence search engine (CSSE) to identify the optimal contraction sequence with the minimal computational overhead. On the hardware side, FETTA features a flexible and efficient architecture equipped with a reconfigurable contraction engine (CE) array to support diverse dataflows. Furthermore, butterfly-based distribution and reduction networks are implemented to perform flexible tensor shaping operations during computation. Evaluation results demonstrate that FETTA achieves reductions of 20.5×/100.9×, 567.5×/45.03×, and 11609.7×/4544.8× in terms of processing latency, energy, and energy-delay product (EDP) over GPU and TPU, respectively. Moreover, working on the tensorized training, FETTA outperforms prior accelerators with a speedup of 3.87 ∼ 14.63×, and an energy efficiency improvement of 1.41 ∼ 2.73× on average."

The main advantage of this method is the direct applicability of the classical Pontryagin maximum principle. Several examples, including the generation of noiseless and noisy qubit gates, as well as population transfer in open two-level systems, are discussed."

The demand at each station is influenced by travel times and incentives to charge. Vehicle types and behaviors (thermal vs. electric, must/may/not charge) are considered. This results in a bi-level optimization problem, which is solved using a Branch-And-Bound approach enhanced with pruning techniques for improved efficiency. Our experiment integrates three levels of optimization: maximizing revenue by optimizing the placement of stations when maximizing their pricing strategies, while minimizing the demand derived from the congestion game model. We examine the total travel time and maximizing revenue does not increase congestion."

Different from the conventional containment task, external disturbances are considered in the dynamic model of followers and human instructions are modeled as the control input for the dynamics of leaders to enhance the maneuverability of the quadrotor team. This framework consists of two parts. First, a distributed trajectory generator is proposed to derive containment state reference for each follower using only observable leaders’ data. Based on the distributed trajectory generator, the containment control problem is transformed into an optimal robust tracking control problem. Furthermore, a zero-sum differential game-based position containment controller is proposed to solve the optimization. To obtain the game’s optimal solution, a critic neural network (NN) is employed with a novel weight adaption law using dynamic regression extension and mixing (DREM) technology. Unlike conventional gradient-based methods, this law achieves weight convergence under relaxed persistent excitation (PE) conditions while enhancing the transient performance for the training of the critic NN. Finally, theoretical analysis is given to prove the stability of the closed-loop system and the efficacy of the proposed control method is demonstrated through simulation."

It connects several types of data gathering, advanced forecasting, user classification, finding out abnormalities and smart techniques to lead in smart energy management. The software captures instant and history data from smart meters like energy use, voltage, current, what devices are using energy, weather information and tariffs used. Applying linear imputation, Z-score filtering and time-series resampling guarantees that only quality data is used. When TCNs are applied to forecast energy demand, they achieve an accuracy of 92.63%, MAE of 0.2092 and RMSE of 0.2007. Clustering through Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) and UMAP made it possible to detect consumption patterns with a silhouette score of 0.7374 or higher. Around 26.45% of energy can be saved because of the role played by DDPG and Q-learning in the framework. Also, residual analysis and hybrid models in the anomaly detection module make it possible to identify unusual consumption patterns promptly, with a precision of 78.67% and a recall of 80.23%. Benchmark datasets were used to confirm the framework and to test it with standard models such as ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM and Random Forest. Every time, the system showed that EnergyTrackCore had better performance and reliability than its competitors. EnergyTrackCore supports both homes and factories, offering utilities and users with real-time updates, forecasted control and a more organized use of energy, leading to a datainformed, expanded approach to sustainability."

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide deployment flexibility and line-of-sight connectivity for coverage. The integration of these technologies presents challenges in the optimization of UAV deployment, radio resources, and semantic content fidelity. This paper proposes a framework for multi-UAV-enabled semantic communication that uses coordinated multipoint transmission. We formulate a problem to maximize the sum Quality of Experience (QoE) of all users by optimizing UAV positioning, cooperative beamforming, and semantic compression ratios, which results in a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. To solve this problem, we develop a hybrid alternating learning and optimization (HALO) algorithm. HALO decomposes the problem, using proximal policy optimization for discrete semantic compression decisions and an alternating optimization method for the continuous UAV positioning and beamforming variables. Simulation results show that the proposed framework achieves QoE improvements over benchmark methods, which validates the benefits of joint optimization in semantic-aware UAV networks."

Spatial temporal graph convolutional networks (ST-GCN) have been applied to extract gait features effectively, enabling enhanced emotion recognition. However, existing methods do not account for subtle movement cues that are intricately linked to human emotions, resulting in a lack of representation of emotion intensity. Additionally, these methods fail to consider the cyclic nature of gait, focusing only on local dependencies in the temporal domain. To tackle these limitations, we propose an innovative three-streams graph neural network model PMF-GCN (Posture-Movement-Frequency-enhanced Graph Convolutional Network). First, we introduce for the first time in gait emotion recognition, the integration of movement features from translational and rotational perspectives, combined with frequency-domain data, to capture emotion intensity and global dependencies. Then, we devise a novel adaptive feature fusion mechanism (TR-AFM), which achieves effective extraction of spatial-temporal-specific emotion features from gaits through temporal and spatial attention mechanisms, as well as gated units. Comprehensive experiments on two public datasets show that PMF-GCN achieves leading performance in gait emotion recognition, and achieves state-of-the-art performance."

Such a problem is relevant when the simulated and the real environment differ. Such a problem poses significant additional challenges compared to the non-robust CMDP problem and the unconstrained robust MDP problem. We seek to characterize the number of iterations required to bound both the sub-optimality gap and the violations by at most ϵ. We observe that the primal-dual-based approaches that achieves iteration complexity bounds for non-robust CMDP cannot achieve the same in the robust CMDP case. We consider a modified problem where we consider the convex hull of the policy-spaces and the decision becomes the simplex over the policy space. We propose a primal-dual based approach and show that ϵ suboptimality gap and violation bound can be achieved after O(1/ϵ<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>) iterations. We also show that an extra-gradient based approach can achieve ϵ suboptimality gap and violation bound can be achieved after O(1/ϵ) iterations.

We propose a stopping criterion for Bayesian optimization when the mean function of the Gaussian process surrogate model is uncertain, but modeled with a prior. The prior induces a probability distribution over surrogate models, which our criterion uses to evaluate the probability that a model will be stopped under an existing stopping criterion. We demonstrate that our criterion will eventually terminate BO, with high probability of achieving a desired accuracy to the optimal value. Empirical analysis on a controller tuning problem for an autonomous underwater vehicle suggests that our method can terminate BO with high accuracy solutions, particularly for low dimensional problems."

    "abstract": "In modern robotics, addressing the lack of accurate state space information in real-world scenarios has led to a significant focus on utilizing visuomotor observation to provide safety assurances. Although supervised learning methods, such as imitation learning, have demonstrated potential in synthesizing control policies based on visuomotor observations, they require ground truth safety labels for the complete dataset and do not provide formal safety assurances. On the other hand, traditional control-theoretic methods like Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) Reachability provide formal safety guarantees but depend on accurate knowledge of system dynamics, which is often unavailable for high-dimensional visuomotor data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach to synthesize a semi-supervised safe visuomotor policy using barrier certificates that integrate the strengths of model-free supervised learning and model-based control methods. This framework synthesizes a provably safe controller without requiring safety labels for the complete dataset and ensures completeness guarantees for both the barrier certificate and the policy. We validate our approach through distinct case studies: an inverted pendulum system and the obstacle avoidance of an autonomous mobile robot, and compare with baselines. Simulation videos of both case studies can be viewed on the project webpage."

However, the fault-related components in vibration signals are often buried by the strong background noises, which makes it difficult to perform feature extraction. To address this challenge, a new deep neural network (DNN), multi-scale and multi-orientation Log-Gabor network (MMLGNet) is constructed in this study to extract features from complex vibration signals. Firstly, log-Gabor filters are embedded in MMLGNet to manipulate the learned convolution filters, which allows features to be extracted directly from the vibration signal. Secondly, a multi-scale and multi-orientation log-Gabor (MMLG) layer is proposed in MMLGNet, in which the Gabor filters with different scales and orientations are used to extract the features from vibration signals. The impulses that contain fault information can be highlighted through MMLG to enhance the feature learning performance of the model. Thirdly, an energy entropy-based feature fusion method is proposed to address the issue of redundant feature extraction, which is proposed to enhance channels with strong impulsive features. Finally, the effectiveness of the MMLGNet is validated by the experiments of bearing fault diagnosis with two datasets. The results indicate that MMLGNet has a better feature learning ability than those state-of-the-art DNNs."

Identifying mild syndrome with small pathological regions serves as an ominous warning and is fundamental in the early diagnosis of diseases. While deep learning algorithms, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown promise in segmenting medical objects, analyzing small areas in medical images remains challenging. This difficulty arises due to information losses and compression defects from convolutional and pooling operations in CNNs, which become more pronounced as the network deepens, especially for small medical objects. To address these challenges, we propose a novel scale-variant attention-based network (SvANet) for accurately segmenting small-scale objects in medical images. The SvANet consists of scale-variant attention (SvAttn), cross-scale guidance, Monte Carlo attention (MCAttn), and Vision Transformer (ViT), which incorporates cross-scale features and alleviates compression artifacts for enhancing the discrimination of small medical objects. Quantitative experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of SvANet, achieving 96.12%, 96.11%, 89.79%, 84.15%, 80.25%, 73.05%, and 72.58% in mean Dice (mDice) coefficient for segmenting kidney tumors, skin lesions, hepatic tumors, polyps, surgical excision cells, retinal vasculatures, and sperms, which occupy less than 1% of the image areas in KiTS23, ISIC 2018, ATLAS, PolypGen, TissueNet, FIVES, and SpermHealth datasets, respectively."

Recently, large language models (LLMs)-based AI agents have made signifi cant progress, enabling them to achieve human-like intelligence across various tasks. However, real human societies are often dynamic and complex, involving numerous individuals engaging in multimodal interactions. In this paper, taking e-commerce scenarios as an example, we present LMAgent, a very large scale and multimodal agents society based on multimodal LLMs. In LMAgent, besides freely chatting with friends, the agents can autonomously browse, purchase, and review products, even perform live streaming e-commerce. To simulate this complex system, we introduce a self-consistency prompting mechanism to augment agents' multimodal capabilities, resulting in significantly improved decision-making performance over the existing multi agent system. Moreover, we propose a fast memory mechanism combined with the small-world model to enhance system ef f iciency, which supports more than 10,000 agent simulations in a society. Experiments on agents' behavior show that these agents achieve comparable performance to humans in behavioral indicators. Furthermore, compared with the existing LLMs-based multi-agent system, more different and valuable phenomena are exhibited, such as herd behavior, which demonstrates the potential of LMAgent in credible large-scale social behavior simulations."

    "abstract": "Recent AI agents, such as ChatGPT and LLaMA, primarily rely on instruction tuning and reinforcement learning to calibrate the output of large language models (LLMs) with human intentions, ensuring the outputs are harmless and helpful. Existing methods heavily depend on the manual annotation of high-quality positive samples, while contending with issues such as noisy labels and minimal distinctions between preferred and dispreferred response data. However, readily available toxic samples with clear safety distinctions are often filtered out, removing valuable negative references that could aid LLMs in safety alignment. In response, we propose Positive–Toxic Self-Alignment (PT-ALIGN), a novel safety self-alignment approach that minimizes human supervision by automatically refining positive and toxic samples and performing fine-grained dual instruction tuning. Positive samples are harmless responses, while toxic samples deliberately contain extremely harmful content, serving as a new supervisory signal. Specifically, we utilize LLM itself to iteratively generate and refine training instances by only exploring fewer than 50 human annotations. We then employ two losses, i.e., maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and fine-grained unlikelihood training (UT), to jointly learn to enhance the LLM’s safety. The MLE loss encourages an LLM to maximize the generation of harmless content based on positive samples. Conversely, the fine-grained UT loss guides the LLM to minimize the output of harmful words based on toxic samples at the token-level, thereby guiding the model to decouple safety from effectiveness, directing it toward safer fine-tuning objectives, and increasing the likelihood of generating helpful and reliable content. Experiments on 9 popular open-source LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our PT-ALIGN for safety alignment, while maintaining comparable levels of helpfulness and usefulness."

The control unit is remote and communicates with the sensor and actuator through an imperfect wireless network. We consider a constant delay in the sensor-to-controller channel (uplink), and data loss in both sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator (downlink) channels. In our proposed scheme, data loss in each channel is modeled as an independent Bernoulli-distributed random process. To systematically handle the uplink delay, we first introduce an augmented discrete-time stochastic linear system (dt-ASLS) by concatenating all states and control inputs that sufficiently represent the stateinput evolution of the original dt-SLS under the delay and packet loss constraints. We then leverage control barrier certificates for dt-ASLS to synthesize a controller that ensures the stochastic safety of dt-SLS, guaranteeing that all trajectories remain outside unsafe regions with a quantified probabilistic bound. Our approach translates safety constraints into matrix inequalities, leading to an optimization problem that eventually quantifies the probability of satisfying the safety specification in the presence of communication imperfections. We validate our results on an RLC circuit subject to both constant delay and probabilistic data loss."

    "abstract": "Nowadays, digital images have been utilized extensively on the internet, particularly in social media. Therefore, image watermarking is necessary and has been developed to protect the copyright of the original image, as it is prone to unauthorized modifications. In this study, image watermarking utilizing NSST, IWT, DCT, and SVD has been proposed for robust copyright protection. The red layer of the image is used for embedding the watermark. After applying NSST and IWT to produce the low-frequency coefficient, divide the coefficient into blocks of size 8 plus 8. DCT is then applied, and eight coefficients from the middle frequency of DCT are selected and applied with SVD to embed the watermark based on a pre-defined rule. Based on the results, the proposed technique has produced a PSNR of 44.9300 and an SSIM of 0.9965. Furthermore, the proposed technique also demonstrated better performance in terms of robustness, as it can extract the embedded watermark even after the watermarked image is subjected to various image processing attacks."

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth in electromagnetic device quantities, various forms of communication interference have emerged, significantly impacting the accuracy of signal classification. Existing classification algorithms mainly focus on unintentional interference, such as co-channel interference and noise, with limited research on the problem of malicious interference in Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) signal classification. This study proposes an intelligent MIMO signal classification algorithm based on fractional graph feature fusion. Initially, a high-order cumulant tensor model is constructed and regularized tensor decomposition is applied to reconstruct the MIMO signals. Subsequently, a feature extraction model using a fractional wavelet scattering network is designed to effectively capture the distinguishing features of signal constellations. Finally, a collaborative representation classifier based on the Grassmann manifold is utilized to amplify the differences between modulation categories, thereby improving classification performance. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm effectively suppresses common communication interference and successfully classifies MIMO signals. Compared to existing methods, the proposed approach demonstrates significant performance improvements without requiring prior knowledge, such as noise power or channel coefficients."

The drift space, introduced between the two SWS sections, is theoretically optimized to enhance phase correlation between the electron beam and RF wave, reaching the second SWS (SWS2). This enables a more effective beam–wave interaction in the second section, contributing toward improved energy conversion. The sectioning of the SWS allows clear separation between the beam modulation region and the energy exchange region, while the drift space provides a feedback mechanism that reinforces stronger velocity modulation at the first SWS (SWS1). The drift length is estimated analytically and validated through a full 3-D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. A more compact beam bunching is observed in phase space, resulting in a simulated microwave conversion efficiency of 50% at 410 kV, 4.72 kA, with a guiding magnetic field of 0.5 T. The electronic efficiency, observed from the power lost in the collector, corroborates the simulated power conversion efficiency."

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently attracted wide attentions in various areas such as 3D navigation, Virtual Reality (VR) and 3D simulation, due to its photorealistic and efficient rendering performance. High-quality reconstrution of 3DGS relies on sufficient splats and a reasonable distribution of these splats to fit real geometric surface and texture details, which turns out to be a challenging problem. We present GeoTexDensifier, a novel geometry-texture-aware densification strategy to reconstruct high-quality Gaussian splats which better comply with the geometric structure and texture richness of the scene. Specifically, our GeoTexDensifier framework carries out an auxiliary texture-aware densification method to produce a denser distribution of splats in fully textured areas, while keeping sparsity in low-texture regions to maintain the quality of Gaussian point cloud. Meanwhile, a geometry-aware splitting strategy takes depth and normal priors to guide the splitting sampling and filter out the noisy splats whose initial positions are far from the actual geometric surfaces they aim to fit, under a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Validation of Depth Ratio Change</i> checking. With the help of relative monocular depth prior, such geometry-aware validation can effectively reduce the influence of scattered Gaussians to the final rendering quality, especially in regions with weak textures or without sufficient training views. The texture-aware densification and geometry-aware splitting strategies are fully combined to obtain a set of high-quality Gaussian splats. We experiment our GeoTexDensifier framework on various datasets and compare our Novel View Synthesis results to other state-of-the-art 3DGS approaches, with detailed quantitative and qualitative evaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in producing more photorealistic 3DGS models."

This study introduces a novel SSL approach, Information-Maximized Soft Variable Discretization (IMSVD), for image representation learning. Specifically, IMSVD softly discretizes each variable in the latent space, enabling the estimation of their probability distributions over training batches and allowing the learning process to be directly guided by information measures. Motivated by the MultiView assumption, we propose an information-theoretic objective function to learn transform-invariant, non-trivial, and redundancy-minimized representation features. We then derive a joint-cross entropy loss function for self-supervised image representation learning, which theoretically enjoys superiority over the existing methods in reducing feature redundancy. Notably, our non-contrastive IMSVD method statistically performs contrastive learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of IMSVD on various downstream tasks in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Thanks to our variable discretization, the embedding features optimized by IMSVD offer unique explainability at the variable level. IMSVD has the potential to be adapted to other learning paradigms.

This paper aims to address the question \"what do efficient flow fields for mixing look like, and how do they behave?\" We approach this question by developing a framework which is inspired by the dynamic and geometric approach to optimal mass transport. Specifically, we formulate the fluid mixing problem as an optimal control problem where the dynamics are given by the continuity equation together with an incompressibility constraint. We show that within this framework, the set of reachable fluid configurations can formally be endowed with the structure of an infinite-dimensional Riemannian manifold, with a metric which is induced by the control effort, and that flow fields which are maximally efficient at mixing correspond to geodesics in this Riemannian space."

This paper presents a Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) frame-work enhanced with motion planning and control strategies to robustly manage these challenges in mixed traffic environments with heterogeneous powertrains and dynamics. The proposed control architecture builds upon previous CACC research by incorporating real-time trajectory planning for cut-in vehicles, dynamic time-gap adjustments, and coordinated emergency braking maneuvers. A hierarchical control structure is implemented, with low-level controllers ensuring accurate longitudinal tracking across different vehicle types, and a high-level motion planner handling dynamic interactions within the vehicle string. The system is validated through real-world experiments on test tracks, where vehicles with diverse power-train configurations (internal combustion engine, hybrid, and electric) execute CACC with dynamic gap management. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances vehicle string stability, minimizes disturbance amplification, and ensures safe cut-in/cut-out transitions while maintaining reasonable time-gap policies. Additionally, coordinated emergency braking across heterogeneous vehicles is evaluated, revealing significant improvements in response time, braking consistency, and collision risk reduction. These findings demonstrate the practicality of CACC deployment in heterogeneous traffic, improving both safety and robustness in dynamic real-world environments."

However, the current traffic situation is intricate and diverse, with an array of traffic information like traffic lights at intersections, traffic signs, and traffic direction boards along the roadside filling the roads. During driving, due to certain factors, drivers might overlook such traffic information, potentially resulting in minor road accidents such as speeding and honking in no - honking zones. To tackle this problem, a project is proposed which combines Internet of Things (IoT) technology with traffic lights to develop a system for obtaining traffic information. This system is composed of a visual information collection end and a data processing and execution end. The visual information collection end uploads the collected traffic sign information to the data processing and execution end and shows it on an LCD screen. After analyzing the corresponding reminder statements, the data processing and execution end conveys the traffic information to the driver via the voice SYN6288 voice broadcast. By means of this system, traffic congestion and accidents can be mitigated, thus attaining the objective of optimizing traffic."

The solution of this problem enables stochastic guidance of spin states of a rigid body (e.g., spacecraft) over a hard deadline constraint by transferring a given initial state statistics to a desired terminal state statistics. This is an instance of generalized optimal transport over a nonlinear dynamical system. While prior work has reported existence-uniqueness and numerical solution of this dynamical optimal transport problem, here we present structural results about the equivalent Kantorovich a.k.a. optimal coupling formulation. Specifically, we focus on deriving the ground cost for the associated Kantorovich optimal coupling formulation. The ground cost is equal to the cost of transporting unit amount of mass from a specific realization of the initial or source joint probability measure to a realization of the terminal or target joint probability measure, and determines the Kantorovich formulation. Finding the ground cost leads to solving a structured deterministic nonlinear optimal control problem, which is shown to be amenable to an analysis technique pioneered by Athans et al. We show that such techniques have broader applicability in determining the ground cost (thus Kantorovich formulation) for a class of generalized optimal mass transport problems involving nonlinear dynamics with translated norm-invariant drift."

    "abstract": "In this work, we revisit a classical distributed gradient-descent algorithm, introducing an interesting class of perturbed multi-agent systems. The state of each subsystem represents a local estimate of a solution to the global optimization problem. Thereby, the network is required to minimize local cost functions, while gathering the local estimates around a common value. Such a complex task suggests the interplay of consensus-based dynamics with gradient-descent dynamics. The latter descent dynamics involves the projection operator, which is assumed to provide corrupted projections of a specific form, reminiscent of existing (fast) projection algorithms. Hence, for the resulting class of perturbed networks, we are able to adaptively tune some gains in a fully distributed fashion, to approach the optimal consensus set up to arbitrary-desired precision."

    "abstract": "Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games, one of the most popular esports genres, have been extensively studied in the fields of game AI and game analytics. Open-source large language models (LLMs), such as Llama, have become essential tools in artificial intelligence (AI) research. However, previous battlefield information prediction studies have largely assumed that all in-game data are readily accessible, using sequential models to analyze samples containing numerous data items collected over a period, which present challenges for users to collect and input. In this work, we introduce MobaQA, a MOBA battlefield information prediction model based on LLMs fine-tuning. Instead of utilizing extensive data inputs, MobaQA employs a minimal set of key data items to construct its dataset. By fine-tuning LLMs, MobaQA generates predictions based on input battlefield information text. Using samples collected from two major game versions over a span of two years, we design multiple Q&A templates and conduct extensive experiments on fine-tuned MobaQA models derived from three different base LLMs, under varying training volumes and with various levels of missing data. Experimental results indicate MobaQA can effectively predict real-time winrate and match outcome."

    "abstract": "Bearings serve as critical mechanical components in rotating machinery, making their intelligent fault diagnosis essential for operational reliability and maintenance efficiency. However, weak faults pose significant challenges in bearing fault diagnosis. To solve this challenge, a multi-sensor feature enhancement network for intelligent bearing fault diagnosis is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a channel adaptive convolution strategy is proposed, which automatically selects the optimal kernel size for each channel, thereby enhancing the expression of advantageous characteristics. Secondly, a multi-sensor feature complementary learning strategy is designed, which enhances the robustness and stability of the model by leveraging redundant information from multiple sensors. Thirdly, a multi-sensor feature enhancement strategy is proposed, which employs an attention mechanism to merge and amplify subtle features from individual sensors, thereby improving the representation of fault characteristics. To verify the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method, validation experiments with a series of state-of-the-art methods are conducted on two datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy in diagnosing bearing faults, even in cases of weak fault conditions."

Then, Lyapunov Redesign methodology is used to generate the set of periodic time-variant subspaces (sliding surfaces), where the closed-loop system exhibits exponential stability. Finally, the resulting SMC law guarantees the finite-time stability of the sliding surface and robustness with respect to matched non-vanishing disturbances and input matrix uncertainty. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through the orbital stabilization of a cart-pendulum system oscillating around its unstable equilibrium."

We use this extended framework to define the class of singular networks and to characterize their ultrasensitive input-output behaviors at given terminals. Our results are grounded in the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction method, which is shown to fully characterize the singularities and bifurcations of the input-output behavior at the network terminals, including when the underlying input-output relation is not explicitly computable through other reduction methods."

To ensure dynamic feasibility, the framework is extended with a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme that computes safe trajectories within the identified corridors. A replanning strategy is introduced to adapt to the unpredictable behaviors of surrounding vehicles and maintain the feasibility of trajectories. Simulation results in an overtaking scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, with the ego vehicle successfully performing trajectory tracking and replanning while satisfying dynamic constraints."

    "abstract": "Quantitative viscoelasticity imaging via shear wave elastography (SWE) remains challenging due to complex wave physics and limitations of conventional reconstruction methods. To address this, we present SW-VEI-Net, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) that simultaneously reconstructs the shear elastic modulus and viscous modulus by integrating viscoelastic wave equations into a dual-network architecture. The framework employs a dual-loss function to balance data fidelity and physics-based regularization, significantly reducing reliance on empirical data while improving interpretability. Extensive validation on tissue-mimicking phantoms, rat liver fibrosis model, and clinical cases demonstrates that SW-VEI-Net outperforms state-of-the-art SWE methods. Compared to SWENet (a PINN-based method using a linear elastic model), SW-VEI-Net not only enables simultaneous assessment of shear elastic and viscous moduli, but also achieves higher accuracy in shear elastic modulus reconstruction. Furthermore, when benchmarked against the dispersion fitting (DF) method (based on a viscoelastic model), SW-VEI-Net produces comparable viscoelastic parameter maps while exhibiting enhanced robustness and consistency. For liver fibrosis staging, SW-VEI-Net achieves AUC values of 0.85 (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\geq$</tex-math></inline-formula>F2) and 0.91 (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$=$</tex-math></inline-formula>F4) based on elastic modulus classification, surpassing both SWENet (0.84, 0.85) and DF (0.78, 0.88). Additional validation in healthy volunteers shows strong agreement with a commercial ultrasound system. By synergizing deep learning with fundamental wave physics, this study represents a significant advancement in SWE, offering substantial clinical potential for early detection of hepatic fibrosis and malignant lesions through precise viscoelastic biomarker mapping."

    "abstract": "The vibration signal data distribution varies greatly when the motor bearing fails under different working conditions and the signal acquisition is also susceptible to noise interference. These two factors often lead to low accuracy of the cross-domain fault diagnosis task. In order to handle these problems, a novel motor bearing fault diagnosis method based on conditional domain adversarial network with smoothing optimization and minimum class confusion is proposed in this paper. First, the conditional adversarial domain adaptation regulates the domain discriminator and reduces the feature distribution differences between the source and target domains. Second, smoothing optimization is introduced into the network to make the classifier task loss converge to the smoothed minimum value, which stabilizes the adversarial training. Finally, the minimum class confusion is utilized to further improve the classifier’s ability to discriminate different classes of samples in the target domain. Based on the minimum class confusion loss and the smoothed classification loss, the network parameters can be updated via backpropagation progress to effectively reduce the target risk of the classifier. Extensive experiments are conducted on the public Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) dataset, and experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the compared methods in solving the problem of electric motor bearing fault diagnosis under variable operating conditions."

Key features include a serial streaming interface optimized for pipelining image rows, a simple downsampling mechanism, a filter selection unit, and adaptive filter blocks capable of dynamically monitoring multiple classes and making adjustments for sampled variations within each class.

In a backtesting evaluation involving 30 tokens identified as P&D schemes, FOMOCheck utilized only pre-dump information, achieving a recall of 70.0% and an F1-score of 82.4 % at a risk threshold of 6/10 or higher. A pilot deployment on 20 new token listings demonstrated end-to-end response times under 4.2 seconds (95th percentile), validating its feasibility for real-time triage and monitoring. A qualitative assessment revealed that the system generated transparent, metric-referenced explanations, although it demonstrated sensitivity to “green-flag” cues, such as price-volume alignment. The primary limitations include incomplete data on holder distribution and liquidity locks, as well as the lack of a balanced evaluation set containing non-P&D tokens. Future work will focus on expanding the dataset to include legitimate tokens, integrating streaming data connectors, and deploying a production-ready anomaly scoring API."

Specifically, we extract the weights assigned to tracking errors and control effort in the implicit cost function that a black-box controller is optimizing, offering a more transparent and interpretable representation of the controller’s underlying objectives. This approach presents connections with well-established XAI techniques, such as Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) since it is still based on a local approximation of the control policy. However, the explanation provided by our method offers a structured and more control-relevant perspective. Numerical examples demonstrate that the inferred cost function consistently provides a deeper understanding of the controller’s decision-making process."

IG already delivers outstanding Precision, Recall, and AUC on NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and UKM-IDS20, even when trained on only 10% of the data. To raise Precision further without sacrificing transparency we introduce Multi-Granular Discretization (IG-MD), which represents every continuous feature at several Gaussian based resolutions.

    "abstract": "With the growth of cloud computing infrastructure, its cost-efficient paradigm is driving a growing wave of small and medium-sized enterprises to migrate data and services to cloud based platforms. However, due to privacy concerns, data encryption prior to outsourcing is an important means of protection, which in turn requires performing queries over the encrypted data. While several approaches do offer support for privacy preserving skyline or top-k queries, they typically struggle with efficiency when extended to secure top-k dominating queries, due to the inherent nature of combining the advantages of both top k and skyline queries. Nevertheless, this nature renders them as a more practical and promising alternative for location-based services. To address this, we introduce STLD, a secure top-k location-based dominating query scheme. Specifically, we develop an innovative index structure called Secure Aggregate R-tree (SAR-tree) by utilizing the Paillier cryptosystem and introducing meticulously crafted noise, while also incorporating principles from aggregate R-trees and semi-blind R-trees. Leveraging this structure, we propose a series of secure sub-protocols to facilitate top-k dominating queries, accompanied by optimization techniques to mitigate latency associated with computationally intensive dominating operations. Given an encrypted query, STLD not only efficiently answers the query but also guarantees the privacy of data(sets), results, queries and access patterns. Finally, STLD undergoes rigorous theoretical security and complexity analysis, complemented by empirical evaluations that demonstrate its performance and feasibility, achieving a reduction in query cost by 40%-60% compared to multiple competing methods."

    "abstract": "Reliable localization under Global Positioning System-denied or visually degraded conditions remains a fundamental challenge for autonomous systems. Vision- and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-based approaches often degrade in low illumination, adverse weather, or appearance-changing environments, as they rely on stable surface texture or geometry. In contrast, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) captures subsurface electromagnetic reflections that remain relatively stable across lighting, seasonal, and weather variations, making it a promising complementary sensing modality for long-term localization. However, spatial variability in subsurface dielectric properties induces fluctuations in electromagnetic wave velocity, leading to geometric distortions in GPR echoes and unstable feature extraction. To address this challenge, we propose the Velocity-Invariant Feature Transform (VIFT), a physics-guided self-supervised learning framework for GPR keypoint detection and description. VIFT explicitly models wave-velocity-induced distortions through a continuous velocity space parameterized by a Beta distribution, and leverages velocity-conditioned wavefield migration as physically consistent data augmentation. A Siamese network is trained with velocity-consistency supervision to jointly learn repeatable keypoint score maps and discriminative local descriptors from unlabeled real GPR scans. To further enhance robustness, sparsity-aware, dispersion, distinctiveness, and orthogonality losses are incorporated to improve repeatability, spatial coverage, and descriptor discriminability. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks and large-scale real-world GPR datasets demonstrate that VIFT consistently outperforms traditional handcrafted methods and recent learning-based Vison and GPR methods, achieving a 5–10% improvement in keypoint repeatability over state-of-the-art methods, particularly under extremely sparse keypoint sampling regimes, while also improving matching accuracy and registration robustness under diverse subsurface conditions."

Despite recent progress with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), the task remains challenging due to variations in spatial resolution, viewpoint, orientation, and background conditions, which often reduce the generalization ability of existing models. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight architecture based on the convolutional mixer paradigm. The model alternates between spatial mixing through depthwise convolutions at multiple scales and channel mixing through pointwise operations, enabling efficient extraction of both local and contextual information while keeping the number of parameters and computations low. Extensive experiments were conducted on the AID and EuroSAT benchmarks. The proposed model achieved overall accuracy, average accuracy, and Kappa values of 74.7%, 74.57%, and 73.79 on the AID dataset, and 93.90%, 93.93%, and 93.22 on EuroSAT, respectively. These results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a good balance between accuracy and efficiency compared with widely used CNN- and transformer-based models.

    "abstract": "Retinal vessel segmentation is crucial for the early detection and management of ocular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and hypertensive retinopathy, offering vital insights into vascular patterns that inform clinical decisions. However, current methods face significant hurdles, including class imbalance between vessel and non-vessel pixels, inconsistent illumination, and the challenge of accurately delineating fine, low-contrast vessels across varied imaging conditions, which often results in incomplete segmentations. To address these limitations, we propose DAFNet-Res, a hybrid-attentive decoder network that leverages a ResNet-50 encoder and a dual attention fusion decoder to enhance the identification of both prominent and subtle vessels. The approach incorporates Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) on the green channel for preprocessing to boost local contrast, a hybrid loss function combining Binary Cross-Entropy and Focal Tversky Loss to handle imbalance, and an optimized training strategy with mixed-precision techniques and data augmentation such as elastic deformations. Evaluated on the DRIVE and HRF datasets at a threshold of 0.35, DAFNet-Res achieves Dice scores of 0.8552 and $\\mathbf{0. 8 3 2 0}$, IoU values of $\\mathbf{0. 7 2 1 2}$ and $\\mathbf{0. 6 9 8 0}$, and AUCs of $\\mathbf{0. 9 7 4 4}$ and 0.9650, respectively, outperforming UNet, ResUNet, and Attention-UNet.

This paper proposes a hybrid framework that integrates handcrafted dermatological descriptors with transformation-based supervised deep features derived from a lightly fine-tuned CNN. The deep embeddings are transformed and dimension-reduced via Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to produce a small set of highly discriminative components, which are then fused with the eandcrafted shape, color, and texture descriptors to form a 39-dimensional feature representation. Classical machine learning classifiers, particularly LightGBM, were then applied for melanoma versus non-melanoma classification on the HAM10000 dataset. The proposed framework is shown to achieve a ROC–AUC of 0.958 and accuracy of 0.944, outperforming individual feature sets as well as several recently reported deep learning baselines. Our results highlight that careful feature engineering and feature fusion, combined with even basic machine learning methods, can achieve state-of-the-art diagnostic performance while remaining lightweight and computationally practical for clinical deployment."

    "abstract": "Wildfires pose escalating threats to ecosystems, communities, and climate systems, highlighting the urgent need for accurate, high-resolution spatiotemporal forecasting. In this work, we explore the untapped potential of video foundation models for advancing wildfire spread prediction using multi-modal satellite data. While large-scale foundation models have transformed artificial intelligence and show promise in Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI), their direct application to domain-specific tasks like wildfire forecasting faces two major hurdles: (1) a substantial domain gap between general pretraining data (e.g., natural images and videos) and geospatial data (e.g., multi-spectral satellite imagery), and (2) limited labeled data for fine-tuning in real-world GeoAI tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce a Cross-Modal Progressive Fine-Tuning (CMPF) strategy tailored for wildfire forecasting. CMPF combines: (1) Informed cross-modal architectural alignment, leveraging video-based Transformers pretrained on spatiotemporal tasks to better capture wildfire dynamics, and (2) Progressive fine-tuning, which gradually adapts models to wildfire-specific representations through intermediate domain adaptation before task-specific tuning. We evaluate CMPF using multiple Transformer backbones, including ViT, MViTv2, and VideoMAEv2, on wildfire spread forecasting benchmarks. Our results show that video foundation models, especially when fine-tuned progressively, outperform conventional CNNs and static vision Transformers in modeling wildfire evolution. These findings also validate the effectiveness of the proposed CMPF approach for adapting general-purpose AI foundation models to complex spatiotemporal geospatial tasks."

However, no previous research has addressed open-circuit (OC) faults in the power switches of doubly salient electromagnetic generator (DSEG) systems with H-bridge semi-controlled rectifier (HBSCR), and the existing methods cannot be applied to these systems. To solve the problem, this article proposes an OC fault diagnosis method for power switches based on bus current and forward freewheeling diode current. Fault location is achieved by detecting the direction of the bus current and the forward freewheeling diode current before and after the switch-<sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">off</small> angle, and analyzing relationships between them. The proposed method does not change the rectifier topology and has low diagnosis cost. It is independent of the fault position and operating conditions. Meanwhile, it can locate OC faults of single switch and dual switches in one sector at the same or different moments. Finally, experiments on a 12/8-pole DSEG platform validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Signalized intersections are paramount for optimizing transportation efficiency and enhancing fuel economy, as they inherently induce stop-and-go traffic dynamics. In this paper, we present an integrated framework that concurrently optimizes signal timing and CAV trajectories at signalized intersections, with the dual objectives of maximizing traffic throughput and minimizing energy consumption for CAVs. We formulate an optimal control strategy for CAVs that prioritizes trajectory planning to circumvent state constraints, while incorporating the impact of signal timing and HDV behavior. Furthermore, we introduce a traffic signal control methodology that dynamically adjusts signal phases based on vehicular density per lane, while mitigating disruption for CAVs scheduled to traverse the intersection. Acknowledging the system’s inherent dynamism, we also explore event-triggered replanning mechanisms that enable CAVs to iteratively refine their planned trajectories in response to the emergence of more efficient routing options. The efficacy of our proposed framework is evaluated through comprehensive simulations conducted in MATLAB."

While deep learning has advanced recognition performance, many existing approaches depend on hold-out evaluation strategies that limit generalization to unseen users. Additionally, computationally intensive models are often unsuitable for real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces a novel lightweight deep learning architecture, the Tiny Variational Residual Network (TVRN), designed for subject-independent EEG-based emotion recognition. TVRN operates directly on raw one-dimensional EEG feature vectors, enabling efficient end-to-end learning. Its architecture combines dense residual connections with a variational bottleneck, facilitating expressive yet compact feature representation. The model was evaluated using a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation scheme on two benchmark EEG datasets: GAMEEMO and LUMED. On the GAMEEMO dataset, TVRN achieved an accuracy of 80.40% for valence and 81.11% for arousal. On the LUMED dataset, it reached an accuracy of 93.22%. Compared to the baseline ResNet1D model, TVRN reduced the parameter count by over 75% and required only 306K FLOPs, underscoring its computational efficiency. These results highlight TVRN’s potential as a robust and scalable solution for EEG-based emotion recognition in real-world, low-resource environments."

While this architecture offers flexibility and scalability, it also raises significant privacy concerns, particularly regarding the sensitive measurements transmitted from the plant to third-party cloud providers, where the control algorithms are executed. In multi-cloud setups, an effective privacy-preserving solution is provided by the Shamir secret sharing scheme. When applied to networked control systems, this approach allows the measurement vector (the secret) to be split among multiple clouds without compromising the overall control law, which can be successfully and efficiently reconstructed from computations performed on the clouds. However, existing Shamir-based schemes have limited robustness, as they only ensure the reconstruction of the correct control input in the presence of missing shares but cannot handle cases where some shares are corrupted. This work presents a robust privacy-preserving computational scheme for multi-cloud control systems using a robust Reed-Solomon secret sharing scheme. The proposed solution enables the reconstruction of the control input despite missing or corrupted shares while preserving the secrecy of the measurements sent to the clouds. The effectiveness and potential of this approach are demonstrated through simulations involving a remotely controlled differential-drive robot."

Methods: In this study, we examined the ability of five different CNN architectures (MobileNet, DenseNet121, ResNet50, VGG16, and a custom iVGG13 model) to classify pediatric chest radiograph images as pneumonia or normal. The trained models were developed using a dataset of 5,856 labeled JPEG images. Results: MobileNet achieved the best predictive per- formance of all models tested, with an accuracy of 91%, a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 84%. MobileNet outperformed the other models in each of these key metrics. Discussion: Our results demonstrate the potential of CNN models, especially MobileNet, to provide a rapid and accurate diagnosis of pneumonia. AI-based models represent a promising option to integrate into clinical practice, improving diagnostic efficiency, enabling this type of early intervention, and potentially addressing areas with poor access to expert radiologists."

The constructed differentiator is based on the online adaptation of the interval length of a finite-difference differentiator according to an estimate of the noise amplitude. The only tuning parameter of the differentiator is a bound on the third-order derivative of the signals whose first and second derivatives are to be estimated. All the differentiator’s properties are formally proven and a simulation example is provided for illustration."

To mitigate communication overhead and handle the unavailability of explicit gradient information, we propose a communication compressed zeroth-order stochastic distributed (CZSD) algorithm. By integrating a generalized contractive compressor and a stochastic two-point zeroth-order oracle, CZSD achieves convergence rates comparable to its exact communication counterpart while reducing both communication overhead and sampling complexity. Specifically, to the best of our knowledge, CZSD is the first compressed zeroth-order algorithm achieving linear speedup, with convergence rates of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt p /\\sqrt {nT} )$ and $\\mathcal{O}(p/(nT))$ under general nonconvex settings and the Polyak–Łojasiewicz condition, respectively. Numerical experiments validate the algorithm’s effectiveness and communication efficiency."

    "abstract": "Most factories trying to “go green” run into a major roadblock: they only discover waste after it's already been produced, forcing them to react instead of prevent. While many use “Digital Twins,” or virtual copies of their operations, these tools are great for simulation but can't predict when inefficiency is about to happen. This paper outlines a framework that solves this by giving the Digital Twin a predictive “brain.” We integrated a high-performance AI called XGBoost and trained it on a realistic, simulated set of factory data-including machine temperature, pressure, and tool wear-to teach it how to forecast a high-waste (or “scrap”) event before it begins. Our model proved to be highly effective, achieving 89.9 % accuracy and an excellent 0.96 AUC score in distinguishing good production runs from bad ones. Crucially, the AI also confirmed that using a worn-out tool is the single biggest predictor of waste. This research provides a solid blueprint for transforming Digital Twins from passive monitors into active, intelligent partners that can truly help a factory optimize resources and stop waste before it's created."

However, transformer-based foundation models in other domains have reduced data requirements by leveraging pre-trained generalist models. Ultimately, developing zero-shot foundation models of system dynamics could drastically reduce manual deployment effort. While recent work shows that transformer-based end-to-end approaches can achieve zero-shot performance on unseen systems, they are limited to sensor models seen during training. We introduce the foundation model unscented Kalman filter (FM-UKF), which combines a transformer-based model of system dynamics with analytically known sensor models via an UKF, enabling generalization across varying dynamics without retraining for new sensor configurations. We evaluate FM-UKF on a new benchmark of container ship models with complex dynamics, demonstrating a competitive accuracy, effort, and robustness trade-off compared to classical methods with approximate system knowledge and to an end-to-end approach. The benchmark and dataset are open sourced to further support future research in zero-shot state estimation via foundation models."

    "abstract": "With the rapid pace of digital transformation, enterprises are facing significant challenges in integrating modern cloud-based platforms with legacy enterprise systems. Workday, as a leading cloud-based ERP platform, offers powerful capabilities for human capital and financial management, yet its integration with legacy on-premise applications and heterogeneous cloud platforms often results in data silos, inconsistent workflows, and high operational complexity. To achieve this, a hybrid methodology is proposed, combining the evolutionary mating optimization (EMO) algorithm for optimal data mapping and workflow orchestration with quantum deep neural network (QDNN) for intelligent data fusion and predictive analytics across Workday, legacy, and cloud platforms. The EMO algorithm ensures efficient alignment of heterogeneous system schemas and reduces integration overhead, while the QDNN learns complex patterns in multi-source enterprise data to enable accurate forecasting and anomaly detection. The proposed model adopts a microservices-based design, supporting modular expansion, real-time processing, and multi-terminal access. Experimental validation was carried out in a simulated enterprise environment where the optimized framework demonstrated a 32 % improvement in data synchronization speed, 27 % reduction in integration latency, and 21 % improvement in predictive accuracy compared to conventional middleware-based solutions."

As an extension of the naive Monte Carlo method, the Multi-Level Monte Carlo method reduces the overall computational effort, but is unable to reduce the time to solution in a sufficiently parallel computing environment. In this work, we propose a Uncertainty Quantification method combining Multi-Level Monte Carlo sampling and Parallel-in-Time integration for select samples, exploiting remaining parallel computing capacity to accelerate the computation. While effective at reducing the time-to-solution, Parallel-in-Time integration methods greatly increase the total computational effort. We investigate the tradeoff between time-to-solution and total computational effort of the combined method, starting from theoretical considerations and comparing our findings to two numerical examples. There, a speedup of 12 – 45% compared to Multi-Level Monte Carlo sampling is observed, with an increase of 15 – 18% in computational effort."

    "abstract": "In-orbit micro-angular vibration has been recognized as a key contributor to the satellite-borne optical communication system. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) angular rate sensor with extremely low noise and high frequency is the most suitable instrument for micro-angular vibration measurement. However, it exhibits poor near-DC sensitivity due to the influence of viscous force and electromagnetic force. Kalman algorithm has been verified to be an effective method to extend the sensor bandwidth by fusing with other sensors. However, traditional Kalman algorithm cannot deal with the unpredicted dynamics of the system due to its invariable parameters over time. In this work, an adaptive sequential Kalman algorithm is proposed. The high-dimensional measurement updates are reduced to multiple low-dimensional measurement updates. The covariance matrix of the measurement noise is set to be adaptively updated and computed in segments. And the process noise covariance matrix is derived via weighted coefficient analysis by minimizing the mean square error. The computing time of the proposed method is proved to be a 38.39% reduction compared to the traditional Kalman method. The proposed method is realized in real-time to experimentally verify the frequency response and noise characteristics of the composite sensor. Results show that the bandwidth can achieve 0.1Hz-700Hz with a maximum amplitude fluctuation of 1.34 dB. The equivalent noise angular rate is 0.1523°/s RMS. Allan variance analysis indicates that the bias instability and angle random walk of the composite sensor are both better than the other methods."

To more efficiently and accurately perform quantitative measurements of phenotypic characteristic dimensions of seeds during the germination process and statistically analyze germination-related indicators, this study designed an automated seed germination monitoring platform, combining machine vision and deep learning technologies, to achieve intelligent monitoring and quantitative analysis of rice seed germination processes. The hardware system is based on an artificial climate box, integrated with a circulating lifting device and an HD camera module, supporting timed automatic acquisition of germination images. The software system integrates One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) and Faster R-CNN models for measurement and extraction of dynamic phenotypic features and high-precision classification, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the system can accurately measure morphological feature changes such as seed area, perimeter, convex hull area and radicle length. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the germination rate detection results of the two models and manual evaluation results exceeds 0.996. Furthermore, the system provides multi-dimensional data support for seed vigor assessment through dynamic analysis of radicle length and statistics on cumulative germination curves. Compared with other commercial equipment, the equipment platform in this study offers advantages of miniaturization, automation, and high flexibility, enabling the simultaneous conduct of multiple sets of seed germination experiments and more effectively meeting the practical needs of small and medium-sized enterprises. It provides a technical reference for the intelligent transformation of seed quality detection."

We critically analyze the conventional store-and-forward modeling approach and highlight its limitations in representing phase-switching gaps at intersections. To overcome these issues, we propose an enhanced store-and-forward model coupled with an improved MP control formulation that explicitly accounts for phase-switching losses. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic constraint on phase durations, challenging the traditional assumption that minimal green times are inherently optimal and stable. Simulation results demonstrate that the negative impact of switching gaps escalates with increasing demand, underscoring the necessity of adaptive phase timing. Our refined control strategy contributes to a more robust, realistic, and efficient traffic signal management, enhancing overall network performance."

    "abstract": "The effects of Total Ionizing Dose (TID) are studied on two different commercial 600 V GaN cascode transistors from the same manufacturer. The components are irradiated with 1 MeV X-rays under different bias conditions in order to distinguish the contribution of each sub-component of the cascode structure to the static response under TID. The combined influence of the electric field and irradiation in these structures is then analyzed. Specific bias conditions are also applied to maximize the potential difference across the GaN HEMT while minimizing the electric field in the Si-MOSFET. The shifts in threshold voltage (V<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">TH</sub>) and maximum transconductance (g<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m,max</sub>) are most significant for bias cases that apply a high potential difference across the Si-MOSFET while maintaining a low electric field in the GaN HEMT. These results indicate that the Si-MOSFET is the main contributor to the static degradations observed in both cascode structures, while the GaN HEMT shows tolerance to TID effects up to 100 krad(SiO<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>). Finally, two unexpected parasitic transistors are triggered by TID irradiation, only in the Cascode 2 device. These parasitic transistors appear when the Si-MOSFET is biased, indicating that their origin lies within the Si-MOSFET. An analytical approach based on cross-sectional views, oxide thicknesses, and experimental threshold voltage shifts (ΔV<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">TH</sub>) is proposed to identify the origin of these parasitic transistors.

Consequently, when collecting data from these devices, e.g., using an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV), malware data may be transmitted to a gateway that is then used to attack servers. To address this issue, we equip a UAV with a virtual network function, and study a novel problem involving the allocation of computation and communication resource to identify malware traffic from solar-powered devices. To solve this problem, we first outline a mixed integer linear program (MILP) that jointly optimizes i) UAV placement, ii) UAV trajectory, iii) data processing, iv) channel allocation, and v) energy usage of devices. To facilitate online decision making, we design a neural network-based solution called neural network mapping (NNM) to store integer valued decision variables offline. During flight, the UAV then uses the neural network to retrieve the corresponding integer values for a given scenario, which allows the UAV to solve the said MILP as a linear program that can be computed quickly. Our simulation results show that NNM is able to effectively reduce the amount of data from malware that arrives at a gateway."

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) present promising candidates for these operations due to their complementary capabilities and mobility advantages. However, effective cooperation between these heterogeneous agents faces significant challenges including communication limitations, energy constraints, and suboptimal task allocation efficiency. In this paper, we aim to maximize data collection capacity, task completion rates, while minimizing energy consumption across all UAVs. We propose U2GNet, a novel UGV-assisted framework for UAV that enables efficient task offloading and resource allocation in dynamic environments by leveraging Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) enhanced with Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks (HGAT). The framework employs HGAT to process local observations and information shared by neighboring agents, while Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) address partial observability by integrating historical information, and DRL optimizes the decision-making process. Simulation results demonstrate that U2GNet improves the average data collection rate and task completion rate by 16.90% and 10.81% respectively compared to the baseline HGN approach."

Traditional model-based approaches rely on precise system dynamics, which may not be available in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose a data-driven safety verification framework that leverages matrix zonotopes and barrier certificates to verify system safety directly from noisy data. Instead of trusting a single unreliable model, we construct a set of models that capture all possible system dynamics that align with the observed data, ensuring that the true system model is always contained within this set. This model set is compactly represented using matrix zonotopes, enabling efficient computation and propagation of uncertainty. By integrating this representation into a barrier certificate framework, we establish rigorous safety guarantees without requiring an explicit system model. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in verifying safety for dynamical systems with unknown models, showcasing its potential for real-world CPS applications."

The system, which can be integrated into the ergonomic design of flexible seat cushions, detects lumbar pressure and airbag pressure values using thin-film sensors on the surface of the air cushion, along with an internal air pressure sensor during long driving sessions. The data is then smoothed using the Savitzky-Golay filter. Finally, an adaptive control algorithm is employed to regulate the air pump, adjusting the air cushion in real-time through feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that the control system can adaptively adjust the inflation and deflation of the airbag, effectively reducing lumbar fatigue,"

    "abstract": "Air–ground integrated mobile edge computing (AGI-MEC) integrates aerial and terrestrial resources to provide efficient computing services for massive mobile terminals (MTs), enabling 6 G network intelligence. However, jointly optimizing offloading and power control remains challenging due to dynamic channels, resource constraints, communication overhead, and privacy concerns. To address these issues, this paper proposes a clustering-based two-layer federated deep reinforcement learning (CTL-FDRL) algorithm. A clustered federated training framework with parameter sharing is first developed, in which raw data exchange is replaced by periodic model aggregation, enabling MTs to learn offloading policies locally while preserving privacy. Furthermore, an efficient representative MT selection method is introduced. A self-organizing map (SOM)-based MT clustering method is designed to adaptively group MTs without a predefined number of clusters. Guided by the derived convergence bound, representative selection within each cluster is posed as a linear programming problem. The resulting representatives are used for federated aggregation, which reduces communication overhead without degrading model performance. Simulation results verify the superiority of CTL-FDRL, achieving about 28.7% higher cumulative reward, 31.5% lower delay, and 18.3% lower energy consumption compared with baseline algorithms."

    "abstract": "Speech emotion recognition (SER) is a crucial technology for applications such as human-computer interaction, mental health monitoring, and call centre analytics. However, SER research in Indonesia is still limited by a lack of annotated speech emotion datasets. In this study, we provided EEPIS’s Speech Emotion Recognition Audio Video Dataset (E-SERAVD), an Indonesian speech emotion recognition dataset that has four basic emotions: Happy, Angry, Neutral, and Sad. The data obtained from Indonesian movies and scenes were trimmed to capture emotional expressions. The dataset creation process is based on a model widely used by previous researchers. In this case, dataset creation begins with the process of defining the parameters and types of audio recording to be targeted. The next step is data collection, followed by the data cleaning process. The data validation stage involves a testing process by three raters to prepare the labelling process. The three raters’ observations showed satisfactory performance, with agreement scores of 88.8, 68.8, and 91.4%. The constructed dataset was evaluated using the inter-rater reliability metric, which showed a Fleiss Kappa value of 0.61; therefore, it was included in the good category and was then determined. The final step is to separate the data for training and testing. The baseline model accuracy was evaluated with a value of 90% and an F1 score of 86%. The E-SERAVD Dataset for Indonesian SER was prepared as an open-source dataset, with complete documentation and model benchmarks."

    "abstract": "The growing urbanization of modern societies intensifies the demand for sustainable mobility that aligns efficiency, safety, and environmental responsibility in smart cities. Shared vehicle systems address this need, but remain limited by subjective manual inspections that hinder operational efficiency. Automated exterior damage assessment via computer vision offers a scalable alternative, although its success critically depends on high-quality, domain-specific datasets, which remain scarce. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SYNDCAR (SYNthetic Damage CAR dataset), a generative AI-based dataset that simulates realistic vehicle damage in images with precise annotations for detection and vehicle parts segmentation. Extensive experiments were conducted that covered hyperparameter tuning, transfer learning, benchmarking of CNN- and Transformer-based models, and post-training optimization and quantization. The results highlight the challenges of damage detection due to appearance variability and dataset size, while pointing to practical solutions: YOLOv8-X achieved the highest accuracy, whereas YOLOv12-S provided the best trade-off. TensorRT deployment tests (FP16/INT8) further reduced the inference time by ≈ 71% on the GPU and the energy consumption by 65%. Segmentation remained more energy-intensive than detection. In general, SYNDCAR demonstrates the potential of synthetic datasets to enable accurate, efficient, and scalable vehicle inspection systems."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the interaction of surface gravity waves with a comb-shaped floating breakwater near an inclined partially reflecting seawall at a finite distance from an array of submerged triangular head porous structures. Under the assumption of linearized water wave theory, this study aims to examine the hydrodynamic quantities of interest, including the reflection coefficient, wave run-up coefficient, force exerted on the partially reflecting wall, as well as moments and vertical and horizontal forces on the comb-shaped floating breakwater. Moreover, the radiation of the comb-shaped floating breakwater is tracked by heave, surge, and pitch motion corresponding to added mass and damping coefficients. The numerical model has been developed utilizing the multi-domain boundary element method to analyze oblique wave scattering and radiation. To ensure the precision of the present model, the utilized technique is validated against existing research. The study reveals that as the friction increases, the wave run-up coefficient decreases due to greater drag forces. Moreover, the lower reflection coefficient of the partially reflecting seawall adds internal dissipation and lowers reflected energy peaks; hence, less force is exerted on the breakwater. The intense wave trapping in the confined region between the comb-shaped breakwater and the inclined partially reflecting seawall increased the number of resonance peaks in surge and pitch damping coefficients. Ultimately, this framework enhances the design of adaptive breakwater platforms aimed at providing efficient coastal protection."

    "abstract": "This article investigates the practical fixed-time synchronization (FxTS) for complex dynamical networks (CDNs). Given the notable benefits associated with intermittent control, wherein control inputs are activated solely during the working phase of each control cycle, and event-triggered control, which significantly curtails the frequency of control input updates, this article proposes an intermittent event-triggered control scheme aimed at achieving practical FxTS in CDNs. The proposed scheme substantially mitigates the volume of information transmitted across the network while concurrently reducing control-related expenditures. To mitigate the issue of high-frequency buffeting, the newly devised control scheme employs a saturation function as a substitute for the conventional signum function. Subsequently, this article presents a more precise estimation approach for reasonably approximating the synchronization time (ST) of CDNs and the synchronization error (SE) induced by the integration of the saturation function. Moreover, this article imposes constraints on the frequency and total duration of communication pauses in an average-sense manner and constructs a piecewise Lyapunov function to further deduce several less conservative criteria for practical FxTS. Finally, two illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate the viability of the intermittent event-triggered control scheme and the accuracy of the ST and SE estimations."

    "abstract": "The industrial internet of things (IIoT) has been widely applied in fields such as smart manufacturing, energy management, and infrastructure monitoring. Its distributed nature and cross-domain data collaboration requirements make federated learning (FL) an important modeling paradigm. However, FL systems in IIoT are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries implant hidden trigger patterns during local model training to induce the global model to produce malicious outputs for specific inputs. To address this issue, we propose a federated backdoor defense method named FedQmc, which is based on quantum state encoding and multi-scale aggregation. Specifically, unlike traditional detection methods that rely on geometric distances in parameter space, we design a quantum state encoding-driven anomaly measurement mechanism. By encoding local updates into quantum states, model updates can be represented in high-dimensional complex Hilbert space, and the coherence and superposition properties of quantum states are exploited to enhance feature discrimination, thereby providing significant advantages in capturing subtle yet highly correlated backdoor perturbations. Based on this, we propose multi-scale robust aggregation, which simultaneously suppresses different types of backdoor updates at three levels: layer scale, block scale, and low-rank subspace scale. In addition, we develop a meta-learning-based adaptive weight optimization mechanism, which enables the aggregation weights at each scale to be dynamically adjusted across multiple training rounds. This allows FedQmc to resist stronger and stealthier backdoor attacks while maximally retaining useful gradient information from benign clients. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the convergence and security guarantees of FedQmc. Experimental results show that FedQmc significantly reduces the attack success rate while maintaining high accuracy across multiple datasets, thereby effectively enhancing multi-scale defense capability in IIoT scenarios."

This study examines lightweight and interpretable Transformer-based models, including Multi-Head Attention, FT-Transformer, and SAINT, to evaluate their ability to predict driving comfort efficiency and reliably. A case study on publicly available real-world road datasets is conducted, and the proposed models are compared with a Transformer model used in an earlier study. Computational complexity is analyzed using Big-O notation. Results demonstrate that the Transformer-based models evaluated in this work achieve improved computational efficiency and maintain competitive predictive performance. After feature selection and a reduction in the number of road-related input features, the models maintain similar levels of accuracy. These findings indicate that accurate comfort prediction can be achieved with a reduced feature set and efficient model designs. The proposed framework thus provides a possible practical solution for real-time integration into autonomous vehicle systems that supports both safety and ride comfort."

    "abstract": "The Infrared Scanner (IRS) onboard the HJ-2B satellite is a high-resolution, dual-channel thermal infrared sensor suitable for applications such as land-surface temperature retrieval and smoke detection. Radiometric calibration is a fundamental prerequisite for ensuring the quality and reliability of IRS observation data and is typically performed via two-point (high- and low-temperature) calibration using the instrument's onboard blackbody. However, the effectiveness of this procedure can be constrained by performance degradation of the calibration hardware and by its frequency of usage. In response to these limitations, this article proposes a refined radiometric cross-calibration method for the HJ-2B/IRS sensor over plateau lakes, which adopts the double-difference method as the technical basis and uses the high-accuracy Terra/MODIS as the reference sensor. Implemented through rigorous screening of calibration sites and sampling points, the method explicitly accounts for viewing geometry, as well as contemporaneous surface and atmospheric conditions. Firstly, calibration points between IRS and MODIS are screened by setting a CV threshold and using the RANSAC algorithm. Next, given the surface and atmospheric conditions at the satellite overpass time, radiances at calibration points with large viewing zenith angles were corrected to their nadir-equivalent values, and a temperature-dependent simulated brightness temperature difference function is constructed, from which the fitted calibration coefficients (FCCs) are derived using the double-difference method. Finally, validation with Landsat-8/TIRS indicates that IRS brightness temperatures calculated by the FCCs deviate less from the TIRS observations than those computed with the official calibration coefficients (OCCs) issued by the China Centre for Resources Satellite Data and Application. Furthermore, when compared with the top-of-atmosphere brightness temperatures derived from forward modeling of in situ measurement data, the IRS at-aperture brightness temperature computed using the FCCs shows mean deviations of −1.04 K and −0.92 K for Band 8 and Band 9, respectively. These values are superior to the corresponding deviations of −1.32 K and −2.43 K obtained using the OCCs. Following a quantitative analysis of various factors influencing the FCCs, the total uncertainty for IRS Band 8 and Band 9 was determined to be below 0.937% and 1.257%, respectively."

In situations where the strain is small, the sensitivity of MZI needs to be further improved. However, due to the limitation of the fiber optic elastic coefficient, the effectiveness of existing sensitization methods is limited. This article proposes a high-sensitivity arc shaped MZI strain sensor based on wave vector axial tilt angle modulation (Arc shaped MZI). Which is formed by cascading arc-shaped fiber optic and multimode fiber optic to form a fiber MZI. During the strain process, the arc shaped MZI undergoes deformation, and the wave vector axial tilt angle of the cladding mode changes. However, the change in wave vector axial tilt angle of the cladding mode is no longer limited by the fiber optic elastic coefficient, and the propagation constant of the cladding mode changes significantly during the strain process, achieving a high-sensitivity MZI strain sensor. The experimental results indicate that the strain sensitivity of Arc shaped MZI is as high as 357.23 pm/μϵ, which can be used for high-precision real-time strain detection in precision instruments with small strain changes in the future."

We show that the resulting ambiguity sets provide a finite-sample, high-probability guarantee that the true decision-dependent distribution is contained within them. Furthermore, we establish key properties of the DD-DRO framework, including a non-asymptotic out-of-sample performance guarantee, an optimality gap bound, and a tractable reformulation. The practical effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through numerical experiments on a dynamic pricing problem with nonstationary demand, where the DD-DRO solution produces pricing strategies with guaranteed expected revenue."

    "abstract": "Barrier certificates, a form of state invariants, provide an automated approach for safety verification of dynamical systems. Similar to barrier certificates, recent works explore the notion of closure certificates, a form of transition invariants, to verify dynamical systems against ω-regular properties including safety. A closure certificate, defined over state pairs of a dynamical system, is a real-valued function whose zero superlevel set characterizes an inductive transition invariant of the system. The search for such a certificate can be effectively automated by assuming it to be within a specific template class, e.g. a polynomial of a fixed degree, and then using optimization techniques such as sum-of-squares programming (SOS) or satisfiability-modulo-theory solvers (SMT) to find it. Unfortunately, one may not be able to find such a certificate for a fixed template. In such a case, one must change the template, e.g. increase the degree of the polynomial. In this paper we consider a notion of multiple closure certificates dubbed interpolation-inspired closure certificates. An interpolation-inspired closure certificate consists of a set of functions which jointly over-approximate a transition invariant by first considering one-step transitions, then two, and repeat until a transition invariant is obtained. The advantage of interpolation-inspired closure certificates is that they allow us to prove properties even when a single function for a fixed template cannot be found using standard approaches. We present an SOS programming approach to search for these sets of functions and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for verifying safety and persistence (or refuting recurrence) over some case studies."

In DPSM, nodes are partitioned into small clusters based on propagated density. The partitioning technique has been proved to be sound and complete. We then extend the concept of spectral clustering from individual nodes to these small clusters, while introducing the CluCut measure to guide cluster merging. This measure is modified in various ways to account for cluster properties, thus provides guidance on when to terminate the merging process. Various experiments have validated the effectiveness of DPSM and the accuracy of these conclusions."

The study includes the design and fabrication of a Temperature-Pressure Integrated Sensor, which is distributed on both sides of the throttling orifice plate to monitor the temperature and pressure. The difference pressure across the throttling orifice plate is then used to calculate the real-time flow within the pipeline. The sensor according to this monitoring scheme has a temperature operating range of 0-50°C and a pressure operating range of 0-1 MPa. Experimental results showed that the maximum error in flow monitoring was 4.34%<5%, meeting the error criteria. Compared with traditional difference pressure sensors, the Temperature-Pressure integrated sensor can monitor pipeline internal temperature and pressure during flow measurement and adapt more effectively to stress fatigue cycles. This feature prevents potential misjudgments of the system status that result from monitoring flow solely, thus validating its high reliability in flow monitoring."

    "abstract": "This paper presents an anti-windup composite adaptive speed controller (AW-CASC) for permanent-magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) operating under parameter uncertainties, external load torque, and input saturation. The proposed AW-CASC integrates three components, an adaptive compensation control (ACC) term, an adaptive proportional-integral (API) controller, and an anti-windup (AW) mechanism, and is therefore referred to as AW[API-ACC]. The ACC compensates for unknown disturbances using an adaptive law that relies only on measurable feedback signals, ensuring robust operation of the composite controller without requiring disturbance observers. The API employs a nonlinear adaptive gain algorithm based on exponential and fractional functions of the velocity error, enabling fast transient response and improved tracking accuracy without the need for fuzzy logic or gain scheduling. To suppress overshoot caused by integrator windup under large step-speed commands, a lightweight AW strategy is integrated directly into the Lyapunov-based control framework. Stability analysis confirms that all closed-loop signals are uniformly ultimately bounded. The proposed AW[API-ACC] method is implemented and experimentally validated under various speed profiles, incorporating parameter uncertainties, external load torque, and current saturation conditions. Compared with a conventional PI controller with disturbance observer (PI-OB), an adaptive optimal control (AOC) strategy, and adaptive sliding mode control combined with an extended state observer (ASMC-ESO), the AW[API-ACC] method achieves up to a 61% reduction in RMS speed error (sinusoidal), 33% and 31% reductions in overshoot and maximum tracking error (ramp), a 70% faster recovery under load torque disturbances, and an 8.8% improvement in settling time (step). These results highlight the improved robustness and tracking performance of the proposed method."

Current moderation tools primarily rely on keyword filtering or binary classifiers, limiting their ability to detect nuanced harm effectively. Aims: This study introduces a fine-grained, multi-class classification framework that leverages instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify twelve distinct categories of sexist and misogynistic comments on GitHub. Method: We utilized an instruction-tuned LLM-based framework with systematic prompt refinement across 20 iterations, evaluated on 1,440 labeled GitHub comments across twelve sexism/misogyny categories. Model performances were rigorously compared using precision, recall, F1-score, and the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). Results: Our optimized approach (GPT-4o with Prompt 19) achieved an MCC of 0.501, significantly outperforming baseline approaches. While this model had low false positives, it struggled to interpret nuanced, contextdependent sexism and misogyny reliably. Conclusion: Welldesigned prompts with clear definitions and structured outputs significantly improve the accuracy and interpretability of sexism detection, enabling precise and practical moderation on developer platforms like GitHub."

    "abstract": "Classical current control strategies in electric propulsion systems often suffer from degraded performance under periodic and aperiodic disturbances. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel current control framework that combines an adaptive fractional-order resonant controller (AFRC) with a fixed-time augmented extended state observer (FxTAESO), aiming to enhance disturbance rejection and dynamic robustness. Firstly, the proposed AFRC introduces a self-tuning fractional-order operator, which adaptively adjusts in real-time according to load current, harmonic rejection strength, and desired phase margin. This adaptive mechanism enables precise harmonic compensation while ensuring stability and robustness across the varying operating conditions. Subsequently, the FxTAESO incorporates a current integral term as system augmented variable to decouple the coupling effect between current measurement noise and high observer gains. Additionally, by embedding an improved nonlinear fixed-time convergence law, the observer ensures that the estimation error converges to a bounded neighborhood of the equilibrium point within a predetermined time, independent of initial conditions. Finally, experimental validation on a PMSM drive platform demonstrates that the proposed FxTAESO-AFRC scheme achieves superior steady-state accuracy, faster transient response, and stronger disturbance suppression compared to conventional methods."

    "abstract": "5G Radio Access Network (RAN) slicing provides support for resource isolation and dynamic resource optimization to accommodate the diverse Quality of Service (QoS) needs across Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems, i.e., enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC), and massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC) or Best Effort (BE) services. However, existing optimization- and data-driven radio resource allocation (RRA) models often suffer from rigid/suboptimal resource distribution and increased Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations in dynamic, multi-service environments. This paper introduces an Adaptive QoS-aware Priority Scheduling (AQPS) solution, a novel RRA approach designed to optimize resource distribution for multi-service 5G network slicing deployments in IoT-enabled infrastructures. To optimally allocate resource block groups (RBGs) according to time-varying traffic patterns and IoT network conditions, we formulate an NP-hard optimization problem with the objective of minimizing SLA violations while satisfying QoS requirements for diverse IoT service classes. In this context, AQPS optimizes resource distribution for IoT services by incorporating: (i) minimum guarantee allocation (QoS-driven RBG estimation), (ii) weighted urgency-based resource distribution (computing user urgency by incorporating buffer state, QoS factors, spectral efficiency, and service priorities), and (iii) priority-based round-robin allocation. Extensive trace-driven simulation findings from two comprehensive multiuser IoT-dense urban and enhanced IoT coverage zone scenarios with realistic channel conditions demonstrate that the AQPS solution experiences a very low number of SLA violations while enabling SLA assurance rates of 99.07% and 97.58%, respectively, when compared against state-of-the-art benchmarks, including Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), Round Robin (RR), and Stepwise Optimal Algorithm (SOA)."

    "abstract": "Proper router buffer sizing is critical for supporting modern applications that require both high throughput and low latency. An excessively large buffer can induce significant delays due to bufferbloat, whereas undersized buffers often reduce throughput. Deriving theoretical guidelines for buffer sizing is particularly difficult in realistic environments where multiple flows using nonlinear algorithms, such as CUBIC TCP, compete. This paper proposes a novel data-driven method for establishing practical buffer sizing guidelines. Unlike conventional theoretical approaches, this method derives guidelines for proper buffer sizing according to a target bandwidth utilization (normalized throughput) using only throughput time-series data. This method relies on time-series measurements from only three points within a broad parameter space. The proposed method models the macroscopic behavior of bandwidth utilization as a one-dimensional discrete dynamical system (where the next state is iteratively computed via a deterministic rule), using the extreme learning machine with a target of bandwidth utilization (ELM-TBU) model. Here, the target of bandwidth utilization is treated as a fixed point of the dynamical system. The minimum buffer size that satisfies this criterion is numerically determined using concepts from dynamical systems theory. By repeating this process for various numbers of flows and bandwidth-delay products, global design guidelines for buffer sizing can be obtained. Using Network Simulator-2, we demonstrate that the proposed method accurately estimates the proper buffer size (i.e., the minimum buffer size that satisfies the target bandwidth utilization). Performance evaluations indicate that the proposed method is highly effective and applicable across a wide range of environments."

To optimize the performance of these systems while ensuring safety, we can cast them as distributed optimization problems, where each agent aims to optimize their parameters to maximize a coupled reward function subject to coupled constraints. Prior work either studies a centralized setting, does not consider safety, or struggles with sample efficiency. Since we require sample efficiency and work with unknown and nonconvex rewards and constraints, we solve this optimization problem using safe Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process regression. Moreover, we consider nearest-neighbor communication between the agents. To capture the behavior of non-neighboring agents, we reformulate the static global optimization problem as a time-varying local optimization problem for each agent, essentially introducing time as a latent variable. To this end, we propose a custom spatio-temporal kernel to integrate prior knowledge. We show the successful deployment of our algorithm in simulations."

Our approach addresses two key challenges: providing convergence guarantees to characterize the worst-case number of iterations required to achieve a predefined tolerance, and upper bounding a performance metric after a fixed number of iterations. These guarantees are particularly useful for online optimization problems with limited computational time, where existing performance guarantees are often unavailable or unduly conservative. We formulate the convergence analysis problem as a scenario optimization program based on a finite set of sampled parameter instances. Leveraging tools from scenario optimization theory enables us to derive probabilistic guarantees on the number of iterations needed to meet a given tolerance level. Using recent advancements in scenario optimization, we further introduce a relaxation approach to trade the number of iterations against the risk of violating convergence criteria thresholds. Additionally, we analyze the trade-off between solution accuracy and time efficiency for fixed-iteration optimization problems by casting them into scenario optimization programs. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in providing reliable probabilistic convergence guarantees and evaluating the trade-off between solution accuracy and computational cost."

At the problem formulation stage, the objective function is chosen as the minimization of the squared error between the devised and desired beampattern, where the beampattern response corresponding to the target region attains its maximum value, whereas the response associated with the jammer region is minimized to nulls. Moreover, the constant modulus, receive energy and spectrum bandwidth constraints are forced to ensure feasibility in practical implementations. To tackle the resultant NP-hard non-convex optimization problem, a Riemannian manifold-based gradient descent (RMGD) algorithm is developed, which reformulates the problem as an unconstrained optimization task by leveraging the geometrical structure of a Riemannian product manifold. In particular, the Euclidean gradient is projected onto the tangent space, and the decision variables are updated and retracted onto the Riemannian manifold. In this respect, the transmit waveform, receive filter, and frequency increment are iteratively obtained through an alternating optimization procedure until convergence. Additionally, the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is analyzed. Simulation results highlight the advantages of the proposed method in deceptive jammer suppression, evidenced by significant improvements in signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) improvement, robustness against position errors, and detection probability."

Our aim is to identify a fairly general and comprehensive class of Markovian switching policies that renders the system stable. Potentially a class of policies that can cover the Pareto frontier related to individual-queue-centric performance measures like the stationary expected number of waiting customers in each queue; for instance, such a class of policies is identified recently for a polling system near the fluid regime (with large arrival and departure rates), and we aim to include that class. We also aim to include a second class that facilitates switching between the queues at the instance the occupancy in the opposite queue crosses a threshold and when that in the visiting queue is below a threshold (this inclusion facilitates design of ‘robust’ polling systems). Towards this, we consider a class of two-phase switching policies, which includes the above mentioned classes. In the maximum generality, our policies can be represented by eight parameters, while two parameters are sufficient to represent the aforementioned classes. We provide simple conditions to identify the sub-class of switching policies that ensure system stability. By numerically tuning the parameters of the proposed class, we illustrate that the proposed class can cover the Pareto frontier for the stationary expected number of customers in the two queues."

We hypothesize that the clever design of such a gripper can facilitate the learning process, reducing the number of required training steps and eliminating the need for learning non-prehensile actions, such as pushing. To validate our hypothesis, we conducted experiments in both simulated and realworld environments, comparing the selected gripper with a rigid parallel-jaw gripper and a four-fingered soft gripper. Results show that the Soft ScoopGripper learns to effectively declutter scenes using a single action (grasping) instead of two (pushing and grasping). This is due to the fact that the scoop-shaped addon allows to perform non-prehensile motions during the grasp action."

Building on this reformulation, and incorporating a human response model that captures human-robot interactions while accounting for individual preferences and biases, we develop a fully distributed algorithm. This algorithm guides the states of the autonomous agents to equilibrium points which, when combined with the human responses, yield a globally optimal resource allocation.

The proposed controller, referred to as the Incremental Ultra-Local Model-Based Predictive Control (IULPC), reformulates the predictive model in terms of temporal input-output differences, enhancing disturbance rejection and reducing sensitivity to modeling drift. Unlike conventional model predictive approaches that require accurate knowledge of motor parameters or additional compensation mechanisms, the proposed method leverages an ultra-local estimation structure to achieve full parameter independence. The incremental formulation further improves robustness by attenuating the impact of slowly varying disturbances and estimator transients, while naturally aligning with digital implementation. A compact real-time estimator is used to capture the aggregated system dynamics in their incremental form. Experimental results under operating conditions representative of electric vehicle propulsion, including rapid acceleration and regenerative braking, parameter mismatches, traction load disturbances, and rapid torque reference changes, demonstrate that the proposed controller consistently achieves accurate and stable performance, validating its effectiveness for real-time PMSM control in electric transportation systems."

    "abstract": "Understanding the complex relationships and behavioral preferences among users in social networks is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms of information diffusion. While recent information diffusion prediction methods, empowered by graph neural networks, have advanced the learning of user representations, they rarely exploit spread interaction feedback. This feedback reflects users’ interests in engaging with information and serves as a key driver of information diffusion. Moreover, the underutilization of unlabeled data leads to an overreliance on labeled data, consequently constraining the model’s self-learning and generalization capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose a novel microscopic diffusion prediction model based on interaction-enhanced graph neural sequence contrastive learning (IEGSCL). Specifically, we construct a triple graph to explore the diversity of user relationships and preferences through the lenses of trust and interaction. A self-supervised graph contrastive learning module is designed to transfer user intents, maximizing the utility of unlabeled data and tackling the feature extraction challenge. Furthermore, we devise an information-driven gating strategy that adaptively modulates the contributions of social and interactive intents to cascade participation, thereby effectively integrating interaction feedback into the cascade modeling. Finally, we employ maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to enforce distributional consistency between global relationship representations and local cascade encodings. Extensive experiments on four public datasets validate the superior performance of the proposed model over existing baselines."

Mobile charging robots have emerged as a versatile solution, offering scalable deployment and the ability to integrate renewable energy sources dynamically. This paper proposes a novel Auction-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (AD-DRL) framework for the efficient and sustainable coordination of mobile charging robots. The framework synergizes DRL for long term strategic policy optimization with an auction based mechanism for robust, real time task allocation. To address the complexities of robot coordination, we introduce Parameterized Action Q-Learning to manage hybrid action spaces and Reward Neural Networks to balance dynamic multi objective trade offs, supported by a Reverse Validation mechanism to ensure assignment feasibility. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including PPO, DDPG, and metaheuristic approaches. Specifically, our method improves the number of EVs served by 28.5%, increases total energy delivery by 46%, and reduces the average charging cost per EV by 11.1%. These results underscore the potential of the AD-DRL framework as a high performance solution for smart, sustainable, and cost effective EV charging operations in modern urban environments."

    "abstract": "Distributed state estimation for large-scale networked systems remains a crucial challenge due to dynamically reconfiguring network topologies caused by link failures, scheduling changes, or environmental interference. To address this issue, we propose the distributed Kalman-IMM estimator (DKIE), which combines different estimator models by subsystem type and incorporates them into a fully distributed and localized design. We focus on switching systems modeled as networked Markovian jump linear systems (MJLS), and propose a systematic way to distinguish subsystem types as either reconfigurable (capable of switching links between neighboring nodes) or static. Then, leveraging system level synthesis (SLS), we design type-specific sub-estimators where reconfigurable subsystems use a variant of the interacting multiple model (IMM) estimator, while static subsystems use a variant of the Kalman filters. By introducing a cooperative protocol, we further develop an extension of DKIE, called DKICE, which enables local coordination of IMM sub-estimators using topology information under Bayesian inference. We compare our approach against an existing distributed estimation baseline on a power grid network with 24 possible topologies, and demonstrate DKICE as a scalable solution for reliable state and mode identification across the entire switching network."

In this paper, a joint waveform and passive beamforming design is proposed for the dual-RIS-assisted ISAC system. This design targets enhancing sensing and communication capabilities by maximizing the sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and minimizing the communication multi-user interference (MUI). Furthermore, phase shift optimization functions for multi-RIS deployment are derived. By analyzing the strong coupling among optimization variables, multi-RIS deployment is shown to fail in yielding sustained performance gains and inducing optimization instability. The Alternating Conjugate Gradient Descent on Riemannian manifold (ACGRM) method is employed to address the optimization problem. Experimental results indicate that the dual-RIS system achieves 23.68% higher communication rates and 10.83% higher sensing SINR than single-RIS system."

This article commemorates the centennial of Lilienfeld’s pioneering conception of the field effect device, situating it as the intellectual and technological seed of the digital age. The narrative traces the continuum from Lilienfeld’s early vision and Alan Turing’s theoretical foundations of computation, through the invention of the transistor and the advent of transistorized computers. It examines the paradigm shift brought by integrated circuits (ICs), highlighting IBM’s System/360 and System/370 as milestones in architectural unification and silicon integration. The discussion then explores the realization of the metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) FET (MOSFET), the birth of the microprocessor, and the breakthroughs in complementary MOS (CMOS) technology that enabled high-density integration and ushered in the fourth generation of computers. Special attention is given to the challenges of MOSFET scaling, the emergence of multiple gate architectures such as FinFETs (fin FETs), and inventive extensions of planar devices including ultra-thin body FETs and buried halo MOSFETs. Finally, the article discusses how domain-specific architectures: Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), and other application-specific ICs have leveraged advanced FET technologies to drive the current era of intelligent machines.

    "abstract": "The deployment of Hydrogen Refueling Stations (HRSs) supports the decarbonization of integrated power and transportation systems by supplying green hydrogen-powered vehicles, utilizing excess renewable energy, and providing grid services. However, this integration requires data exchange with the Energy Management System (EMS), exposing it to potential cyberattacks that threaten safety, service continuity, and grid stability. Despite these risks, cybersecurity assessment and the development of cyber-resilient solutions for HRSs remain largely unexplored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel cyber-resilient EMS for HRSs within an integrated transportation and power system. First, the impact of DoS attacks on individual operational parameters, such as hydrogen demand, tank State of Charge (SoC), and grid service signals, is analyzed to assess vulnerabilities and quantify economic losses. Then, a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack model is introduced, strategically optimizing the attack budget to target critical information signals while maximizing financial disruption. To mitigate these threats, a two-tiered defense mechanism is developed. To reconstruct missing data, a Time-Frequency Spectrum-based Deep Neural Network (TFS-DNN) is proposed. The model applies Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to capture short-term temporal correlations and integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to enhance long-term forecasting accuracy. Second, a two-stage robust optimization framework ensures secure and optimal HRS scheduling. The first stage determines safe operational limits to maintain power system stability, while the second stage employs convex robust optimization to derive an optimal scheduling strategy that accounts for forecast uncertainty and ensures transportation demand fulfillment, grid service provision, and financial sustainability."

This study presents an optimization-based procedure to systematically design the parameters of an unbalance force rejection controller (UFRC). The UFRC is capable of suppressing synchronous currents caused by rotor mass unbalance and resonance, thereby improving energy efficiency and reducing vibration-induced noise. The proposed method requires only five inputs: the system’s sensitivity function, resonant frequencies, minimum and maximum operating speeds, and the allowable peak sensitivity. The proposed method is optimization-based, ensuring that the designed parameters are optimal with respect to the objectives and constraints. Furthermore, the method is nonparametric, it does not require a full system model and system parameters, making it highly suitable for industrial applications. The optimized UFRC parameters were experimentally validated on the shaft of a magnetically levitated chiller system. Experimental results show that, after activating the UFRC, the magnitude of the control current was reduced by 75% compared with the case without compensation and approached the same level as static levitation. Meanwhile, the vibration reduced by more than 50%, showing the effectiveness of the optimized parameters."

    "abstract": "Steganography is a technique for embedding secret messages into digital media while preserving perceptual integrity and avoiding detection. Robust steganography specifically enables secure communication through lossy channels with disturbances, where a critical challenge lies in the receiver's ability to accurately reconstruct hidden messages from corrupted stego data-a process termed error-correction. Recent advancements in stego coding schemes for robust steganography leverage probabilistic decoding to enhance message error-correction accuracy. These schemes employ Maximum-A-Posteriori (MAP) decoders that integrate channel knowledge, i.e. the probability distribution of stego symbols derived from received data, thus necessitating precise estimation of such channel knowledge. While existing approach for Channel Knowledge Estimation (CKE) relies on heuristic, handcrafted methods grounded in empirical assumptions, its effectiveness is limited by the inherent complexity of media content and the diversity of channel disturbance. Besides, it is not compatible with some of the embedding method for robust steganography. To address these limitations, we propose a deep learning-based framework for universal channel knowledge estimation, which significantly improves error-correction performance. Furthermore, we extend this framework to multi-channels robust steganography scenarios, formulating a novel multi-channels knowledge estimation paradigm to enhance message correctness through transmission in multiple channels. Experimental results on various state-of-the-art robust steganography methods demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing CKE methods and coding schemes."

    "abstract": "Color distortion and structural degradation in underwater images are classic challenges in underwater image enhancement (UIE). The core goal is to restore degraded images to high-quality images with both color and structure that conform to visual perception. However, in the traditional RGB space, these two issues are highly coupled, resulting in existing enhancement methods often neglecting one over the other. To address this challenge, we propose a guided diffusion model based on the principle of decoupling. Our key insight is that in perceptual color spaces such as HSV, color (H, S) and structure (V) are naturally separated. To exploit this property, we first design an adaptive perceptual guidance module (APGM), which analyzes the degraded HSV image and generates two orthogonal guidance signals: a color guide and a structure guide, which guide the denoising process of the diffusion model. To ensure that this decoupled guidance is faithfully implemented, we propose a corresponding decoupled loss optimization module, which uses independent loss functions to supervise the final output color and structure. By combining the forward decoupled guidance with the backward decoupled supervision, we construct a closed-loop optimization framework. This framework enables the model to collaboratively optimize color and structure under various degradation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in a variety of underwater scenes, particularly those degraded by color casts and haze. Furthermore, it exhibits superior performance on no-reference image quality assessment metrics. The source code is available at https://github.com/zy-world/DCD-UIE."

Therefore, it is important to sense the degradation of devices timely and understand the failure mechanisms. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of an online degradation sensing method of Schottky-gate p-GaN HEMTs by tracking changes in current transient feature before and after electrostatic discharge stress. Device degradation was induced by subjecting the gate terminal to repetitive electrostatic discharge stress using on-wafer transmission-line pulse testing on gate. Additionally, a boost circuit was used to simulate real-world operating conditions. The degradation phenomenon is quantified by the drain-to-source current switching rate during turn-on transient, measured via a non-intrusive current probe. The experimental results show that the variation of current switching rate correlates with device degradation and can be effectively used to monitor early failure. Furthermore, degradation mechanisms such as trapping effects and current crowding are investigated and verified by technology computer-aided design simulations."

However, the existing selection criteria for CAI are limited, and the current CAI model groups various types of ankle instability without any precise differentiation of subtypes. This study aimed to apply clustering analysis to identify distinct CAI subtypes. An ordered dataset representing three CAI types (perceived ankle instability (PAI), functional ankle instability (FAI), and mechanical ankle instability (MAI)) was designed, and the K-means clustering algorithm was then applied to clinical data from 210 participants, including individuals with CAI, copers, and healthy people. Clustering analysis was performed using the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool (CAIT), Identification of Functional Ankle Instability (IdFAI), and anterior drawer test (ADT) scores as indicators, followed by dimensionality reduction and cluster validation. The K-Means clustering algorithm identified five distinct CAI subtypes: PAI, FAI, PAI+FAI, PAI+FAI+MAI, and Sub-coper. The clustering model based on clinical data confirmed the absence of pure MAI and showed that CAI patients could present with varying levels of instability. The most prevalent subtype might be a combination of PAI and FAI. This study demonstrates that, by using clustering analysis, CAI can be categorized into distinct subtypes, offering a more precise diagnostic framework. This approach supports the development of subgroup-based management strategies for CAI and highlights the need for updated selection criteria for CAI."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients, enhancing privacy by keeping data local. Yet conventional FL, relying on frequent parameter-sharing, suffers from high communication overhead and limited model heterogeneity. Distillation-based FL approaches address these issues by sharing predictions (softlabels, i.e., normalized probability distributions) instead, but they often involve redundant transmissions across communication rounds, reducing efficiency. We propose SCARLET, a novel framework integrating synchronized soft-label caching and an enhanced Entropy Reduction Aggregation (Enhanced ERA) mechanism. SCARLET minimizes redundant communication by reusing cached soft-labels, achieving up to 50 in communication costs compared to existing methods while maintaining competitive accuracy. Enhanced ERA resolves the fundamental instability of conventional temperature-based aggregation, ensuring robust control and high performance in diverse client scenarios. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that SCARLET consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillationbased FL methods in terms of accuracy and communication efficiency.

A spatially and frequency-resolved image of electromagnetic field intensity is obtained by scanning the region of interest. The sensor is read out by measuring the dc current-voltage (IV) characteristic of the JJ. Discrete frequencies together with their corresponding intensities can be extracted from measurements by evaluating the Shapiro steps in the IV domain. To extract a continuous spectrum from the IV characteristic, the numerical method of Hilbert transform spectroscopy is used and its applicability to our JJs is evaluated. As a benchmark of the setup's capabilities, radiation from a quantum cascade laser (QCL) THz source is characterized both spectrally and spatially. A frequency comb spectrum consistent with the QCL's cavity is revealed by Hilbert transform spectroscopy. The far field radiation patterns of two strong QCL modes are resolved individually and show different characteristics. Optical QCL feedback is observed when the sensor is brought in close proximity."

    "abstract": "This study introduces Adapter-RL, a novel architecture aimed at improving the performance of existing agents in reinforcement learning tasks. The approach integrates human-knowledge-based systems with deep reinforcement learning, combining the interpretability and rule-based logic of the former with the adaptive learning capabilities of the latter. A crucial aspect of this method is the use of “adapters”—concise modules integrated with a base-agent, designed to adjust the policy for specific tasks. The Adapter-RL framework comprises a base-agent responsible for initial decision-making and an adapter module that refines these decisions to meet task-specific requirements. The adapter facilitates efficient training, reduces parameter requirements, and mitigates catastrophic forgetting, enhancing overall performance and adaptability. This architecture enables agents to be fine-tuned effectively, allowing them to adapt to complex tasks with rapidly changing or uncertain conditions. The research demonstrates the efficacy of Adapter-RL through experiments in microRTS, a challenging real-time strategy game. The results demonstrate that Adapter-RL significantly accelerates the training process and outperforms base-agents across various tasks, highlighting its efficiency and robustness. In addition, the study investigates the temperature coefficient tradeoff in adapter training, finding that optimal performance is achievable within a broad range of coefficients. This underscores the stability of the method. The Adapter-RL method enables the specialization of base AI for specific characters or scenarios."

    "abstract": "Multi-temporal hyperspectral imagery (HSI) has become a powerful tool for change detection (CD) owing to its rich spectral signatures and detailed spatial information. Nevertheless, the application of paired HSIs is constrained by the scarcity of annotated training data. While unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) offers a potential solution by transferring change detection knowledge from source to target domains, two critical limitations persist: (1) the labor-intensive process of acquiring and annotating source-domain paired samples, and (2) the suboptimal transfer performance caused by substantial cross-domain distribution discrepancies. To address these challenges, we present a Temporal Self-Construction Cross-Domain learning (TSCCD) framework for UDA-based HSI-CD. Our TSCCD framework introduces an innovative temporal self-construction mechanism that synthesizes bi-temporal source-domain data from existing HSI classification datasets while simultaneously performing initial data-level alignment. Furthermore, we develop a reweighted amplitude maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) metric to enhance feature-level domain adaptation. The proposed architecture incorporates an attention-based Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) with high-frequency feature augmentation within an encoder-decoder structure to effectively capture change characteristics. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that TSCCD achieves superior performance compared to current state-of-the-art methods in HSI change detection tasks.

    "abstract": "Recently, shortage of ground-based communication, transportation, and surveillance services has prompted the exploration of low-altitude airspace, that leads to Low-altitude economy (LAE) networks. Unlike traditional uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) systems, LAE envisions dense networks of flying platforms that serve both as mobile base stations and service nodes. However, the malicious deployment of UAVs in LAE networks can result in serious disasters. Therefore, robust and real-time UAV threat detection capabilities are required, particularly for low-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. To address these challenges within LAE networks, we propose a Hybrid Quantum-Classical Convolutional Neural Network (HQC2NN) for low-SNR RF drone signal classification. The model fuses classical feature extraction with quantum variational circuits to leverage quantum superposition and entanglement for improved representation learning.By providing an efficient and noise-resilient RF sensing mechanism, the proposed HQC2NN directly supports the sensing plane of LAE architectures, enabling reliable situational awareness in dense, interference-prone environments. Simulations demonstrate a classification accuracy of 97.3%, outperforming classical counterparts under noisy conditions. The results underscore the potential of quantum-enhanced deep learning models for robust RF signal analysis and real-time drone detection."

Compared with the conventional Sigma topology, the proposed topology achieves higher efficiency under the same gain and power distribution conditions, due to the optimized duty cycle range of the Buck converter. Besides, all switches in the SHB achieve ZVS through phase-shift control, effectively reducing switching losses.

Although recent deep-neural-network (DNN) detectors exceed 97% accuracy on clean corpora, single-step or optimization-based perturbations can still force misclassification rates above 40%. We address this fragility by designing a memory-efficient, adversarially robust static detector and evaluating it on 381,938 APKs drawn from the CCCS–CIC–AndMal-2020 corpus—ten high-prevalence families (Riskware, Adware, Trojan, Zeroday, Ransomware, Spy, SMS, Dropper, NoCategory, PUA) plus benign apps. A hybrid feature pipeline concatenates 332 permission flags, 148 intent strings, and opcode 3-grams, z-scores them, and reduces dimensionality to 100 principal components via out-of-core Incremental PCA. Class imbalance is mitigated through benign down-sampling to ≈ 1:1 and cost-weighted loss. A lightweight fully connected network (100-256-128-10 soft-max) is first trained on clean data (baseline accuracy = 0.951; AUC = 0.987), then hardened with a dual-curriculum: (i) FGSM (∊=0.05) and (ii) Carlini-Wagner CW ℓ<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> (K=0, 40 iterations).

    "abstract": "Model-free adaptive optimization methods are capable of optimizing unknown, time-varying processes even when other optimization methods are not. However, their practical application is often limited by perturbations that are used to gather information on the unknown cost and its gradient. The aim of this paper is to develop a perturb-and-observe (P&O) method that reduces the need for such perturbations while still achieving fast and accurate tracking of time-varying optima. To this end, a (time-varying) model of the cost is constructed in an online fashion, taking into account the uncertainty on the measured performance cost as well as the decreasing reliability of older measurements. Perturbations are only used when this is expected to lead to improved performance over a certain time horizon. Convergence conditions are provided under which the strategy converges to a neighborhood of the optimum. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that uncertainty-based P&O can reduce the number of perturbations significantly while still tracking a time-varying optimum accurately."

    "abstract": "Regression analysis (RA) is a fundamental tool in statistical modeling, used to uncover relationships between dependent and independent variables. Linear regression (LR) assumes a linear relationship, fitting a straight line to data using methods like ordinary least squares (OLS). Due to its simplicity and interpretability, LR is widely applied in fields such as engineering, economics, medicine, and social sciences; however, it struggles with complex patterns. Multiple linear regression (MLR) extends LR by modeling the dependent variable as a function of multiple independent variables arranged in a polynomial fashion with linear coefficients. Nonlinear regression (NLR) further generalizes this approach by capturing nonlinear relationships through iterative optimization, enabling the modeling of intricate dynamics. However, NLR requires predefined functional forms and careful parameter tuning. Symbolic regression (SR), an advanced machine learning (ML) approach, overcomes these limitations by automatically discovering optimal mathematical expressions without assuming a specific model structure. Using evolutionary algorithms (EAs) such as genetic programming (GP), SR balances accuracy and simplicity, producing interpretable models useful for scientific discovery in physics, engineering, and other domains. This paper presents a novel SR technique based on MLR with an optimal dynamic transformation process for predictors. Unlike traditional SR methods, this technique does not rely on GP, resulting in a more straightforward and interpretable structure."

This approach replaces SRS with RSS, a stratified sampling method that ranks ensemble members and observations using auxiliary information, thus enhancing the representation of the true distribution. RSS improves EnKF by reducing noise (stochastic) and enhancing covariance (deterministic), outperforming SRS, as shown. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that RSS-EnKF is more efficient than traditional EnKF, effectively bridging sampling and assimilation for geophysical applications."

Indonesia, one of the fastest-growing economies in the global south, has significant potential to integrate Web3 technologies into its national Digital Public Infrastructure. While previous DPI initiatives in countries such as India and Estonia have shown the value of open standards and low-cost digital services, there is limited research on how decentralized systems can support higher level digital functions. This paper examines how real-world asset tokenization can serve as an important DPI component for Indonesia. The study analyzes global initiatives in asset tokenization and decentralized identity systems and evaluates how similar approaches can be adapted to Indonesia's socioeconomic environment. The paper argues that open protocols, standardized APIs, and community operated nodes can create a transparent and interoperable infrastructure for tokenized assets. This approach would allow local communities to participate directly in validating asset information and supporting network operations."

This study explores the very essence of the issue and provides a comprehensive study of Intrusion Detection System (IDS), capable of carrying out prediction and analysis of the network traffic to identify and react to the possible threats or attempts of unauthorized access with the help of some popular methods of the Machine Learning field. The effectiveness of deep generative learning for network intrusion detection is investigated in this research. In comparison to the LR model, which has an accuracy (Acc) of 88.7% and an F1-score (F1) of 88.9%, the experimental findings show that BiGAN achieves an accuracy(acc) of 92.15% and an F1-score(F1) of 96.10% on the standard NSL-KDD test data. Comparing analysis with contemporary techniques, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Autoencoder-CNN hybrids, and AdaBoost, also reveals that the BiGAN model is superior in its work. Training curves, validation flaws, confusion matrices, and ROC have been analyzed to prove that the model is stable and has a high level of distinguishing between normal and malicious traffic. Altogether, the findings indicate that generative deep learning and standard classifiers can contribute to the efficient intrusion detection and intrusion classification to a significant extent, which is a promising path toward more resilient cybersecurity solutions."

The classical source seeking control is enhanced with static-triggering conditions to enable aperiodic and less frequent updates of the system’s input signals, offering a resource-aware control design. Our convergence analysis is based on time-scaling combined with Lyapunov and averaging theories for systems with discontinuous right-hand sides. ET-SSC ensures exponentially stable behavior for the resulting average system, leading to practical asymptotic convergence to a small neighborhood of the source point. We guarantee the avoidance of Zeno behavior by establishing a minimum dwell time to prevent infinitely fast switching. The performance optimization is aligned with classical continuous-time source seeking algorithms while balancing system performance with actuation resource consumption. Our ET-SSC algorithm, the first of its kind, allows for arbitrarily large inter-sampling times, overcoming the limitations of classical sampled-data implementations for source seeking control."

    "abstract": "Microservice-based architecture has gained popularity over monolithic architecture during the last few years in both industry and research. This is due to its tremendous advantages (e.g., efficiency, scalability, reliability, etc.). To make use of these advantages, different techniques aiming to migrate monolithic applications to microservices have been proposed. However, these techniques are often based on clustering algorithms that can lead to non-optimal solutions. Also, the identification process often use ad-hoc criteria and tend to overlook several key characteristics of a microservice. Thus, they usually identify microservices that do not match the ones identified by a software architect. To tackle these limitations, we propose in this paper an approach that, on the one hand, takes into account microservice characteristics, and on the other hand, uses well-known metaheuristics in search-based software engineering: the genetic algorithm. The main goal of our approach is to extract microservices from Object-Oriented (OO) monolithic source code by measuring their quality, while considering the semantics of the concept “microservice”. We have experimented with the proposed approach on a collection of Java applications and compared the identified microservices by our approach to those identified by a software architect or domain expert. The conducted experimentation shows the relevance of the identified microservices by our approach."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a notion of backward control barrier certificates to synthesize safety controllers for deterministic systems. Barrier certificates and control barrier certificates play a fundamental role in the automated design of controllers to ensure the safety of dynamical systems. The simultaneous search for control barrier certificates and their controllers typically face challenges in automation as they involve quantifier alternation between the states (for all states) and the inputs (there exists an input) as well as bilinearity between the unknown certificate and control input. In this paper, we show that one may simultaneously search for both a certificate and controller effectively for deterministic systems via standard sum-of-squares approaches without the need for quantifier alternation. Here, we treat the input as a disturbance and build an invariant set over the unsafe set of states rather the the initial set. This set is invariant in the backward direction rather than forward, and hence we dub these as backward control barrier certificates. Ensuring that the initial set is not in this invariant set guarantees the existence of a controller to ensure safety. We show how one may automate the search for these certificates, and discuss some strategies to implement their corresponding safety controllers. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with some case studies."

    "abstract": "This paper considers the backstepping control for a class of general linear infinite-dimensional descriptor systems. By assuming constant matrices in the system description, a decoupling of the descriptor system is possible using the Weierstraß normal form for a matrix pencil with index 1. With this, well-posedness and consistent initial conditions are verified. The resulting decoupled system is a fully actuated hyperbolic-elliptic PDE, where the elliptic PDE can be eliminated by state feedback control. This allows to apply backstepping for the stabilization of a general heterodirectional hyperbolic system with several zero speed states. For the resulting closed-loop system exponential stability is shown. The results of the paper are demonstrated for an unstable infinite-dimensional descriptor system with 6 distributed descriptor variables."

The proposed method relies on data from input-state observations collected over a finite-time horizon while satisfying a specific rank condition. Our data-driven scheme enables the synthesis of R-CBCs and R-SCs directly from observed data, bypassing the need for explicit modeling of the system’s dynamics and thus ensuring robust system safety against disturbances within an infinite time horizon. The proposed approach is formulated as a sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization problem, providing a structured design framework. Two case studies showcase our method’s capability to provide robust safety guarantees for unknown input-affine polynomial systems under bounded disturbances, demonstrating its practical effectiveness."

In this paper we propose an anomaly analysis method for microservice call chain with the help of graph neural network technology. We constructed a call chain diagram model that reveals the call relationships within a microservice system by combining metrics data; Considering the dynamic nature of the system over time, we constructed a microservice anomaly detection method based on Transformer; When a system anomaly is detected, the system constructs a causal graph, and then each node in the causal graph is allocated an anomaly score. The results of the random walk algorithm sort the failure root cause nodes, then complete the microservice root cause location. Experimental results show that this method improved the F1 score for anomaly detection by 8.2 % and the HR@5 metric for root cause localization by 7.3% compared to the best benchmark methods on two datasets."

Many affected countries adopt natural and low-cost measures, such as installing bamboo fences, to protect their shorelines. However, these fences are not durable and require frequent inspection. In Thailand, inspections are carried out manually, a process that is time-consuming, inefficient, and difficult to scale for effective maintenance planning. To address this problem, we propose an automatic system based on deep learning to detect and count individual bamboo poles. The system processes aerial images captured by drones and identifies bamboo poles within the images. We evaluated the proposed method on images collected from actual coastal erosion protection sites, achieving high accuracy with a missing rate ranging from 0.09% to 1.99%, depending on image resolution. These promising results demonstrate the potential of the proposed method as a valuable tool for maintaining bamboo fences and supporting routine government asset inspections."

    "abstract": "The rapid rise of social media has made it one of the most popular platforms for sharing news. However, this has also led to an increase in the spread of misinformation, which negatively affects public trust and safety. Semantic differences between the headline and the news content are sometimes used intentionally to mislead readers about the actual content. In low-resource environments, detecting such misleading content becomes even more challenging due to the limited availability of user metadata or propagation data. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing the Headline-Body Lightweight Attention Network (HBLA-Net), a lightweight cross-attention model focused on identifying semantic inconsistencies between a news article's headline and its content in low-resource environments without relying on user metadata. We utilize two separate DistilBERT encoders to understand the news headline and content separately, and then compare them using a cross-attention mechanism. We evaluate HBLA-Net on two benchmark datasets, FakeNewsNet and ISOT, achieving accuracies of 0.80 and 0.99, respectively, which demonstrates HBLA-Net's performance to be comparable to existing state-of-the-art models. HBLA-Net stands out for its balance of performance and efficiency, making it well-suited for scenarios where computational resources are limited and deployment speed is important. These results suggest that analyzing the relationship between headlines and body text can significantly support the detection of misinformation."

    "abstract": "Health prognosis is crucial for reliable operation of Li-Ion batteries (LIB). Recently, machine learning (ML) methods have attracted significant interest for state-of-health (SOH) prediction of LIB. However, most ML methods overlook the impacts of varying operational conditions on battery SOH, and their generalization ability and interpretability are usually concerned. With the recent advances of large language models (LLMs), this letter proposes an LLM based framework for health prognosis of LIB, which contains two stages: offline parameter-efficient fine-tuning and online applications with retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG) system integration. The first stage fine-tunes the LLM using low-rank adaptation for efficient training with lower memory and computational costs, making it ideal for adapting large models to specific tasks with limited computational resources. In the second stage, the trained model is applied with integrated domain knowledge to enhance explainability. The RAG system interprets the underlying principles of degradation using its knowledge base, providing guidance to adjust operational conditions for improving battery health. The proposed framework is implemented with distilled DeepSeek-r1 models and achieves high prediction accuracy. Additionally, the RAG system provides credible and context-aware explanations for prognosis results."

In generative AI, these models play a crucial role by enabling the creation of high-quality text, code, and content creation (viz., poetry, stories, etc.). While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating human-like language, they are often limited by high computational costs, significant memory necessities, and energy inefficiency. These limitations make LLMs impractical for deployment on edge devices or in low-resource environments, creating a demand for SLMs that provide similar functionalities with optimized efficiency and reduced resource consumption. Unlike LLMs, SLMs are designed to operate with lower computational requirements, fewer parameters, and minimal memory usage, making them ideal for deployment on resource-constrained devices, namely smartphones, IoT devices, and tiny embedded systems. Thus, this paper provides a beginner's guide to SLMs, exploring their core concepts, advantages, and applications."

Recent advances suggest that random delays can be effectively modeled as stochastic multiplicative uncertainty, enabling the characterization of system stability via mean-square criteria and the application of robust control techniques. This paper contributes to this body of knowledge by confirming, for the first time, that the long-standing law for state feedback stabilization—namely, that the total channel capacity should exceed the topological entropy of the open-loop plant—remains valid for random delay channels, at least in the context of a first-order system with one-step delay. Unlike prior work that focused on minimum-phase mean channels, our study lifts this restriction, offering a more general perspective, which may provide more insights for further research in networked control systems with random delays."

    "abstract": "Managing power grids with the increasing presence of variable renewable energy-based (distributed) generation involves solving high-dimensional optimization tasks at short intervals. Linearizing the AC power flow (PF) constraints is a standard practice to ease the computational burden at the cost of hopefully acceptable inaccuracies. However, the design of these PF linearizations has traditionally been agnostic of the use case. Towards bridging the linearization-application gap, we first model the complete operational sequence needed to implement optimal power flow (OPF) decisions on power systems and characterize the effect of PF linearization on the resulting steady-state system operation. We then propose a novel formulation for obtaining optimal PF constraint linearizations to harness desirable system-operation attributes such as low generation cost and engineering-limit violations. To pursue the optimal PF linearization, we develop a gradient-based approach backed by sensitivity analysis of optimization routines and AC PF equations. Numerical tests on the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate the capabilities of our approach in traversing the cost-optimality vs operational feasibility trade-off inherent to OPF approximations."

    "abstract": "Conventional music recommendation systems typically rely on user listening history or collaborative filtering. Although these techniques are effective to an extent, they rarely reflect the listener's present emotional state, which limits the relevance of recommendations. With advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), it has become feasible to create systems that adapt dynamically to a user's mood. This paper introduces an integrated framework that combines Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) with Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based lyric sentiment analysis to generate emotion-aware music suggestions. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are employed for facial emotion detection, while Transformer-based models such as DistilRoBERTa, BERT, and BART analyze lyrical sentiment. A Flask-based pipeline supports real-time interaction and deployment. Unlike conventional cloud-only systems, this study adopts a Dew-Edge-Cloud layered approach, where lightweight inference is executed at the edge, and dew servers handle intermediate processing, reducing latency and enhancing user responsiveness. Developing such frameworks, however, introduces challenges related to imbalanced data, ambiguous emotional categories, hardware limitations, and the subjectivity of emotion-to-music mapping. Future work points toward multimodal fusion that incorporates facial, acoustic, and physiological cues, and considers user-specific factors like age, culture, and language. The findings demonstrate that integrating vision and language models enhances emotional alignment in music recommendations, showing promise for applications in entertainment, therapy, and human-computer interaction."

As a proof of concept, we illustrate the idea by introducing a QSS-based Adams-Bashforth method applied to a test equation. We then move to demonstrate how the proposed approach can achieve notable performance improvements in realistic power system simulations."

    "abstract": "The public transport system's complementing information processing, control, and communication capabilities could be enhanced by the Internet of Things (IoT). The networked and cooperative operation of automated transportation is guaranteed by the Internet of Things-enabled Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Many IoT devices in an IoT network can communicate with servers, or users can access IoT devices via an open channel using a specific message exchange. IoT offers numerous advantages, such as efficiency, automation, and convenience, but it also poses serious security risks because there aren't enough appropriate, industry-standard security safeguards in place. As a result, bad actors might be able to introduce malware into the network. In order to steal information or harm the systems' resources, they might initiate destructive attacks. By adding intrusion detection and prevention systems to the network, this can be lessened. To implement preventative measures for secure communication and a malware-free network, an intelligent intrusion detection system is necessary. By facilitating the smooth integration of numerous devices and systems, the IoT-enabled ITS, or SDLMA-IITS for short, has completely transformed the transportation sector. It strategically uses sensors, networked devices, and data analytics to increase the environmental friendliness, safety, and efficiency of transportation networks. Because of the Internet of Things' ability to enhance traffic management, lessen congestion, enable real-time monitoring, and streamline transportation operations, its use in ITS has become more and more common. For several reasons, including securing sensitive data, ensuring privacy, preventing unwanted access, and guarding against the possibility of disruptions or manipulations, IoT-enabled ITS systems and devices need to be secured against cyberattacks. The functionality and performance of the deployed smart IoT devices are impacted by malware assaults. For IoT-enabled ITS, we suggest a safe malware attack detection method powered by deep learning. Effective malware detection has been achieved with the use of explainable artificial intelligence."

    "abstract": "The efficient operation of civil aviation flight scheduling systems is the core to ensure the safety and economy of air transportation. Current traditional scheduling methods generally suffer from issues such as air-ground scheduling disconnection, insufficient adaptation to dynamic scenarios, and imbalance in multi-objective optimization. To address these pain points, this study focuses on three core aspects: dynamic flight landing scheduling, parking bay allocation, and ground support vehicle scheduling, and constructs an integrated intelligent optimization algorithm system. For dynamic flight landing scheduling, an improved intelligent algorithm incorporating interference perception factors is designed to achieve real-time response to air traffic fluctuations and sudden interference. For parking bay allocation, a two-stage hybrid algorithm integrating operational preferences is proposed to balance the bridgeadjacent rate, taxi fuel consumption, and practicality requirements. For ground support vehicle scheduling, a discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm based on stochastic simulation is developed to effectively control the risk of vehicle conflicts caused by flight delays. Simultaneously, information linkage among the three aspects is achieved through a collaborative mechanism, forming a full-process scheduling closed loop of “landing - parking bay - vehicle”. Multi-scenario experimental verification shows that the proposed algorithm can reduce total flight delay time by 28%, increase the bridge-adjacent rate by 9%-14%, and control the probability of vehicle scheduling conflicts within a threshold of 5%. This provides a practical technical solution for the intelligent upgrade of civil aviation flight scheduling systems."

Our solution exploits the wheel’s dynamics decomposition to project the wheels’ internal dynamics and friction forces, preserving all their mechanical effects without hard assumptions. Developing a closed-kinematic chain dynamical analysis, our approach embraces the parallel-serial manipulator and the articulated suspension in a unique screw-theory formulation. Additionally, with respect to previous approaches, our normal forces solutions account for all nonlinear dynamics and accelerations in both the articulated suspension and the wheels. This results in an accuracy enhancement, as demonstrated by a reduction of the average error in normal forces computation by half while traversing uneven terrains when simulating a 7-DoF mobile manipulator with a 2-DoF suspension. We include a losing-contacts robust formulation."

    "abstract": "In recent years, GPUs are widely used as highperformance computing platforms in various computing domains such as scientific computing and AI. Although GPUs have high computing power, architecture-aware optimizations are needed to exploit the performance. Optimizing data layout in the GPU memory is crucial among such optimizations because it directly affects the memory access efficiency which often dominates the GPU performance. However, current GPU programming requires low-level hand-optimizations thus automatic optimization is desired. In this paper, we propose a performance estimation method of GPU programs based on static code analysis. Estimating each execution time of the target program with a different data layout enables selecting the optimal data layout automatically. The proposed method analyzes not only the CUDA source code but also PTX code, which is compiled from the source code, to obtain the executed instructions. The method constructs a control flow graph and extracts memory access patterns from array index expressions. Then it estimates the execution time of the program using the instruction latency model of the GPU. As a result of an evaluation using 4 typical computation kernels such as matrix multiplication from PolyBench benchmark suite, the estimation of our method was enough to select the optimal data layout from AoS, SoA and ASTA."

Therefore, output measurements collected using sensors, which represent the only available information about the dynamic system in this case, can be used to identify transmissibility operators. Generalized transmissibility operators, which have been recently introduced, provide a more general mathematical characterization of transmissibility operators by relaxing an assumption that requires knowledge of the dimension of the excitation signal to construct meaningful transmissibility operators. Although generalized transmissibility operators are constructed from the zeros of the underlying system and not the poles, we show in this paper that the determinant of the difference between two generalized transmissibility operators constructed between the same outputs but under different input locations can be used to determine the poles of the underlying system. We apply the proposed approach to determine the poles of a motion system from two transmissibility operators."

    "abstract": "This paper considers a network of open quantum harmonic oscillators which interact with their neighbours through direct energy and field-mediated couplings and also with external quantum fields. The position-momentum dynamic variables of the network are governed by linear quantum stochastic differential equations associated with the nodes of a graph whose edges specify the interconnection of the component oscillators. Such systems can be employed as quantum memories with an engineered ability to approximately retain initial conditions over a bounded time interval. We use the quantum memory decoherence time defined previously in terms of a fidelity threshold on a weighted mean-square deviation for a subset (or linear combinations) of network variables from their initial values. This approach is applied to maximizing a high-fidelity asymptotic approximation of the decoherence time over the direct energy coupling parameters of the network. The resulting optimality condition is a set of linear equations for blocks of a sparse matrix associated with the edges of the direct energy coupling graph of the network. We also discuss a setting where the quantum network has a subset of dynamic variables which are affected by the external fields only indirectly, through a complementary \"shielding\" system. The partially isolated subnetwork has a longer decoherence time in the high-fidelity limit, which is also amenable to optimization."

    "abstract": "Vertical Split Federated Learning (VSFL) allows participants to collaboratively train a better model with different features vertically partitioned in the same sample space, where the model is divided into bottom model and top model by the cut layer, trained by passive and active participants respectively. However, in the process, the labels owned by the active participant will still be inferred or stolen by curious or malicious passive participants. In this paper, we propose Casper, a causality-inspired defense mechanism with a confounder against label inference attacks in VSFL. Casper first analyzes the feasibility of optimizing the training process in VSFL at the intervention level from a causal perspective. It then introduces a confounder consisting of cut layer output reconstruction and label obfuscation to disrupt the direct causality between cut layer outputs and labels. Additionally, we integrate selective discrepancy training to further ensure model utility by strategically balancing training between active and passive participants. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets across different tasks demonstrate that Casper effectively preserves label privacy while maintaining model performance, significantly outperforming current advanced defending methods in VSFL."

    "abstract": "To address key challenges including Cyclone GNSS (CYGNSS) sparse point observations, insufficient coverage in coastal regions, and systematic underestimation of high wind speeds, this study proposes a PIDW-E2E deep learning framework that integrates U-Net and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), achieving for the first time end-to-end generation of daily gap-free gridded wind speed products based on CYGNSS observations. The model effectively extracts spatially correlated features of normalized bistatic radar cross section (NBRCS), addressing the coupling challenge between sparse point observations and complex wind field structures while simultaneously accomplishing coastal wind speed retrieval and data gap filling in unobserved areas. By further incorporating a physics-constrained loss function and a high wind speed label enhancement strategy, the model significantly improves retrieval performance in high wind speed regions. The results show that, when evaluated against daily ERA5 wind speeds, the gridded product generated by the model achieves an overall RMSE of 0.92m/s. Compared to CYGNSS L2 FDS data, the RMSE is further reduced by 0.67m/s. In coastal wind speed reconstruction tasks, PIDW-E2E demonstrates significant advantages, producing spatially complete coverage in coastal regions (RMSE ∼1.10m/s, Bias ∼-0.01m/s) with accuracy comparable to that of open ocean areas. For tropical cyclone monitoring, the model effectively mitigates systematic underestimation in high wind speed regions. Under conditions where the maximum retrievable wind speed reaches 45m/s, the model achieves an RMSE of 3.47m/s and a Bias of -1.39m/s relative to the daily HWRF wind speed reference data. This study provides a new approach for CYGNSS wind speed retrieval that combines gap-free coverage capability with enhanced responsiveness in high wind speed regions."

This innovative design utilizes the unique flexibility, biocompatibility, and mechanical properties of polymers to achieve excellent integration and performance consistency. The FBG array, with three FBGs inscribed in a single-mode polymer fiber using femtosecond laser micromachining, featuring progressively increasing lengths to compensate for the reflectivity degradation typically observed in conventional FBGs. The 3D arc-shaped arrangement of the FBG array endows the sensor with the ability to achieve 3D force perception, including normal stress, left shear stress, and right shear stress. By accurately measuring the wavelength shifts of the FBGs under different force stimuli, the sensor can accurately distinguish multi-directional forces. Experimental results show that the sensor has high force sensitivities to the left shear force, normal force, and right shear force with sensitivities of 4.973nm/N, 4.363nm/N, and 4.746nm/N, and measurement resolutions of 0.02N, 0.023N, and 0.021N, respectively, within a verified linear working range of 0 N to 0.8 N. Its sensitivity is as high as 17 times that of the traditional quartz optical fiber FBG sensor. our sensor can accurately measure multi-dimensional forces with very good sensitivity and significantly reduce the crosstalk caused by humidity, demonstrating very good performance. Its all-polymer design exhibits high flexibility and environmental robustness—completely eliminating crosstalk caused by humidity changes. It is expected to have potential applications in advanced robotics and intelligent tactile sensing systems."

Eleven preprocessing techniques were individually applied to evaluate their impact on classification performance, with Gaussian filtering yielding the best results. A custom convolutional neural network (CNN) enhanced with Convolutional Block Attention Modules (CBAM) was trained alongside four strong baseline architectures, ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, EfficientNetB0, and ViT-B16, under consistent experimental settings. EfficientNet-B0 with Gaussian filtering achieved the highest performance under the fixed train-validation-test split (97.30%), while cross-validation identified DenseNet-121 with Gaussian filtering as the most consistently reliable configuration. Model interpretability was further assessed using multiple XAI methods, including Grad-CAM, Integrated Gradients, Saliency Maps, Guided Backpropagation, and DeepLIFT, highlighting regions most relevant to clinical decision-making. The findings suggest that the integration of preprocessing optimization, attention-based CNN design, and explainable AI offers a reliable and interpretable approach for lung cancer classification, while future work will aim to validate the framework on larger, multi-institutional datasets."

    "abstract": "In this paper we study fully asynchronous random access (RA) multiple antenna receiver in a Rayleigh block-fading AWGN channel with pure path delays. Although our approach can be used to detect users in a grant-free random access system, where each user sporadically and without waiting for a permission from a base station (BS) transmits short messages, we in particular consider the pilot-based unsourced random access (U-RA), where those messages are from a common codebook. The first and arguably the most important task of the pilotbased U-RA receiver is to detect the list of transmitted pilots. Due to the propagation through the considered channel, those pilots are received as a superposition at the BS with delays, due to the lack of perfect timing synchronization. We show that the output of the chip matched filter at the BS receiver can be seen as the superposition of two zero-padded versions of each transmitted pilot sequence. We include this observation in the compressed sensing (CS) formulation of the activity detection (AD) problem, and solve it using the multiple measurement vectors approximate message passing (MMV-AMP) algorithm and a dedicated parametrized 2-level hierarchical sparsity (P2-LHS) denoiser. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed scheme can accurately detect U-RA messages and shows excellent robustness to timing asynchronism. The proposed denoiser vastly outperforms the standard Bernoulli-Gaussian (BG) denoiser for a large range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values. Furthermore, using outage rate analysis, we investigate the performance of the asynchronous U-RA receiver using a Gaussian codebook and minimum distance decoding in the data phase. Our results show that a significant gain in throughput can be achieved when users adopt rate control (RC)."

The framework ensures that these units consistently achieve specified performance levels while demonstrating resilience to abnormal voltage signals. First, an innovative overload-avoiding performance transformation method is proposed. This approach confines the synchronization errors of all generators within prescribed performance boundaries without imposing restrictions on their initial voltage conditions. In addition, a mean-filtering-based memory event-triggered mechanism is developed to bolster the robustness of the secondary voltage control process against non-real-time signals, while also mitigating undesirable voltage fluctuations that may occur in microgrids by utilizing stored stable data. It is shown that the generators' output voltages accurately track the desired reference voltage, with the tracking performance strictly adhering to the prescribed performance criteria. Simulation results further validate the efficacy of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "3D point cloud registration, which seeks the optimal rigid transformation to align two point clouds, is a fundamental task in autonomous systems. However, the 3D correspondences between point clouds are prone to substantial outliers (mismatches), leading to significant decreases in registration accuracy. Existing outlier-robust registration methods commonly have high computational complexity and, hence, are limited in time-sensitive applications. Inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors are widespread in modern autonomous systems and can offer precise gravity directions. Accordingly, we propose a highly efficient voting-based outlier removal method by leveraging the gravity prior in this paper. This pre-processing step can significantly reduce the candidate correspondence set for subsequent estimation, thus accelerating robust point cloud registration. We then leverage pairwise invariant features to decompose the optimization of rotation and translation. Further, we propose a two-stage consensus maximization solver to optimize the rotation and translation sequentially, leading to deterministic and robust registration. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets indicate that our method effectively boosts registration efficiency while exhibiting comparable robustness to state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "We address the problem of speech denoising where the goal is to extract clean speech signal from a noisy signal. Traditionally, the task of denoising has been performed using audio modality only. However, human speech perception is inherently multimodal where cues from visual modality are used to understand the speech better in a noisy environment. Similar observation has been made with computational denoising methods, i.e., performance of audio only model improves after adding visual modality. Inspired by these findings we propose a novel audio-visual network for adaptively combining both modalities for the task of speech audio denoising. We show that extracting noise from mixed audio and using it as a conditioning signal, improves speech denoising performance. To estimate the noise, we use both audio and visual modalities, i.e., lip region of the speaker, to extract the non-speech/silent regions from it. The silent regions enable us to estimate better noise profile to eliminate from the signal. Our proposed network uses self and cross attention framework between audio and video features, along the temporal dimension, to model correlations between the two modalities. We evaluate the proposed approach on a large scale audio-visual dataset VoxCeleb2 and obtain state-of-the-art results. We also demonstrate generalization to unseen speakers at test time."

    "abstract": "Facial Expression Recognition (FER) has emerged as a pivotal research domain within computer vision and affective computing. Despite technological advances in deep learning architectures such as CNNs, VGG-16, ResNet-50, and MobileNet, FER systems continue to face critical challenges, particularly data imbalance where some emotional categories are abundantly represented while others appear far less frequently. This imbalance leads to biased model performance and poor recognition rates for minority emotions, which are often the most crucial in sensitive applications. While numerous systematic reviews have examined fundamental FER aspects including recognition techniques, deep learning methodologies, and general challenges, there is a notable absence of focused systematic literature reviews that comprehensively analyze imbalance-specific solutions within FER. Our analysis revealed four primary approaches to handling data imbalance in FER: (1) Loss Function approaches - the most prevalent due to their simplicity and computational efficiency, (2) Generative Network approaches demonstrating the highest performance gains through sophisticated synthetic data generation; (3) Resampling approaches offering intuitive solutions through oversampling and undersampling techniques; and (4) Learning approaches employing multi-stage and ensemble architectures for sophisticated representation learning."

    "abstract": "Recent methods to enhance Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for Visual Question Answering (VQA) have focused on strengthening their inference capabilities, enabling them to tackle VQA tasks independently rather than merely as aids to Large Language Models (LLMs). However, these approaches often ignore the rich commonsense knowledge inside the given VQA image sampled from the real world, limiting the full potential of VLMs. Inspired by the human top-down reasoning process, i.e., systematically exploring relevant issues to derive a comprehensive answer, this work introduces a novel, explainable multi-agent collaboration framework by leveraging the expansive knowledge of LLMs to enhance the capabilities of VLMs themselves. Our framework comprises three agents, i.e., <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Responder</i>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Seeker</i>, and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Integrator</i>, to collaboratively answer the given VQA question by seeking its relevant issues and generating the final answer in such a top-down reasoning process. The VLM-based <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Responder</i> agent generates the answer candidates for the question and responds to other relevant issues. The <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Seeker</i> agent, primarily based on LLM, identifies relevant issues related to the question to inform the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Responder</i> agent and constructs a Multi-View Knowledge Base (MVKB) for the given visual scene by leveraging the build-in world knowledge of LLM. The <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Integrator</i> agent combines knowledge from the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Seeker</i> agent and the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Responder</i> agent to produce the final VQA answer. Extensive and comprehensive evaluations on diverse VQA datasets with a variety of VLMs demonstrate the superior performance and interpretability of our framework over the baseline method, e.g., 5.7% improvement on VQA-RAD and 5.2% on Winoground in the zero-shot setting without extra training cost."

First, it generalizes the antenna crosstalk model from the conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) system to MA. Then, a Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) minimization problem driven by joint beamforming and antenna position design is presented. To address the problem, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach, specifically the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm is employed to train a flexible beamforming agent. Numerical results show that the proposed crosstalk-resilient (CR) beamforming outperforms other benchmark schemes under antenna crosstalk."

While spatial super-resolution and spectral super-resolution have been extensively studied, joint spatio-spectral super-resolution remains relatively explored. We propose an end-to-end model-driven framework that explicitly decomposes the joint spatio-spectral super-resolution problem into spatial super-resolution, spectral super-resolution and fusion tasks. Each sub-task is addressed by unfolding a variational-based approach, where the operators involved in the proximal gradient iterative scheme are replaced with tailored learnable modules. In particular, we design an upsampling operator for spatial super-resolution based on classical back-projection algorithms, adapted to handle arbitrary scaling factors. Spectral reconstruction is performed using learnable cluster-based upsampling and downsampling operators. For image fusion, we integrate low-frequency estimation and high-frequency injection modules to combine the spatial and spectral information from spatial super-resolution and spectral super-resolution outputs. Additionally, we introduce an efficient nonlocal post-processing step that leverages image self-similarity by combining a multi-head attention mechanism with residual connections. Extensive evaluations on several datasets and sampling factors demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

    "abstract": "Identifying key nodes in multiplex networks is a fundamental problem in the field of network science, which has attracted widespread attention from many scholars. In recent decades, various centrality methods have been proposed for identifying key nodes in multiplex networks. However, these existing methods only utilize the single structural information of multiplex network, resulting in unsatisfactory performance of algorithms. In this paper, we define a simple and effective multiplex centrality based on Dempster -Shafer(MCBDS) evidence theory, which combines local and semi-local information of networks. The proposed centrality trades off between the multi-degree centrality and Supra-Laplacian centrality values of every node in multiplex networks. The influences of both the multi-degree and Supra-Laplacian of each node are represented by basic probability assignment(BPA), which consists of elements <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">high</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">low</i>. <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">High</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">low</i> are the absolute values of the difference between the centrality value of node <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</i> and the maximum and minimum centrality values of all nodes, respectively. Therefore, BPA can represent the degree of trust in node <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</i> being an important node and the degree of trust in node <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</i> not being an important node when using multi-degree or Supra-Laplacian centrality to measure node importance. Then, the MCBDS is proposed by combining these BPAs. In the simulation experiment, we compare the performance of our proposed centrality with other existing centrality methods on three real-world multiplex networks by introducing Linear Threshold(LT) model and resolution entropy(RE) index. The experimental results indicate that our proposed centrality algorithm is a competitive and effective centrality algorithm."

    "abstract": "Organizations face a major problem with employee turnover, which affects operating expenses, morale, and productivity. Machine learning (ML)-powered human resource (HR) analytics provides a data-driven method for proactively identifying workers who are at danger of quitting. In order to forecast employee turnover using structured HR data, this study investigates the use of many machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting. Workload, tenure, pay, performance evaluations, job satisfaction, and demographics are among the key characteristics examined. In order to improve model accuracy and interpretability, feature selection methods are used, and the dataset is preprocessed to address inequities and missing values. The findings show that ensemble approaches perform better in terms of prediction, especially Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. HR departments can apply focused retention tactics, such customized employee engagement initiatives and pay modifications, according to insights gained from the model. By switching from reactive to proactive talent management, this study highlights how ML can revolutionize HR decision-making processes. The results show how data analytics may be used to increase organizational effectiveness and lower turnover. The original aspect of this study is the development of a new HR analytics system that combines machine learning and explainable AI to forecast the time when employees may leave a company in realtime. This system combines a number of various models in the process of prediction, such as logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting, to ensure that the predictions are more accurate and reliable even in situations where a different type of employees is used."

The outer-loop controller generates an acceleration reference, which is then converted into attitude and angular velocity references, later tracked by a nonlinear inner-loop controller. Numerical simulations validate the approach, demonstrating enhanced performance in precise and fast tracking by imposing less conservative constraints than existing approaches, while still guaranteeing stability."

These conventional methods typically suffer from reliance on large training datasets or lack a formalized language for precise edits. Utilizing CGA as a robust formal language, our system, Shenlong, precisely models spatial transformations necessary for accurate object repositioning. Leveraging the zero-shot learning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs, Shenlong translates natural language instructions into CGA operations which are then applied to the scene, facilitating exact spatial transformations within 3D scenes without the need for specialized pre-training. Implemented in a realistic simulation environment, Shenlong ensures compatibility with existing graphics pipelines. To accurately assess the impact of CGA, we benchmark against robust Euclidean Space baselines, evaluating both latency and accuracy. Comparative performance evaluations indicate that Shenlong significantly reduces LLM response times by 16% and boosts success rates by 9.6% on average compared to the traditional methods. Notably, Shenlong achieves a 100% perfect success rate in common practical queries, a benchmark where other systems fall short. These advancements underscore Shenlong's potential to democratize 3D scene editing, enhancing accessibility and fostering innovation across sectors such as education, digital entertainment, and virtual reality."

The dual-band antenna element consists of a low-band bowl-shaped antenna with a ring for the low-band and a high-band dipole antenna, placed in the center of the bowl. The ring is used to reduce the size of the dual-band antenna element without compromising the bandwidth. The presence of the ring can introduce spurious resonance modes in the structure that impairs the performance of the antenna. These resonances are suppressed by placing stubs on the ring. The proposed dual-band antenna element consists of robust metallic components, with some dielectric supports. As a result, the antenna provides a high radiation efficiency and power handling, making it suitable as a base station antenna. Furthermore, the presented antenna is also demonstrated to be suitable for array configurations, which is critical for the targeted application. A prototype is manufactured and tested to corroborate the simulation results, and a good agreement is found. Importantly, the measured radiation efficiency is higher than 96% and 93% in the targeted low and high bands."

To avoid combinatorial challenges and the limitation of case-by-case studies, this paper proposes a systematic and efficient method for determining optimal allocation of grid-forming and grid-following inverters in power networks. The approach leverages a novel unified grid-forming/following inverter control and formulates an optimization problem to ensure stability and maximal energy dissipation during transient periods. An iterative algorithm is developed to solve the optimization problem. The resulting optimal droop gains for the unified inverters provide insights into the network’s needs for grid-forming and grid-following resources. A three-bus system is used to demonstrate the optimality and dynamic performance of the proposed method."

This approach leverages learning techniques to improve the accuracy of density reconstruction despite constraints in available data. For the sake of consistency, we will prove that, if only using data from dynamical systems, the approximate density predicted by our learned-based model converges to a well-known macroscopic traffic flow model when the number of vehicles approaches infinity."

    "abstract": "Carbon reduction targets are a major challenge for cement manufacturing world-wide, as carbon dioxide is released from the raw material and from the material burning process. Therefore, kiln operation must be considered: kiln stops, or dwell times, have to be avoided or at least kept at a minimum. To reduce the emissions, new refractory lining concepts have been developed by designing a new finer ceramic microstructure. These novel basic and non-basic brick grades with porosities of up to 25%, reduce heat loss due to their exceptionally low heat transfer characteristics. All other properties, including refractoriness, strength, structural elasticity, permeability and thermal shock resistance, are kept at values that are proven to be effective for rotary kiln lining applications. Additionally, consideration is given to kiln linings which are exposed to gases with higher alkali content, so silicon carbide containing bricks are an essential part of this emission and energy-saving concept. The installation of these new products is as easy as it is for standard products, with no required additional effort or considerations. The results of recent installations show a significant decrease in kiln shell temperature. The reduction in overall CO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> emission is calculated using approximately .5 kg/t clinker, the resulting thermal energy input at the main burner is reduced by 4-5% and the kiln shell heat losses drop by up to 25%, which is enormous considering that the rotary kiln process is already optimized. The reduction in overall CO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> emission is calculated to reach up to an impressive 2%. In addition to a lower lining weight, there is also a 10% reduction of refractory lining material, resulting in improved sustainability and reduced carbon footprint. This impacts not only for the kiln operator, but also the refractory producer and the environment: carbon challenge accepted."

    "abstract": "We study a nonlinear control problem in which linear dynamics are regulated by a time-varying state-feedback law. The nonlinearity arises from the bilinear interaction between the feedback gain and the state. We show that the classical Kalman controllability condition, easily seen to be necessary, is also sufficient in this setting. More strongly, we establish that one can not only prescribe the terminal state vector over any finite horizon, but also steer the entire state-transition matrix to an arbitrary target with positive determinant.Our interest in controlling the state-transition matrix is motivated by the problem of regulating ensembles of agents that evolve according to the given dynamics, where a common time-varying feedback gain is broadcast and applied by all agents. We show that, under a suitable protocol, a collection of particles can be repositioned arbitrarily fast into any admissible terminal configuration.While this work was initially intended as an extended abstract for the journal article [1], which develops broader results on controllability over diffeomorphism groups, the present article now provides an independent constructive derivation of main result and of the feedback protocols that achieve prescribed terminal state-transition matrices."

    "abstract": "The cement industry is responsible for approximately 7-8% of global CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions, contributing around 2.8 gigatonnes (Gt) of CO2 annually. As a major contributor to global warming, the industry is under significant pressure to reduce its carbon footprint and meet the ambitious net-zero carbon target by 2050. Cement production, particularly the calcination of limestone in clinker production, accounts for about 60% of these emissions, with an additional 35% resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels. The industry's reliance on energy-intensive processes exacerbates its carbon impact, highlighting the urgent need for sustainable practices.This article explores the various strategies being pursued by the cement industry to reduce CO2 emissions, and how advanced combustion systems and alternative energy solutions can contribute to the energy transition of the cement sector.Key strategies include enhancing energy efficiency and transitioning to lower-carbon fuels like natural gas biomass, alternative solid fuels (ASFs) and hydrogen which offer immediate reductions in CO2 emissions. Reducing the clinker-to-cement ratio by incorporating Supplementary Cementitious Materials (SCMs) such as calcined clay and fly ash is another effective approach. Additionally, combining Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS) with oxy-fuel combustion is highlighted as a crucial approach for long-term decarbonization, though it is still in the initial stages of development.In conclusion, the cement industry's path to decarbonization is complex, requiring the adoption of advanced technologies and innovative practices. Combustion specialized companies are playing a critical role in this transition, helping the industry move closer to achieving its net-zero carbon goals by 2050."

    "abstract": "In recent years, contrastive learning has made significant progress in DeepFake detection. However, existing methods emphasize class granularity, and it is difficult to distinguish between the real instance and its forgery counterparts effectively. Furthermore, the diversity of forgery cues produced by different manipulation methods cannot be effectively clustered by class granularity alone. Thus, the model’s generalization capability is limited. To tackle the above problems, a Dual-Granularity Contrastive Learning (DGCL) for DeepFake detection is proposed in this paper. Specifically, Class Granularity Contrastive Learning (CGCL) and Instance Granularity Contrastive Learning (IGCL) are designed. Firstly, for semantic aggregation at the class level, CGCL incorporates the class prototype, which encourages anchor approaches to the prototype of the positive class, thereby pulling the intra-class features closer. Secondly, for distinguishing between real and fake instances, Real Instance Granularity Contrastive Learning (RIGCL) and Fake Instance Granularity Contrastive Learning (FIGCL) are proposed based on the instance characteristics. RIGCL endeavors to distinguish fake instances from original real instances by expanding the differentiation in the feature space. Meanwhile, FIGCL extracts consistent forgery features from various manipulation methods using cosine similarity constraints. Finally, the superiority and generalizability of DGCL are validated by the experimental results on CELEBDF, DFD, and DFDC datasets."

Underground substations, widely used in dense urban areas, pose unique challenges due to high ambient temperatures, constrained spaces, and noisy or irregular data, which limit the effectiveness of conventional data-driven analytics. This study proposes and validates a hybrid Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) framework specifically designed to analyze operational data from underground substations. Real-world data from 43 substations managed by CEEE Equatorial in Porto Alegre, Brazil, were preprocessed and analyzed using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to uncover latent operational patterns and the Apriori algorithm to extract association rules that explain and validate these patterns. The framework integrates rigorous data cleaning, normalization, discretization, and interpretable clustering and rule-mining techniques implemented in R and WEKA. Experimental results identified meaningful clusters representing distinct operational regimes, including a critical anomalous cluster characterized by high temperature combined with low-voltage and low-current conditions. Association rules reinforced the interpretability of these clusters and highlighted operational anomalies with high confidence and support. The proposed framework demonstrates practical relevance for intelligent monitoring, anomaly detection, and decision support in Smart Grid systems. Future work includes temporal modeling, incorporation of external contextual data, and the use of hybrid or deep learning approaches to enhance model scalability and diagnostic accuracy."

Our paradigm leverages a residual learning approach, which embeds boundary conditions (BCs) while focusing on learning only the adjustments needed to steer a standard solution to an optimal one. Compared to a computationally expensive OCP-based planner, our paradigm achieves 87.3% of the performance near the training dataset and 50.8% far from the dataset, while being two to three orders-of-magnitude faster."

However, identifying these systems from closed-loop experimental data remains a challenge due to the correlations induced by the feedback loop. Traditional nonlinear closed-loop system identification methods struggle with reliance on precise noise models, robustness to data variations, or computational feasibility. Additionally, it is essential to ensure that the identified model is stabilized by the same controller used during data collection, ensuring alignment with the true system’s closed-loop behavior. The dual Youla parameterization provides a promising solution for linear systems, offering statistical guarantees and closed-loop stability. However, extending this approach to nonlinear systems presents additional complexities. In this work, we propose a computationally tractable framework for identifying complex, potentially unstable systems while ensuring closed-loop stability using a complete parameterization of systems stabilized by a given controller. We establish asymptotic consistency in the linear case and validate our method through numerical comparisons, demonstrating superior accuracy over direct identification baselines and compatibility with the true system in stability properties."

A comparative study was performed with 50 participants across various age groups and health profiles, with device readings being compared to those of a clinical-grade ECG. The wearable system demonstrated an impressive 1.1 BPMMAE and 1.5 BPMRMSE, hence indicating the ability of the system to alert abnormal heart rates adequately in real-time. Feedback from users indicated that the watch was easy to use and satisfactory, although it still felt slightly uncomfortable after extended hours of wear.

This study evaluates the performance of 11 supervised learning models for classifying vector-borne diseases, using a dataset of 300 patient records from Burkina Faso, where malaria accounts for approximately 79% of cases. To address class imbalance, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied. The results indicate that LightGBM and Voting Algorithm stand out as the best-performing models among those tested. Specifically, LightGBM achieved the highest accuracy on balanced datasets, with an accuracy of 98.3% and an F1-score of 98.2%. Meanwhile, the Voting Algorithm performed best on imbalanced datasets, achieving an accuracy of 86.44% and an F1-score of 83.40%. These findings highlight the importance of selecting an appropriate model based on dataset characteristics. This study emphasizes that the accuracy of vector-borne disease prediction can be significantly improved by exploring additional machine learning models. Regardless of whether the dataset is balanced or imbalanced, tailored approaches can optimize classification performance. Finally, these findings offer new perspectives on the application of artificial intelligence to enhance disease diagnosis in resource-limited settings."

    "abstract": "As Electric Vehicles (EVs) are connected to the smart grid, this can provide both a transformational opportunity and a considerable challenge to the future sustainable energy infrastructure. With the growing deployment of EVs around the world, the strain on the power grids is increasing, especially during peak times of change. We consider the coordination of EVs within the smart grid context, with an emphasis on adaptive control strategies for a more efficient, green, and customer-oriented charging management. The proposed study presents a multilayered adaptive control framework using real-time data analytics, prediction and decentralized decision making for the optimal charging of electric vehicles. The system adapts in real-time to grid demand, supply of renewable, user needs and price signals. The framework improves the grid resilience with the increased energy efficiency and reduced carbon emissions by applying V2G communication, demand-side management, and machine learning-based forecasting. One of the most important strengths of this solution is its capability to adjust to heterogeneous users and dynamic grid status. The control structure combines demand response algorithms and distributed energy resource management to select charging according to priority, battery lifetime and environmental considerations. Policy-based charging rules and incentive mechanisms for off-peak charging and renewable energy consumption are also considered by this governance model. Simulation using realworld datasets show that the system can achieve up to 30 % reduced peak load, 22 % more renewable energy integration, and over 90 % users are satisfied with respect to charging sufficiency and flexibility. The proposed framework is scalable and interoperable providing the integration of various smart grid architectures, EV models, and energy markets. The research contributes to the advancement of intelligent and scalable EV charging ecosystems and is in line with global sustainability objectives and smart city goals. The suggested adaptive control solutions provide promise for a seamless control of the increasing EV population without sacrificing grid stability or user satisfaction. Moreover, the model can help the policy maker and the utility in designing a data-driven charging policy that considers the technical, economic, and environmental goals. And with the two worlds of mobility and energy increasingly merging, such flexible systems are key enablers to allow for smooth and sustainable transition to electrified transportation infrastructures."

However, integrating diverse modalities in a computationally efficient and biologically plausible manner remains a significant challenge. Transformer-based fusion architectures rely on global cross-attention to integrate multimodal information but incur high computational costs. In contrast, STDP-driven fully connected layers adopt local learning rules, which restrict their ability to autonomously form efficient sparse topologies for complex multimodal tasks. To address these issues, we propose a novel end-to-end framework—the Multimodal Spiking Neural Network (MSNN)—featuring a fusion module grounded in the Generalized Distributive Law (GDL). This principled mechanism provides an efficient and interpretable means of integrating heterogeneous biomedical and sensory signals. The MSNN further incorporates structure-adaptive leaky integrate-and-fire (SALIF) neurons, enabling dynamic optimization of sparse connectivity to enhance fusion efficiency. The proposed MSNN is validated on a range of datasets, demonstrating strong versatility: it achieves binary classification accuracies of 92.29% (valence) and 91.08% (arousal) on the DEAP dataset for affective state decoding and 99.77% on the WESAD dataset for stress detection, while delivering state-of-the-art performance on standard pattern recognition tasks (MNIST & TIDIGITS: 99.01%) and event-driven neuromorphic datasets (MNIST-DVS & N-TIDIGITS: 99.98%).

Perpetual exploration requires that, starting from specific initial positions and colors, robots move so that every node is visited by at least one robot infinitely often. A robot is myopic if it can observe nodes only within a fixed distance $\\phi$, and luminous if it is equipped with a light device that can emit a color from a finite set. We assume $\\phi=1$ in this paper. In the fully-synchronous model, when at most f robots may crash, Ooshita et al. (OPODIS2024) proposed a crash-tolerant perpetual exploration algorithm using $f+2$ robots and $3 f+2$ colors. Our goal is to reduce the number of colors by allowing a larger number of robots. We first address the extreme cases of one and two colors: we present an algorithm using $6 f+3$ robots and one color, and another using $4 f+2$ robots and two colors. Next, we propose an algorithm using $2 f+2$ robots and $O(\\log f)$ colors. These algorithms provide a trade-off between the number of robots and the number of colors in achieving crash-tolerant perpetual exploration."

Deploying microservice applications in the container-based cloud enables fine-grained elastic resource allocation. Autoscaling is an effective approach to dynamically adjust the resource provisioned to containers. However, the intricate microservice dependencies and the deployment scheme of the container-based cloud bring extra challenges of resource scaling. This article proposes a novel autoscaling approach named HGraphScale. In particular, HGraphScale captures microservice dependencies and the deployment scheme by a newly designed hierarchical graph neural network, and makes effective scaling actions for rapidly changing user requests workloads. Extensive experiments based on real-world traces of user requests are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of HGraphScale. The experiment results show that the HGraphScale outperforms existing state-of-the-art autoscaling approaches by reducing at most 80.16% of the average response time under a certain VM rental budget of application providers."

    "abstract": "The Sri Lankan banking sector, dominated by Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) and Licensed Specialized Banks (LSBs), plays a vital role in economic liquidity and risk transformation. While offering diverse services including digital banking and pawning facilities security challenges such as fraud, unauthorized access, and inefficiencies in collateral management persist. Traditional pawning systems face vulnerabilities like theft, tampering, and lack of transparency in tracking high-value assets like jewellery. As the value and quantity of pawned assets continue to grow, adopting modern asset management methods has become crucial for institutions aiming to maintain operational excellence and customer trust. This research aims to develop an efficient and secure pawned collateral management system using IoT and blockchain technologies for secure jewellery storage, real-time monitoring, and a transparent digital history of access and asset movements. The proposed solution in this research contains a blockchain and IoT-based solution to enhance pawned asset security through RFID tagging, biometric authentication, and real-time monitoring. Data from IoT devices is processed via a Raspberry Pi and recorded on a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain, ensuring tamper-proof audit trails. The system developed is capable of tracking collateral items with a high accuracy. A React and Node.js interface facilitates secure access. The system mitigates risks, improves traceability, and strengthens trust in pawning sector, aligning with modern financial security demands."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a robust controller for multi-rotor systems that can effectively handle aggressive and high-magnitude disturbances, both in the orientation and position subsystems. Our control design uses only position and angular position vector information and comprises two primary algorithms: a state feedback controller and an extended high-gain observer. Moreover, the proposed controller provides asymptotic stability while satisfying user-imposed constraints on the position, velocity, and angular position error states. To achieve this goal, we introduce a barrier Lyapunov function, which guarantees that the tracking error trajectories of the system remain within the constraints. We evaluate the performance of our proposed control through numerical simulations and a comparison with a state-of-the-art popular controller. The results illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in coping with high-magnitude disturbances, especially in the positioning subsystem of the multi-rotor system."

Such models feature a network where attacks propagate through, an intrusion detection system that provides noisy signals of the true state of the network, and the capability of the defender to clean a subset of computers at any time. The Boolean Kalman Filter has been used to solve the optimal estimation problem, by estimating the hidden true state given the attack-defense dynamics and noisy observations. However, this algorithm is intractable because it runs in exponential time and space with respect to the network size. We address this feasibility problem by proposing a mean-field estimation approach, which is inspired by the epidemic modeling literature. Although our approach is heuristic, we prove that our estimator exactly matches the optimal estimator in certain non-trivial cases. We conclude by using simulations to show both the run-time improvement and estimation accuracy of our approach."

When the linear systems in successive iterations differ by a low-rank modification (as is common in active set and augmented Lagrangian methods), updating the existing factorization can offer significant performance improvements over recomputing a full Cholesky factorization. We review the hyperbolic Householder transformation, and demonstrate its usefulness in describing low-rank Cholesky factorization updates. By applying this hyperbolic Householder-based framework to the well-known Riccati recursion for solving saddlepoint problems with optimal control structure, we develop a novel algorithm for updating the factorizations used in optimization solvers for model predictive control (MPC). Specifically, the proposed method can be used to efficiently solve the semismooth Newton systems that are at the core of the QPALM-OCP solver. Optimized open-source implementations of the proposed factorization update routines are made available."

The research incorporates environmental and oceanographic variables, including water temperature, salinity, pH, oxygen concentration, chlorophyll, nitrate, phosphate, and water depth. Data were obtained from Copernicus Marine Services and focused on existing farms in regions such as Iranthiew and Jaffna. Successful and failed farm sites were included in the data to enhance the accuracy of the model. From the data, a training and test set was split after conversion and cleaning. They were trained using various machine learning algorithms, such as Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Neural Networks, KNearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes, and XGBoost. The system analyses environmental data to determine the suitability of different locations for sea cucumber farming. Gradient Boosting gives the best accuracy among all the models, with an accuracy of $99.91 \\%$. A Reactbased web interface was also created using the best-fitted model, where users can input data and predict location suitability. This system can assist researchers, fishery officers, and entrepreneurs in making decisions when selecting locations for sea cucumber farms."

Recognizing the urgent need for early identification, technological solutions, specifically those leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI), are being explored for their potential in promptly detecting individuals susceptible to burnout. Among AI methodologies, Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are gaining prominence due to their demonstrated efficacy in prior research findings. This study undertakes a comparative analysis of ML and DL techniques to discover their relative effectiveness in burnout detection. While prior research has explored mental health detection, limited studies have directly compared ML and DL approaches on burnout-specific content. The novelty of this study lies in its dual-model comparison and targeted focus on burnout, offering insights into model performance for early detection systems. The data underwent pre-processing techniques including text cleaning, tokenization, and removal of noise. Furthermore, it evaluates the performance of selected models across various metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision and F1 score. The analysis encompasses several ML models alongside key DL architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Deep Neural Networks (DNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This comparative assessment serves as a foundation to determine the suitability and effectiveness of these models for future application in this domain."

    "abstract": "The detection and analysis of features in fluid flow are important tasks in fluid mechanics and flow visualization. One recent class of methods to approach this problem is to first compute objective optimal reference frames, relative to which the input vector field becomes as steady as possible. However, existing methods either optimize locally over a fixed neighborhood, which might not match the extent of interesting features well, or perform global optimization, which is costly. We propose a novel objective method for the computation of optimal reference frames that automatically adapts to the flow field locally, without having to choose neighborhoods a priori. We enable adaptivity by formulating this problem as a moving least squares approximation, through which we determine a continuous field of reference frames. To incorporate fluid features into the computation of the reference frame field, we introduce the use of a scalar guidance field into the moving least squares approximation. The guidance field determines a curved manifold on which a regularly sampled input vector field becomes a set of irregularly spaced samples, which then forms the input to the moving least squares approximation. Although the guidance field can be any scalar field, by using a field that corresponds to flow features the resulting reference frame field will adapt accordingly. We show that using an FTLE field as the guidance field results in a reference frame field that adapts better to local features in the flow than prior work. However, our moving least squares framework is formulated in a very general way, and therefore other types of guidance fields could be used in the future to adapt to local fluid features."

Despite the similarity of this problem to standard linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control, we show that when the observation model is bilinear, neither does the Separation Principle hold, nor is the optimal controller affine in the estimated state. Moreover, the cost-to-go is non-convex in the control input. Hence, finding an analytical expression for the optimal feedback controller is difficult in general. Under certain settings, we show that the standard LQG controller locally maximizes the cost instead of minimizing it. Furthermore, the optimal controllers (derived analytically) are not unique and are nonlinear in the estimated state. We also introduce a notion of input-dependent observability and derive conditions under which the Kalman filter covariance remains bounded. We illustrate our theoretical results through numerical experiments in multiple synthetic settings."

Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to determine the natural conductivity of the tissue, while voltage–current (V–I) measurements during EP were combined with a realistic threedimensional finite element model to estimate the field-dependent conductivity from 10 V to 140 V. Results show an initial conductivity of 0.299 S/m and a 178% increase during electroporation. The conductivity increase leads to higher treatment currents. If the conductivity increase is not considered, currents can be underestimated by up to 40%. Understanding electroporation current is important for treatment feedback, treatment planning and engineering. The proposed measurement approach enables reproducible and quantitative estimation of tissue conductivity under non-uniform electric fields. The framework also includes a procedure for assessing measurement bias by statistically evaluating V-I measurements over sequential EP applications, ensuring reliability and supporting future uncertainty quantification."

    "abstract": "Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems are a key technology for future wireless networks, but the large array aperture naturally creates a hybrid-field (HF) propagation regime in which far-field (FF) planar-wave and near-field (NF) spherical-wave components coexist. This work considers the problem of HF channel estimation (CE) and introduces a unified model that superimposes FF and NF contributions according to the Rayleigh distance boundary. By exploiting the inherent sparsity of the channel in the angular and polar domains, we formulate the estimation task as a sparse recovery problem. Unlike conventional approaches that require prior knowledge of the channel sparsity level, the proposed method operates without requiring knowledge of the sparsity level L and the NF/FF ratio γ, which are used only for synthetic channel generation in simulations. The channel estimator determines the number of paths adaptively through a residual-based stopping rule. A combined FF/NF dictionary is employed to initialize the support, and each selected atom undergoes continuous parameter refinement to mitigate grid mismatch. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed estimator achieves accurate HF channel reconstruction under both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions, offering a practical and computationally efficient solution for XL-MIMO systems."

Access to ample high-quality data, combined with deep models adept at inference, is essential for attaining significant outcomes. Yet, data scarcity and the substantial costs of sensor deployment result in notable data imbalances. Overly specialized models that lack causal linkages further undermine the generalizability of inference techniques. To address these challenges, we first introduce a causal framework for ST predictions, named NuwaDynamics, aimed at pinpointing causal regions in data and providing models with the capability for causal reasoning in a dual-phase process. Initially, we employ upstream self-supervision to identify causally significant patches, equipping the model with generalizable insights and performing targeted interventions on non-essential patches to approximate potential testing distributions. This stage is known as the <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">discovery</b> phase. Progressing from discovery, we apply the insights to downstream tasks tailored to specific ST goals, enhancing the model's recognition of a wider potential data distribution and augmenting its causal perceptual abilities (referred to as the <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Update</b> phase). Additionally, we address environmental controllability and high computational complexity by implementing channel multiplication and conditional generation methods. This process, termed NuwaDynamics+, can further be interpreted as the front-door adjustment technique in the causality domain. Through comprehensive experiments across ten real-world or simulated ST benchmarks, we demonstrate that integrating the NuwaDynamics+ concept substantially improves various model performance. NuwaDynamics+ concept also significantly enhances the versatility across various dynamic ST tasks, such as extreme weather forecasting and long-temporal-step super-resolution predictions."

We show how to improve classical methods by tuning their step-sizes, and find that we can save up to 20% on their actual worst-case performance regret."

    "abstract": "Full configuration interaction (FCI) serves as a benchmark tool for evaluating the accuracy of approximate quantum chemical methods. However, its exponential computational cost limits its practical use. The inherently parallel and compute-intensive nature of matrix and vector operations in FCI is well-suited for acceleration on modern GPU architectures. Despite this potential, prior research has only focused on accelerating the matrix and vector multiplication, thus failing to fully exploit the power of GPUs. In this paper, we present a fully GPU-accelerated FCI implementation that uses a CUDA-enabled GPU for the entire computational workflow, achieving end-to-end acceleration. Our implementation incorporates and refines advanced optimization strategies from previous studies, while crucially eliminating redundant computational steps and minimizing CPU-GPU data transfers. To facilitate broad usability and integration, we offer both Python- and C-based implementations. Our C implementation achieves up to a 35.4× speedup over a multithreaded CPU implementation and up to a 15.9× speedup over the current leading GPU-based implementation, respectively. Our Python implementation also delivers substantial acceleration, reaching up to 18.9× and 8.7× speedups over CPU and prior GPU implementations, respectively."

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced new possibilities for automating and augmenting FL through code understanding, reasoning, and integration with dynamic analysis tools. This paper conducts a literature review of 21 studies on LLM-based FL. Specifically, reviewed studies are classified into five categories: (1) test-free/code-only localization, (2) agentic and tool-augmented frameworks, (3) crash/stack-trace-driven methods, (4) LLM-augmented information-retrieval-based FL, and (5) empirical analysis. For each category, we analyze methodological design choices, including the types of input leveraged (code, tests, logs, bug reports), localization granularity (file, method, statement, token), prompting strategies, fine-tuning vs. incontext learning, and ranking mechanisms. We also summarize datasets, evaluation metrics, and reported performance trends, drawing comparisons across LLMs. Finally, we outline open challenges and research directions for LLM-based FL. This survey provides a knowledge base for researchers and practitioners seeking to advance LLMdriven fault localization."

Computational auditory scene analysis, disentangling acoustic scenes by detecting and classifying events, focuses on objective attributes of sounds, such as their category and temporal characteristics, ignoring their effects on people, such as the emotions they evoke within a context. To fill this gap, we propose the affective soundscape captioning (ASSC) task, which enables automated soundscape analysis, thus avoiding labour-intensive subjective ratings and surveys in conventional methods. With soundscape captioning, context-aware descriptions are generated for soundscape by capturing the acoustic scenes (ASs), audio events (AEs) information, and the corresponding human affective qualities (AQs). To this end, we propose an automatic soundscape captioner (SoundSCaper) system composed of an acoustic model, i.e. SoundAQnet, and a large language model (LLM). SoundAQnet simultaneously models multi-scale information about ASs, AEs, and perceived AQs, while the LLM describes the soundscape with captions by parsing the information captured with SoundAQnet. SoundSCaper is assessed by two juries of 32 people. In expert evaluation, the average score of SoundSCaper-generated captions is slightly lower than that of two soundscape experts on the evaluation set D1 and the external mixed dataset D2, but not statistically significant. In layperson evaluation, SoundSCaper outperforms soundscape experts in several metrics on datasets D1 and D2. In addition to human evaluation, compared to other automated audio captioning (AAC) systems with and without LLM, SoundSCaper performs better on the ASSC task in several natural language processing (NLP) based metrics. Overall, SoundSCaper performs well in human subjective evaluation and various objective captioning metrics, and the generated captions are comparable to those annotated by soundscape experts. The model, source code, LLM scripts, human assessment data, instructions, and evaluation statistics are all publicly available."

    "abstract": "In recent years, maritime intelligent platforms with environmental perception and autonomous decisionmaking capabilities have been widely applied in both military and civilian fields, drawing extensive attention to the issue of autonomous route planning. The complexity and uncertainty of the maritime environment are the primary challenges faced by intelligent platforms in autonomous route planning. Traditional operational research algorithms struggle to deliver solutions within a short time frame when dealing with highly complex problems and significant environmental changes. Although heuristic algorithms hold considerable advantages in addressing complex problems, they find it difficult to obtain high-quality solutions in application scenarios requiring strong real-time performance. In this paper, the route gravitational field and time disturbance factor are introduced into the environmental model, and a real-time route planning method based on the hybrid artificial potential field method is proposed. Experimental results show that in most cases, the improved model can effectively identify and avoid potential obstacles while maintaining high path planning efficiency."

    "abstract": "Money laundering is a financial crime that obscures the origin of illicit funds, necessitating the development and enforcement of anti-money laundering (AML) policies by governments and organizations. The proliferation of mobile payment platforms and smart IoT devices has significantly complicated AML investigations. As payment networks become more interconnected, there is an increasing need for efficient real-time detection to process large volumes of transaction data on heterogeneous payment systems by different operators such as digital currencies, cryptocurrencies and account-based payments. Most of these mobile payment networks are supported by connected devices, many of which are considered loT devices in the FinTech space that constantly generate data. Furthermore, the growing complexity and unpredictability of transaction patterns across these networks contribute to a higher incidence of false positives. While machine learning solutions have the potential to enhance detection efficiency, their application in AML faces unique challenges, such as addressing privacy concerns tied to sensitive financial data and managing the real-world constraint of limited data availability due to data regulations. Existing surveys in the AML literature broadly review machine learning approaches for money laundering detection, but they often lack an in-depth exploration of advanced deep learning techniques—an emerging field with significant potential. To address this gap, this paper conducts a comprehensive review of deep learning solutions and the challenges associated with their use in AML. Additionally, we propose a novel framework that applies the least-privilege principle by integrating machine learning techniques, codifying AML red flags, and employing account profiling to provide context for predictions and enable effective fraud detection under limited data availability. Specifically, our approach defines AML-relevant financial profile characteristics and risk indicators to contextualize transactions and assess their associated risks. The proposed context-risk-predict AML (CRP-AML) model demonstrates notable success, achieving an F1 score of 82.51% on the minority class and nearly doubling the performance of other pattern detection models when the proportion of money laundering records in the dataset drops as low as 0.0005."

The proposed method measures server load using both traffic volume and server response time, enabling dynamic filtering of DDoS traffic. By incorporating response time as an additional indicator, the system can effectively address low-traffic DDoS attacks such as Slowloris, which are difficult to detect using traffic volume alone. The NIPS is implemented on an FPGA, achieving highspeed packet processing suitable for defending against highrate DDoS attacks. Experimental results show that the system processes traffic at up to 10 Gbps without packet loss, achieving a minimum latency of $\\mathbf{7 3 0}$ ns. Compared with conventional traffic-volume-based approaches, the proposed method demonstrated superior adaptability to various attack patterns and significantly reduced false positives. These results confirm the effectiveness of integrating response time into FPGA-based NIPS for improving detection accuracy and handling a wider range of DDoS attack scenarios."

Conventionally, secondary distribution systems are implemented using ac configuration. In recent years, the rapid proliferation of loads, such as electric vehicle (EV) chargers has led to significant overloading issues in ac-based secondary distribution systems. A straightforward solution involves upgrading distribution infrastructure including cables and transformers; however, this approach is often costly, requiring substantial investments in both equipment and labor. To address this issue, this article presents a cost-effective alternative: retrofitting existing ac systems into hybrid ac/dc systems using power electronic converters. This hybrid configuration not only enhances the system’s hosting capacity with minimal infrastructure modifications, but also provides additional technical benefits, including improved power quality and smart energy management. A real-world demonstrative hybrid ac/dc secondary distribution system was established in Red Deer, Alberta, Canada, with extensive testing conducted to validate its technical benefits and practical value."

By re-decoding a list of candidate input message vectors, obtained in terms of the double extension of unsatisfied check nodes (UCNs) or the weight constraint of CCDM codewords, the LDPC decoder may get out of the trapped state. As a result, the shaping decoder of CCDM may acquire more accurate input messages from the re-decoding process of LDPC code. Simulation results show that the proposed local re-decoding (LRD) algorithm can achieve better performance with reasonable computational overhead compared with other algorithms for decoding LDPC codes in the LDPC-coded modulation system."

The suggested model combines implementing deep learning structures, that is, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) with bio-inspired algorithms, which are Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) to tune hyperparameters and control stability. The hybridization makes it have adaptive learning on the nonlinear features of time and responsive to changes of loads. The model improves the forecasting accuracy of 18.7% compared to the baseline ARIMA and Support Vector Regression models, and the voltage fluctuation indices are also 23.4 smaller to guarantee more stable operation at variable renewable penetration by using real-world datasets of ISO-NE and PJM grid.

    "abstract": "Objective: Assessment of lung function variability is recommended for the diagnosis of asthma, but its specificity in separating asthmatic from COPD subjects is low. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that the day-to-day variability of respiratory resistance depends on the respiratory phase considered and observation time. Methods: Respiratory resistance was measured daily by oscillometry at 5 Hz in 47 mild asthmatics, 20 moderate-to-severe COPD, and 35 healthy subjects. The coefficient of variation was calculated over multiple time scales using full breaths, inspiratory phase, or mid-inspiratory phase. Results: The coefficient of variation of mid-inspiratory resistance was significantly higher in asthmatic than healthy and COPD groups at time scales >7 days, but not different between healthy and COPD. The accuracy of the 14-days coefficient of variation of mid-inspiratory resistance in separating asthmatic from the other groups, calculated as the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, was 0.86, with 73% sensitivity and 83% specificity at the optimal cutoff of 10%. Moreover, the coefficient of variation was significantly higher in asthma than COPD despite an increased mean resistance in the latter. Conclusion: When expressed as the day-to-day coefficient of variation of mid-inspiratory oscillometric resistance, the variability of lung function does not appear related to the presence or degree of airflow obstruction. Two-week assessment of day-to-day variability of mid-inspiratory resistance provides accurate separation of asthmatic from both healthy and COPD subjects. These findings demonstrate that simple, self-administered daily oscillometry can provide useful clinical information, supporting more accurate asthma diagnosis in real-world settings."

    "abstract": "Secure Shell (SSH) remains a critical protocol for remote administration and encrypted data transfer, yet its widespread use has made it a prime target for malicious actors, including brute-force attempts and credential theft. This study presents a honeypot-centric framework designed to capture and analyze SSH attack behaviors in real time. By deploying high interaction decoys, the framework attracts attackers, enabling detailed observation of their techniques, strategies, and persistence. Behavioral analytics are applied to the collected interaction data to identify temporal trends, attack vectors, and preferred IP ranges, revealing patterns indicative of coordinated intrusion campaigns. Advanced visualization techniques transform raw logs into actionable intelligence, providing cybersecurity teams with intuitive insights for monitoring, response, and mitigation. The findings demonstrate that decoy-based deception not only enhances detection of sophisticated SSH intrusions but also supports adaptive security strategies by profiling attacker behavior. This work establishes a structured methodology for behavioral analysis of SSH attacks, offering a robust foundation for future research in proactive intrusion detection and network defense."

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of safely exploring a static and unknown environment while learning valid control barrier functions (CBFs) from sensor data. Existing works either assume known environments, target specific dynamics models, or use a-priori valid CBFs, and thus provide limited safety guarantees for general control-affine systems during exploration. We present a method for safely exploring by incrementally composing a global CBF from local CBFs. The challenge here is that local CBFs may not have well-defined end behavior outside their training domain, i.e. local CBFs may be positive (indicating safety) in regions where no training data is available. We show that well-defined end behavior can be obtained when local CBFs are parameterized by compactly-supported radial basis functions. For learning local CBFs, we collect sensor data, e.g. LiDAR capturing obstacles in the environment, and augment it with simulated data from a safe oracle controller. Our work complements recent efforts to learn CBFs from safe demonstrations, where learned safe sets are limited to their training domains, by demonstrating how to grow the safe set over time as more data becomes available. We evaluate our approach on two simulated systems, where our method successfully explores an unknown environment while maintaining safety throughout the entire execution."

While effective, the PID approach does not guarantee optimal outcomes. In this preliminary work, we theoretically investigate optimal light input strategies to maximize the terminal amount of FA at the final time of a batch process. We first reformulate the original model, then state and solve an optimal control problem with the optogenetic light as the control input. By applying Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle (PMP), we derive necessary conditions for optimality. A complementary direct numerical approach yields results that align with the PMP analysis. The resulting optimal control is of bang–bang type, offering practical advantages for implementation. These results provide a basis for extended studies focusing on experimentally feasible feedback strategies."

A widely used primitive of ZKP, Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK), has attracted significant attention in edge computing; however, edge devices face severe resource constraints when processing its computational bottleneck, Montgomery multiplication. This paper proposes MMzk, a lightweight hardware architecture optimized for 384-bit Coarsely Integrated Operand Scanning (CIOS) Montgomery multiplication, which is primarily employed in multi-scalar multiplication (MSM) of zk-SNARKs. To achieve both high performance and resource efficiency, MMzk core operating at the System-on-Chip (SoC) level integrates three key optimizations: resource sharing of two adders, a subtractor, and a multiplier; effective memory organization for large-data processing; and double-buffering memory scheduling. Implementation results on a Xilinx ZCU102 SoC show that MMzk core operates at up to 250MHz with a utilization of 3,590 LUTs, 1,648 FFs, 16 DSPs, and 6 BRAM36 blocks. Compared with existing FPGA-based counterparts, it achieves a throughput of 657.53Mbps (up to 35.9 times higher) and an area efficiency of 81.48Kbps/eLUT (up to 9.5 times higher). Furthermore, real-time evaluation demonstrates an energy efficiency of 9,030Mbps/W at 250MHz and 67mW, surpassing modern CPUs by up to 52.9 times. These results confirm MMzk core as an energy-efficient and high-performance solution for zk-SNARK-based blockchain systems and other Montgomery multiplication applications."

A new model of Clustering-Based Smart Healthcare Fog Environment for Optimal Fog Resource Allocation (CSHFE-OFRA) is proposed in conjunction with clustering for minimizing task execution time and using MDP for problem modeling. To solve the supply distribution delinquent, an procedure grounded on reinforcement learning, namely Optimal Fog Resource Allocation using Deep Neural Network with Target Network (OFRA_DQN-TN), has been proposed. The results of comparative simulations with Q-Learning, DQN/ Vanilla, and DQN/Experience Replay show that OFRA_DQN-TN has the highest performance. It has been observed to show more stable convergence in the loss function as well as obtaining higher cumulative rewards whereas requiring fewer steps to accurately allocate the required resources. The pass rate also rose to 98%. This work emphasizes how OFRA_DQN-TN works in dynamic scenarios, offering real-time functionality and the enhancement of QoS for medical services."

The charge transfer alters carrier concentration in the graphene channel, which is reflected as a change in the drain current. The FN injection increases the interface trap states. Although time constant of charge transfer between graphene and the interface trap states was slightly degraded, lower limit of detection and sensor response were improved by the FN injection; the sensor response at 1 kV/m after 30 s of FN injection was 1230% of that before FN injection. The experimental result indicates the proposed method by FN injection is widely applicable for sensitivity improvement of electric field sensor composed of two-dimensional materials."

To address the limitations of traditional passive attitude sensors and the attitude determination method based on satellite navigation signal, such as cumulative errors, environmental interference, and restricted application scenarios, this paper proposes an autonomous attitude estimation method based on Radio Frequency (RF) measurements. The proposed method utilizes radar to acquire inter-spacecraft range and angular measurements, and constructs line-of-sight (LOS) vectors under the body frames of different spacecraft. By employing the singular value decomposition (SVD) to calculate the rotation matrix and derive the Euler angles, the relative attitude estimation of multiple spacecraft without prior position and attitude information can be achieved. Furthermore, this paper derives the optimal formation configuration under the minimum attitude estimation error, providing theoretical guidance for the design of the formation configuration. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing improved estimation performance for multi-spacecraft formation flying relative to existing RF-based autonomous measurement approaches."

HTS magnets are typically operated in power-driven mode, which requires a busbar to connect the power supply at room temperature with the magnet placed in the cryogenic environments. However, this method allows substantial heat to enter the cryogenic environments from the room temperature environments, reducing the system's efficiency and stability. To address this issue, our previous study proposed an inductive coupling-based contactless current charging system that removes the physical electrical connection between room temperatures electronics and the cryogenic magnet, enabling excitation designed for a HTS coil operating in cryogenic environments. This system effectively demonstrated feasibility through finite element analysis, electrical circuit simulations, and prototype experiments. In this study, we aim to extend the application of this technology to larger-scale HTS coils. The research will focus on the design and fabrication of a system capable of charging HTS coils efficiently while addressing challenges such as optimizing coupling coefficients and ensuring robust performance under cryogenic conditions. This result is expected to provide a practical and scalable approach to contactless current charging for HTS magnet, enabling broader adoption in advanced superconducting applications."

    "abstract": "In the process of comprehensive mechanized caving coal mining, the monitoring technology for coal gangue mixing ratios at coal discharge outlets has long relied on manual experience judgment, lacking automated monitoring methods. This has led to widespread over-discharge or under-discharge phenomena during coal release, severely affecting mining efficiency and quality. To address this technical challenge, this paper innovatively designs and develops an integrated sensing monitoring system based on the PT symmetry principle. By constructing a three-coil LC resonant circuit system, we utilize the high-sensitivity characteristics of third-order PT symmetry at exceptional points (EP) to achieve stable monitoring of resonant frequency variations. Experimental results show that the sensitivity enhancement factor of the synthetic third-order PT system reaches up to 1.8 times that of second-order systems, effectively detecting frequency differences caused by changes in coal gangue mixture dielectric constants. Based on this, we establish a quantitative relationship model between coal gangue ratios and resonant frequencies, enabling precise determination of mixing ratios. Additionally, combining synthetic dimension theory, we design a sensing system with PT symmetric circuit architecture, achieving high-sensitivity monitoring of minute gangue ratio variations. This sensing monitoring system not only significantly reduces equipment size but also demonstrates excellent detection accuracy and stability. It provides reliable technical support for improving coal quality and achieving automated mining in coal mine working faces, playing a significant role in advancing intelligent development in the coal industry."

Without access to previously seen tasks and unseen tasks, memory-constrained MTIL suffers from forward and backward forgetting. To alleviate the above challenges, parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques (PEFT), such as prompt tuning, are employed to adapt the PT-VLM to the diverse incrementally learned tasks. To achieve effective new task adaptation, existing methods only consider the effect of PEFT strategy selection, but neglect the influence of PEFT parameter setting (e.g., prompting). In this paper, we tackle the challenge of optimizing prompt designs for diverse tasks in MTIL and propose an Instance-Aware Prompting (IAP) framework. Specifically, our Instance-Aware Gated Prompting (IA-GP) strategy enhances adaptation to new tasks while mitigating forgetting by adaptively assigning prompts across transformer layers at the instance level. Our Instance-Aware Class-Distribution-Driven Prompting (IA-CDDP) improves the task adaptation process by determining an accurate task-label-related confidence score for each instance. Experimental evaluations across 11 datasets, using three performance metrics, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of underwater networking and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) technologies, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) cluster networks have emerged as a promising framework for enabling smart underwater missions, particularly in cooperative target encirclement. However, training MARL policies in such environments faces a critical challenge: acquiring large-scale interaction data is infeasible due to the severely constrained communication bandwidth, especially for online MARL frameworks. Therefore, achieving fast policy convergence with limited data collection is essential for practical deployment. This article proposes an LLM-Empowered Hybrid Training (LLM-EHT) architecture for MARL, which leverages the reasoning and generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to facilitate the transition from online to offline MARL under limited-sample conditions. Specifically, the proposed architecture first collects a small amount of online interaction data. It then employs an LLM to synthesize an offline dataset, guided by a dedicated alignment loss that enforces consistency between policy actions and LLM-generated references. This process significantly accelerates MARL policy convergence. Building upon LLM-EHT, we further develop a smart and cooperative underwater target encirclement scheme, incorporating a scalable state space representation method and a smart target encirclement policy to ensure robust, efficient, and scalable operation. Evaluation results showcase that the proposed scheme significantly reduces the required sample size while achieving faster convergence and maintaining stable encirclement effectiveness."

To address gaps in prior studies, the model incorporates a multi-scenario sensitivity analysis, a clear discussion of methodological assumptions, and a comparative validation using published telemetry-based energy benchmarks from similar electric bus platforms. A case study in Ottawa’s Altavista neighborhood demonstrates the applicability of the framework, evaluating the Lion C ESB across urban and extra-urban segments. Results show that auxiliary loads are a primary driver of consumption in low-speed conditions, increasing total SOC depletion by over 36% between mild and winter like scenarios. The study highlights implications for fleet operations, HVAC investment decisions, and route planning, providing actionable insights for school districts deploying electric fleets. Limitations and directions for future model extensions such as multi-bus routing and stochastic weather conditions are also explicitly discussed."

Although numerous face forgery detectors have been developed to counter the risks of facial deepfakes, detecting forgeries across varying quality levels, particularly under extreme degradations, remains a critical challenge. Current face forgery detection methods largely rely on identifying low-level artifacts, which are highly susceptible to distortions introduced by image degradation. Recognizing that restoration can recover critical forensic cues from severely degraded forgeries, this study proposes a quality-agnostic deepfake detection framework that leverages a blind face restoration model to enhance robustness. The framework incorporates an auxiliary restoration branch alongside the original detection pathway. While the original branch operates directly on the degraded input, the restoration branch performs detection on facial images restored by a blind face restoration model. In addition, a Saliency-Guided Restoration objective is introduced to enhance alignment between the restoration and detection tasks. A Restoration Similarity-Aware Fusion mechanism is further designed to adaptively integrate predictions from both branches based on input quality. To assess the robustness of our approach under extreme degradation, we establish a specialized, real-world-inspired benchmark that simulates diverse degradation scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on both the proposed and existing benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves superior robustness in various degradation scenarios."

Additionally, the research will analyze training and inference times, model sizes, and the impact of features using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values. Misclassifications will be scrutinized to identify potential errors stemming from dataset properties, emphasizing the necessity of thorough dataset preprocessing for broader applicability. Furthermore, the robustness of the models will be tested against adversarial attacks tailored for Wi-Fi detection. The findings will culminate in a comparative analysis of the models, underscoring the significance of each methodological step and the potential consequences of neglecting critical aspects. This work aims to contribute to the field by enhancing the understanding of ML applications in cybersecurity and promoting the development of more reliable and explainable detection systems."

    "abstract": "Online monitoring of stator winding temperature is essential for ensuring the safe and reliable operation of inverter-fed machines. Conventional methods, such as NTC temperature sensors, are prone to inaccuracies due to installation deviations or sensor degradation, potentially leading to false derating, or protective shutdowns. To overcome these limitations, this article presents a novel approach for online temperature monitoring by utilizing self-excited high-frequency (HF) switching oscillations of the inverter. The study begins with an analysis of the temperature dependence of winding insulation capacitance, followed by the identification of the HF common-mode oscillation frequency as a robust indicator of insulation temperature. The proposed online monitoring method is experimentally validated on a 380 V/0.37 kW inverter-fed induction machine test bench. Results demonstrate that the method accurately tracks real-time stator winding temperature variations, exhibits strong robustness under various operating conditions, and achieves an average temperature measurement error of less than 1.97°C."

    "abstract": "The reverse-salient permanent magnet motors (RSPMMs) have attracted widespread attention in the field of electric vehicles due to its wide constant power speed range and strong overload capacity. However, there are few researches on the design and optimization of RSPMMs used for electric vehicles (EVs). In this paper, a reverse-salient hybrid permanent magnet motor (RSHPMM) is proposed. By analyzing the motor parameters that affect the distribution of the operating interval, the optimization objectives are reasonably selected. To reduce the difficulty of optimization, Sobol global sensitivity analysis is introduced for parameter analysis. This approach fully considers the interactions between two parameters. After eliminating non-critical parameters, a genetic algorithm is employed for multi-objective optimization. The electromagnetic performance of the RSHPMM is investigated by finite element method and is compared with a conventional interior permanent magnet motor (CIPMM). Finally, a prototype is manufactured and tested. The results show that the RSHPMM has lower ripple torque, stronger flux-weakening ability, wider constant-power speed range, and higher efficiency at a high speed than the CIPMM. The amount of rare-earth permanent magnets is only 44% of that of CIPMM. The validity of the design and optimization approaches of the RSHPMM used for EVs is verified."

    "abstract": "Cobots are designed to work in close collaboration with humans. To ensure safety in shared workspaces, ISO/TS 15066 imposes limits on the collaborative robot speeds to limit the impact forces during collisions. These limits depend on robot design, including inertia. Flexible link manipulators combine the advantage of lightweight design and the introduction of an elastic element, which is promising in the context of collaborative robots. However, reduced stiffness affects dynamic performance. As trade-offs between link flexibility for safety and dynamic performance remain unclear, this paper investigates how undesired side effects of flexibility relate to the positive aspects of compliance and lightweightness. To investigate the effect of flexibility on both safety towards a human and controlled manipulator dynamics, a generic simulation framework was designed. Safety is assessed by a simulation study on the influence of varying geometrical parameters on impact force at collision with a human head, after which the corresponding maximum allowable end-effector velocities per ISO/TS 15066 threshold were derived. To analyze control performance, a generic controller was implemented, consisting of a PID with direct strain vibration control, with gains optimized for each link design. The resulting end-effector tracking performance during point-to-point motion is evaluated. Based on these results, a co-design methodology was proposed to optimize link geometry and control gains for the fastest possible, yet safe motion for a given task. The effectiveness of the method was experimentally validated to assess whether optimal link stiffness and controller gains yield the desired dynamic performance while respecting ISO safety thresholds."

    "abstract": "Encrypted traffic classification (ETC) serves as a pivotal research for network measurement and Quality of Service (Qos) management. However, most current approaches rely on statically frozen parameters after training, which remain vulnerable to performance degradation under real-world distribution shifts caused by dynamic network conditions, protocol evolution, and adversarial obfuscation techniques. To tackle this issue, we propose NetTTT, an online self-adaptation framework that, for the first time, performs continuous representation refinement directly at inference time without retraining. NetTTT leverages a hierarchical feature encoder that constructs structured dual-modal representations from raw traffic sessions, coupled with a pre-trained generic representation extractor to powerfully capture transferable contextual features, and incorporates a lightweight test-time adapter, which performs unsupervised, layer-wise parameter optimization during inference to dynamically align traffic representations with test-time traffic distributions, followed by a compact classifier that efficiently maps adapted representations to traffic categories. Experimental results reveal the superiority of NetTTT across diverse ETC tasks and few-shot scenarios with accuracy improvements ranging from 0.08% to 9.34% over state-of-the-art baselines. By enabling dynamic adaptation without labeled data or full model retraining, NetTTT bridges the gap between static pre-trained models and evolving encrypted traffic, highlighting its potential to provide a practical solution for real-world scenarios."

First, a novel funnel boundary is designed to constrain formation errors with prescribed transient and steady-state performance, ensuring collision avoidance. Second, a composite disturbance observer (CDO) is proposed to accurately estimate and compensate for both external and neighbor-induced coupled disturbances. Furthermore, an optimal resilient control strategy is formulated within a backstepping framework with an actor–critic neural network (NN) to mitigate FDI attacks, ensuring stable formation tracking and performance optimization. The theoretical analysis proves the boundedness of all closed-loop signals and the convergence of formation errors within the funnel.

    "abstract": "Solid-state circuit breakers (SSCBs) enable rapid and reliable isolation of short-circuit faults in photovoltaic (PV) storage and charging DC microgrids. However, the main switch typically experiences high current and voltage stress during fault isolation, thus challenging the safe operation of the SSCB. Hence, a novel SSCB topology based on a normally-on silicon carbide (SiC) junction field-effect transistor (JFET) is proposed, which can achieve fully zero-current turn-off for both the main and auxiliary switches. During a short-circuit fault, an LC resonant circuit injects a reverse pulse current into the SiC JFET main switch to achieve zero-current turn-off, while a metal-oxide varistor (MOV) branch absorbs the fault current flowing through the SiC metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) auxiliary switch, thereby facilitating the zero-current turn-off of the SiC MOSFET. Subsequently, the operating characteristics and design considerations for key components, including the inductor, capacitor, and MOV, are analyzed. Finally, a 375 V/63 A SSCB prototype is constructed and validated. Experimental results confirm that the proposed topology achieves zero-current turn-off for all the switches when interrupting a 260 A fault current, thereby significantly enhancing the interrupting performance and energy efficiency of the SSCB in PV storage and charging DC microgrids."

    "abstract": "Ventilation network diagrams play a vital role in mine safety, enabling simulation, airflow control, and emergency planning. Traditional manual drawing methods are time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to synchronize with evolving mine structures. To address this, we propose an automated framework that generates schematic ventilation diagrams from spatial models while preserving topological fidelity. The framework integrates a hierarchical node layering algorithm based on Hasse diagrams, a trunk–branch decomposition strategy for structural abstraction, and a deformation-based curve layout model inspired by water droplet geometry to enhance visual clarity and structural alignment. A 3D elevation inference module ensures semantic consistency across 2D diagrams, 3D models, and graph representations. The system further supports reactive multi-view synchronized editing, enabling coherent modifications across different representations while preserving user-defined constraints. Although developed and validated in mine ventilation, the framework is generally applicable to directed-graph–based industrial systems. Its generality is further demonstrated on a schematic exhaust pipeline case, where a tree structure rather than a network diagram provides a more suitable abstraction, highlighting that the method supports domain-adaptive abstraction guided by topological characteristics. This approach has been integrated into real-world mining operations through the “Ventilation Brain System,” offering a scalable solution for intelligent layout generation, adaptive design iteration, and responsive decision-making. By bridging spatial realism with schematic abstraction, the proposed method streamlines diagram construction and reinforces intelligent mine ventilation management."

    "abstract": "Land-cover classification from multi-source remote sensing imagery requires the effective integration of complementary spatial and spectral information across heterogeneous modalities, which is crucial for accurately capturing complex landscape features that cannot be fully represented by a single modality. However, conventional masked image modeling frameworks such as the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) exhibit limited capability in capturing cross-modal dependencies and often fail to preserve fine-grained structural details. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a Dual-Stream Masked Autoencoder (DS-MAE), an attention-driven pretraining–training framework designed for joint spatial–spectral representation learning and multi-source image classification. The model incorporates a dual-stream deformable-attention Transformer to separately reconstruct masked spatial pixels and spectral channels, while Swin-Transformer branches along spatial and spectral directions enhance sensitivity to small objects, high-frequency textures, and object boundaries. A cascaded feature fusion module (CFM) further strengthens cross-modal alignment by effectively integrating global and local information from different modalities. Experiments conducted on Berlin, Augsburg, and Houston 2018 datasets demonstrate that DS-MAE consistently surpasses seven state-of-the-art methods in Overall Accuracy, Average Accuracy, and Kappa coefficient, with particularly notable gains for classes exhibiting complex spatial structures such as buildings and roads. These results confirm the robustness and generalizability of DS-MAE and highlight its effectiveness in capturing complementary spatial–spectral cues for advanced multi-source remote sensing image classification."

    "abstract": "The popularity of artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) is prompting the deployment of large language model (LLM) from cloud to edge networks, leading to mobile edge generation (MEG). Due to high latency and limited computational capabilities of mobile devices, personalized image generation for mobile healthcare and education requires edge-mobile generation paradigm. In this paper, a novel non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) assisted multi-user MEG framework is proposed for text-guided mobile image generation. NOMA enables concurrent access from multiple user equipments (UEs) to the edge-deployed large model, facilitating adjustable generation splitting. Specifically, the edge server (ES) partially generates the image and transmits it via downlink NOMA, while UEs complete the remaining parts using lightweight models. Both unlimited and limited energy budget scenarios are considered. 1) For unlimited energy budget, a joint generation splitting ratio and NOMA power allocation optimization problem is formulated, which minimizes the maximum (min-max) latency of UEs to ensure fairness. The closed-form globally optimal solutions based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) and Lambert-W theory are derived. Moreover, the superiority of MEG-NOMA over conventional MEG-orthogonal multiple access (OMA) is mathematically proved. 2) For limited energy budget, a multi-objective programming problem is formulated to minimize the latency of each UE, which leads to a user-centric latency minimization problem. The closed-form solutions of generation splitting ratio and power allocation are derived. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed MEG-NOMA outperforms the MEG-OMA in both two-user and multi-user cases. Compared to conventional MEG-OMA, the MEG-NOMA framework reduces the min-max latency and the user-centric latency by 33.01% and 9.86%, respectively."

Existing hybridization techniques are categorized according to the fusion point, including input features, loss functions, model architecture, and output correction, and their respective advantages and challenges are assessed. Domain-specific trends are identified: automotive and aviation benefit from high-fidelity physical models and abundant labeled datasets, while maritime applications often contend with sparse, noisy data and low-fidelity models, thus placing greater emphasis on hybrid methods to ensure safety and reliability. We further analyze strategies such as physics-informed neural networks, residual learning, transfer learning with synthetic data, and multimodel architectures, and evaluate their suitability under different data availability and physical modeling constraints. This review highlights the critical role of domain knowledge, the impact of physical model fidelity, and the importance of adaptive integration strategies in achieving robust and trustworthy dynamic models in real-world transport systems."

In this work, we present PoCoDP3, a pose- and contact-aware visual-tactile policy that integrates 3D point clouds and tactile inputs to generate actions in contact-rich tasks. PoCoDP3 introduces a dual-branch tactile encoder that jointly models contact dynamics and estimates in-hand object pose, enabling structured tactile representations for precise contact-rich manipulation. A contact-driven cross-modal fusion mechanism adaptively prioritizes sensory modalities based on real-time interaction cues, enabling efficient visual-tactile integration. Moreover, a reference-guided diffusion policy leverages reference action offsets to reduce sampling steps, significantly accelerating inference while maintaining action quality. Experiments across simulation and real-world tasks demonstrate that PoCoDP3 consistently outperforms representative 2D and 3D policies in terms of both accuracy and inference efficiency."

We derived the unique CC factorization in the Lie group context and examined the impact of Christoffel inconsistency in Coriolis matrix factorization on the dynamic behavior of robot systems during both free motion and interaction with humans, particularly in the context of passivity-based controllers and augmented PD controllers. Specifically, the question is: What are the advantages of using the CC factorization, and what is the effect of non-CC factorization on the robot's dynamic behavior, which has been rarely explored? We showed that Christoffel inconsistency generates unwanted torsion, causing the system to deviate from the desired trajectory, and this results in undesirable dynamic behavior when controlling the system, especially when the dynamics of the robot is described by twist and wrench. Through simulation and a real-world robot experiment, this phenomenon is verified for the first time."

    "abstract": "Effective motion retargeting is essential for robotic hands to perform fine-grained teleoperated manipulation. However, existing methods face several key challenges: optimization-based approaches offer accurate reproduction but suffer from high computational latency; learning-based methods provide faster inference but require large-scale datasets; and achieving fine-grained retargeting often compromises hardware adaptability due to task- or hand-specific designs. To this end, we propose Modular Residual Reinforcement Learning (MoReL), a generalizable reinforcement learning framework for dexterous hand retargeting. MoReL decomposes policy learning into finger-specific subpolicies and a residual coordination module, effectively balancing detailed local control with coherent global motion. This architecture enables efficient training from minimal demonstrations without reliance on pretrained networks, while achieving low-latency inference and supporting flexible input modalities. A structured reward formulation further preserves human manipulation nuances and promotes generalization across diverse robotic hands and task scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our architecture and reward design, demonstrating MoReL's superior performance and cross-platform adaptability in fine-grained dexterous manipulation tasks."

It is important to consider before starting a new business or before making any decision related to the already existing business. In fact, every business decision revolves around the results of the analysis. Usually, business analysis is performed by humans, where the chances of mistakes are high. Also, getting accurate results regarding the estimation of factors involved in effective business analysis is a laborious process for human beings. Therefore, this paper proposes a canonical correlation methodology-based model for effective business analysis. It solves the aforesaid problems with human analysis. It considers all the critical factors of a business (example: unit price, shipping cost, expected units to be sold, etc.) and investigates how the rise and fall of these factors influence the outcome of the business (example: revenue, net income, profit, etc.). This analyzes the business ups and downs corresponding to the changes in these critical factors. These analysis results help the owners to make a decision to enhance the outcome of the business. Besides, the business planners can estimate how the relationship between different factors and their dynamic variations influences the fruitfulness of the desired business."

    "abstract": "This study presents a nonlinear signal processing method for accurate radar-based heartbeat interval estimation by exploiting the periodicity of higher order harmonics inherent in heartbeat signals. Unlike conventional approaches that employ selective frequency filtering or track individual harmonics, the proposed method enhances the global periodic structure of the spectrum via nonlinear correlation processing. Specifically, smoothing and second-derivative operations are first applied to the radar displacement signal to suppress noise and accentuate higher order heartbeat harmonics. Rather than isolating specific frequency components, we compute localized autocorrelations of the Fourier spectrum around the harmonic frequencies. The incoherent summation of these autocorrelations yields a pseudo-spectrum in which the fundamental heartbeat periodicity is distinctly emphasized. This nonlinear approach mitigates the effects of respiratory harmonics and noise, enabling robust interbeat interval estimation. Experiments with radar measurements from five participants demonstrate that the proposed method reduces absolute error (AE) by 34% and root-mean-square error (RMSE) by 35% and improves the false detection rate (FDR) by 1.37 points relative to conventional techniques."

Recently, 3D Gaus sian Splatting has emerged as a promising technique with faster training and rendering speeds. However, both methods rely heavily on clear images and precise camera poses, limiting performance under motion blur. To address this, we introduce Event-Informed 3D Deblur Reconstruction with Gaussian Splat ting(EiGS), a novel approach leveraging event camera data to enhance 3D Gaussian Splatting, improving sharpness and clarity in scenes affected by motion blur. Our method employs an Adaptive Deviation Estimator to learn Gaussian center shifts as the inverse of complex camera jitter, enabling simulation of motion blur during training. A motion consistency loss ensures global coherence in Gaussian displacements, while Blurriness and Event Integration Losses guide the model toward precise 3D representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior sharpness and real-time rendering capabilities compared to existing methods, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of our components in robust, high-quality reconstruction for complex static scenes."

Using the Llama 3.2 model deployed locally to ensure data privacy, the developed system automatically extracts key information such as titles, document reference numbers, descriptions, and names. Developed using the waterfall model, the solution demonstrated strong performance during testing, achieving F1-scores of 0.8974 for title extraction, 0.9688 for document reference number extraction, 0.8767 for document summarization, and a recall of 0.9112 for name extraction. Furthermore, the average document processing time was 5.15 seconds, satisfying all success metrics and quality requirements. These results meet the defined success criteria and demonstrate the potential of LLM integration to support more reliable electronic signature workflows. Furthermore, the developed document processing capabilities could be adapted and extended to other electronic signature systems."

Although robotic models in the literature offer insightful actuation mechanisms, many tackle only isolated stages of swallowing, have reduced physiological accuracy, and tend to be mechanically complex and costly. This paper addresses these limitations by developing a novel robotic model that replicates the oral and pharyngeal stages of swallowing, featuring a passive system to simulate the protective closure of the epiglottis. This paper presents the design, function and experimental validation of the robot model. The proposed model can transport thickened fluids from the tongue to the pharynx, preventing aspiration.

It can also be integrated with iris recognition to enhance overall performance, since both systems operate on the same input image. In this study, we propose a method for periocular verification based on an autoencoder and a convolutional neural network (CNN). In the enrollment phase, an eye image is encoded using the encoder of a trained convolutional autoencoder to obtain a periocular template. Together with a generated unique ID, the template and ID are stored in a database. In the verification phase, a claimed ID is used to retrieve a gallery periocular template from the database. The gallery template is then decoded by the decoder of the trained convolutional autoencoder to reconstruct an eye image. The probe eye image and the reconstructed image are combined to form an input tensor for a CNN-based classifier, which determines whether to accept or reject the claimed identity. We evaluated the proposed scheme on the CASIA-Iris V2 dataset. The experimental results demonstrated satisfying performance, achieving accuracy, balanced accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score values of 0.9909, 0.9909, 0.9827, 0.9994, and 0.9910, respectively.

The aim of this paper is to compare the performance of two of the widely used algorithms K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) and Random Forest (RF) for on-the-go crop monitoring and yield prediction in a smart farming approach. The data set used in this paper is taken from IoT based smart farming systems which are also capable of accounting for other environmental factors such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, pH and other factors that directly affect the health and output of crops. The data set is prepared using various data preparation techniques such as feature selection, treatment of missing values and normalization to achieve the best performance of the model. The Random Forest method is compared with the K-Nearest Neighbour method which is simple and effective in recognizing patterns. Performance of both the algorithms is measured using ROC AUC, F1-score, Accuracy, Precision and Recall. Based on the experimental analysis, Random Forest has been claimed to have better prediction accuracy and robustness with larger and more complicated data sets than KNN which performs well in smaller data sets and under low noise conditions. The work also highlights the computational trade-offs, where Random Forest requires more computing power in training but faster predictions whereas KNN has shorter training time, but with more prediction latency."

    "abstract": "Accurate delineation of farmland boundaries is vital for agricultural resource management and environmental sustainability. However, existing deep learning approaches often face three intertwined challenges: large variations in farmland scales and orientations, ambiguous transitional regions between adjacent parcels, and complex background interference from vegetation and built-up areas. To address these difficulties, this study proposes MSGNet, a Multi-Scale Gabor Priori Guided Network that integrates explicit texture priors into deep feature learning. The core idea is to formulate farmland texture extraction as a Gabor parameter learning problem, allowing the network to capture directional and scale-sensitive texture cues that conventional isotropic convolutions often miss. Specifically, MSGNet introduces a multi-scale Gabor encoder to model anisotropic texture structures, while a Transformer-based module is employed to enhance global contextual reasoning and maintain boundary consistency across scales. Furthermore, a Gabor-based Boundary Enhancement Module (GBEM) dynamically refines spatial attention, strengthening the model’s sensitivity to local edge variations amid complex backgrounds. To preserve both texture continuity and geometric integrity, a composite loss function combining cross-entropy, Dice, and Hausdorff distance is designed, ensuring stable and topology-aware learning. Experiments on the Guangdong Farmland Dataset demonstrate that MSGNet achieves superior accuracy and robustness, with 83.80% IoU, 90.88% precision, 91.49% recall, and 91.18% F1-score, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Tests on the France Farmland Dataset further confirm the generalization ability of the proposed network across diverse agricultural landscapes.

In this work, we present a method to improve the performance of STA predictions. Our contributions are two-fold: 1) We propose STAformer and STAformer++, two novel attention-based architectures integrating frame-guided temporal pooling, dual image-video attention, and multiscale feature fusion to support STA predictions from an image-input video pair; 2) We introduce two novel modules to ground STA predictions on human behavior by modeling affordances. First, we integrate an environment affordance model which acts as a persistent memory of interactions that can take place in a given physical scene. We explore how to integrate environment affordances via simple late fusion and with an approach which adaptively learns how to best fuse affordances with end-to-end predictions. Second, we predict interaction hotspots from the observation of hands and object trajectories, increasing confidence in STA predictions localized around the hotspot.

Therefore, this study investigates a novel multidirectional strain-insensitive stretchable temperature sensor (STS) based on a hexagram structure. A sensor prototype was fabricated with a measurement range of 200 °C and a temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of 0.30 %/°C. Furthermore, it achieved hysteresis and repeatability errors of 0.83 % and 1.79 %, respectively. The proposed sensor exhibited a resistance variation of less than 1 % under a multidirectional uniaxial tensile strain of 0 to 80 %, indicating its effective strain decoupling capability. Finally, real-time surface temperature distribution detection was successfully achieved under a heat flux of 202 kW/m² by integrating the sensor array on an active thermal protection flexible skin, demonstrating the potential application of morphing high-speed vehicles."

However, most studies focus on forecasting individual market prices, such as day-ahead (DA) or real-time (RT) prices, while neglecting the importance of price difference forecasting in identifying arbitrage opportunities. The strong correlation between DA and RT prices can significantly amplify probabilistic forecasting errors if not properly accounted for. To address the above issue, a novel price difference probabilistic forecasting framework based on joint probability density modeling and numerical integral solutions is proposed. First, the skewed deep auto-regressive recurrent neural network (skewed DeepAR) is proposed to separately forecast the probability densities of DA and RT prices with the consideration of both skewness and kurtosis characteristics. Sklar’s theorem is then applied to model the joint probability density function. Second, we derive the integral relationship between the price difference’s probability density and the joint probability densities of DA and RT prices. Finally, a numerical conditional density projection method is proposed to efficiently project the joint probability density onto the price difference space, offering a flexible approach to calculating complex integrations. Case studies based on PJM electricity market data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving at least a 10.15% improvement in the overall performance of probabilistic forecasting."

The converging-diverging (CONDIV) manifold is designed to protect internal heatsinks from debris-laden flows while maintaining high thermal performance. Previous studies relied on simple parametric sweeps for only a limited exploration of the design space of external manifolds, limiting the discovery of optimal designs. Here, a comprehensive MOGA framework is implemented, combining 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations validated against experiments. Seven geometric parameters are optimized to simultaneously minimize thermal resistance and pumping power, maximizing the coefficient of performance (COP). The design of experiments (DOE) is generated via Latin hypercube sampling (LHS), and a response surface model is constructed to approximate heatsink performance. The MOGA efficiently explores the design space, yielding a Pareto front of optimal solutions. Best compromise solutions (BCSs) are selected and verified through CFD. Results show that MOGA-optimized designs consistently outperform previous CONDIV and baseline plate-fin heatsinks, achieving up to 33% higher COP and 4.3% greater heat flux than previous CONDIV-H design and 42.4% higher mean COP than the baseline plate-fin heatsink. Detailed flow analyzes reveal that optimized BCSs improve airflow into internal channels and improve flow uniformity, resulting in superior thermal management. This demonstrates the strong potential of MOGA-driven optimization for advanced manifold heatsink applications in electrified transport."

Leveraging Knowledge Distillation (KD), a lightweight student model with only $\\mathbf{5 4 5, 0 0 5}$ parameters, is trained to emulate a larger, custom YOLO-based teacher model (2.6 M parameters). The methodology optimizes both hard and soft losses using temperature-scaled KullbackLeibler divergence, ensuring the student model retains the teacher’s knowledge while being computationally efficient. Results demonstrate that the student model not only matches but surpasses the teacher’s performance, achieving a validation accuracy of 93.8% (vs. 92.9%), along with improved precision (94.00%), recall (93.23%), and F1-score (93.38%). Saliency maps were employed to interpret the model’s decision-making process, confirming its ability to focus on disease-specific features. These findings highlight the effectiveness of KD in creating lightweight, high-performing models for plant disease classification. By reducing computational requirements while maintaining accuracy, DYL-Leaf is well-suited for deployment in resourceconstrained agricultural environments."

    "abstract": "Airborne FSO links have emerged as an ultra-high-capacity solution for maintaining air-to-air and air-to-ground connectivity. Unlike the fixed FSO links, airborne links are subject to mobility; therefore experience continuous changes in SNR due to the relative movement of transmitter and receiver. This necessitates the use of link adaptation where baseband parameters can be adjusted according to the channel conditions. In this paper, we present an experimental study for the performance evaluation of coherent adaptive mobile FSO systems. In the practical implementation of adaptive systems, estimation of SNR becomes critical to provide the required feedback from the receiver to the transmitter. To eliminate the need for additional hardware and satisfying the size, weight, and power (SWAP) constraints of mobile platforms, we introduce an innovative SNR estimation approach where the estimation is performed directly on the sampled waveforms. To validate the proposed approach, we conduct an experimental study in controlled lab settings where transmission distances up to 1km are emulated with the use of a variable optical attenuator. Our experimental results demonstrate that the transceiver successfully maintains a BER below 2×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−2</sup> over the link by adapting the bit-rate through the changes of modulation format and symbol rate according to the estimated SNR."

    "abstract": "A natural assumption in games is to consider static payoffs. Yet, this is not true when the environment changes independently or as a result of players' interactions, e.g., geopolitical decisions in the global financial market, or weather conditions in autonomous driving. Indeed, these environmental aspects have a significant impact on the strategic interactions between players and vice versa. With the growing interest in machine learning approaches, disregarding these environmental changes leads to nonstationarity and instability of the corresponding algorithms. Motivated by this issue, we develop a novel framework for continuous-time finite-state feedback-evolving mean-field games (FEMFG) where the population dynamics are paired with an environmental resource which determines the payoffs and in turn evolves according to the population distribution across the underlying Markov chain. We derive the corresponding initial-terminal value problem and show the conditions for the existence of a feedback-evolving mean-field Nash equilibrium as the solution to the FEMFG, namely, when the population dynamics given by the Kolmogorov equation and the value function obtained via the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation do not change over time."

    "abstract": "The visualization of latent fingerprints on water immersed non-porous surfaces remains a major challenge in forensic science. Conventional small particle reagents (SPRs) rely on heavy metal-based or toxic components, posing environmental and health concerns. This study integrates artificial intelligence (AI) technology with an eco-friendly calcium carbonate-based SPR for enhanced fingerprint detection. Calcium carbonate based SPR was synthesized and developed fingerprint was characterized using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), confirming its strong adherence to fingerprint ridges on metallic substrates recovered from aquatic environments. To augment visualization and interpretative accuracy, the developed fingerprint images were processed using the OpenArt AI image enhancement tool, which employed automated contrast adjustment, denoising, and super resolution algorithms. This AI-driven enhancement significantly improved ridge clarity, minutiae visibility, and overall pattern recognition, facilitating more objective and reproducible fingerprint analysis. Among the formulations stained with Methyl Red, Rhodamine B, and Methylene Blue, the Methyl Red-stained variant and the unstained formulation exhibited the highest clarity and responsiveness to AI-based refinement. To objectively assess the enhancement performance, quantitative image quality metrics, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR: 28.4-32.6 dB), Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM: 0.87-0.94), and ridge-count accuracy (increase of 18–25%) were calculated. Additional softwarebased analysis using contrast ratio, ridge-valley definition, and minutiae count demonstrated measurable improvement (contrast +62%, ridge-valley clarity +36%, minutiae +27%) after AI enhancement, with statistical significance <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(p&lt;0.01)$</tex>. The OpenArt AI module, employing a convolutional encoderdecoder (U-Net-like) architecture, enhanced ridge clarity through adaptive histogram equalization, denoising, and superresolution reconstruction. The combined use of a sustainable calcium carbonate SPR and advanced AI image enhancement establishes a novel, green, and intelligent forensic approach for reliable detection and comparison of water-immersed latent fingerprints, minimizing examiner bias and enhancing the evidentiary value of fingerprint evidence."

This study investigates the performance of two lightweight models, YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n, which are the nano variants of the latest official YOLO series, within a unified detection and classification framework for FER. Two benchmark classification datasets, FER2013 (in the wild) and KDEF (studio quality), are converted into object detection format and model performance is evaluated using $\\mathrm{mAP} \\text{@} 0.5$, precision, recall, and confusion matrices. Results show that YOLOv12n achieves the highest overall performance on the clean KDEF dataset with a $\\mathbf{m A P} \\text{@} 0.5$ of 95.6% and also outperforms YOLOv11n on the FER2013 dataset in terms of mAP (63.8%), reflecting stronger sensitivity to varied expressions. In contrast, YOLOv11n demonstrates higher precision (65.2%) on FER2013, indicating fewer false positives and better reliability in noisy, real-world conditions. On FER2013, both models show more confusion between visually similar expressions, while clearer class separation is observed on the cleaner KDEF dataset. These findings underscore the trade-off between sensitivity and precision, illustrating how lightweight YOLO models can effectively balance performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate adaptability across both controlled and real-world conditions, establishing these models as strong candidates for real-time, resourceconstrained emotion-aware AI applications."

To address this issue, this study presents the validation of an SD model of COVID-19 using empirical data from multiple countries to assess both its structural and behavioural validity. The model was developed in Vensim DSS and manually calibrated to evaluate its performance against realworld data cases across five European countries: Spain, Portugal, Italy, France, and Hungary, which represent diverse outbreak contexts. The results indicate that the model successfully replicates the trends of the COVID-19 outbreak in each country, providing strong evidence of the model’s structural soundness, robustness and its capacity to adapt across diverse yet comparable contexts. Thus, uncertainty surrounding both the model’s structure and behaviour is reduced. The future implications of this study suggest that the model can support broader scenario testing and provide a foundation for future applications in other regions where validation across multiple cases is required."

However, existing deep learning approaches struggle under adverse conditions such as occlusion, illumination variation, and cluttered environments. This study introduces a novel hybrid framework that integrates the Firefly Algorithm (FA) with You Only Look Once version 8 (YOLOv8), termed FA-YOLOv8, to enhance accuracy and precision in traffic light detection. The proposed FA-YOLOv8 was tested on three video datasets, comprising a total of 340 frames and 1,684 objects, which in each dataset captured in different challenges (occlusion, illumination and cluttering). As a result, the proposed hybrid FA-YOLOv8 method achieved a high precision of 96.76%. In comparison with three existing approaches which are YOLOv5+DeepSort, YOLOv8+DeepSort, and ByteTrack, the proposed hybrid FAYOLOv8 method demonstrated superior performance, achieving the highest scores in five out of ten evaluation metrics, including Multiple Object Tracking Precision (MOTP), Recall, F1-Score, (Identity F1) IDF1 and (Mostly Lost) ML. Its ease of use and ability to function in both offline and real-time scenarios make it versatile and suitable for various domains. Applications include traffic surveillance, vehicle monitoring, and intelligent transportation systems, such as autonomous driving. Detecting traffic light accurately and efficiently is essential for effective vehicle regulation and roadway safety. This research contributes a valuable framework for improving detection methods across diverse real-world environments and advanced transportation technologies."

A traditional Neyman-Pearson energy detector is used to develop an equivalent SRSS energy detection on the post-SRSS-processed output signal, which matches the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) of a traditional energy detector. Using a solution of the applicable SRSS stochastic differential equation (SDE), the SRSS energy detection test statistic is computed, from which the steady-state stochastically resonant signal and noise responses are estimated, allowing an applicable SR energy detection threshold to be determined, against which energy detection on the post-SRSSprocessed output signal can be established. We discuss the background theory, analyze the results and briefly address the implications to boost dynamically sharing spectrum by dynamic spectrum access network (DySPAN) cognitive radios (CR)."

Significant development effort has generated devices with minimum integration times approaching 1 ns and 1 ns inter-frame time for burst-mode sequences. In this regime, photodiode design can be a crucial factor in temporal response due to the extended signal current from the sensor to the readout circuit. This work explores photodiode pixel layout strategies that improve charge collection speed without requiring changes to the fabrication process or device operation. TCAD simulation of baseline and alternative designs is presented to demonstrate the device physics underlying the proposed changes. Finally, pulsed laser measurements on fabricated devices using the varied pixel layouts are shown. It is demonstrated that larger sensing electrodes are preferable to minimize charge collection time."

    "abstract": "Metasurface reflectors and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), which are key technologies for robust, high-speed, and high-capacity communications in millimeter-wave bands, can eliminate shadowed areas caused by buildings and moving objects by artificially shaping the propagation environment. Metasurface reflectors are passive devices that can generate reflected waves in desired directions and are expected to be installed on buildings and windows as low-cost, power-free solutions. However, since their reflection angles cannot be adjusted after installation, the improvement in coverage area may be limited. To address this limitation, we propose the concept of building a multipath environment by deploying a massive number of metasurface reflectors on windows and building surfaces. When scaling up such deployments, each metasurface reflector must be individually designed due to variations in the distance and angle relative to the base station and the user equipment, leading to increased design and manufacturing costs. To mitigate this issue, we also propose a method for simplifying the design of the incident and reflection angles for metasurface reflectors. We fabricated prototype metasurface reflectors, each measuring one square meter, and designed them to exhibit specific incident and reflection angle characteristics. These metasurface reflectors were deployed continuously to form a ten-meter-long array, and we experimentally evaluated their angle-of-arrival characteristics in a large-scale setting. We confirmed that the reflected waves arrived from the designed reflection angle at each point within the measurement area."

Recent works have attempted to transition clinical tests to home-based services or develop innovative diagnostic methods, but most approaches remain self-initiated and discrete. In this study, we focused on refractive disorders and explored the feasibility of using electrooculography (EOG) to detect changes in refractive power passively. Thirty-nine participants used optometry trial lenses to simulate different refractive conditions. Participants performed a series of visual tasks while their EOG signals were recorded. We trained classification models to predict simulated refractive power levels relative to baseline visual condition across multiple evaluation settings, including within-subject, temporal generalization, and across-subject scenarios. The findings reveal that refractive power classification models achieve a mean accuracy of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$0.950 \\pm 0.034$</tex-math></inline-formula> in within-subject, within-condition scenarios.

To address DMCC deterioration, this work proposes a general ZCM scheme employing pulse-phase shifted SPWM. By identifying volt-second imbalance induced by periodic phase shift ratio variations as the root cause of DMCC degradation, the method introduces duty cycle correction to optimize it. Compared to conventional interleaved SVPWM, the proposed approach reduces CM voltage without exacerbating DMCC."

    "abstract": "In today's world, the concept of agents has been widely adopted across multiple domains and disciplines. One of the fields in which this term became significantly popular is the field of computing and computer science. One emerging sub-field of computing is Virtual Worlds, and with the advancements of technology, the concept of Metaverse. When the concept of Metaverse is used in the domain of education, it is typically referred to as the EduVerse. As technology advances and Metaverse applications are becoming popular with the general public, the role of embodied virtual agents is becoming increasingly relevant. While various types of virtual agents have been developed and studied across different domains in the scientific literature, there remains a lack of synthesized understanding regarding their use in educational virtual environments and, to an extent, in EduVerse applications. Building on this notion, this paper attempts to address these gaps and provides a narrative review of agents in the domain of computer science and AI, a survey of the most frequently used types of embodied virtual agents in the context of education, synthesizes their potential when they are used in different applications, and finally this paper discusses potential future research directions on using embodied virtual agents in EduVerse applications."

    "abstract": "The convergence of communication, sensing, and computing capabilities is a key trend in future 6th generation mobile (6 G) networks. Integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with federated learning can further enhance network performance in these areas while reducing resource overhead and protecting data privacy. However, due to limited spectrum resources and data heterogeneity, lack of client scheduling not only increases bandwidth pressure but also degrades training performance. Moreover, incentive allocation in federated learning directly influences whether UAVs accept client selection and participate in collaborative learning tasks. In order to solve the above problems, this paper designs an incentive assignment scheme for UAV clients in federated intelligent inspection based on communication-sensing-computing integration. This scheme comprehensively considers two dimensional metrics, client data quality and contribution value, for UAV incentive allocation and selection, hence abbreviated as the Multi Dimensional Scheme (MDS). MDS accounts for the communication, sensing, and computational energy consumption of UAVs, establishing a federated learning candidate pool through contract theory. Subsequently, UAVs that contribute more to model training are selected from the candidate pool via Bayesian optimization. Experiments conducted on multiple datasets show that, compared to existing methods, MDS effectively improves the accuracy of model training while reducing incentive costs."

    "abstract": "Low-Altitude Economy (LAE) networks, driven by UAVs, smart drones, and aerial-ground collaborative platforms, transform applications like surveillance, inspection, and precision agriculture. In these systems, data are inherently distributed across numerous edge devices, making centralized data aggregation impractical. Federated Learning (FL) delivers a distributed machine learning paradigm, enabling on-device model updates without centralized data collection and powering critical functions like aerial image classification and anomaly detection. However, FL still faces severe challenges in LAE environments, including data imbalance, extreme feature diversity, and weak generalization capabilities across highly heterogeneous edge nodes. The objective of this work is to address these challenges by introducing Federated Augmentation (FA) as a novel framework specifically adapted to LAE networks. Unlike conventional FL methods, our approach enriches local training with synthetic feature generation while preserving privacy and communication efficiency, thereby tackling both data scarcity and non-IID feature skew. We present an image classification case study demonstrating how SDP integration into the FA pipeline enhances privacy protection without compromising model utility. Finally, we outline key research directions to advance efficient, adaptive, and privacy-aware learning in future low-altitude systems."

    "abstract": "Updatable oblivious key management (UOKMS) allow users to outsource encrypted data along with a symmetric key-generating token to a cloud server. The designated recipient uses this token and interacts with multiple key servers to derive the decryption key and then access the data. To ensure secure access and prevent impersonation attacks, users must authenticate to each key server using distinct credentials during key derivation. This introduces computational overhead that scales linearly with the number of key servers, especially posing challenges for resource-constrained devices. Moreover, UOKMS assumes that users' devices are fully trustworthy, but real-world cases show that they may be embedded with backdoors that covertly exfiltrate cryptographic secrets. To address these challenges, we propose a secure re-randomized password-derived public/secret key pairs generation mechanism that protects the symmetric key-generating token, eliminates interactive authentication with key servers, and resists password-guessing attacks. Our design incorporates a protocol-aware reverse firewall that mitigates backdoor threats by generating unbiased randomness and transforming interactive messages through re-randomization and de-randomization. Building on this, we develop ATTEST, a password-based data protection scheme for cloud storage against backdoor attacks. Security and performance evaluations demonstrate that ATTEST offers strong security with practical efficiency."

    "abstract": "Polarimetric phased arrays (PPAs) enhance radar target detection and anti-jamming capabilities, but their conventional dual transmit/receive (T/R) channel architecture leads to high cost and system complexity. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a polarization-coding reconfigurable phased array (PCRPA) and associated pattern synthesis techniques, which reduce the channel count while preserving key performance. In the PCRPA, each antenna element connects to a single T/R channel and is equipped with a two-level RF switch, enabling real-time control of its polarization state and subarray grouping. By optimizing both the element polarization codes and the excitation weights, the array can synthesize arbitrarily polarized and dual-polarized beams. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves suppressed cross-polarization and comparable sidelobe levels compared to conventional PPAs across a wide scan range, with performance improvements being more pronounced in larger arrays. The inherent channel reduction does, however, incur a trade-off in terms of radiated power and directivity. Experimental validation using an 8 × 8 X-band array antenna confirms the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed system. The PCRPA architecture and the accompanying synthesis methods offer a cost-effective solution for large-scale PPA systems, maintaining sidelobe and polarization control with significantly reduced hardware complexity."

    "abstract": "The dilemma of optically transparent antennas, regardless of what material they are made from, has been the trade-off between transparency and antenna efficiency. This study examines the fundamental parameters that govern the two contradicting properties and presents optimized antenna designs for the two most basic antenna geometries: monopole and patch. For validation, monopoles and patches were fabricated using silver nanowires (AgNWs) that have a lower cost and an ease of preparation compared to transparent conductive oxides. The main reason for the gain reduction is Ohmic loss on the transparent conductor. Therefore, the gain improvement for the monopole antenna is to widen the geometry, and for the patch antenna, it is to raise the frequency, together with choosing an appropriate substrate. The gain is shown to be further enhanced by applying conductive strips at locations where the radiating current is concentrated, and by stacking transparent conductors. The two methods can be combined for further improvement. The prototyped AgNWs monopole antenna demonstrates a wide band operation from 3.5 GHz to 5.9 GHz, with an efficiency of 50.4% and an improvement to 76.3% with the addition of the conductive strips while keeping the optical transparency higher than 80%. The fully transparent patch antenna with both the patch and ground plane made of AgNWs is recorded to have a gain and efficiency of 3.58 dBi and 44% at 8.9 GHz. These designs outperform the existing studies in the transparency-gain trade-offs at relatively low frequency (<10 GHz), as most prior designs rely on raising the frequency to improve gain."

    "abstract": "The increasing penetration of renewable energy introduces significant uncertainties in power systems, necessitating advanced strategies to maintain economic efficiency and frequency stability. This article addresses the multireserve constrained unit commitment (MRCUC) problem by simultaneously allocating spinning reserve and frequency regulation reserve in systems with high renewable energy penetration. First, spinning reserve requirements are accurately determined by an optimization model addressing imbalances caused by renewable energy volatility and load variations. Second, primary and secondary frequency regulation requirements are quantified through detailed frequency-domain simulations utilizing each unit's frequency-to-active-power-output transfer function, thereby overcoming limitations of traditional first-order frequency approximations applicable mostly to synchronous generators. The proposed comprehensive MRCUC model, characterized by partial observability of load uncertainties and high-ordernonconvexity stemming from precise frequency simulations, cannot be efficiently solved using conventional optimization methods. Therefore, a hybrid optimization framework combining RL with convex optimization techniques is developed to address these complexities, ensuring feasible and effective decision-making. Extensive case studies conducted on IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus test systems confirm the efficacy of the proposed method, highlighting enhanced economic performance, accurate reserve allocation, and robust frequency stability."

    "abstract": "As a widely deployed aeronautical surveillance technology, Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) has become vulnerable to various security threats due to its reliance on plaintext data transmission through open protocols and unencrypted communication channels. Existing security schemes for ADS-B systems face significant challenges, including high communication overhead and excessive computational delay. To address these limitations and achieve efficient lightweight authentication for ADS-B data, this study proposes a novel intra-inter chain framework. Building upon this framework, a tree-chain authentication scheme using SM3 and SM9 cryptographic algorithms is desiged. This scheme organizes ADS-B data packets into authentication chains, employs a tree hash model for hash generation, and constructs a shared signature for multiple chains. Comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive experiments are conducted to validate the scheme's functionality and evaluate its performance. Experimental results show that our authentication scheme can effectively defend against ADS-B data spoofing attacks. Compared with other existing authentication schemes, the proposed scheme reduces communication overhead by approximately 19.3% and decreases hash/signature generation time and data verification delays by at least 42.8% and 16.5%, respectively. Moreover, the scheme maintains a verification probability of 98.7% even under high packet loss conditions, exhibiting exceptional robustness. This study provides a practical and efficient solution to enhance the security of ADS-B surveillance systems."

The approach ensures backward compatibility, improves retrieval, reduces storage, and remains cost-effective. Two retrieval experiments on autonomous driving datasets are presented: one with generic scene descriptions and another with fine-grained captions. A variational autoencoder with parameter subsampling serves as the mapping function between differently sized vectors, adapting older vectors to newer ones. Effectiveness is assessed with Centered Kernel Alignment and cosine similarity. Results show strong performance on fine-grained captions, achieving ~80% retrieval confidence even with vectors reduced to one-third size, though performance drops to ~30% for generic use cases. The method demonstrates particular strength in targeted retrieval tasks within focused language spaces."

A lot of research has been done for energy-efficient communication protocols, clustering approaches and cloud-based data analysis for improving the WBAN performance. Despite all of the efforts, the current WBAN architectures are still facing challenges related to high energy consumption, increased latency, and limited scalability due to continuous data transfer as well as lack of intelligent-based decision making at the edge of the network. One major research gap is the lack of energy-aware clustering algorithms, adaptive data aggregation and machine learning-based frameworks for joint optimization of energy efficiency, reliability and security, thus this work proposes a fog-assisted energy-efficient WBAN framework, which incorporates hybrid cluster head (CH) selection, based on least distance and residual energy, adaptive data aggregation, anomaly detection based on Random Forest, and heuristic optimization for better energy operations. The proposed methodology includes a simulation-based evaluation of WBAN communication, which is based on energy consumption, delay and throughput. this study offers insights into (i) the design of an intelligent, energy-aware hybrid clustering model, accompanied by machine learning, for energy management. (ii) Additionally, it evaluated energy consumption, performance enhancement, and fog-based processing. The simulation findings demonstrated that the hybrid clustering model is effective in considerably reducing energy costs, reducing latency, and improving throughput in comparison to traditional WBAN schemes, resulting in a sustainable and smart solution for ongoing healthcare monitoring."

The study was part of a broader action research plan whose first aim was to identify the factors that are conducive to these young women’s academic success. Specifically, the study examined the extent to which cognitive measures (i.e., grades), metacognition (i.e., self-efficacy beliefs), and behavioral engagement (i.e., attendance) would predict summative assessment outcomes (i.e., final exam grades). It then evaluated students’ awareness of their performance to determine the extent to which it could account for such outcomes. In this case study, only cognitive measures were found to predict performance. Awareness of final exam outcomes was minimally related to students’ actual performance. These results support the development of interventions on two fronts: (a) practice fostering competency to address weaknesses in knowledge and skills, and (b) training to encourage students to appreciate the benefits of a realistic self-assessment of their knowledge and skills. The next phase of the action research plan is to develop such interventions."

We design and analyze an implicit zeroth-order FL method (ZO-HFL), equipped with nonasymptotic convergence guarantees for both the server-agent and the individual client-agents, and asymptotic guarantees for both the server-agent and client-agents in an almost sure sense.

Traditional detection approaches often rely on limited datasets, as sharing proprietary design and testing information across organizations raises significant privacy and security concerns. To address this challenge, we propose the use of federated learning (FL) as a collaborative framework for counterfeit IC detection. This approach enables multiple stakeholders to train models on distributed datasets without exchanging raw data. Thereby it leads to preserving confidentiality while improving generalization and promoting collaboration. Using an IC dataset, the research demonstrates that FL-based models can accurately distinguish authentic from counterfeit ICs with the ability to adapt to emerging counterfeiting strategies. The results highlight FL as a powerful tool in advancing counterfeit detection, offering a scalable and privacy-aware path towards enhancing hardware trustworthiness."

    "abstract": "Credit card fraud poses a meaningful threat to the reliability of digital payments, and there are significant financial consequences for organizations and individuals. As the world continues to adopt digital payments, a concurrent increase in fraud is anticipated. In light of the rapidly changing and dynamic nature of credit card fraud, advance data-driven technologies should be able to learn the nuanced patterns exhibited in fraudulent transactions and thus, be optimally positioned to prevent fraud at the beginning of the process. While potential exists to address fraud using data-driven models, a commitment to high quality and substantial data is necessary. This is not always achievable given privacy constraints, as well as the systematic imbalance found in real-world datasets the number of legitimate transactions becomes vastly greater than the number of fraud transactions. The dataset of credit card fraud used here contains a total of 284,807 single observations. Among these, a heavy class imbalance is seen since there are merely 492 instances that have been marked as fraud. To evaluate and train the performance of all the different machine learning models, the entire dataset was split into two completely separate subsets: a training set and a testing set. Extensive analysis revealed the Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier as the top performer for fraud detection. This ensemble method effectively predicts fraud while accurately distinguishing genuine transactions. Combining this data-driven approach with rule-based systems could further enhance credit card fraud detection capabilities."

    "abstract": "This study presents a computer vision and machine learning-based approach for estimating the total leaf area of tomato plants. Accurate estimation of plant leaf area is essential for crop monitoring, growth assessment, and precision agriculture. However, traditional measurement approaches, such as manual tracing or the use of depth cameras, are often labor-intensive, destructive, or costly, which limits their scalability in large-scale agricultural applications. Recent advances in computer vision and machine learning have enabled non-destructive estimation of plant traits directly from ordinary RGB images. Monocular depth estimation models, such as MiDaS, can extract relative depth information from a single RGB image without requiring additional hardware devices, while advanced segmentation methods, such as YOLOv5, can accurately isolate plant regions from complex backgrounds. Nevertheless, the potential of integrating depth estimation with segmentation for leaf area estimation has not been fully explored. To address this gap, this study proposes a new method, referred to as MiDaS-LAE, that combines MiDaS depth estimation with YOLOv5-based segmentation to extract relative depth information from segmented regions, compute the relative depth sum of squares, and use it as a compact feature for a regression model. This framework enables non-destructive leaf area estimation from a single RGB image, avoids reliance on depth sensors or manual measurement, and is validated on a tomato plant dataset with multi-view images, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness for practical agricultural applications."

    "abstract": "This paper studies a strategic security problem in networked control systems under stealthy false data injection attacks. The security problem is modeled as a bilateral cognitive security game between a defender and an adversary, each possessing cognitive reasoning abilities. The adversary with an adversarial cognitive ability attacks strategically selected interconnections of the system with the aim of disrupting the network performance while remaining stealthy to the defender. Meanwhile, the defender with a defensive cognitive ability monitors strategically selected nodes to impose the stealthiness constraint with the purpose of minimizing the worst-case disruption caused by the adversary. Within the proposed bilateral cognitive security framework, the preferred cognitive levels of the two strategic agents are formulated in terms of two newly proposed concepts, cognitive mismatch and cognitive resonance. Moreover, we propose a method to compute the policies for the defender and the adversary with arbitrary cognitive abilities. A sufficient condition is established under which an increase in cognitive levels does not alter the policies for the defender and the adversary, ensuring convergence. The obtained results are validated through numerical simulations."

Meanwhile, Digital Twin (DT) has surfaced as a promising technology to provide comprehensive and dynamic descriptions of physical objects in cyberspace with bidirectional and real-time interactions. Moreover, Internet of Things (IoT) devices have contributed abundant, heterogeneous and continuous data from interconnected devices to the explosion of DTs. With technologies evolution, there is an increasing necessity to address the freshness of both DT states and DT data, through timely synchronizations between DTs and their objects in a highly dynamic IoT environment. In this paper, we develop innovative methodologies to improve the DT freshness while minimizing the cost of various resources consumed on the DT freshness improvement. Specifically, we first formulate two novel optimization problems of DT freshness: (i) The static DT freshness optimization problem, where all DT synchronization tasks are given in advance; and (ii) the dynamic DT freshness optimization problem without any knowledge of future DT synchronization tasks over a given finite time. We then devise an approximation algorithm with a provable approximation ratio for the static DT freshness optimization problem. Also, we develop an online algorithm with a provable competitive ratio for the dynamic DT freshness optimization problem. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms through simulations. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms outperform their comparison baselines by no less than 13.2%."

Although current methods for detecting PV faults, such as thermal imaging, drone inspections, or artificial neural networks, have proven to be highly accurate, they frequently depend on expensive equipment, intricate setups, or cloud-based computing that impede real-time and embedded deployment. By presenting a unique Embedded Machine Learning (EML) framework for proactive, low-power, on-site PV failure detection, this study gets beyond these restrictions. Our Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, in contrast to ANN-based models, is designed for lightweight deployment on an ESP32 microcontroller, guaranteeing reliable performance with low computational overhead. When combined with high-precision sensors, data preprocessing, and IoT interaction with Adafruit IO and MQTT, the system attains a 96.5% classification accuracy while using just 250 mw significantly reducing the energy footprint compared to existing solutions. This work demonstrated the possibility of deploying scalable, autonomous, and energy-efficient diagnostic systems in resource-constrained environments with real-time monitoring, which had not been taken into consideration in prior papers in the literature, in addition to early identification of common faults like shading, short circuits, open circuits, and hot spots. This work makes an exceptional contribution to solar energy predictive maintenance by bridging the gap between cutting-edge AI methods and real-world field application, opening the door for more intelligent and greener PV installations."

    "abstract": "In this article, a decentralized relative attitude state observer using rotation matrices is designed for a multivehicle system. This system is modeled as a multi-agent rigid body system (MARBS). Several challenges arise in the analysis of multi-vehicle systems modeled as MARBS: one of these challenges is estimating the relative rotational motions of vehicles in such systems. Here, a relative attitude and relative angular velocity estimation scheme based on the Lagranged’Alembert principle of variational mechanics, is designed. Estimates of absolute attitudes and angular velocities of agents (vehicles) in the system are shared with other vehicles they are communicating with. These estimates are used to design a Lagrangian, obtained as the difference between a kinetic energy-like term and a potential energy-like function. Thereafter, a decentralized variational estimation scheme is designed to estimate the relative attitude motion states and its stability is shown analytically. This estimation scheme is then discretized in the form of a Lie group variational integrator (LGVI) for numerical simulations, by applying the discrete Lagrange-d’Alembert principle. Finally, numerical simulations indicate that the estimated states converge to a bounded neighborhood of the true states of the multi-vehicle system in the presence of noise in absolute state estimates."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically optimize the expected cumulative reward, i.e., the expected value of the sum of scalar rewards an agent receives over the course of a trajectory. The expected value averages the performance over an infinite number of trajectories. However, when deploying the agent in the real world, this ensemble average may be uninformative for the performance of individual trajectories. Thus, in many applications, optimizing the long-term performance of individual trajectories might be more desirable. In this work, we propose a novel RL algorithm that combines the standard ensemble average with the time-average growth rate, a measure for the long-term performance of individual trajectories. We first define the Bellman operator for the time-average growth rate. We then show that, under multiplicative reward dynamics, the geometric mean aligns with the time-average growth rate. To address more general and unknown reward dynamics, we propose a modified geometric mean with N-sliding window that captures the path-dependency as an estimator for the time-average growth rate. This estimator is embedded as a regularizer into the objective, forming a practical algorithm and enabling the policy to benefit from ensemble average and time-average simultaneously. We evaluate our algorithm in challenging simulations, where it outperforms conventional RL methods."

Unlike previous research, which predominantly focuses on safeguarding client data, our work shifts attention to protecting the client model itself. Through a theoretical analysis, we examine how various factors—such as the probability of client selection, the structure of local objective functions, global aggregation at the server, and the eavesdropper’s capabilities—impact the overall level of protection. We further validate our findings through numerical experiments, assessing the protection by evaluating the model accuracy achieved by the adversary. Finally, we compare our results with methods based on differential privacy, underscoring their limitations in this specific context."

For concreteness, we focus on the stochastic projected gradient (SPG) algorithm, and we examine the asymptotic distribution of its iterates when the method is run with constant step-size updates (the de facto choice for practical deployments of the algorithm). In contrast to variants of the method with a vanishing step-size case, SPG with a constant step-size does not converge: instead, it reaches a neighborhood of the game’s Nash equilibrium at an exponential rate, and then, due to persistent noise, it fluctuates in its vicinity without converging (occasionally moving away on rare occasions). We provide a theoretical quantification of this behavior by analyzing the Markovian structure of the process. Namely, we show that, regardless of the algorithm’s initialization, the distribution of its iterates converges at a geometric rate to a unique invariant measure which is concentrated in a neighborhood of the game’s Nash equilibrium. More explicitly, we quantify the degree of this concentration and the rate of convergence of the algorithm’s empirical frequency of play to the invariant measure of the process in Wasserstein distance, and we provide explicit bounds in terms of the method’s step-size, the variance of the noise entering the process, and the geometric features of the game’s payoff landscape."

    "abstract": "The Weekly Unit Commitment (WUC) problem is critical for power system operations, where inter-temporal dependencies and unit start-up/shutdown dynamics extend beyond daily scheduling. Traditional Weekly Aggregated Unit Commitment Model (WAUCM), formulated as Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs), plan an 8-day (192-hour) horizon with hourly resolution but become computationally intractable when applied to large systems or finer time steps. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a Sequential Daily Unit Commitment Model (SDUCM) that decomposes the 192-hour horizon into eight 24-hour subproblems, transferring terminal states between days to preserve temporal continuity. Using real operational data from the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), both the SDUCM and the WAUCM were benchmarked under two scenarios: (A) with must-run/mustshutdown constraints and (B) without such restrictions. Results show that the Aggregated Unit Commitment Model achieved marginally lower operating costs, with reductions of 0.041% in Scenario A and 0.031% in Scenario B, equivalent to weekly savings of 237,626 THB and 181,964 THB, respectively. However, these gains required nearly 700% more decision variables and over 800% more constraints, resulting in significantly longer computation times. In contrast, the proposed Sequential Model produced near-optimal solutions (0.05% cost deviation) with up to 36.6% faster computation, while ensuring full compliance with operational constraints. These findings demonstrate that the SDUCM provides a scalable and computationally efficient framework for largescale weekly scheduling, making it well-suited for real-time or rolling-horizon operations in modern, interconnected power systems. Unlike Aggregated formulations, which become computationally prohibitive at national or multi-regional scales."

    "abstract": "As audio adversarial attacks continue to evolve, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models have emerged as a significant target. Traditional audio attack methods often focus on minimizing perturbation magnitude and frequency, overlooking the importance of perturbation location. However, certain audio regions hold lower importance for ASR models, making attacks on these regions less effective and more perceptible as noise. Additionally, the human ear perceives noise differently depending on its placement within the audio sequence, with noise in silent segments being more noticeable. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Pitch Sparse Audio Attack (PASK), an innovative framework designed to enhance adversarial imperceptibility through sparse perturbations. PASK introduces two key techniques: Pitch Mapping, which provides a strategic starting point for perturbation, and an adaptive grouped selective mask that achieves targeted sparsity, focusing perturbations on high-impact audio regions. Experimental results demonstrate that PASK outperforms existing methods in both effectiveness and imperceptibility. Furthermore, a human study confirms that silent-segment perturbations are more easily detected, underscoring the perceptual advantages of our approach."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider inflectional instability of linearized incompressible Euler equations in a continuous time formulation. Inflectional instability is a linear inviscid instability mechanism that plays important role in dynamics of transitional and turbulent fluid flows. According to Rayleigh theorem, it occurs when an inflectional point develops in the mean velocity profile. Rayleigh theorem [1], as most of the studies concerning stability analysis of fluid flows, relies on eigenvalue decomposition that restricts analysis to a class of perturbations known as normal models (waves with time-dependent amplitude). In addition to the Rayleigh condition, a second, Fjørtoft condition [2], has also been developed, likewise based on the normal mode assumption. Both these conditions represent necessary conditions for instability assuming a normal mode decomposition. The current paper revisits linear stability analysis of inviscid incompressible flows, but instead develops a generalized, continuous in time analysis framework that does not require a normal mode decomposition or any other assumption on the form of perturbations. The framework transforms a governing Partial Differential Equation (PDE) problem into a Partial Integral Equation (PIE) and then analyzes stability of a continuous in time PIE by invoking Lyapunov-based methods verified through Linear Partial Inequality (LPI) tests. The developed stability test provides a stricter condition for stability than the normal mode analysis since it explicitly searches for a Lyapunov function, which, if found, guarantees stability. The results of this paper show that, even when the Rayleigh and Fjørtoft criteria for instability are not satisfied (i.e. a system has all stable eigenvalues), an appropriate Lyapunov function cannot always be found, meaning that these profiles can be unstable to generalized perturbations. This suggests that, in general, neither Rayleigh nor Fjørtoft criteria can be used as sufficient conditions for stability when the Lyapunov stability of a continuous-time formulation is considered."

Leveraging the capabilities of artificial intelligence can help with making data and technology secure against sophisticated and evasive malware. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learningbased approach for malware detection of Portable Executable(PE) files using an Artificial Neural Network(ANN). Since PE files are essential for the operation of the Windows operating system and its applications, they can be exploited and used maliciously. These files are most commonly used for malware detection since the Windows operating system, the most prominent desktop operating system worldwide, uses PE files as its most common executable file format. Because of this, most malware is created for the Windows operating system and spread in the PE format. PE files contain a wealth of information that can be used to detect malware, such as the file's entry point, section headers, and digital certificates. This information can be used to identify suspicious behavior, such as attempts to execute code in non-executable sections of the file or the absence of a valid digital certificate. Our paper makes use of ANNs to evaluate the behavioral and structural traits of PE files and differentiate between samples that are harmful and those that are not. The process begins with feature extraction, where various attributes of PE files, including header information, section details, import/export functions, and strings, are extracted to serve as input features for the neural network. Our approach for detecting PE malware is by using a hybrid framework of deep learning, a technique in artificial intelligence, and machine learning and using the EMBER dataset to train the model."

Recent works have explored population-adaptive sampling patterns learned from groups of patients (or scans), which enhance sampling pattern design by tailoring it to dataset-specific characteristics, rather than relying on generic approaches. Building on this idea, sampling techniques can be further personalized down to the level of individual scans, enabling the capture of subject- or slice-specific details that may be overlooked in population-based designs. To address this challenging problem, we propose a framework for jointly learning scan-adaptive Cartesian undersampling patterns and a corresponding reconstruction model from a training set, enabling more tailored sampling for individual scans. We use an alternating algorithm for learning the sampling patterns and the reconstruction model where we use an iterative coordinate descent (ICD) based offline optimization of scan-adaptive <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$</tex-math></inline-formula>-space sampling patterns for each example in the training set.

    "abstract": "As PV systems become more integrated into power grids, challenges arise in optimizing power flow and maintaining stability amid fluctuating load conditions. Variations in solar energy output and load lead to unbalanced reactive power and potential voltage instability. This study presents a Graph-Attention-Long Short-Term Reinforcement Network (GAL-RNet), which combines the innovations of the Reinforced Graph-Long Short-Term Control Network (RGLCN) and the Temporal Attention-Gated Recurrent Unit Convolutional Network (TAG-CNN) for power flow optimization and real-time voltage stabilization. RGLCN employs Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for adaptive control, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for disturbance prediction, and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to model grid dynamics. TAG-CNN utilizes Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to forecast load changes accurately, employs attention mechanisms to focus on key factors, and incorporates Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to adjust parameters in real time. The MATLAB/Simulink code and related scripts for data generation for the IEEE-9-Bus PV-connected grid system are publicly available at https://github.com/obatolasamuel-ops/IEEE-9-BUS-SYSTEM-IN-PV-CONNECTED-GRID-SYSTEM. Simulation results on the IEEE 9-Bus system demonstrate that GAL-RNet achieves a total harmonic distortion of less than 1%, 98% accuracy, 95% system stability, and a computation time of 70 ms, outperforming traditional models such as RNNs, ANNs, and CNNs. However, the approach’s computational complexity limits its applicability in larger systems. Future research will focus on improving computational efficiency and enabling real-world deployment."

    "abstract": "Differential Privacy (DP) provides a rigorous framework for developing privacy-preserving applications. For discrete selection problems, the Exponential Mechanism (EM) offers a computationally tractable solution. However, the conventional EM fails to incorporate critical real-world constraints, such as non-uniform priors on the input domain or desired marginal distributions (evidence) over the output space. This limitation is significant, as the only alternative — direct optimization under such constraints — is often computationally prohibitive for large-scale applications, impeding the practical deployment of DP. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel utility formulation for the EM that explicitly models datapoints’ dissimilarity while integrating prior information. This formulation is parameterized, allowing us to generate an ensemble of candidate EMs. We propose an efficient bisection-based search heuristic to select a near-optimal mechanism from this ensemble. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that our method improves privacy (up to 5%) parameter ϵ over the conventional EM. Furthermore, its performance closely approximates the optimal DP solution under constraints on expected dissimilarity, input priors, and output evidence, offering a practical and scalable approach."

The method significantly enhances the ability to detect low-frequency, hidden temporal defects and logical errors, transforming the traditional testing paradigm that relies on expert experience.

    "abstract": "While generative AI has the potential to augment human creativity, it has also been noted for its potential to induce “cognitive fixation,” a state where initial ideas excessively constrain subsequent thinking. This paper reframes this fixation, generally regarded as a barrier, as a potentially necessary phase in the creative process, corresponding to the intensive “preparation” stage in Wallas's model of creativity. From this perspective, the essential challenge is not the elimination of fixation itself, but rather the management of the transition from this state of intense focus, through an incubation stage of unconscious thought, to a new illumination or insight. This study explores this dynamic using an AI-augmented system for the KJ-Ho (KJ Method). Preliminary investigations suggest a dual role for <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{A I}$</tex>. In the data grouping stage, the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{A I}$</tex> helped to relativize unproductive mental sets, thereby shortening the incubation period and facilitating insight. However, in the group naming stage, the AI's high-quality suggestions induced a powerful fixation that resulted in creative stagnation, thereby preventing a productive preparation phase. This paper examines this dual role of AI through the lenses of Wallas's creative cycle, Gestalt psychology, and foundational HCI theories, presenting a design philosophy for AI that enables users to productively leverage fixation while smoothly navigating the entire creative cycle."

    "abstract": "Data Science is fast becoming a revolutionary field, which requires reviewing pedagogical strategies and curriculum development to accommodate the demands of Big Data and high-level analytics. The application of data science has gained importance in the healthcare industry of India because with the increasing rates of the digital health record, telemedicine, insurance databases, and data that are produced by the IoT-based medical devices, the necessity to integrate data science into the industry has exponentially increased. Although this has expanded, lack of a standardized educational system to train the data scientists is a critical challenge. An integrated teaching model is needed to prepare a community of professionals in the future with the capabilities necessary to manage healthcare data in large quantities, both structured and unstructured, process, analyze, and integrate. This paper underlines the potential role of data science in transforming Indian health care through data-driven transformation, clinical decision making, better patient outcomes, and optimized use of resources in the public and private systems. In India, where the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) and building electronic health infrastructure efforts are currently being implemented by the government, there is a viable prospect to implement uniform data science education. The paper emphasizes the need to have academic institutions, policymakers, and healthcare organizations collaborate to build one successful educational program that bridges the knowledge gap and gives rise to sustainable and data-driven healthcare change in India."

    "abstract": "What is the performance cost of using simple, decoupled control policies in inherently coupled systems? Motivated by industrial refrigeration systems, where centralized compressors exhibit economies of scale yet traditional control employs decoupled room-by-room temperature regulation, we address this question through the lens of multi-location inventory control. Here, a planner manages multiple inventories to meet stochastic demand while minimizing costs that are coupled through nonlinear ordering functions reflecting economies of scale. Our main contributions are: (i) a surprising equivalence result showing that optimal stationary base-stock levels for individual locations remain unchanged despite coupling when restricting attention to decoupled strategies; (ii) tight performance bounds for simple decoupled policies relative to optimal coupled policies, revealing that the worst-case ratio depends solely on the degree of nonlinearity in the ordering cost function; and (iii) an analysis of a practical online algorithm that achieves competitive performance without solving complex dynamic programs. Numerical simulations demonstrate that while decoupled policies significantly outperform their worst-case guarantees in typical scenarios, they still exhibit meaningful suboptimality compared to fully coordinated strategies. These results provide actionable guidance for system operators navigating the trade-off between control complexity and operational efficiency in coupled systems."

A key aspect of successful implementation is the incorporation of design flexibility to accommodate different fuel types, ensuring future sustainability in the event of fuel source fluctuation or unavailability. Design aspects, such as size and the use of accessories (spike rolls, leveling augers) is discussed, with their applicability dependent on the material in question. By carefully considering these factors, Walking Floor bins can be a reliable and adaptable solution for alternative fuel management in cement production."

    "abstract": "We propose and analyze a model for the dynamics of the flow into and out of a nest for the arboreal turtle ant Cephalotes goniodontus during foraging to investigate a possible mechanism for the emergence of oscillations. In our model, there is mixed dynamic feedback between the flow of ants between different behavioral compartments and the amount of pheromone along trails. On one hand, the ants deposit pheromone along the trail, which provides a positive feedback by increasing rates of return to the nest. On the other hand, pheromone evaporation is a source of negative feedback, as it depletes the pheromone and inhibits the return rate. We prove that the model is globally asymptotically stable in the absence of pheromone feedback. Then we show that pheromone feedback can lead to a loss of stability of the equilibrium and onset of sustained oscillations in the flow in and out of the nest via a Hopf bifurcation. This analysis sheds light on a potential key mechanism that enables arboreal turtle ants to effectively optimize their trail networks to minimize traveled path lengths and eliminate graph cycles."

Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) systems are critical for minimizing downtime and ensuring operational continuity. This research investigates the integration of Digital Twin (DT) technology with Machine Learning (ML) models for real-time fault detection and diagnosis (RT-FDD) in discrete manufacturing machines. Two industrial systems—a Pick-and-Place machine and a Furnace—were modeled using linear and non-linear models to develop Digital Twins. The method is validated on a simulated environment replicating real industrial behavior, combining DT-generated features with conventional real-time process data. The proposed approach improved F1 scores by up to 11% and demonstrated enhanced robustness in both inter-cycle and intra-cycle fault detection tasks. Notably, for the Furnace machine, the method enabled fault detection 40% earlier in the cycle while maintaining the same F1 Score of 94%, and provided reliable diagnosis with an F1 Score of 80% at only 15% of cycle completion. A comprehensive evaluation of 16 ML algorithms highlighted the effectiveness of DT features in boosting predictive performance."

The traditional governance model based on technical defense is no longer suitable for the needs of new media scenarios. This study focuses on the governance of network information security based on credit mechanisms in the context of new media. Supported by credit theory and network security theory, a step-by-step implementation process of “collection preprocessing evaluation grading incentive constraint” credit mechanism is constructed, and combined with a three-dimensional guarantee system of “technology compliance collaboration”, forming a “mechanism+technology” collaborative security prevention and control framework. Through experimental verification, this mechanism has achieved a false information recognition rate of 89.1% and a cross platform risk blocking rate of 82.4% in terms of security prevention and control, effectively curbing core security risks; At the compliance level, the credit data collection compliance rate reached 92.3 %, strictly following the principle of “minimum necessity”; At the technical performance level, the average time for credit evaluation is <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\leq 85 \\text{ms}$</tex>, the data security compliance rate throughout the entire process is 100 %, and it is adapted to the real-time dissemination characteristics of new media information.

Through comparative analyses, the study demonstrates that AI-enabled online systems consistently outperform traditional education models across key sustainability indicators, including resource efficiency, accessibility, intercultural collaboration, and learner support. The significance of the paper includes the case study of Manav Rachna Online (MRO) providing a practical illustration, showing how its AI-powered LMS reduces paper and travel requirements, ensures integrity through AI-based exam proctoring, and fosters global dialogue through COIL initiatives. These innovations align directly with SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals), while contributing indirectly to SDG 13 (Climate Action). At the same time, the paper acknowledges the persistent barriers to sustainability in online education, including funding constraints, institutional resistance, curriculum overload, cultural diversity, and technological inequality. Addressing these challenges through evidence-based research, innovative pedagogy, and equitable access to AI technologies is essential for realizing the full potential of online education.

    "abstract": "The three-level neutral point clamped (3L-NPC) inverter is widely used in permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive systems for its low total harmonic distortion (THD) and high efficiency but suffers from neutral point voltage (NPV) drift and third-order harmonic fluctuations. With a relatively small DC-link capacitance, the NPV exhibits more pronounced high-frequency fluctuations. Although conventional carrier-based pulse width modulation (CBPWM) schemes effectively mitigate NPV drift, the regulation latency, due to the injected zero sequence voltage cannot be adjusted within each switching cycle, inherently limits their ability to suppress high-frequency NPV fluctuations. Therefore, this paper investigates the mechanism of NPV fluctuation in three-level NPC inverters and establishes a linearized model describing the relationship between the injected zero-sequence voltage and NPV dynamics. Based on this model, a CBPWM control strategy incorporating active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) is proposed to enhance both steady-state and dynamic NPV regulation. An extended state observer (ESO) is employed to estimate and compensate for the third-harmonic disturbances responsible for NPV oscillations in real time, enabling active suppression of voltage ripple without increasing switching frequency or computational complexity. Experimental results verify that the proposed method achieves stable NPV regulation and smooth torque response under both steady-state and dynamic conditions, thereby enhancing the overall performance of a 3L-NPC inverter-based PMSM drive."

    "abstract": "The development of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has enabled AI-driven models to excel in recognizing a limited set of classes within static environments. As AI systems progress, few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to expand their understanding of novel classes from minimal samples while retaining knowledge of previously encountered ones. However, most existing FSCIL models face significant challenges, including <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">inadequate adaptability</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">catastrophic forgetting</i>, which hinder their ability to maintain robust forward and backward learning capabilities. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel Forward-Backward Knowledge Transfer (FBKT) paradigm, which strategically integrates forward distribution adaptation (FDA) and backward semantic alignment (BSA) mechanisms to achieve bidirectional adaptability in knowledge transfer. The FDA mechanism enhances forward adaptability by expanding and reserving the embedding space for new classes using semantic-irrelevant masked images as virtual negative classes, thereby mitigating data overfitting. It also employs self-supervised representation learning to utilize semantic-relevant local embeddings as additional positive samples, fostering class separation and generalization. Meanwhile, the BSA mechanism ensures the semantic consistency of previously learned classes across sessions during class-incremental learning, promoting smoother backward adaptability and reducing model degradation. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets consistently highlight the superior performance and effectiveness of our FBKT compared to state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Accurate age estimation from facial images is critical in domains such as healthcare, online safety, and demographic analytics. However, the under-representation of older adults in publicly available facial datasets introduces a significant bias in regression models, often leading to systematic underperformance for this age group. In this work, we address the challenge of age estimation under imbalanced age distributions by proposing an adaptive ensemble regression framework. Our method combines three complementary estimators: RankSim, which enforces local ranking consistency; Supervised Contrastive Regression (SupCR), which leverages relational structure in label space; and a baseline L1 regression model. The final prediction is obtained via a weighted combination of the individual outputs, with weights dynamically learned to reflect the reliability of each model across different age groups. We evaluate the proposed approach on three benchmark datasets: AgeDB, IMDB-Wiki, and UTKFace. Experiments show that our ensemble method consistently reduces the mean absolute error (MAE), particularly for the 65+ age group, where single-model approaches exhibit the largest performance gap. This study highlights the importance of model-level mitigation strategies for addressing digital ageism in facial analytics systems."

Traditional methods of measuring soil moisture, though well established, are time consuming, labor intensive, requires installation and maintenance of equipment, expensive and gives low resolution outputs. This calls for the requirement of a soil moisture calculation method which is instantaneous, portable,economic and efficient. Spectroscopy has emerged as a promising solution since it can deliver valuable insights into the composition, structure, and properties of materials across diverse fields. In this study, a spectroscopic sensor was employed to analyze soil samples,and its readings were compared with soil moisture values determined through the conventional gravimetric method. By applying different regression approaches, a relationship between the sensor output and soil moisture was established, aiming to minimize errors such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean bias error (MBE), and root mean square error (RMSE).The findings revealed that a third-order polynomial regression equation at 705 nm wavelength provided the most accurate results, with error values of MAE, MBE, and RMSE being 0.38, 0.06, and 0.5, respectively. This outcome demonstrates that combining the spectroscopic sensor with the derived equation can offer an instantaneous, non-contact method for soil moisture estimation. Compared to the lengthy and labor-intensive gravimetric process, this approach provides a rapid and practical solution for soil moisture assessment in various applications."

The sampler selects without replacement according to these risk-aware scores.

On grid, Erdős–Rényi (ER), and Barabási–Albert (BA) graphs, our approach consistently reduces the normalized root- mean-square error (NRMSE) compared to random sampling; the gain increases with the sampling rate and persists under selection-graph mismatch. The method is simple, eigendecomposition-free, and scales linearly in the number of edges per Hutchinson probe."

Through a series of experiments, we gather force-moment data from the robotic arm attachment and utilize it to fine-tune our unsteady model for banking turn maneuvers. Subsequently, we employ the tuned FSI model alongside a collocation control strategy to accomplish 3D banking turns of Aerobat within simulation environments. The primary contribution lies in presenting a methodical approach to calibrate our FSI model to predict complex 3D maneuvers and successfully assessing the model’s potential for closed-loop flight control of Aerobat using an optimization-based collocation method."

In a stochastic setting, model predictive control (MPC) is a widely adopted approach for tackling this problem. However, it can be computationally intensive and, perhaps more importantly, relies on the characterization of uncertainty. To overcome these potential limitations, we propose a Lyapunov-based online optimal control method, which operates in real time without requiring prior characterization of the uncertainty. By relaxing time-coupling constraints, the proposed online method becomes suboptimal compared to offline optimization with perfect foresight, i.e., the ideal solution to the optimal control problem. Our main result establishes an infinite horizon time-average performance guarantee, demonstrating bounded suboptimality of the proposed method. We apply the Lyapunov-based online optimal control method to the economic dispatch of cascaded hydropower plants, and show that it can outperform both greedy online control and popular MPC."

Consequently, developing an effective brain–computer interface (BCI) suitable for their operation has become an immediate concern. This paper presents a wearable multimodal BCI system for smart ward control, which employs a self-designed wearable headband to capture head rotation and blinking movement. By wearing the headband, users can control a computer cursor on the screen only with head rotation and blinking, and further control devices in a smart ward with self-designed graphical user interfaces (GUIs). The system decodes signals from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to map the head posture to the position of the cursor on the screen and decodes electrooculography (EOG) and electroencephalography (EEG) signals to detect valid blinks for selecting and activating function buttons. Ten participants were recruited to perform two experimental tasks that simulate the daily needs of patients with extremity motor function issues. To our satisfaction, all the participants fully accomplished the simulated tasks, and an average accuracy of 97.0±3.9 % and an average response time of 2.39±0.53 s were achieved. Different from traditional step-controlled BCI nursing beds, we designed a continuous-controlled nursing bed and achieved satisfactory results. Furthermore, workload evaluation using NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) revealed that the participants experienced a low workload when using the system. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed system, indicating significant potential for practical applications."

One of the key factors determining the severity of a user's VRMS symptoms is the VRMS susceptibility. In order to explore how the susceptibility modulate the brain activity, and detect the VRMS susceptibility through the EEG, this paper designs a simulated flight mission and adaptive training experiment to obtain the different susceptibility from the same experimental conditions. And a tempo-spatial attention EEG model with contrastive learning (TSAEEG-CL) is proposed to detect the VRMS susceptibility. The model employs a temporal branch (temporal position embedding and multi-head self-attention) and a spatial branch (spatial position embedding and multi-head self-attention) to extract the tempo-spatial features from the EEG. Then a feature fusion layer is utilized to aggregate them. The contrastive learning used in the model consider the resting state EEG before and after the VRMS exposure task as the benchmark and target respectively. The model is trained to learn the difference between the target and benchmark to determine the VRMS susceptibility. Experimental results demonstrate that TSAEEG-CL attains 99.91 % accuracy surpassing the performance of several existing models. This framework provides quantitative assessment for VRMS susceptibility and offers new ideas for the development of VR system comfort.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a fast mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) framework for multi-robot navigation by combining graph attention networks and distributed optimization. We formulate a mixed-integer optimization problem for receding horizon motion planning of a multi-robot system, taking into account the surrounding obstacles. To address the resulting multi-agent MICP problem in real time, we propose a framework that utilizes heterogeneous graph attention networks to learn the latent mapping from problem parameters to optimal binary solutions. Furthermore, we apply a distributed proximal alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm for solving the convex continuous optimization problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework through experiments conducted on a robotic testbed."

    "abstract": "Phase-modulated continuous-wave (PMCW) radar is a promising technology for internet of things (IoT) applications due to its high resilience against interference and compatibility with communication systems. To address the computational burden in PMCW radar, conventional approaches accumulate sequences in the time domain to reduce the number of samples used for Doppler processing in velocity estimation. However, the direct summation of sequences without phase compensation leads to severe performance degradation caused by the Doppler effect, including velocity ambiguity and signal-to-noise ratio loss. Therefore, this paper proposes a low-complexity sequence accumulation method for detecting fast-moving targets. By adjusting the desired velocity search region, the proposed method simultaneously resolves the velocity ambiguity and reduces computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed method achieves a processing time approximately 3.5 times faster than the non-accumulation method. In addition, the proposed method compensates for the Doppler phase difference along the slow-time to enable coherent accumulation over sequences, thereby preventing performance degradation and achieving higher detection probability compared to conventional accumulation methods."

    "abstract": "Concept drift, a persistent challenge in machine learning, can lead to the deterioration of model performance over time due to changes in data distribution. This issue is a pressing issue for the U.S. Armed Forces as they integrate AI-driven systems into defense operations such as surveillance and reconnaissance as drops in model accuracy can lead to sever tactical disadvantages. This study presents a novel drift detection method that quantifies concept drift by combining AI-generated confidence values with human corrections. Unlike traditional approaches, this method allows for AI-human interaction, ensuring adaptability to evolving data distributions while enhancing trust and facilitating targeted retraining. The proposed system introduces a custom metric called the Drift Avoidance Value to detect drift in desired object classes. A YOLO object detection model was employed to evaluate the method using a dataset of 200 images focusing on object classes relevant to military operations. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the Drift Avoidance Value for detecting and responding to concept drift, decreasing as the model’s performance declines and increases following retraining. The study highlights the crucial role of human input in reinforcing model reliability and demonstrates the method’s effectiveness in adapting to performance degradation. This approach supports the sustainability of object detection systems in defense and could also be applied to various other AI systems, ensuring robust decision-making across multiple domains."

To address these challenges, we propose a digital twin (DT)-empowered Transformer-based policy learning framework that combines accurate real-time virtual modeling with attention-driven sequential decision-making for AAV–ARIS-assisted communications. The DT enables efficient synchronization with physical channels in dynamic environments, significantly improving data-efficient training. Meanwhile, a Transformer-based actor–critic architecture captures long-range temporal dependencies to jointly optimize ARIS configuration and AAV mobility control across diverse scenarios. A multi-objective reward function is formulated to maximize both secrecy rate and energy efficiency while ensuring robustness against channel uncertainty and adversarial threats. The formulated problem is solved using reinforcement learning with Transformer-enhanced policy optimization. Simulation results demonstrate consistent performance gains over strong baselines, including DT-deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), DT-twin delayed DDPG (TD3), and RIS-soft actor-critic (SAC). The proposed framework achieves up to a 12.5% improvement in secrecy rate, a 14.8% enhancement in energy efficiency, and a 33% faster convergence rate. Furthermore, ablation studies and complexity analyses confirm the contribution of each component and demonstrate the scalability of the framework with acceptable latency. These findings highlight the potential of integrating DT technology with Transformer-based reinforcement learning to enable secure, adaptive, and resource-efficient ARIS-assisted communications in next-generation wireless networks."

    "abstract": "In recent years, domain adaptation methods have been widely applied in fault diagnosis. However, these methods are typically based on the assumption that the source and target domains have identical fault modes. In real-world industrial scenarios, unknown fault modes may occur in mechanical equipment, resulting in limitations in existing diagnostic methods. To address these issues, a dual-level entropy-aware consensus domain adversarial framework (DECDAF) is proposed for open set fault diagnosis. First, a dual-level entropy-aware module is constructed that employs unified entropy metrics at the sample-level and domain-level, which dynamically weights samples and adjusts decision boundaries. Then, for supervised learning, an auxiliary classifier module is employed to enhance the alignment of known classes; for unsupervised learning, a self-supervised clustering module is introduced to explore the intrinsic structure of the target domain and disambiguate marginal samples. Finally, a consensus domain adversarial module is designed that integrates the outputs of multiple modules to ensure consistent recognition of known classes and enhance domain alignment through adversarial learning. Comprehensive experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in solving the open set fault diagnosis and demonstrate its usability through real-world condition applications."

Consequently, this technology has recently garnered considerable attention within this domain. However, existing methods either encounter limitations in instance-level visual representation due to self-occlusion or fail to fully utilize the potential of complex kinematic information, making it challenging to adequately capture the intricate relationships between the two data sources. In this paper, we tackle this issue by addressing the problem through causal learning and Fourier learning. Specifically, we introduce a novel framework called <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Causal-Inspired Fourier Representation Learning (CIFRL)</i> for Wearable IMUs and Egocentric Action Recognition, which aims to enhance cross-modal feature alignment. The framework consists of two key components: (1) Temporal Causal Modeling (TCM), designed for video interpretation from a causal perspective; (2) Spectral-Temporal Learning (STL), which aims to decompose the inertial data using Fourier representation and align cross-modal features. We evaluate our proposed framework on the WEAR and CMU-MMAC benchmarks. Empirical results demonstrate the superior performance of our CIFRL approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Nanoscale manufacturing requires high-precision surface inspection to guarantee the quality of the produced nanostructures. For production environments, angle-resolved scatterometry offers a non-invasive and in-line compatible alternative to traditional surface inspection methods, such as scanning electron microscopy. However, angle-resolved scatterometry currently suffers from long data acquisition time. Our study addresses the issue of slow data acquisition by proposing a compressed learning framework for the accurate recognition of nanosurface deficiencies using angle-resolved scatterometry data. The framework uses the particle swarm optimization algorithm with a sampling scheme customized for scattering patterns. This combination allows the identification of optimal sampling points in scatterometry data that maximize the detection accuracy of five different levels of deficiency in ZnO nanosurfaces. The proposed method significantly reduces the amount of sampled data while maintaining a high accuracy in deficiency detection, even in noisy environments. Notably, by sampling only 1% of the data, the method achieves an accuracy of over 88%, which further improves to more than 95%—approaching the 96.4% accuracy achieved with full image classification—when the sampling rate is increased to 7%. These results demonstrate a favorable balance between data reduction and classification performance. The obtained results also show that the compressed learning framework effectively identifies critical sampling areas. The framework was further validated on GaN nanosurfaces, which confirmed that the sampling strategy generalizes effectively across different materials and achieves classification accuracies close to full-image performance."

    "abstract": "Electric vehicles primarily use interior permanent magnet synchronous motors (IPMSMs) as traction motors. Although IPMSMs are powerful and efficient, their neodymium-based permanent magnets are susceptible to demagnetization under high-temperature conditions. Demagnetization weakens the motor and may compromise the overall performance of the vehicle. In severe cases, it may disable the motor entirely or cause accidents such as fires, thereby threatening the safety of the vehicle and its passengers. In addition, demagnetization characteristics can vary with driving conditions. Therefore, this study conducted a demagnetization analysis that considers the driving characteristics of a vehicle operating on the new European driving cycle (NEDC). Because analyzing data across the entire NEDC would be excessively time-consuming, only the starting and maximum-speed points, which are considered the worst-case conditions for demagnetization, were selected for analysis. A coupled electromagnetic and thermal analysis was performed for the selected points as well as the rated operating point to determine the convergence temperatures of the permanent magnets under ambient and high-temperature conditions. Based on the determined convergence temperature, the demagnetization rate, quantified by the reduction in the back electromotive force, was evaluated by varying the current magnitude and angle. Even at the rated operating point and maximum-speed point under high-temperature conditions, where a high current was applied, the demagnetization rate remained within 3%, and no irreversible demagnetization was observed. These findings provide practical insights for designing robust EV traction motors capable of withstanding worst-case thermal and loading conditions."

DTS systems frequently face challenges related to limited spatial resolution and overlapping thermal profiles, significantly impairing accurate event detection and localization in different applications. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel sensor data fusion and pattern recognition approach employing simulated and experimental DTS datasets. Our hybrid DLN extracts intricate features from sensor data, effectively reconstructing temperature profiles with minimal gaps of 0.1 meters between events, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.104 meters. The proposed method demonstrates robust generalization capabilities and high accuracy in real-world industry application scenarios, significantly enhancing the sensor’s data processing capability without necessitating modifications to existing DTS infrastructure. This research provides substantial advancements in soft computing methodologies for sensor data processing, particularly in high-density thermal event detection and classification."

The framework introduces three key innovations: (1) a voxel-based state representation with dynamic ray-traced coverage updates; (2) a dual-objective reward that enforces precise overlap control while minimizing the number of viewpoints; and (3) integration of robotic kinematics to guarantee physically feasible scanning. Experiments on industrial parts demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques in overlap regulation and planning efficiency, enabling more accurate and autonomous 3D reconstruction for complex geometries."

In this study, we present a method that estimates tumor boundaries in RMIS using sweeping palpation data acquired with a single force/torque (F/T) sensor. From the reconstructed surface, tissue displacement and normal force were derived to calculate stiffness, which was then used to construct a stiffness map. To reduce noise and enhance feature representations, we employed a sparse autoencoder (SAE). The SAE outputs were subsequently clustered with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and K-means to segment the tumor from normal tissue. Experiments with phantom models and an ex vivo model demonstrated that the SAE-based approach significantly improved the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and sensitivity while maintaining specificity and reduced the Hausdorff distances (HD and HD95) and average symmetric surface distance (ASSD), compared with results from raw data. Importantly, when evaluated under clinically relevant surgical margin conditions, the estimated HD consistently remained below the threshold across all models. These results indicate that the proposed method achieves both high accuracy and clinical feasibility without additional imaging devices or displacement sensors, highlighting its potential to support margin minimization and organ function preservation in RMIS."

Data were collected from 40 participants whose presentations were evaluated twice: once by a human expert using a rubric with six performance indicators, and once by PowerPoint Coach. Based on the generated reports, five classification models were tested to predict human scores for (1) the attainment level of pitch and speed, and (2) the overall attainment level of the oral presentation. Support Vector Machine achieved the highest accuracy for pitch and speed (87.5%, AUC = 0.848), while Random Forest performed best for overall scores (62.5%, AUC = 0.769). The findings suggest that while certain skills can be predicted with high accuracy, holistic assessment remains challenging. We conclude that either a substantially larger dataset is required to build a more robust predictive model, or that the current PowerPoint Coach dashboard functions more effectively as a rehearsal aid rather than a reliable substitute for objective assessment."

In concrete, using a suite of designed prompts for extracting diverse features, we first use an LLM to generate descriptive texts for both sake and dishes which served to augment information and aid in pairing suggestions. We then feed the generated texts into a Sentence-BERT model to obtain numerical representations of each sake and dish. Furthermore, we build fine-tuned and optimized embedding models using contrastive learning on the numerical representations that capture not only the sake-dish relationship, but also the sake-sake and dish-dish relationships. The proposed framework, which utilized approximately 1000 kinds of sake and 600 kinds of dishes, was evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively via computational experiments and a questionnaire survey, respectively. In the computational evaluation, our model that simultaneously learned all three relationships of sake-dish, sake-sake, and dish-dish achieved the highest scores across multiple metrics among four different variants. Furthermore, the qualitative evaluation confirmed that the top-ranked sake-dish pairings suggested by our model were generally acceptable to the subjects.

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a rapid increase in demand for deep learning inference in embedded systems such as autonomous vehicles and smart devices. In these embedded environments, the challenge is to achieve high-speed processing under constraints such as limited computing resources and power consumption. This paper investigates the performance of CNN inference processing using the RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV) on an embedded RISC-V processor. Considering the computational resource constraints of embedded systems, we implement CNN inference processing using fixed-point arithmetic. In the experiment, we analyze the effect of RVV on improving computational throughput and the effect of memory transfer performance in the overall processing by varying the parameters of vector register length, processor operating frequency, and memory configuration. As a result, we confirmed that performance improves by expanding the vector register length, while the effect of memory bandwidth is small. By comparing with scalar implementations in each processing layer, it was found that RVV vectorization is particularly effective for computationintensive operations such as addition and GEMM. It achieves up to approximately $23 \\times$ speedup, showing that the effect of parallelization varies significantly depending on the processing type."

In conventional QUIC-CYPHONIC, tunnel communication is implemented using QUIC streams with reliability features. As a result, when packet loss occurs in scenarios involving TCP-based applications and QUIC-CYPHONIC, both TCP and QUIC perform retransmission control, leading to redundant retransmissions and a significant reduction in throughput.

However, despite progress in time series forecasting (TSF) models, including transformer-based architectures, these models have not been adequately tested on stock index data, which is inherently noisy and chaotic. To facilitate this challenge, we proposed a hierarchical shifted-window time series transformer (SwinTST), that employs a multi-stage hierarchical strategy and shifted-window attention to effectively model both long-term and shortterm dependencies in time series data. Furthermore, through computing self-attention within local temporal windows, SwinTST achieves linear computational complexity with respect to the input sequence length. Extensive experiments on seven popular datasets show that the proposed SwinTST outperforms state-of-the-art models in time series forecasting. SwinTST achieves an average performance promotion of $\\mathbf{5. 4 \\%}$ and $\\mathbf{1 2. 9 \\%}$ for financial and nonfinancial datasets, respectively.

The model used internet-based learning, drift identification, vulnerability rating, and explainable AI to create dynamic and transparent risk scores. Experimental findings indicated that the proposed methodology was more accurate than the existing methods with 96.8 % accuracy, precision of 0.95, recall of 0.94 and F1-score of 0.945 with a minimum error of MSE of 0.018 and RMSE of 0.134. In the findings, it is emphasized that cybersecurity preparedness cannot be identified using infrastructure alone but must equally be considered through compliance and human factor. The suggested framework will provide a multifaceted model that would assess institutional risk and could be utilized as a core in the implementation of the model in other sectors."

This paper presents the design and simulation of a two-chiplet AES encryption-decryption system communicating over the Bunch-of-Wires (BoW) protocol, into which multiple hardware Trojans from the Trust-Hub benchmark suite were integrated. The inserted Trojans were triggered by rare input conditions and evaluated through functional verification, structural analysis, and switching activity monitoring. A weighted Suspicion Score metric was introduced to unify the results from static inspection, DRC, timing, and switching activity analyses, enabling quantitative risk classification of Trojan presence.

    "abstract": "Computing electromagnetic properties of large-scale finite periodic structures (LFPSs) via the multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA) often suffers from heavy time and memory consumption. The main reason is that complex structures and high-permittivity materials in LFPSs need dense meshes, leading to a prohibitively dense near-field interaction (NFI) matrix. To overcome this drawback, during the MLFMA initialization, each leaf box is enforced to exactly encapsulate an identical periodic structure of the LFPSs with consistent mesh topology and basis function definitions. The NFI matrix can then be divided into several repeatable submatrices, while only those unique ones require computation and storage, thereby reducing the filling time and memory consumption of the NFI matrix by severalfold without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, when the leaf boxes are overcrowded with basis and test functions, the matrix-vector products during the iterative solution are enhanced through dual accelerations: interpolative decomposition (ID) compresses the low-rank NFI matrix, while spherical harmonic expansion (SE) replaces numerical quadrature in <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>-space with spherical harmonic summations for far-field interactions.

The computational workflow under EPA scheme is systematically divided into three dominant processes: matrix filling, LU-based direct solver, and iterative solver. To enhance matrix filling efficiency, a co-processing framework is proposed where the CPU is responsible for partitioning matrices in a block-wise manner by Message Passing Interface (MPI) while intensive computation operations are assigned to heterogeneous accelerators. A loop reduction is also proposed for matrix filling, achieving a peak speedup of 162-fold in matrix filling relative to CPU-only implementations. To solve current on internal BOR, a parallel LU-based direct solver is developed, where matrix operators are delegated to heterogeneous accelerators, including a dual-matrix operator designed for simultaneous inversion of upper/lower matrices, achieving a peak speedup of 150-fold under large-scale datasets. To acquire current solution across the entire solution domain, the generalized minimal residual method (GMRES) is parallelized by a multi-tier reduction framework, where inter-subdomain interaction computations are calculated simultaneously by MPI. A heterogeneous-accelerated matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) operator is designed based on the Fourier-mode characteristics of BoR basis functions, which can achieve a peak speedup of 10-fold under large-scale datasets. Finally, parallelization of parameter sweeping is validated through several simulation and experimental benchmarks."

In particular, we show that there exist piecewise linear continuous functions with a unique global minimum such that their greatest convex minorant is not Turing computable. Furthermore, for these functions there do not even exist monotonically increasing, computable sequences of convex computable continuous functions that converge to the greatest convex minorant. The same results also hold for the least concave majorants of continuous functions."

This paper proposes a neuromorphic controller, inspired by the integrate-and-fire neuronal model, to address this problem. The overall system is modelled as a hybrid system, and we analyse the proposed controller in closed loop with a single-input single-output linear time-invariant plasma model. The controller generates spikes, representing pellet launches, when the neuron variable reaches a certain threshold. Between the control actions, or spikes, the system evolves in open loop. We establish conditions on the controller variables and minimum actuator speed, depending on the reference value for the desired density, the pellet size and the time-constant of the plasma density, that guarantee a practical stability property for the closed-loop system. The results are illustrated in a numerical example."

In this article, we propose a certifiable alignment method for a robot to learn a safety constraint in its model predictive control (MPC) policy with human online directional feedback. To our knowledge, it is the first method to learn safety constraints from human feedback. The proposed method is based on an empirical observation: human directional feedback, when available, tends to guide the robot toward safer regions. The method only requires the direction of human feedback to update the learning hypothesis space. It is certifiable, providing an upper bound on the total number of human feedback in the case of successful learning, or declaring the hypothesis misspecification, i.e., the true implicit safety constraint cannot be found within the specified hypothesis space. We evaluated the proposed method using numerical examples and user studies in two simulation games. Additionally, we implemented and tested the proposed method on a real-world Franka robot arm performing mobile water-pouring tasks. The results demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our method, showing that it enables a robot to successfully learn safety constraints with a small handful (tens) of human directional corrections."

This brief proposes a seamless power and gain transition (SPGT) scheme to achieve smooth transition from AM to SM and competitive conversion efficiency. Besides, the introduced DCM compensation effectively suppresses subharmonic oscillation to address the instability issue during SM operation. The proposed scheme is implemented in a 180 nm BCD process with a core scheme area of 0.07 μm². Test results show seamless transitions both AM-SM and PWM-PFM without any glitches. No subharmonic oscillation is observed during either steady-state or transient operation. The prototype achieves a peak efficiency of 96% and a 30 mV undershoot voltage and a 7 μs settling time under a 0.1-3A load step."

    "abstract": "Deployment of public Electric Vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure in Germany is largely demand-driven, reinforcing spatial inequities by favoring central districts and leaving peripheral areas with higher congestion and reduced access. We address this with a data-driven geospatial optimization pipeline, coupling city-scale analysis with operational policy design. Using recent Federal Network Agency data (Q2 2025), we diagnose Berlin’s network, revealing stark gaps between well-served central and underserved outer districts (e.g., Marzahn-Hellersdorf, Treptow-Kopenick). We implement a multi-objective NSGA-II model in Python to balance coverage and spatial equity, minimizing district-level Gini coefficient of BEVs per charger. This approach yields different Pareto-optimal deployment strategies for planners. For K = 100 new chargers, the equity approach assigns six times more chargers to Treptow-Kopenick than a utilitarian baseline, boosting local access by 21% and reducing the citywide Gini coefficient by 13%. Heatmaps further simulate how policy choices affect Berlin’s equity.

RL implementation is attempted to achieve the \"Defend the Center\" scenario on the VizDoom, a gaming platform. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm is applied to the Stable- Baselines-3 collection, where the agent learns by interacting with the game world. The efficacy of the algorithm is measured based on the performance indices that include survival time, aim accuracy, kills to death ratio and space movement covered.

    "abstract": "Sensor-based gesture recognition technology has been widely applied in human-machine interaction, human-robot interaction, prosthetic control, medical rehabilitation, and other fields. Surface electromyography (sEMG) provides rich information about muscle motion that accurately reflects a user’s motion intention, making sEMG sensors critical for assistive and rehabilitative technologies. Therefore, sEMG-based gesture recognition has received extensive research attention. In this study, we propose a gesture recognition and classification method based on sEMG signals, referred to as ECNN-CS. The method inputs extracted features into an efficient convolutional neural network (ECNN). It incorporates both channel attention (CA) and spatial attention (SA) mechanisms to improve gesture classification at the decision layer. We evaluated ECNN-CS on the official DB4 and DB5 datasets. In the DB4 dataset (sampling frequency 2000Hz), we achieved an accuracy of up to 82.32% across 53 gesture recognition tasks, using a window length of 250ms (corresponding to 500 time steps) and a movement length of 62.5ms (125 time steps). In the DB5 dataset (sampling frequency 200Hz), the window length is 250ms (50 time steps), the movement length is 62.5ms (12 time steps), and the highest accuracy reaches 88.13%. These results demonstrate that ECNN-CS effectively leverages both temporal and spatial features of sEMG signals, achieving excellent performance in gesture recognition tasks and providing a solid foundation for future research and applications."

We consider the challenging case of system identification under adversarial attacks, where the probability of having an attack at each time is Θ(1/k) while the value of the attack is arbitrary. We first show that the ℓ<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</inf>-norm estimator exactly identifies the true Markov parameter matrix for nilpotent systems under any type of attack. We then build on this result to extend it to general systems and show that the estimation error exponentially decays as k grows. The estimated balanced truncation model accordingly shows an exponentially decaying error for the identification of the true system up to a similarity transformation. This work is the first to provide the input-output analysis of the system with partial observations under arbitrary attacks."

    "abstract": "With the continuous expansion of accounting data scale, the traditional single machine processing mode faces the dual challenges of low efficiency and accuracy guarantee. General parallel computing technology is difficult to meet the requirements of accounting data structuring, decimal accuracy, and compliance due to the lack of adaptation to accounting business characteristics. This study aims to solve the problem of efficient and compliant processing of accounting data, and constructs a three-layer parallel processing framework of “data algorithm application”. Three types of accounting specific parallel algorithms are designed: dynamic sharding algorithm based on “account timestamp composite hash” to ensure data correlation and sharding balance, BCD code parallel conversion algorithm to achieve accuracy lossless and efficiency improvement through SIMD instructions and verification pipeline, and double entry bookkeeping parallel verification algorithm relying on incremental tagging and two-level verification to balance compliance and processing speed. Based on Spark and HDFS technology, a parallel processing platform was built, and experimental verification showed that the algorithm's shard balance remained stable at 0.90 or above, the BCD code conversion accuracy reached 100%, and the complex verification time was reduced by more than 70% compared to full processing; The batch processing efficiency of the platform is 3-5 times higher than that of traditional standalone machines, and the real-time verification response time is controlled within 2.3 seconds. The research results indicate that the proposed algorithm and platform can effectively address the adaptation gap of general parallel technology in accounting scenarios, providing technical support and practical solutions for the upgrading of enterprise accounting informatization."

    "abstract": "An interconnection network is an inevitable component in a parallel computer. As parallel programs employ communication as well as computation, and the communication overheads are not negligible, many studies are discussing efficient communication methods. As many parallel programs execute collective communication repetitively, reduction of the communication overhead is strongly required. To solve the problem, this paper discusses an optimization method of collective communication from two viewpoints: distribution of packets and optimization of injection timing. Not a few parallel systems employ a regular network and a deterministic routing algorithm, and also many parallel programs employ regular traffic patterns. This paper tries to discuss packet distribution, following those regular situations. This paper offers preliminary work on an optimization method by combining the two viewpoints. Concretely, we introduce the extended oblivious routing as a practical packet distribution method and also introduce lazy optimization of packet injection timing (Lopit). Our discussion reaches a new communication method called V-Lopit. Preliminary evaluation results show satisfactory improvements in some traffic patterns. The V-Lopit method accelerates the collective communication performance at most 1.78 times from un-optimized conditions and at most $\\mathbf{1. 1 6}$ times from the Lopit method."

The tool provides configurable field mapping, validation diagnostics, and support for media references, enabling linguists to edit data in familiar tabular form and reimport it into FLEx with minimal technical overhead. Evaluation across five Thai lexical resources (110k+ entries) demonstrates consistent structural fidelity, efficient conversion, and successful preservation of media references. A user study with ten participants highlights strong usability and reliability, though challenges remain in handling complex LIFT structures, restricted audio integration, and large-scale corpora. By lowering barriers for non-specialist users and aligning with FAIR data principles, this work establishes a practical pathway for integrating FLEx resources into broader NLP pipelines."

Within this framework, we introduce a novel design methodology based on optimization, where linear matrix inequalities are employed as constraints in a customized minimization problem to guide the selection of suitable parameters for the MHE cost function. The proposed approach is validated through a numerical case study, demonstrating superior performance compared to the conventional Luenberger observer."

Existing dual-stream networks extract modality-specific features but often suffer from over-coupling and insufficient shared identity modeling. Simple feature fusion strategies do not adequately address the modality gap. We propose a ViT-based deep learning framework, termed Transformer-based Decoupled Modality Feature Learning (TDMFL), which effectively learns both modality-specific and modality-shared features while leveraging modality-invariant identity information to decouple different modality representations. Specifically, we first introduce an identity-modality decoupling learning strategy (IMDL) to facilitate learning with reliable modality-shared features while preserving essential modality-specific information. Additionally, we design a novel Identity-Modality Aggregation (IMA) loss function that efficiently integrates modality-specific and modality-shared features, assisting the model in learning more modality-invariant representations from both identity consistency and modality adaptation perspectives. Extensive experiments on the SYSU-MM01, RegDB, and LLCM datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.

    "abstract": "Person re-identification (ReID) aims to match person images of the same identity under different camera views. Conventional ReID models mainly consider a closed-world setting where person identities in query and gallery are exactly the same. However, in real-world applications, query identities and gallery identities usually do not exactly contain the same persons. Therefore, open-world ReID has been proposed to match the images of gallery identities (targets) with a large number of non-gallery identities ( non-targets). Since some non-targets are quite similar to the targets, the ReID model may make incorrect judgments when verifying these non-targets. To solve this problem, we leverage the impressive cross-modal matching capabilities of the large vision-language model (VLM) to construct <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</b>egative <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">S</b>emantic guided identity boundaries for each person to develop the open-world <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ReID</b> model (NS-ReID). To construct the identity boundary, we propose Virtual Non-target Repulsion that utilizes negative semantics to prompt the ReID model to push virtual non-targets away from the targets. The prompts expressing negative semantics offer a different perspective to guide the training process to avoid contradictory optimization. Moreover, we propose the Dual-Boost Refinement Learning strategy to train learnable identity prompts to capture detailed identity information, which is essential for constructing the identity boundary since the variations among identities are comparatively small. These facilitate the model in constructing the wide identity boundary of each person. Extensive experiments on two benchmark ReID datasets demonstrate that our proposed NS-ReID achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing methods."

A robust sliding mode control (RSMC) strategy based on a load torque observer is proposed in this paper in order to improve the dynamic performance of the VGRMGM. A sliding mode speed controller and a torque observer for feedforward compensation in the current loop, is employed to improve the robustness and dynamic performance of the VGRMGM. Under speed-regulation conditions, the RSMC strategy achieves a 6% reduction in overshoot and a 25.4% improvement in response speed compared with conventional PI control. For load-variation conditions, the overshoot is reduced by 5%, and the response speed is improved by 32.1%, highlighting the VGRMGM superior transient performance. Experimental evaluations on a purpose-built test rig validate the enhancement of the RSMC strategy in terms of improved dynamic performance."

Experiments show that the proposed metric accurately quantifies the complementarity between wind and solar generation and load demand, effectively capturing the temporal patterns of the net load fluctuations. Incorporating the optimized complementarity metric into day-ahead scheduling enables the system to achieve better load matching, reduced regulation pressure on conventional units, and higher overall system flexibility."

The complex and diverse multimodal content elements in dynamic livestreaming scene pose a great challenge to video content understanding.

We propose a heterogeneous multimodal state space network (HMS<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>Net) for dynamic scene classification in livestreaming via CLIP.

    "abstract": "Image inpainting represents a fundamental and challenging problem in computer vision, requiring the synthesis of visually plausible content for missing regions while preserving both textural details and structural coherence. While current approaches employ auxiliary networks and attention mechanisms to capture structural priors and expand receptive fields, they remain constrained by two fundamental limitations: (1) insufficient interaction between textural and structural priors, and (2) the quadratic computational complexity inherent in attention operations. To overcome these challenges, we present DESSM, an innovative Dual Encoder-based State space Model for image inpainting that achieves efficient global context modeling with linear computational complexity. Our DESSM integrates three synergistically designed modules: (1) a dual-branch encoder for complementary learning of textural patterns and structural priors, (2) a Feature Cross Fusion Block (FCFB) enabling dynamic feature interaction while adaptively suppressing redundant information, and (3) a Spatial-Channel joint Selective scan Block (SCSB) for efficient long-range dependency modeling. Comprehensive evaluations across four standard benchmarks (i.e., CelebA, CelebA-HQ, Places2, and Paris StreetView) demonstrate that our DESSM achieves state-of-the-art performance in both visual fidelity and computational efficiency."

    "abstract": "The integration of model predictive control (MPC) and direct torque control (DTC) has become an attractive solution for high performance torque regulation in fault-tolerant permanent magnet rim driven motor (FTPM-RDM). The motor features a unique independent H-bridge inverter topology with spatially decoupled windings, which provides inherent fault tolerance but also poses challenges due to its large voltage vector space. Traditional model predictive torque control (MPTC) with voltage vector preselection requires repeated screening of all candidates, resulting in high computational complexity and limited adaptability under faulted conditions. This paper proposes a reverse-prediction-based MPTC strategy that derives the required voltage vector amplitude and angle in real time and dynamically reconstructs the feasible set. By doing so, it avoids static lookup tables and reduces the number of candidate vectors from 61 to typically 2-3, achieving a 57% reduction in execution time. Under single-phase open-circuit faults, the strategy reconstructs the voltage vector space using only the healthy phases, thereby suppressing torque ripple and ensuring rapid recovery. Experimental validation verifies the superior performance of the proposed method: it reduces computation time to 31 μs, ensuring real-time operation within the 100 μs control period, and under fault conditions, it achieves recovery within 0.26 s while cutting torque ripple to 11.27%, compared with 25.96% without the proposed strategy. These results confirm that the proposed control strategy combines improved computational efficiency with robust fault-tolerant performance, offering clear advantages over traditional MPTC."

Ground-penetrating radar (GPR), a non-destructive detection technique, provides high-resolution subsurface imaging; however, accurately interpreting rock echoes remains challenging due to signal interference. This study proposes a novel instance segmentation framework to accurately identify echo features of small rocks in GPR images. Specifically, the ConvNeXt architecture is adopted as the backbone network to enhance the extraction of global contextual features. Furthermore, an optimized Hybrid Task Cascade head is introduced to strengthen joint learning across multi-stage detection and segmentation tasks, substantially boosting model performance in complex scenarios with overlapping hyperbolic signatures. A hybrid localization strategy that integrates the least-squares hyperbolic fitting with a fully connected neural network is developed to achieve precise regression of rock spatial positions. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and field datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a precision of 94.3% and a recall of 94.8%, with horizontal localization errors typically below 2.5 cm and depth errors generally under 5%. The methodology offers valuable technical support for optimizing drilling path planning in future lunar exploration missions."

    "abstract": "Optical networks aim to achieve a higher rate per channel and larger capacity per fiber while lowering the cost per bit. Ultra-wide band (UWB) wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) over single-mode fibers has been widely studied, particularly in the S+C+L-band. However, inter-channel stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS) imposes scalability challenges and limits system capacity. Anti-resonant hollow-core fiber (AR-HCF) emerges as a promising transmission medium for UWB systems due to its ultra-low nonlinearity. The air-guiding mechanism not only brings ultra-low loss but also results in ultra-low Rayleigh backscattering, allowing for direction to be treated as an independent dimension. In this paper, we leverage these advantages to enhance the fiber capacity, demonstrating co-frequency co-time full-duplex (CCFD) S+C+L-band WDM transmission over 100 km AR-HCF to highlight its potential. Since the capacity is primarily constrained by optical/electrical components rather than AR-HCF itself, we employed multiple strategies, including a homemade high-power S-band integrable tunable laser assembly (ITLA) and optical domain equalization (OEQ) to improve the performance of coherent transceivers. It is important to note that gas absorption, as an extrinsic factor, has caused significant impairments in certain channels, which can be partially mitigated by conventional digital signal processing (DSP) techniques. With all these efforts, the capacity of one direction was experimentally measured to be 188.8 Tb/s under a bidirectional transmission configuration, corresponding to an equivalent aggregate bidirectional capacity of 377.6 Tb/s over 100-km AR-HCF. The result underscores the advantages of AR-HCF for ultra-wideband bidirectional transmission."

    "abstract": "Physiological signs are key indicators of cardiovascular health, which can be estimated using remote photoplethysmography. Their estimations in dark environments are particularly important, where infrared based methods were predominantly applied, since they are illumination resistant. However, the extracted signals have poor pulsatile strength with low signal-to-noise ratio, eventually resulting in spurious estimates. Conversely, RGB based methods exhibits stronger pulsatile strength, but hindered by poor illumination. To overcome these limitations, we propose 2E1D-Net, trained using a self-created database acquired in a dark environment with marginal illuminance ≤ 1 lux. It comprises dual encoders that take paired input images captured at different exposure levels, and project them to a latent. The decoder then, elevates the noise (darkness) component from the dark image, followed by multiscale feature fusion, to produce enhanced images. 2E1D-Net was trained using a linear combination of multiscale structured-similarity-index, L1 and L2 losses, respectively. Subsequently, RGB heart rate and oxygen saturation methods cascaded to trained 2E1D-Net, were tested on self-created and public databases. Experimental results proved the superiority of 2E1D-Net, over state-of-the-art, which ensured the extended ability of RGB methods for physiological measurements in dark, thereby proposing RGB as reliable and clinically relevant alternative to infrared methods without performance compromise."

Because this work is a complete overview of the techniques that are most commonly used in the most common software development paradigms (such as Procedural, Object-Oriented, Component-Based Systems and Hybrid Systems) both historically and contemporarily, this study provides a complete overview of traditional and contemporary techniques of software maintainability prediction. Through the synthesis of current literature on methodology, metrics/prediction criteria, and results, studies were classified according to the type of technique used. Traditional techniques included empirically-based models, statistical regression, and metric-based techniques, while the primary attributes measured in these studies included modularity, readability, and traceability. Modern techniques utilize the soft computing paradigm including GWO-GA-NeuroFuzzy systems, and other hybrid models, such as FLANNGA, to increase both the accuracy and flexibility of software maintainability predictions. All of the research focused on key performance measures (MMRE, RMSE, MAE, SEM), and tools (Classic-Ada, CKJM) as well as the data sets (QUES, UIMS, OSS) used by each study. In addition to reviewing all of the research, the trend toward using AI-based predictive models, which have been validated through strict validation methods (i.e., <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$k$</tex>-fold or leave-one-out cross-validation), and have shown the ability to capture the dynamic aspects of maintainability (e.g., code complexity, design deficiencies, software obsolescence), was of particular interest. These findings have shown that although past methodologies were a good base for soft computing techniques to be applied; they improved forecast accuracy as well as the ability to scale up the forecasting process. Research in the future could focus on: applying soft computing methodologies to develop real-time forecasts of maintainability, automating the extraction of metrics, and developing intelligent solutions for specific domains."

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) can enhance artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) networks by providing efficient sensing and transmission. Existing AIGC services usually assume that the accuracy of the generated content can be ensured, given accurate input data (e.g., pose image) and command (i.e., prompt), thus only the content generation quality (CGQ) is concerned. However, it is not applicable in ISAC-based AIGC networks, where content generation is based on inaccurate sensed data. Moreover, the AIGC model itself introduces generation errors, which depend on the number of generating steps (i.e., computing resources). Thus, to assess the quality of experience (QoE) of ISAC-based AIGC services, this paper proposes a content accuracy and quality aware service assessment metric (CAQA). Since allocating more resources to sensing and generating improves content accuracy but may reduce communication quality, and vice versa, this sensing-generating (computing)-communication three-dimensional resource tradeoff must be optimized to maximize the average CAQA (AvgCAQA) across all users with AIGC (CAQA-AIGC). This problem is NP-hard, with a large solution space that grows exponentially with the number of users. To solve the CAQA-AIGC problem with low complexity, a standard linear programming (LP) guided deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm with an action filter (LPDRL-F) is proposed. Through the LP-guided approach and the action filter, LPDRL-F can transform the original three-dimensional solution space to two dimensions, reducing complexity while improving the learning performance of DRL. Simulations show that compared to existing DRL and generative diffusion model (GDM) algorithms without LP, LPDRL-F converges faster and finds better resource allocation solutions, thus improving AvgCAQA by more than 10%. With LPDRL-F, CAQA-AIGC can achieve an improvement in AvgCAQA of more than 50% compared to existing schemes focusing solely on CGQ."

However, most existing methods construct a consensus anchor graph based solely on view-level contributions, overlooking the varying importance of individual samples across different views. Moreover, these methods fail to ensure that anchors are evenly distributed across clusters. Thus, we propose a novel and scalable multi-view clustering method, called Sample-Level Weighted and Structure-Enhanced Anchor Graph Learning for Scalable Multi-View Clustering (SLWSE-AGL). Specifically, we introduce a sample-level weighting mechanism based on anchor self-representation learning, enabling the constructed consensus anchor graph to capture the varying importance of samples in different views. Additionally, we incorporate a structure-enhancement constraint to encourage the learned anchors to be more evenly distributed among clusters, leading to more balanced and meaningful cluster partitions. Furthermore, we employ an anchor-to-sample label propagation mechanism that directly yields the final clustering results, thereby avoiding the information loss associated with the two-stage clustering processes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art multi-view clustering approaches.

However, most current detectors only explore rotation-invariant feature extraction but disregard the valuable spatial and semantic prior knowledge in remote sensing images (RSIs), which limits the detection performance when encountering blurred or heavy occluded objects. To address this issue, we propose a mask-reconstruction relation learning (MRRL) framework to learn such prior knowledge among objects and a consistency-reasoning transformer over relation proposals (CTRP) to recognize objects with limited visual features via consistency reasoning. Specifically, MRRL framework applies random mask to some objects in the training dataset and performs masked objects reconstruction to guide the network to learn the distribution consistency of objects. CTRP is the core component of the MRRL framework, which models the interaction between spatial and semantic priors, and uses easy detected objects to reason hard detected objects. The trained CTRP can be integrated into the existing detector to improve the ability of object detection with limited visual features in RSIs. Extensive experiments on widely-used datasets for two distinct tasks, namely remote sensing object detection task and occluded object detection task, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

This paper develops a distributed asymptotically optimal consensus controller by designing a novel type of observer and feed-forward controller. The proposed controller is obtained by solving Riccati equations, and it is a unified design framework for solving the consensus problem for heterogeneous and homogeneous systems. Moreover, the convergence speed under the proposed distributed asymptotically optimal controller is proved to be faster than those of traditional methods.

Despite notable progress, the accuracy of electroencephalography (EEG) decoding remains constrained by pronounced intersubject physiological variability. Domain generalization (DG) methods offer a feasible solution as they do not require target subject data during training. However, existing DG approaches are limited by insufficient modeling of temporal dependencies, inadequate exploitation of feature diversity, and overly simplistic training strategies. To address these issues, we propose a novel temporal generation (TGen) component that integrates a temporal convolutional network with a variational autoencoder to capture temporal dependencies in EEG signals. It employs a dual-branch design combining random convolutions with covariance regularization to enhance feature diversity. Building upon TGen, we further construct the DG model, named DG-MTLNet, by incorporating cross electrode convolution and multitask learning. Evaluations on the public BCI competition IV datasets 2a and 2b, the large-scale public datasets OpenBMI and EDSP, and the diverse dataset MI-GS, demonstrate that DG-MTLNet outperforms the best baseline models, achieving mean accuracy improvements of 2.50%, 3.11%, 3.23%, 1.54%, and 3.47%, respectively."

This paper extends semantic communication to doubly selective channel scenarios, addressing the challenges of time-varying and frequency-selective fading. Inspired by the noise resilience of semantic transmission and the principle of semantic inequality, a superimposed pilot design method is proposed for semantic transmission over doubly selective channels. An optimization problem is theoretically analyzed to determine the optimal power allocation ratio between pilot and semantic data symbols under channel estimation errors in doubly selective channels, without considering semantic importance. This analysis provides insights into pilot power and coherence time, serving as a benchmark for semantic performance optimization. Additionally, considering semantic symbol inequality, a suite of deep learning-based models including semantic interleaving, power adaptation, and channel compensation are designed to enable unequal power allocation that prioritizes important semantic symbols, maximizing semantic performance. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of this method, demonstrating substantial improvements in transmission quality over traditional orthogonal pilot schemes in doubly selective channels, particularly under low SNR conditions. Execution time analysis further highlights the computational efficiency of this approach, achieving a favorable balance between performance and complexity."

    "abstract": "Network centrality is a foundational concept for quantifying the importance of nodes within a network. Many traditional centrality measures—such as degree and between-ness centrality—are purely structural and often overlook the dynamics that unfold across the network. However, the notion of a node’s importance is inherently context-dependent and must reflect both the system’s dynamics and the specific objectives guiding its operation. Motivated by this perspective, we propose a dynamic, task-aware centrality framework rooted in optimal control theory. By formulating a problem on minimum energy control of average opinion based on Laplacian dynamics and focusing on the variance of terminal state, we introduce a novel centrality measure—termed U-centrality —that quantifies a node’s ability to unify the agents’ state. We demonstrate that U-centrality interpolates between known measures: it aligns with degree centrality in the short-time horizon and converges to a new centrality over longer time scales which is closely related to current-flow closeness centrality. This work bridges structural and dynamical approaches to centrality, offering a principled, versatile tool for network analysis in dynamic environments."

However, zero-valued coefficients, which constitute the majority of DCT coefficients, are more suitable for data embedding to reduce the shift distortion. To efficiently utilize zero-valued coefficients for high-capacity embedding while controlling the file size increment, this paper introduces a novel JPEG RDH method based on ternary matrix embedding, where ternary syndrome trellis codes (STC) is employed on selected zero-valued coefficients to minimize the expansion embedding distortion, and other non-zero-valued coefficients are shifted for reversibility. Furthermore, a novel DCT coefficients measurement strategy is proposed for coefficient selection to further reduce the shift distortion. Extensive experimental validations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in various evaluation criteria.

    "abstract": "A resonant push-pull converter is proposed in this paper, which can achieve Zero Current Switching (ZCS) and Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS), used in Travelling-wave Tube Amplifier (TWTA) high voltage applications. The proposed resonant push-pull converters can effectively utilize the transformer’s parasitic capacitor as the parallel resonant capacitor, its leakage inductance as the series resonant inductor, and its magnetizing inductance as the parallel resonant inductor, requiring only an additional capacitor as the resonant capacitor. Therefore, the proposed resonant push-pull power converters have the advantage of a simple structure and fewer components. In addition, due to the use of only two switches with ZVS and ZCS, the turn-on and turn-off losses of switches are lower. The working principles of the resonant push-pull power converter are explained. On this basis, the key parametric equations are deduced. A resonant push-pull converter with 21V/6800V, 55 kHz, 120 W, and 97.27% efficiency was built to validate the analysis and superiority."

    "abstract": "Reversely switched dynistor is a two-terminal semiconductor switch with high critical current rising rate and peak current, and is triggered by the reverse pre-charge current. To generate the reverse current, a magnetic switch is used to block the main capacitor discharge during pre-charge. The complex trigger circuit with the magnetic switch serves as the most important factor to limit the widespread application of RSD in high-voltage occasions. Typically, to keep the blocking time (saturation time) within proper range for triggering RSD at high voltages, the size or the winding turns of the magnetic switch needs to be increased to increase the voltage-time product, leading to higher weight and saturated inductance. In this study, the pre-charge time increasing circuit of RSD without changing the voltage and without increasing the size or winding turns of the magnetic switch is proposed. By adding an auxiliary winding, the pre-charge time and the equivalent voltage-time product of a magnetic switch have been increased by up to 20.8%. This study decreases the size and saturated inductance of magnetic switch at high voltages and is favorable for the application of RSD in pulsed power field."

This paper proposes a differential Y-factor OTA NF measurement method using a tunable photonic terahertz noise source with high excess noise ratio (ENR). The method eliminates the need for ENR calibration and ensures sufficient excitation power for OTA measurements under high-loss conditions. To further enhance accuracy, a dynamic gain calibration technique is introduced to address distance-related gain variation, enabling consistent NF measurements in both near-field and far-field scenarios. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through measurements on a D-band (110–170 GHz) AIA. The NF measurement results show strong agreement with conducted reference values and consistent performance across different measurement distances."

In this paper, multiphoton microscopy and digital pathological imaging analysis were conducted to examine the treatment-driven microenvironment changes among 51 samples with only underwent surgical resection (SG), 49 samples with good pathological reactions (GR) and 34 samples with poor pathological reactions (PR). The results showed that treatment caused the elastic fiber to remodel in the arterioles and led the vascular walls to thicken, which might be related to drug delivery but not to the therapeutic effect. After neoadjuvant therapy, the collagen fibers in the stromal regions immediately adjacent to the tumor mass were degraded, which was a good response to treatment. In the GR group but not the PR group, although neoadjuvant therapy caused significant regression of the tumor mass, some more aggressive subclones of tumor cells were screened out, characterized by rounder nuclear shape, and smaller smoothness, with looser nuclear structure and enlarged nucleoli. In addition, stromal fibrosis also can be observed in the GR group, manifested by the more deposition of collagen fibers, longer and wider collagen fibers, and more orderly arrangement of collagen fibers existing in the stromal regions at 200 μm from the tumor mass after treatment. Correlation analysis showed that the degradation of collagen fibers adjacent to the tumor mass, nuclear morphology of the residual cells, and stromal fibrosis were significantly correlated with therapeutic efficacy."

    "abstract": "Single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) pixel scaling is essential to meet the increasing demands for high-resolution, compact, and power-efficient time-of-flight (ToF) sensing. In particular, the 3D-stacked approach enables aggressive pixel scaling by separating the SPAD and readout circuits into different wafers, thus maximizing the fill factor while minimizing the pixel pitch. However, pixel miniaturization often leads to degraded SPAD performance due to the premature edge breakdown (PEB) and the reduced number of photon-generated carriers that go through the avalanche multiplication region. In this work, we overcome these challenges by optimizing the doping profile to enhance the carrier collection in the device. We present a detailed analysis of the optimization progress by evaluating breakdown voltage (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">V<sub>B</sub></i>), dark count rate (DCR), and photon detection probability (PDP), highlighting the trade-offs and recovery achieved through successive doping refinements. The optimized device achieves a PDP of 37% and a timing jitter of 85 ps at 940 nm. Compared to prior 3D-stacked back-illuminated (BI) SPADs, our work exhibits one of the smallest pixel pitches to date, yet retains competitive PDP and jitter characteristics. This combination of aggressive scaling and robust performance positions the proposed SPAD as a promising solution for LiDAR, 3D imaging, and future wearable sensing systems."

To overcome this limitation, we propose a High-Frequency Feature-Oriented Network (HFFO-Net). First, we introduce the Channel- wise Frequency Modulation Module (CFMM), which leverages the 2D Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to accentuate salient frequency components while mitigating noise interference. Second, we design a High-Frequency Oriented Module (HFOM), which utilizes the Channel Selection Branch (CSB) and Spatial Selection Branch (SSB) to highlight small objects in the channel and spatial region. Third, we introduce a Dual-Query Attention Fusion Mechanism (DQAFM), which reduces the semantic gap between spatial and frequency features and achieves better feature fusion through bidirectional cross-attention. Extensive experiments are implemented, and the corresponding results demonstrate that HFFO-Net excels at detecting small objects."

Due to the presence of targets with various scales in the change detection scenes, existing methods have designed multi-scale encoders to extract change information at different scales. However, these methods do not directly enhance or enrich high-frequency features, resulting in persistent blurry change boundaries. To address this issue, we propose a multi-scale enhanced change detection method based on detail supplementation, dubbed MEDS-CD. It designs a multi-scale edge-guided adaptive filter to extract high-frequency information and compensate for multi-scale features. Specifically, a multi-scale transformer encoder is employed to extract multi-scale features. To capture high-frequency details lost during the encoding process, a multi-scale edge-guided adaptive filter is introduced to extract high-frequency details. Furthermore, to fully exploit the restored high-frequency information for change extraction and edge enhancement, we propose a multi-scale convolution modulation module and a fuzzy weighting strategy. Finally, the above process is supervised by a hybrid loss function. The proposed method MEDS-CD is validated on three public datasets, LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD and SYSU-CD. The experimental results show that MEDS-CD achieves better segmentation performance."

To address these issues, we introduce a deep linguistic representation learner pretrained with linguistic features to learn deep linguistic representations in a supervised way, and suggest a contrastive information bottleneck fusion module to simultaneously fuse the intra-text deep features with an information bottleneck module in a self-supervised way and learn the inter-text deep representation via the contrastive learning. We conduct a series of experiments on five benchmark datasets, which show the superior performance of the proposed model compared to state-of-the-art models and verify the effectiveness of the introduced modules. In particular, the introduced deep linguistic representation learner has much better representation ability than both raw and existing deep linguistic representations."

A new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is constructed to perform the convergence analysis of the designed algorithm, and it is proved that the actions of all players globally exponentially converge to the Nash equilibrium.

Based on the conceptual design (CD), the TBM and HCS have been refined to ensure component manufacturability, and the safety analysis has been correspondingly updated. In this article, the loss of flow accident (LOFA) is simulated. The simulation is performed using the RELAP5 MOD3.4. Furthermore, a specific thermal radiation model is incorporated for parametric analysis. Six different cases are chosen to investigate the effect of the shutdown time of fusion power on the first wall temperature, the effect of natural circulation in the primary loop, and the feasibility of the removal of decay heat by thermal radiation after LOFA. The study provides a scientific basis for the design of the safety instrument control system of China HCS, in particular, the safety characteristics in the case of an LOFA. The results demonstrate that plasma power must be stopped immediately after this accident occurs, but the stopping method can be relatively moderate. Both fast and normal fusion power stops are satisfactory, and the temperature of the first wall structure material remains within the design temperature range. The natural circulation is effective in removing decay heat from the primary loop during this accident, and the thermal radiation is helpful for decay heat removal after the accident, particularly on the first wall structure."

    "abstract": "Molecular sequence analysis is crucial for understanding several biological processes, including protein-protein interactions, functional annotation, and disease classification. The large number of sequences and the inherently complicated nature of protein structures make it challenging to analyze such data. Finding patterns and enhancing subsequent research requires the use of dimensionality reduction and feature selection approaches. Recently, a method called Correlated Clustering and Projection (CCP) has been proposed as an effective method for biological sequencing data. The CCP technique remains computationally expensive, despite its effectiveness for sequence visualization. Furthermore, its utility for classifying molecular sequences is still uncertain. To solve these two problems, we present a Nearest-Neighbor Correlated Clustering and Projection (CCP-NN)-based technique for efficiently preprocessing molecular sequence data. To group related molecular sequences and produce representative supersequences, CCP makes use of sequence-to-sequence correlations. As opposed to conventional methods, CCP does not rely on matrix diagonalization, therefore, it can be applied to a range of machine-learning problems. We estimate the density map and compute the correlation using a nearest-neighbor search technique. We perform a molecular sequence classification using CCP and CCP-NN representations to assess the efficacy of our proposed approach. Our findings show that CCP-NN considerably improves the accuracy of the classification task and significantly outperforms CCP in terms of computational runtime."

As a result, managing these devices and services has become increasingly important, drawing attention to tools and systems such as IT Asset Management (ITAM), Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), and Attack Surface Management (ASM). However, each system sees only part of the overall IT environment, making it hard to detect shadow IT or respond quickly.To address these challenges, we propose a \"three-way reconciliation matrix\" that cross-validates asset records from ITAM, EDR, and ASM to reveal inconsistencies and uncover unmanaged or shadow IT assets. Based on this matrix, we also propose a new AI agent-based ITAM system that automates IT asset classification, notification, and reporting tasks. We evaluate the proposed system in a simulated enterprise environment. The results show that our approach improves asset visibility, reduces unnecessary notifications, and achieves approximately 95% classification accuracy. These findings suggest that our proposed system can reduce operational workload while maintaining governance and security."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses a novel optimal supervisory control problem for reachability tasks in partially-known discrete-event systems (DES). We consider a setting where the supervisor lacks prior knowledge of feasible events in certain states and must discover this information by visiting them. To assess performance in this context, we study regret as a metric that quantifies the difference between the actual cost incurred and the optimal cost achievable with full knowledge. We formalize this problem and propose the algorithm to compute an optimal supervisor that guarantees reachability while minimizing regret. Our results demonstrate that regret serves as a meaningful performance measure for supervisory control in partially-known DES, and our method is both correct and effective in practice."

    "abstract": "Surface defects alter the intrinsic texture characteristics, resulting in more complex and random patterns that vary significantly in scale across different types of patterns. This necessitates the use of different receptive fields. To address this challenge, a novel lightweight model is introduced. Specifically, a scale-matched block (SMBlock) is proposed, designed to adaptively adjust the desired receptive fields of stacked convolutions, thereby preventing the loss of orientation information. Additionally, heterogeneous convolution is employed to capture multi-scale features at various stages, preserving the texture details of small targets while simultaneously capturing large-scale information. Furthermore, a tripartite fusion module (TFM) is introduced to integrate features from neighboring layers, mitigating spatial misalignment. Extensive experiments on the GC10-DET and NEU-DET surface defect datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving improvements of 3.1% and 2.9%, respectively, over the baseline. The algorithm also outperforms the baseline in detecting minimal-sized defects. The code is made available at https://github.com/HL-Louis/LSRF-YOLO."

In parallel, the number of people with dementia is increasing, raising the importance of early detection and robust screening methods. To address these challenges, we developed the tablet-based drawing test app EVIDENT. In this study, we propose an early screening method for cognitive decline using drawing-process data from the Clock Drawing Test (CDT) and the Cube Copying Test (CCT) collected with these apps. Specifically, we build machine learning models that use process features as explanatory variables and scoring results as target variables. We also perform clustering of the drawing-process data to reveal drawing-process patterns in participants with cognitive decline and to summarize their characteristics. Through evaluation experiments, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed models and extract process features that contribute to early screening. These results suggest that our approach can serve as a basis for supporting early detection in real-world operations, including group testing, while reducing burden at the point of care. In future work, we will expand the dataset, further improve screening accuracy, and pursue applications to diagnostic support integrated with EVIDENT."

The objective is to design a boundary heat flux control to stabilize the moving boundary at a desired setpoint, with satisfying the required conditions of the model on PDE state and the moving boundary. We apply a PDE backstepping method for the control design with considering a constraint on the control law. The PDE and moving boundary constraints are shown to be satisfied by applying the maximum principle for parabolic PDEs. Then the closed-loop system is shown to be globally exponentially stable by performing Lyapunov analysis. The proposed control is implemented in numerical simulation, which illustrates the desired performance in safety and stability. An outline of the extension to third-order moving boundary dynamics is also presented. Code is released at https://github.com/shumon0423/HighOrderStefan_CDC2025.git."

    "abstract": "The demand for high-performance computing (HPC) has been rapidly increasing with the advancement of scientific computing and AI workloads. During peak periods, resource contention often leads to prolonged job waiting times. Cloud Bursting (CB), which elastically extends on-premises resources with on-demand cloud instances, has emerged as a practical solution. However, CB introduces a trade-off between job waiting times and minimizing cloud costs. Effectively balancing these conflicting objectives remains a major challenge. Conventional approaches based on weighted scalarization singleobjective reinforcement learning tend to bias optimization toward one objective, resulting in poor coverage of the Pareto Front (PF). In this study, we apply a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework, Pareto Conditioned Networks (PCN), to HPC job scheduling for preserving the trade-off structure between job waiting time and cloud cost. Through simulation experiments conducted under four different settings that vary the number of jobs and the node size of each resource, PCN consistently outperformed conventional methods. PCN achieved approximately 43% improvement over competing approaches in terms of hypervolume (HV), which measures both the extent and the quality of the obtained PF. Furthermore, PCN maintained lower values of the spacing metric, which evaluates the uniformity of PF distribution. By offering a broader and evenly distributed PF, PCN provides HPC system operators with greater flexibility in adaptively selecting trade-offs according to operational requirements."

To address this issue, they employed Homomorphic Linear Transformation (HLT) to achieve further efficiency gains for nonlinear bivariate functions. These two approaches represent the current state-of-the-art for this task under the BFV scheme.In this work, we present a further improved algorithm for evaluating arbitrary non-linear bivariate functions using the BFV scheme. We implemented our scheme and the two prior works in OpenFHE under identical computational settings and parameter configurations. Experimental results show that our method achieves a 10-15% performance improvement over the current state-of-the-art.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we expand the Bayesian persuasion framework to account for unobserved confounding variables in sender-receiver interactions. While traditional models typically assume that belief updates follow Bayesian principles, real-world scenarios often involve hidden variables that impact the receiver’s belief formation and decision-making. We conceptualize this as a sequential decision-making problem, where the sender and receiver interact over multiple rounds. In each round, the sender communicates with the receiver, who also interacts with the environment. Crucially, the receiver’s belief update is affected by an unobserved confounding variable. By reformulating this scenario as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), we capture the sender’s incomplete information regarding both the dynamics of the receiver’s beliefs and the unobserved confounder. We prove that finding an optimal observation-based policy in this POMDP is equivalent to solving for an optimal signaling strategy in the original persuasion framework. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this reformulation facilitates the application of proximal learning for off-policy evaluation (OPE) in the persuasion process. This advancement enables the sender to evaluate alternative signaling strategies using only observational data from a behavioral policy, thus eliminating the necessity for costly new experiments."

A tracking error function is defined on a general smooth manifold for measuring the error between the configurations of two interacting agents. The stability of the desired consensus equilibrium is proved using a generalized version of Lyapunov theory and LaSalle’s invariance principle applicable for systems evolving on a smooth manifold. The formulated consensus control law utilizes both the configuration and the velocity information from neighboring agents. The design of tracking error function and consensus control inputs are demonstrated through an application of attitude consensus problem for multiple communicating rigid bodies. The consensus algorithm is numerically validated by demonstrating the attitude consensus problem."

In particular, we use a dataset of games with parameters coming from a certain distribution (e.g., uniformly random player locations). We then train a deep neural network (DNN) where the input is the local measurement available to the player and the output is the reward parameters that best approximate the global objective. We demonstrate our approach for two classes of games: energy games and wireless power control games.

However, these queue length related methods often suffer from delayed detection and high error rates. In this study, we propose a distributed incast detection method for data center networks at the switch-level, leveraging a probabilistic hypothesis test with an optimal detection threshold.

Strong scene understanding and real-time feedback are necessary for safety assurance and independence; however, the majority of available assistive technologies experience high cost, poor contextual awareness, and poor performance in complex outdoor environments. To overcome these constraints, this paper introduces a cost-effective, real-time assistive navigation system that combines edge–cloud computing with vision–language modeling (VLM) for descriptive, multilingual audio output. The envisioned system utilizes a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W as the camera to capture images and send visual information to a cloud server hosting an enhanced Bootstrapped Language–Image Pretraining (BLIP) model. The BLIP model is fine-tuned with a new three-stage Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning method and learned on a proprietary dataset of 427 labeled Indian traffic scenes. Compared to existing assistive navigation systems they are primarily depending upon object detection or GPS cues, our system novel approach integrates a fine-tuned Vision-Language Model (BLIP + LoRA) based on Indian traffic conditions, achieving a 15.6% average improvement across BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and semantic similarity metrics,while holding inference latency under 2000 milliseconds. By integrating effective edge hardware with cloud intelligence, the suggested system provides scalable, accessible, and context-aware navigation assistance, which helps visually impaired users to move around urban spaces with higher safety and independence."

Continual learning extends personalization to multiple concepts through long sequence training, resulting in more practical applications. However, the continual learning approach causes the following trade-off problems: reduced stability for previously learned concepts as the number of concepts increases, and reduced plasticity by maintaining the performance of past concepts. In this study, we propose a continual learning approach for personalization that maintains high-performance image generation across multiple concepts while learning new targets. Our method leverages deep generative replay with latent variables to balance the past and new concepts, demonstrating that replay in the latent space effectively suppresses performance degradation. Furthermore, by integrating a sub-model with each layer of the latent diffusion model through the conditional input of latent variables, the proposed method achieves robust personalization for diverse concepts. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method, which is optimized for many concepts, achieves superior performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods specialized for a few concepts. In addition, in the context of continual learning, we demonstrate that the proposed method effectively mitigates performance degradation for previously learned concepts, indicating its potential for realistic image generation applications involving long-tail scenarios."

Existing trust models for edge computing, such as lightweight estimation approaches or blockchain-based collaborative schemes, address important aspects of trust computation but remain limited by the lack of contextual reasoning, insufficient robustness to advanced attacks, or the absence of integration within decision-making mechanisms such as cooperative orchestration or task migration. To fill this gap, we introduce DyTrust, a dynamic and context-aware trust model that combines behavioural analytics, anomaly detection, and trust-aware orchestration to enhance secure collaboration among edge nodes. DyTrust supports resistance to on–off behaviour, collusion, Sybil-like manipulations, and poisoning in distributed learning. We integrate DyTrust into a trust-aware, many-objective formulation of service placement and migration that balances latency, energy, migration cost, and trust; the search is solved with NSGA-III using reference-point selection. An implementation in iFogSim2 evaluates distributed DNN inference and federated learning workloads under realistic mobility and network conditions, with attack scenarios for recommender collusion and federated backdoors. The simulations show that DyTrust yields consistently stronger Pareto fronts (higher hypervolume, lower IGD), higher trust satisfaction at comparable QoS, and improved robustness to adversarial dynamics, while imposing modest control-plane overhead.We discuss limitations and outline directions for risk-aware objectives, privacy-preserving evidence gathering, and hardware-in-the-loop validation."

    "abstract": "Background: Software contracts are legally binding agreements that define terms for development, licensing, usage, and distribution. Despite their importance for compliance and stakeholder clarity, their complexity often impedes readability, and generic clause summarization fails to capture stakeholder-specific responsibilities, especially when clauses span multiple departments. Aim: This study explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to generate stakeholder-specific insights from complex contractual clauses in software engineering. Method: We evaluate zero-shot, few-shot prompting, and finetuning techniques across open-source models including T5, Llama 3.1 & 3.2, PEGASUS, BART, Mistral, Gemma 3, and Qwen 2.5. Commercial models like ChatGPT and Claude are excluded due to data privacy constraints, focusing instead on deployable models suitable for proprietary datasets. Using a dataset of 4,000 contractual clauses, we assess performance through ROUGE, METEOR, BLEU scores, and human-evaluation metrics such as fluency, coherence, informativeness, and relevance. Results: Finetuning emerged as the most effective technique, improving performance by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$150-200 {\\%}$</tex> over others. Among all models, the finetuned LlaMa 3.2 achieved the highest scores-over 0.9 on quantitative metrics, consistent ‘High’ ratings across qualitative metrics, and sub-second insight generation. Conclusions: The finetuned Llama 3.2 model demonstrates strong practical applicability and has been successfully integrated into the Software Contracts Governance System (SCGS) of a major IT vendor, validating its utility in real-world contract analysis."

    "abstract": "Background: A commit message describes the main code changes in a commit and plays a crucial role in software maintenance. Existing commit message generation (CMG) approaches typically frame it as a direct mapping which inputs a code diff and produces a brief descriptive sentence as output. Aims: Since the raw code diff lacks the context related to the code itself, we intend to supplement the relevant code as input of CMG to generate high-quality and informative commit messages. Method: We propose a contextual code retrieval-based method called C3Gen to enhance CMG by retrieving commit-relevant code snippets from the repository and incorporating them into the model input to provide richer contextual information at the repository scope. In the experiments, we evaluated the effectiveness of C3Gen across various models using four objective and three subjective metrics. Meanwhile, we design and conduct a human evaluation to investigate how C3Gen-generated commit messages are perceived by human developers. Results & Conclusions: By incorporating contextual code into the input, C3Gen enables models to leverage additional information to generate more comprehensive and informative commit messages with greater practical value in real-world development scenarios. Further analysis underscores concerns about the reliability of similarity-based metrics and provides empirical insights for CMG."

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in deep learning have led to significant achievements in hashing for image retrieval. However, existing methods primarily operate under the assumption that training and testing data share the same distribution, meaning that the categories in the training and test sets are identical. This assumption may not hold in real-world scenarios, potentially limiting the effectiveness of these methods. In this work, we investigate the performance of existing deep hashing methods on unseen category data during retrieval tests and find a considerable performance decline. To address this issue, we propose a Hierarchical Text-guided Hashing (HTH) framework to mitigate the performance degradation in open-world image retrieval. Specifically, our method is trained in a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework using automatically synthesized coarse-to-fine textual descriptions. By combining the strengths of SSL in learning discriminative low- and mid-level features with the semantic richness of hierarchically structured text, our approach aims to enhance the model’s ability to generalize across unseen categories and complex open-world settings. Technically, we elaborately design a local attention pooling module to fuse the local patch information. Furthermore, we propose both hierarchical and fine-grained alignment modules, respectively applied to the global and local vision-language representations at different semantic levels, guiding the hash encoding to fully understand the visual primitives and extract discriminative and generalizable semantic information from images. Under the newly established large-scale ImageNet-CoG open evaluation protocol, our method demonstrates significant improvements in generalization compared to state-of-the-art and also possesses enhanced performance across various other open-world retrieval datasets and scenarios."

    "abstract": "This letter presents a stealth two-dimensional leaky-wave antenna (2D LWA) with integrated radar-absorbing properties. Substrate-integrated image guide (SIIG) is employed to construct the LWA. The use of patch-type radiating elements without direct metal connections allows the antenna to perform in-band beam scanning while also enabling control over its out-of-band reflection properties. To this end, the patches are loaded with a metal-based resistive ink to maintain the reflection and absorption characteristics, ultimately enabling the antenna to combine beam scanning with out-of-band absorption. Moreover, the low-profile, integrated design reduces the spatial requirements for a radar system incorporating a radome. A proof-of-concept prototype is fabricated and measured, which demonstrated frequency-controlled beam scanning from -40° to 0° and a wide absorption bandwidth from 7 to 11 GHz. Owing to its beam-scanning capability, absorbing properties, low profile, and low cost, this LWA is a promising candidate for radar systems requiring stealth, scanning, and detection functionalities."

Leveraging this prior knowledge, we prove improved guarantees for secure state estimation and attack detection performance, even when a larger number of sensors are compromised, thereby strengthening the system’s resilience against malicious sensor attacks. We also present a control input design method that leverages the side initial state information to ensure system safety in the presence of sensor attacks. Finally, numerical examples using a simple 2D vehicle model demonstrate the beneficial effect of initial state information on system resilience and safety against sensor attacks."

This paper presents Middle-Shortcut Fusion, a novel mid-level multimodal fusion framework that effectively integrates synchronized LiDAR point clouds and RGB images using a two-stream neural architecture with cross-modal residual shortcut pathways. These shortcuts enable efficient feature propagation and deep intermodal interaction, substantially enhancing detection accuracy and computational efficiency. The incorporation of the mid-level fusion technique, when combining camera and LiDAR modalities, demonstrates remarkable improvements over individual sensorbased detection methods, highlighting its superior capability for autonomous perception. To validate the framework, a highresolution dataset capturing real-world semi-urban driving conditions was curated. Experimental results show that the proposed approach consistently surpasses conventional early and late fusion baselines, achieving superior detection precision and faster inference in vehicle detection tasks. By uniting the semantic richness of visual cues with the geometric precision of LiDAR through learnable shortcut pathways, the proposed fusion method establishes a new benchmark for efficient and robust multimodal perception in dynamic urban environments."

However, traditional BFT protocols often incur significant communication overhead, leading to unacceptable latency for applications requiring sub-second response times.This paper introduces BFTaaS (Byzantine Fault Tolerance as a Service), a novel paradigm designed to address these challenges. BFTaaS leverages NIC-level ordering and state management to offload consensus protocols and critical state components directly onto the network interface card (NIC), thereby reducing end-to-end latency and enhancing performance. Additionally, BFTaaS offers a transparent \"plug-and-play\" deployment model, facilitating easier integration of BFT protection.BFTaaS is currently being developed with the P4 language. Preliminary results are promising, indicating that BFTaaS can potentially halve the end-to-end latency of traditional BFT protocols."

Unlike the state-of-the-art (SoA) that considers the problem in a 2-dimensional space, the current work provides a solution in a 3-dimensional case. Based on geometry embedded within the considered problem, the work builds triangular relationships between a pair of reference points and a target to derive a weighted least squares (WLS) estimator whose solution is given in analytic form. Moreover, in contrast with the SoA which is exclusively focused on the localization problem, the solution of the WLS together with simple geometry are exploited to define a scheme for attacker detection. Lastly, by treating measurement noise as von Mises random variables, the current work derives a final expression of the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the secure localization problem. The proposed method is evaluated in terms of different parameters relevant to the problem, and numerical results corroborate its effectiveness in terms of computational complexity, localization accuracy and attacker detection."

    "abstract": "Maneuver coordination enables connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) to collaboratively plan, negotiate, and execute driving maneuvers, aiming to enhance safety, traffic flow, and energy efficiency. As part of the Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication system, it operates as a dedicated service that relies on detailed, bidirectional interactions between vehicles, unlike traditional broadcast-based V2X services. While maneuver coordination is the focus of ongoing research and standardization, the rules that govern when and how vehicles generate Maneuver Coordination Messages (MCMs) within the Maneuver Coordination Service (MCS) are still not fully defined. These rules are essential for ensuring timely and reliable coordination. This paper proposes three adaptive MCM generation strategies based on the operation mode of the MCS, maneuver priority, and current channel load. The first approach defines MCM rules for intent sharing, maneuver negotiation, and execution phases, factoring in maneuver importance. The second adjusts the frequency of intent MCMs when a negotiation message is received from another vehicle. The third adapts frequency based on real-time channel load during intent sharing. For comparison, two baseline strategies are also evaluated. The proposed rules are tested for highway merging and lane change use cases in traffic scenarios with increasing vehicle density and high channel loads. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted using metrics related to the network, message generation frequency, congestion control, and maneuver coordination. The results demonstrate significantly enhanced channel efficiency and communication reliability across all metrics. For example, under the final approach, maneuver negotiation time is reduced by a factor of five in congested V2X environments."

We first characterize the games for which successful steering is possible. Moreover, we establish that steering players to any desired action profile is not always achievable with information design alone, nor when accompanied with sublinear payment schemes. Consequently, we derive a lower bound on the constant payments required per round to achieve this goal. To address these limitations incurred with information design, we introduce an augmented approach that involves a one-shot information design phase before the start of the repeated game, transforming the prior interaction into a Stackelberg game. Finally, we theoretically demonstrate that this approach improves the convergence rate of players’ action profiles to the target point by a constant factor with high probability, and support it with empirical results."

Using minimal, standard tools from control theory, we present examples, counterexamples, and empirical explorations to illustrate key properties of internal virtualization and its relationship to classic control concepts such as feasible trajectory planning and differential flatness, as well as the more general concepts of modularity and predictive coding.Altogether, the rich insight demonstrated in such a simple, mathematically minimal treatment of virtualization in layered reference tracking reflects the urgent need for a more expansive, formal theory of Internal Virtualization in layered control architectures."

Many ancestry and descendant relationships between the measured quantities in networked systems can be identified using PAG, whereas the skeleton of a network entail the connectivity among the quantities without specific directionality of the influence. However, together a PAG and skeleton can entail true edge directions in a generative structure.

    "abstract": "Recent open-vocabulary robot mapping methods enrich dense geometric maps with pre-trained visual-language features, achieving a high level of detail and guiding robots to find objects specified by open-vocabulary language queries. While the issue of scalability for such approaches has received some attention, another fundamental problem is that high-detail object mapping quickly becomes outdated, as objects get moved around a lot. In this work, we develop a mapping and navigation system for object-goal navigation that, from the ground up, considers the possibilities that a queried object can have moved, or may not be mapped at all. Instead of striving for high-fidelity mapping detail, we consider that the main purpose of a map is to provide environment grounding and context, which we combine with the semantic priors of LLMs to reason about object locations and deploy an active, online approach to navigate to the objects. Through simulated and real-world experiments we find that our approach tends to have higher retrieval success at shorter path lengths for static objects and by far outperforms prior approaches in cases of dynamic or unmapped object queries."

    "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) has demonstrated significant potential in enhancing STEM education through immersive visualization and interactive learning experiences. Recent advances in large language models present new opportunities to integrate AI teaching assistants (AI-TAs) into VR educational applications. This paper presents a case study evaluating the user experience and perceived effectiveness of an AI-TA integrated into a custom VR physics education module for crystal structure learning. We developed a system combining a fine-tuned Llama 3 language model with a 3D avatar interface and voice interaction capabilities. Through workshops with 10 graduate physics students, we compared traditional instruction methods with VR-based learning enhanced by AI-TA support. Participants evaluated the system using modified usability scales and provided qualitative feedback on their learning experience. Results indicate moderate user satisfaction across key dimensions including interface usability, explanation quality, and information relevance, with users expressing strong preference for VR-based crystal structure manipulation over traditional methods. However, the AI-TA integration faced challenges in seamlessly complementing the VR experience, highlighting important design considerations for future implementations. This study contributes initial insights into the challenges and opportunities of integrating conversational AI with immersive educational technologies, with findings suggesting that while AI-VR integration shows promise, success depends on careful attention to multimodal interaction design and system synchronization."

Traditional centralized intrusion detection systems struggle with the complexity and heterogeneity of IoT environments. While federated learning addresses privacy and centralization issues, its performance is hindered by limited edge-device resources and data distribution drift. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight DDoS detection architecture based on protocol partitioning. By grouping IoT devices by protocol type, detection tasks are distributed more efficiently, reducing feature redundancy and computational load. A traffic redistribution mechanism, combined with domain adversarial training, enables effective cross-protocol collaboration while mitigating distribution drift. Additionally, a fine-grained FedProx-based aggregation strategy improves model robustness under device heterogeneity. Experiments on the CICIoT-2023 dataset show that the proposed method achieves 97% accuracy with low overhead, making it wellsuited for resource-constrained IoT scenarios."

    "abstract": "Carrier interference is a fundamental research challenge in backscatter systems. Existing solutions leverage frequency shifting or full duplex designs to mitigate carrier interference in the analog or digital domain. However, these solutions introduce extra spectrum usage, protocol overhead, and power consumption, all of which are undesirable in backscatter systems. In this paper, we revisit polarization mismatch and propose Lotus, a low-cost analog design to combat carrier interference for backscatter systems. Lotus comprises a novel antenna design and a backscatter tag design. At runtime, Lotus antenna replaces the receiver default antenna to cancel out the carrier interference, without any protocol or hardware overhead. Lotus tag mitigates the power loss caused by polarization mismatch and remains compatible with all existing backscatter radios. Experimental results show that Lotus achieves comparable cancellation gain (i.e., 42 dB) with the state-of-the-art frequency-shifting baseline. Meanwhile, Lotus outperforms the baseline by 2× and 6.5× in spectrum and power efficiency, respectively. Additionally, Lotus achieves comparable performance to the frequency shifting baseline regarding backscatter range and throughput across three backscatter technologies, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and LoRa."

The suggested design reduces CPU and memory by utilizing targeted indexing algorithms, streamlined parsing rules, and automated pipeline orchestration. Experimental findings reveal that this integration has proven extremely effective in speed and centralizing log storage, reducing the requirement for log rotation. The benchmarking outcomes predict its effectiveness: automatic search execution took 0.119 seconds compared to 1 minute and 16.248 seconds for manual analysis, which makes the data processing about 641 times quicker.

Finally, for classification, we evaluated four Machine Learning Classifiers, which are K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost. The optimal pipeline combined 0.5–30 Hz bandpass filtering with Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), achieving 87% classification accuracy using a (KNN) classifier, outperforming prior work.

Existing tools, including the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP), provide strong baseline detection but lack comprehensive capabilities to address these challenges and support actionable remediation. To fill this gap, we develop ZAPx, an extension of ZAP that integrates enhanced detection and AI-driven remediation. ZAPx introduces: (i) an active scan module to detect vulnerabilities exploitable by automated attacks, (ii) a passive scan module to identify sensitive data exposure in client-side code, and (iii) a generative AI engine that produces context-specific remediation plans. Experimental results demonstrate that ZAPx achieves a higher detection rate of web application vulnerabilities while reducing false positives compared to the baseline ZAP tool."

These methods were chosen to balance accuracy with regulatory accountability, while SHAP values provide both global and local explanations of financial drivers. Predictive uncertainty is further quantified using Monte Carlo Dropout, Quantile Regression, and bootstrapped confidence bounds to support risk-aware decisions. Evaluated on over 500 firms and 6,000 firm-quarters, XAI-RiskNet achieves high accuracy (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> = 0.994 for Net Income), limited degradation under shocks (ΔR<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> = –1.3%), and 87% interpretability compliance.

To address this dual challenge, this study introduces a simple yet efficient segmentation framework based on Multi-scale Prototype matching and visual Sparse Attention mechanisms (MPSA), which is a transformer-based architecture designed to optimize the balance between performance and efficiency. The proposed MPSA integrates a novel lightweight cross-attention mechanism and prototype selection and filtering strategy to accurately correlate category queries with corresponding visual objects with a multi-scale Feature Pyramid Network (FPN). Within the pixel decoder, our Axial Convolution Enhanced (ACE) module mitigates lost global context by combining depth-wise separable convolutions with deformable convolutions, thereby recovering global semantics while preserving fine-grained spatial details. Through this innovative design, MPSA demonstrates outstanding performance in both semantic and panoptic segmentation tasks across multiple datasets. Remarkably, MPSA achieves surprising 83.9% mIoU with only 114M parameters on the Cityscapes dataset while compared to some state-of-the-art architectures, highlighting its ability to deliver exceptional results with significantly reduced resource consumption. Our code is released at https://github.com/zxqing01/MPSA."

However, the optimal configuration of such games remains largely unexplored. While there is existing literature on the parametrization of dynamic games, little research examines this parametrization from a strategic perspective — where each agent’s configuration choice is influenced by the decisions of others. In this work, we introduce the concept of a game of configuration, providing a framework for the strategic fine-tuning of differential games. We define a game of configuration as a two-stage game within the setting of finite-horizon, affine-quadratic (AQ) differential games. In the first stage, each player chooses their corresponding configuration parameter, which will impact their dynamics and costs in the second stage. We provide the subgame perfect solution concept and a method for computing first stage cost gradients over the configuration space. This then allows us to formulate a gradient-based method for searching for local solutions to the configuration game, as well as provide necessary conditions for equilibrium configurations over their downstream (second stage) trajectories. We conclude by demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in example AQ systems, both zero-sum and general-sum."

The agents trade off tracking an artificial reference against the need for that reference to minimise the cooperative task’s objective function. The scheme guarantees asymptotic fulfilment of the cooperative task. Importantly, the eventual solution is not specified a priori, but emerges from the agents’ decisions."

However, this measurement remains challenging due to the non-uniformity of contact pressure. A hybrid methodology integrating the moderate equivalent circuit model with heuristic optimization algorithms (genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization) is proposed to nondestructively detect the TTR distribution in full-scale racetrack REBCO coils for maglev applications. The systematic comparison demonstrates that Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is more suitable for the studied problem under the specific parameter settings, as it shows better voltage fitting accuracy and operational stability compared to Genetic Algorithm (GA). The method first estimates the global TTR range through a lumped circuit model and time constant analysis, then minimizes the deviation between measured and simulated voltage values to obtain the optimal spatial distribution of TTR. Experimental validation on three full-scale racetrack coils (C1, C2, C3) reveals characteristic TTR distributions, where the resistivity values at inner and outer turns are 2–6 times higher than those at middle turns."

However, in practice, the lack of historical data often makes it difficult for traditional software defect prediction methods to achieve satisfactory results. As a result, cross-project software defect prediction (CPDP) techniques have gained increasing attention. Among these, data filter-based(namely DF) methods are a relatively mainstream defect prediction technique in CPDP. Nevertheless, current DF methods usually do not consider the issue of concept Shift between different projects. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a novel cross-project defect based on data filter prediction method called TrDF. This method first selects multiple source project datasets that are similar to the target project. Then, we assigns different weights to these datasets based on the smoothness assumption. Finally, we bagging to train efect prediction classifier based on these these weights. This paper compares TrDF with other CPDP methods on 11 datasets, measuring their F1-score and G-mean values. The experimental results show that the performance achieved by TrDF is better than other CPDP methods."

When a sparse array configuration is employed, the imaging resolution can be improved. However, it is inevitably accompanied by severe grating lobes. Although multi-frame observations can be used to mitigate the influence of grating lobes, they often introduce additional artifacts. Existing approaches remain inadequate in artifact suppression and unavoidably attenuate weak targets. To address these issues, we propose an adaptive weight strategy that leverages the statistical characteristics of multi-frame data to suppress artifacts and improve the fidelity of target amplitude reconstruction. First, the energy of multi-channel signals is computed for each frame, forming a multi-frame energy sequence. Second, an adaptive weight is calculated based on the mean and variance of this sequence. Finally, an exponential factor of the weight is applied to enhance the spectral reconstruction by enlarging the discrimination between true targets and artifacts. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through simulation and measurement experiments, demonstrating its advantages over existing methods."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of high-speed railways, 5G for Railways (5G-R) is gradually replacing the legacy Global System for the Mobile Communications for Railway (GSM-R) system to meet growing communication demands. However, the large bandwidth, use of array antennas, and pronounced non-stationarity caused by high mobility make 5G-R channel modeling significantly more complex. Accurate and realistic channel models are therefore essential to support reliable system design. Despite this need, there is a scarcity of time-variant channel models specifically tailored to 5G-R frequency bands and scenarios, particularly those that adopt a cluster-based framework. This paper proposes a cluster-based time-variant channel model for 5G-R, extending the 3GPP framework by incorporating temporal evolution and dynamic multipath behavior. The model is constructed from comprehensive real-world measurements on a 5G-R private network. Key propagation features including path loss, Rice K-factor, delay and angular spreads are statistically characterized, with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test validating their goodness of fit. Clustering analysis shows 1 to 6 multipath clusters per stationarity region, and their birth-death dynamics are effectively modeled using a first-order four-state Markov chain. Compared to the standard 3GPP CDL model, the proposed 5G-R CDL model exhibits longer delays, more balanced cluster power distribution, and wider angular spreads, better reflecting the unique features of the railway propagation environment. Moreover, validation with cluster dynamic parameters confirms that the birth–death model accurately captures cluster evolution, supporting the Markov process assumption. Link-level simulations further demonstrate that the proposed model more accurately captures real-world variations in bit error rate and signal quality than existing 3GPP models. The proposed model enhances realism and adaptability for link-level simulations, network planning, and physical layer algorithm design in high-speed railway scenarios, providing a solid foundation for future 5G-R channel standardization."

    "abstract": "Harmonic currents in microgrids (MGs) have increased significantly due to the evolving characteristics of power electronics, generation systems, and load profiles. Improper sharing of these currents among distributed generators (DGs) can lead to overload and reduced reliability. This paper proposes a consensus-based secondary control strategy that enables proportional sharing of both fundamental and harmonic currents among DGs in AC MGs. The primary control level employs voltage and current parallel control using proportional-resonant (PR) controllers. Through the exchange of current amplitudes and total harmonic distortion (THD) over a communication network, the proposed method dynamically adjusts each DG reference currents to reflect its capacity, thus preventing overload. The strategy operates seamlessly in both islanded and grid-connected modes, without switching logic states, avoiding discontinuities that could cause high-frequency oscillations or instability. Additionally, a THD equalization layer improves harmonic distribution, ensuring compliance with standard limits. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the method's resilience to communication failures and its plug-and-play capability, highlighting its practical applicability in modern MGs."

Conventional pulsed laser deposition (PLD) with a stoichiometric target suffers from degradation of BaHfO3 (BHO) nanorod alignment at high deposition rates, resulting in a significant reduction in Jc. In this study, a newly designed target with the composition Y:Ba:Cu = 1:2.3:3.7 was employed to induce liquid-phase formation during PLD growth. Structural and compositional analyses revealed the presence of Cu-rich precipitates and microstructural features characteristic of liquid-mediated growth. The use of a YBCO+BHO seed layer prevented the reaction between Ba species and the CeO2 surface of the substrate. Consequently, the formation of BaCeO3 was effectively suppressed at elevated substrate temperatures. Furthermore, YBCO+BHO films grown from the non-stoichiometric target maintained well-aligned nanorods even at high deposition frequencies (100 Hz), exhibiting Jc values comparable to those of films deposited at low rates. These findings demonstrate that liquid-phase-assisted growth enabled by non-stoichiometric target design is an effective strategy for achieving both high Jc and high-rate deposition in REBCO films. This approach provides new insights into the control of liquid-phase formation in PLD processes and offers a promising pathway for cost-effective fabrication of high-performance coated conductors."

    "abstract": "The dynamic dispatching of mobile charging vehicles (MCVs) has emerged as a promising solution to overcome the limitations of fixed charging infrastructure in electric vehicle (EV) services. However, the stochastic nature of user charging demands and the high operational costs of MCV travel pose significant challenges in balancing supply and demand, particularly under real-time requests and large-scale traffic networks. Existing MCV dispatch strategies are often static, reliant on predefined demand locations, and fail to adapt to the spatiotemporal variations in EV demand and MCV states. To address these challenges, we formulate the MCV dispatching problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and propose multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MARL)-evolutionary strategy (ES), a novel MARL framework with centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE), enhanced by integrated action-space ESs. MARL-ES leverages a neural network-based state-value function that incorporates the experiences of MCVs and EV demands, as well as offline historical data. It further employs mutation and segment-based crossover operators to enhance the strategic diversity, improve exploration, and optimize dispatch decisions. We develop a realistic, large-scale city grid simulator to model stochastic EV arrivals, energy constraints, and coordinated MCV interactions. Experimental results show that MARL-ES significantly outperforms static optimization and conventional MARL approaches in total profit, operational cost, and MCV moving distance. The framework also demonstrates robust scalability and adaptability across different fleet sizes and under uncertain demand and energy conditions, offering a practical and adaptive dispatching solution for intelligent mobile charging services (MCSs)."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel distributed data-driven optimization scheme. In particular, we focus on the so-called aggregative framework, namely, the scenario in which a set of agents aim to cooperatively minimize the sum of local costs, each depending on both local decision variables and an aggregation of all of them. We consider a data-driven setup in which each objective function is unknown and can be only sampled at a single point per iteration (thanks to, e.g., feedback from human users or physical sensors). We address this scenario through a distributed algorithm that combines three key components: (i) a learning part that leverages neural networks to learn the local cost functions descent direction, (ii) an optimization routine that steers the estimates according to the learned direction to minimize the global cost, and (iii) a tracking mechanism that locally reconstructs the unavailable global quantities. By using tools from system theory, i.e., timescale separation and averaging theory, we formally prove that, in strongly convex setups, the overall distributed strategy linearly converges in a neighborhood of the optimal solution whose radius depends on the given accuracy capabilities of the neural networks. Finally, we corroborate the theoretical results with numerical simulations."

To address this issue, a residual neural network downsampling scheme is proposed. The network automatically learns the intrinsic features of the beat signals and preserves diagnostically relevant vibration information under aggressive dimensionality reduction. Experiments on a heterodyne Φ-OTDR system show that, compared with the traditional downsampling scheme, the proposed scheme achieves a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and better waveform fidelity at the same compression ratio. When combined with μ-law quantization, an overall compression ratio of up to 32 is achieved while maintaining acceptable signal quality, which significantly improves the efficiency of data storage and transmission."

    "abstract": "Reliable satellite attitude fault recovery is essential for the success of space missions, particularly as satellites increasingly operate autonomously in dynamic and uncertain environments. Such uncertainties may arise from actuator degradations, subsystem anomalies, environmental disturbances, or other unpredictable operational conditions. Maintaining control resilience in these scenarios is critical to preserving mission objectives and ensuring system stability. However, traditional Proportional-Derivative (PD) controllers and existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms such as TD3, PPO, and A2C often fall short in providing the real-time adaptability and robustness required for autonomous satellite operations. This study introduces a DRL-based fault recovery strategy designed for satellite resilience and adaptability under uncertainty. In contrast to previous DRL-based solutions that focused primarily on nominal operations or minimal noises, this work introduces a new method tailored for fault recovery. The proposed method, referred to as TD3-HD, employs Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) enhanced with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) and Dimension-Wise Clipping (DWC) to accelerate learning under sparse post-fault rewards and stabilizes policy updates in degraded scenarios. This combination forms a distinct learning mechanism designed specifically for resilience and adaptability in the presence of actuator faults and structural variations. Experimental results demonstrate that TD3-HD achieves significantly lower attitude error, improved angular velocity regulation, and enhanced stability in the presence of uncertainty, highlighting its potential as a robust fault recovery framework for future autonomous satellite missions."

This paper investigates the influence of channel sizes on TID response in H-gate DSOI nMOSFETs. The experimental results indicate that shorter-channel devices exhibit higher TID sensitivity at low-to-medium doses but demonstrate a significant threshold voltage rebound at high doses. Furthermore, under short-channel conditions, increasing the channel width aggravates degradation, resulting in an anomalous radiation-induced wide channel effect. The 3D TCAD simulation is carried out to further analyze the size-dependence phenomena. Simulation results highlight that channel sizes modulate the local electric field distribution within the buried oxide, thereby influencing the density and spatial evolution of radiation-induced trapped charges. Finally, charge extraction via the mid-gap and DCIV techniques confirms the differences in trapped charge density and provides a mechanistic explanation for the rebound effect."

    "abstract": "It is widely believed that increasing the amount of training data enhances the intelligence of deep learning models, which in turn heightens dependence on external datasets. However, these datasets are susceptible to adversarial poisoning, allowing attackers to insert backdoors that trigger misclassifications. Although various defense strategies have been suggested, training-phase defenses (TPDs) appear most promising, as they can significantly lower the attack success rate (ASR) without greatly impacting model performance. Nevertheless, creating TPDs that achieve both high accuracy and low ASR is challenging due to two main issues: 1) Many solutions require additional clean samples that match the distribution of the poisoned dataset, which is not always practical in real-world scenarios; 2) most existing solutions have high computational costs, sometimes requiring five to ten times the expense of standard training, which severely limits their practical use. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Confidence Consistency Detection (CCD), an efficient and lightweight training-phase backdoor detection method. CCD is particularly advantageous in situations where clean data is scarce or unavailable, as it completely eliminates the need for external clean samples. Moreover, CCD significantly reduces computational costs to just 25% to 50% of existing solutions (1.7 times the standard training time), providing a notable improvement over current TPD methods. The core innovation of CCD lies in its ability to utilize the high confidence shown by backdoor samples during the early stages of model training for precise detection. Specifically, we initially train a model on a poisoned dataset for a few epochs, followed by intra-class loss fine-tuning to increase sensitivity to poisoned samples. We then create preliminary sets of poisoned and clean samples by assessing the consistency of confidence variations before and after fine-tuning. These sets guide the model training, enabling the detection of high-confidence poisoned samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCD effectively reduces the attack success rate (ASR) to 1.43%, while having a negligible impact on the model’s clean accuracy. In detecting poisoned samples, CCD achieves a 99% true positive rate (TPR) and a 0.033% false positive rate (FPR), setting a new benchmark in the field."

    "abstract": "Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is an indirect measure of vessel stiffness, that has the potential to serve as a meaningful parameter for risk stratification of vascular diseases, such as abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). However, assessing the PWV and pulse wave patterns in the complete abdominal aorta using ultrasound-based pulse wave imaging (PWI) is challenging due to the limited field of view (FOV) and contrast of a single ultrasound (US) probe. Hence, an approach is required that can capture distension of aortas with different levels of stiffness accurately in a large FOV. Therefore, we propose PWI based on dual probe, bistatic US. Single and dual probe ultrasound simulations were performed using finite element models of pressure waves propagating in aortas with different stiffness levels. Next, the approach was tested on an aorta and AAA mimicking phantom in a mock circulation setup. The simulation results show that the FOV, image quality, and PWV-estimation accuracy improve when using the dual probe approach (accuracy range: 94.9 - 99.8 <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\%$</tex-math></inline-formula>; <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</i><inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$^{2}$</tex-math></inline-formula> range: 0.92 - 0.98) compared to conventional US (accuracy range: 12.6 - 93.9 <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\%$</tex-math></inline-formula>; <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</i><inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$^{2}$</tex-math></inline-formula> range: 0.52 - 0.91).

    "abstract": "Background: In recent years, with the advancement of software engineering technologies and industry, Open Source Software (OSS) has become a mainstream model for software development and innovation. Increasingly, organizations and developers are adopting and customizing existing OSS to simplify and accelerate development processes. During OSS adoption, recommending suitable software based on user needs is crucial for enhancing development efficiency and addressing diverse requirements. However, the vast number and diversity of OSS make the recommendation task highly challenging. Despite progress in previous research, several issues remain, such as neglect of key software attributes, complexity in extracting multilingual features, and challenges of cold start and data sparsity. Aims: This paper presents AthenaRec, a large-scale OSS recommendation system comprising three core modules: Delphi, Argus, and Hestia. AthenaRec aims to recommend relevant and suitable software from a vast OSS based on user needs. Method: Specifically, Delphi first analyzes user queries to identify intention; Argus employs a heterogeneous ensemble recall approach to retrieve a large set of candidate software relevant to the identified intention; finally, Hestia adopts a two-stage deep ranking strategy. It performs coarse ranking by integrating multilingual modeling with contrastive learning, followed by fine ranking with a large language model, augmented by retrieval-augmented generation to incorporate external evidence. To evaluate the effectiveness of AthenaRec, we use a query dataset from real application scenarios. Results: Experimental results demonstrate that, on the test set of 7,500 queries, AthenaRec achieves superior recommendation performance, with Hits@20, MAP@20, NDCG@20, and MRR scores of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$98.27 \\%, 95.60 \\%, 95.05 {\\%}$</tex>, and 92.92%, respectively. On average, AthenaRec outperforms other top methods by 10.9% across all evaluation metrics. Conclusions: Additionally, we develop a Visual Studio Code (VSCode) plugin based on AthenaRec, which can be accessed via URL. We intend for this research to provide a reference for software developers, advancing the efficiency and accuracy of OSS recommendation."

While general perspectives of SSE have been studied, little is known about the context-specific sustainability needs and constraints of sectors like financial services, which are highly regulated, data-intensive, and handle millions of transactions daily. Aim: To address this gap, our research focuses on a financial services company (FinServCo) that invited us to investigate perspectives on sustainability in their IT function: how it could be put into practice, who is responsible for it, and what the challenges are. Method: We conducted an exploratory qualitative case study using interviews and a focus group with six higher management employees and 16 software engineers comprising various experience levels from junior developers to team leaders. Results: We found a clear divergence in how sustainability is perceived across organisational levels. Higher management focused on technical and economic aspects, such as cloud migration and business continuity through data availability, while developers emphasised human-centric concerns like workload and stress. Some developers were sceptical of organisational motives, viewing initiatives as PR-driven. Key challenges included knowledge gaps, cultural resistance, legacy systems, and limited client demand. Many participants favoured a dedicated sustainability team, often drawing comparisons to established security governance structures. Conclusions: SSE is shaped by organisational roles, cultural dynamics, and sector-specific constraints. The disconnect between organisational goals and individual developer needs highlights the importance of context-sensitive, co-designed interventions.

Typists used playback machines with foot pedals to control the speed of the recording and to reverse and repeat as necessary. The Dictaphone competed with Thomas Edison's Ediphone, which used similar technology. But the Dictaphone won in a sense, in that “dictaphone” is used generically to describe all dictation machines."

The VR/AR interaction module realizes three-dimensional simulation of cold ground sites and visual implantation of regional cultural elements, supporting real-time adjustment of landscape elements; The greedy algorithm optimization module adopts a phased strategy of “cultural priority layout surplus material reuse” to balance cultural adaptability and material efficiency with a dual objective function; The intelligent evaluation module constructs a quantitative evaluation system through objective indicators (material utilization rate, cultural fit) and subjective indicators (interaction fluency, user satisfaction).

    "abstract": "In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in natural language understanding, contextual modeling, and human-like reasoning. However, these capabilities have also unveiled a spectrum of critical security vulnerabilities, including logical inconsistencies during inference, linguistic and semantic disruptions, and entrenched cognitive biases. Such deficiencies can cause LLMs to produce inaccurate, misleading, or even harmful outputs, posing significant risks to high-stakes applications such as decision support systems, legal consultation, and medical diagnostics. This paper presents a systematic analysis of security threats arising during the inference phase of LLMs. By examining the inference pipeline across its distinct stages and the varying levels of abstraction at which threats manifest, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy of potential security risk factors. Furthermore, we conduct targeted testing and validation to assess the impact of these threats. Our study aims to provide both theoretical insights and practical guidance for the development and deployment of safer and more reliable LLM systems."

In this work, we study GNEP with shared distributionally robust chance constraints (DRCCs) for incorporating inevitable uncertainties. The DRCCs are defined over the Wasserstein ball, which can be explicitly characterized even with limited sample data. To determine the equilibrium of the GNEP, we propose an exact approach to transform the original computationally intractable problem into a deterministic formulation using the Nikaido-Isoda function. Specifically, we show that when all agents’ objectives are quadratic in their respective variables, the equilibrium can be obtained by solving a typical mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, where the integer and continuous variables are decoupled in both the objective function and the constraints. This structure significantly improves computational tractability, as demonstrated through a case study on the charging station pricing problem."

Traditional acceleration methods either degrade prediction performance or rely on dedicated hardware with additional resources, but the resources are usually limited in real applications. One solution is to resort to new optimization strategies, such as learning from easy to hard by multiple stages. However, existing strategies are designed mainly for networks with a serial structure, but <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">MoE</i> has multiple expert networks working in parallel. They employ an identical learning plan for all experts, ignoring that each expert's learning domain and speed differ, resulting in some experts being over-learned while others being under-learned. This mismatch will make it hard for experts to train together, harming training efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a new training acceleration framework. It can customize an effective learning plan for each expert by considering their training progress, avoiding blindly searching in a huge parameter space. In detail, we first design a multi-stage planner that starts with optimizing a subpart of the network and then scales it up to retrain until it expands to an entire network. It uses the density function to assess the knowledge gained by the expert in each stage, giving priority to the experts who learn faster to increase the training scale, so as to boost convergence. Afterward, we exploit the growth operator to add the expert training scale of the next stage. In each stage, the network would converge to some locally optimal values. That can provide a better initialization to train the next stage more easily, since the time and data required for training from scratch are greatly reduced. To alleviate the gradient vanishing problem caused by network growth, we develop a scheduler to dynamically adjust the learning rate. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our method. The results show that we can obtain more than 25% training acceleration on average."

The SABN dynamically adjusts the gate bias of the peaking devices based on input power, leveraging the rectification characteristics of a series-connected diode array. A comprehensive theoretical analysis is provided to illustrate the SABN’s operating principle and its impact on OBO extension and source termination. Following detailed design guidelines, a prototype is implemented using commercial gallium nitride high electron mobility transistors (GaN HEMTs) CG2H40010F. Measurement results demonstrate that the proposed DPA achieves a 10-dB OBO range with drain efficiency (DE) between 43% and 61% in back-off and saturated DE of 64%–74% over 1.6–2.15-GHz bandwidth (29.3% fractional bandwidth). The proposed DPA effectively alleviates gain compression in the peaking branch and maintains high efficiency across the targeted frequency band. When evaluated using the 20-MHz long-term evolution (LTE) signals at an average output power of around 35 dBm, the proposed DPA achieves the adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) better than −47 dBc after linearization. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first work to employ an adaptive bias network (ABN) in a PCB-level three-way GaN-based DPA."

    "abstract": "This article presents a power hardware-in-the-loop (PHIL)-based emulation testing method for investigating eccentricity faults in wound-rotor induction machines (WRIMs). Due to the smaller per-unit air-gap length and high-power ratings of WRIMs, even minor eccentricities can be hazardous, yet inclined eccentricity, which is more prevalent in practical scenarios, has been underexplored. Conventional fault studies rely on physical prototypes and large test benches, leading to high cost and prototyping delays. The proposed PHIL approach integrates a high-fidelity analytical model to replicate complex inclined eccentricity fault behaviors in real time. This method provides substantial cost reductions over conventional dynamometer-driven setups by replacing expensive mechanical test-bed components and single-use custom motors with power electronic-based setups, while eliminating assembly delays and mitigating the physical risks of direct fault testing. The analytical model for the inclined eccentricity fault is developed using the modified winding function method, accounting for the complexity arising from air-gap variations that change circumferentially and axially in a motor. The emulation results are validated against experimental measurements from a scaled-down 2.5 MW WRIM test rig, demonstrating strong correlation and confirming the accuracy of the approach. Linear amplifier and switched converter-based emulation results are compared with the actual machine."

    "abstract": "An AC disturbance suppression method for permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drives is proposed on the basis of a mathematical optimization algorithm. First, the AC disturbances of the system were equivalently moved to the controller input point (error feedback) according to the principle of shifting the introduction point of in a control flow diagram. Thus, additional harmonics with appropriate amplitudes and phase angles can be injected at this point to compensate for the effects of the AC disturbances. Second, a two-dimensional optimization method based on the gradient descent algorithm (GDA) was designed to obtain the injected harmonics with the optimal amplitude and phase angle. Furthermore, a reasonable evaluation function was designed to prevent the GDA from falling into a local optimum. Third, the iteration of the amplitude and phase angle was improved according to the evaluation function so that the two are approximately decoupled. This avoids the derivative calculations required by the traditional GDA and provides a better balance between the convergence speed and the accuracy. The method for selecting the initial value of the GDA iteration is also given, and the parameter robustness of the proposed GDA was analyzed. Finally, experimental validation was performed."

    "abstract": "The growing proliferation of distributed energy resources (DERs) is significantly enhancing the resilience and reliability of distribution systems. However, a substantial portion of behind-the-meter (BTM) DERs is often overlooked during black start (BS) and restoration processes. Existing BS strategies that utilize grid-forming (GFM) battery energy storage systems (BESS) frequently ignore critical frequency security and synchronization constraints. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a predictive framework for bottom-up BS that leverages the flexibility of BTM DERs through Grid Edge Intelligence (GEI). A predictive model is developed for GEI to estimate multi-period flexibility ranges and track dispatch signals from the utility. A frequency-constrained BS strategy is then introduced, explicitly incorporating constraints on frequency nadir, rate-of-change-of-frequency (RoCoF), and quasi-steady-state (QSS) frequency. The framework also includes synchronizing switches to enable faster and more secure load restoration. Notably, it requires GEI devices to communicate only their flexibility ranges and the utility to send dispatch signals—without exchanging detailed asset information. The proposed framework is validated using a modified IEEE 123-bus test system, and the impact of GEI is demonstrated by comparing results across various GEI penetration scenarios."

    "abstract": "The symmetrical phase-shift modulation of the three-to-two-level neutral-point-clamped dual-active-bridge (3/2LNPC-DAB) DC-DC converter has more controllable control variables than the conventional two-level DAB converter. The increase in control variables leads to an increase in the number of operating modes and inequality constraints, significantly complicating the modulation optimization process. To enhance the efficiency of the converter, this paper proposes an optimized quadruple phase-shift (OQPS) modulation considering both conduction losses and switching losses. Five effective operating modes that have the potential to achieve zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) for all switching devices are screened based on the ZVS inequality constraints. The inductor peak current is used as an optimization objective to minimize the conduction losses while satisfying the ZVS inequality constraints. The boundary of the feasible region satisfied by the optimal solution is derived by numerical optimization. Based on this, an improved Lagrange function and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are proposed to solve the analytical solution of OQPS modulation. Finally, the proposed OQPS modulation is applied to a 1.6kW prototype to verify the improvement of efficiency. The designed prototype can achieve 96.9% peak efficiency at 300V input and 150V output voltages. Compared with previous modulations, the proposed OQPS modulation can achieve the highest efficiency in the full power range."

Existing approaches often face limitations, such as the inability to interact station locations with demand or difficulty in finding the optimal solution for large study regions. This paper first proposes a mathematical model to generate optimal eVTOL station locations while considering associated potential eVTOL demand, and then proposes a heuristic algorithm, Hierarchical Optimization MEthod (HOME), to efficiently solve the model. With a case study of Southern California, HOME was compared to 1) directly solving the original integer linear programming-based network design problem, and 2) employing the widely used genetic algorithm. Results suggest that HOME can find optimal solutions with limited computational resources. The proposed framework powered by HOME provides a computationally efficient way to support urban air mobility planning."

However, as system complexity increases, the topology and data interaction relationships of onboard networks become more intricate. This paper proposes an architecture for an onboard network test platform based on network communication protocols, aiming to enhance the reliability and automation of network testing. The proposed architecture adopts a three-layered structure: management layer, execution layer, and target layer. Through standardized network communication protocols, it enables command and data communication between the test server and the test target endpoint. These protocols meticulously define the formats and parameters of request messages and response messages, supporting functionalities such as system initialization, configuration loading, and test data control. By achieving separation of commands from data, the protocol ensures the efficiency and reliability of the testing process. This innovative architecture addresses the issues of low automation and high complexity inherent in traditional onboard network testing systems, providing a brand-new solution for onboard network testing."

Given the complexity involved and the abundance of data now available, it is essential to integrate learning-based methods not only to design optimal controllers with safety guarantees, but to also gain an understanding of human driving behavior, as well as user preferences for the mobility options that intelligent transportation systems provide. The three objectives of this tutorial paper are: (1) Set the stage for emerging mobility systems consisting of both autonomous and human-driven vehicles in a mixed traffic environment by formulating basic optimal control problems for autonomous vehicles that seek to jointly optimize travel time, energy, and comfort while ensuring that safety constraints are always satisfied. (2) Present methods for solving the formulated problems using a combination of optimization techniques and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) that provide safety guarantees, as well as state of the art learning-based methods to design effective controllers for mixed traffic transportation systems.

For this, we have done data analysis of a dataset of student records containing 17 features including age, gender, CGPA, sleep duration and several mental health related indicators. We tested six machine learning algorithms in total-Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), XGBoost, and AdaBoost. After hyperparameter tuning, Adaboost performed the best, achieving an accuracy of 84.80%, an F1-score of 84.71% and ROC-AUC of 92.54%. These results were slightly better than what has been reposted in similar recent studies. From the feature importance analysis factors such as sleep duration, academic pressure, and family mental illness history were the strongest predictors.

    "abstract": "The development of dependable Embodied Intelligence (EI) is a pivotal step toward transforming Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) into trustworthy physical agency. Unlike virtual AI systems, embodied agents, such as service robots and autonomous vehicles, must operate safely and predictably in dynamic environments, where errors have tangible consequences. Achieving this demands not only intelligence but also measurable dependability in safety, robustness, and accountability under frameworks like the EU AI Act [9]. Large Language Models (LLMs) and World Models (WMs) embody complementary paradigms of intelligence: LLMs provide semantic reasoning and task decomposition, while WMs enable causal prediction and grounded planning. Existing paradigms, i.e., LLM-EI and WM-EI, each face limitations: the former lacks physical grounding and adaptivity, while the latter struggles with abstraction and generalization. Integrating LLMs and WMs within embodied agents (LLM-WM-EI) unites semantic cognition with causal grounding, offering a stronger foundation for general-purpose autonomy. However, this integration introduces new dependability and security challenges. This work advances the discussion from integration to dependable integration, analyzing the emerging threat landscape of LLM-WM-EI systems and outlining principal directions for ensuring their trustworthy, reliable, and accountable operation."

This study investigates the asymptotic behavior of a heterogeneous bi-threshold population, where the thresholds vary among the individuals. First, we show through an example that the proportion of adopters in finite populations may fluctuate. We then use available results in the stochastic approximation theory and approximate the finite discrete dynamics by corresponding continuous-time dynamics. Our analysis shows that the continuous-time dynamics always equilibrate. This implies that the amplitudes of the fluctuations in the proportion of adopters in a finite bi-threshold population almost surely diminish when the population size grows to infinity. The result underlines the advantage of analyzing simpler continuous-time dynamics to get insights into the long-term behavior of finite discrete bi-threshold populations."

In this work, we introduce a PREDictive System-Level Synthesis (PredSLS) framework that designs closed-loop controllers by integrating prediction information into an affine feedback structure. Rather than focusing on worst-case uncertainty, PredSLS leverages both current state feedback and future predictions to achieve effective control in distributed settings. In particular, PredSLS enables a unified system synthesis of the optimal κ-truncated controller, therefore outperforms approaches with post hoc communication truncation, as was commonly seen in the literature. A core feature of the PredSLS is the temporal decaying property ensures that the influence of prediction errors diminishes exponentially over time, effectively localizing the effect of disturbances and enabling the use of finite impulse response approximations for efficient computation. Moreover, the PredSLS framework can be naturally decomposed into spatial and temporal components for scalable parallel computation across the network."

Bipartite negativities between the single-spin entity and the remaining spin dimer are analyzed alongside the global tripartite negativity (gTN) of the whole trimer under the effect of an external magnetic field and both easy-axis and easy-plane types of single-ion anisotropy. Interestingly, the single-ion anisotropy significantly influences the degree of entanglement by altering the stability regions of energetically preferred ground states and it may also introduce additional phases in the overall ground-state phase diagram. Moreover, even an arbitrarily small single-ion anisotropy is sufficient to generate global tripartite entanglement in a state that remains biseparable in the isotropic limit.

Problems arising during wafer manufacturing, including imperfections in surface flatness, step height variations, curvature, warping, and surface defects, directly compromise the quality of subsequent chip manufacturing processes.

Interferometry achieves wavelength-scale accuracy and operates at fast speeds, yet it necessitates an expensive, large reference plate comparable in size to the wafer. To address these issues, we developed the Ptychographical Iterative Engine Profilometry (PIEP), which attains wavelength-scale accuracy without relying on costly optical components or devices. The experimental results demonstrated that PIEP was effective in profiling the surface of 4-inch wafers. We anticipate that PIEP is a promising tool for inspection in wafer manufacturing."

However, the trade-off is that it involves complex-valued computation, especially, in the task of a matrix decomposition. To overcome the high complexity problem, the real-valued spatial search function called the mirrored angles mitigation MUSIC (MAM-MUSIC) is formulated. The unitary transformation method is used to transform the complex to real computation. The proposed MAM-MUSIC can mitigate the mirror peaks caused by the virtual array transformation (VAT-MUSIC) method. Thresholding the MAM-MUSIC spectrum is to suppress the mitigated mirror peaks providing a new search function named as the mirrored angles suppression MUSIC (MAS-MUSIC). Furthermore, complexity analysis comparison is given. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed MAS-MUSIC algorithm which has lower computational complexity and similar performance to classical MUSIC and other existing methods, particularly without virtual mirrored angles."

    "abstract": "In industrial anomaly detection, the traditional auto-associative kernel regression (AAKR) method suffers from low computational efficiency and interference from distant samples. To address these issues, this paper presents an AAKR anomaly detection method based on truncation strategies. Specifically, two Gaussian kernel weight sparsification strategies—explicit truncation and implicit truncation—are designed, which prune the kernel function by setting a distance threshold and limiting the number of neighbors, respectively. This effectively reduces the influence of historical samples with weak correlation to the target sample and significantly improves computational efficiency. Theoretically, the concept of a critical bandwidth is introduced. It is proven that with appropriate truncation parameters, when the bandwidth is below the critical value, truncation can greatly reduce computational burden while maintaining estimation accuracy; when the bandwidth is above the critical value, truncation helps enhance model performance. Numerical simulation validates the effectiveness of the proposed method, and further experiments on the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) and wind turbine (WT) datasets demonstrate that, compared with existing methods, the proposed method achieves superior performance in both fault detection and computational efficiency, exhibiting greater engineering applicability."

Within the 8–10 GHz frequency range, all chips exhibit return loss below −10 dB, and the values near the operating frequency remain below −60 dB, indicating excellent microwave performance. At 10 GHz, the measured sensitivities are 16.6fF/W for 200μm beam length, 65.6 fF/W for 300 μm beam length, and 144.4 fF/W for 400μm beam length. In comparison, the theoretical sensitivities are 27.7 fF/W, 56.2 fF/W, and 168.0 fF/W, respectively. The small deviation between the measured and theoretical results indicates high sensitivity of chips. These findings provide valuable insights for the optimization of the MEMS microwave power detection chips."

    "abstract": "We study a finite-horizon discrete-time dynamic system that is jointly controlled by a designer and an agent. The designer can influence the agent’s behavior by selectively revealing some information to the agent. Specifically, at each time step, the designer sends a message to the agent based on its private information. The agent uses the received message (and its own information) to choose its action. Both the actions of the designer and the agent influence the evolution of the underlying dynamic system and their reward structures. We are interested in the setting where the designer would like to send messages in a way that incentivizes the agent to play a specific strategy. Under certain assumptions on the information structure of the designer and the agent, we provide an algorithm to find an optimal messaging strategy for the designer that incentivizes the agent to play the desired strategy. Our algorithm requires solving a family of linear programs in a backward inductive manner."

    "abstract": "Warning: This paper contains examples of harmful language and images, and reader discretion is recommended. With the rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), ensuring their safety against adversarial attacks has become a pressing concern. Most prior research has focused on jailbreaking techniques for text-only Large Language Models (LLMs). The unique vulnerabilities of MLLMs, especially those arising from cross-modal interactions, remain under-explored, especially for the Arabic and French Languages, which are widely used in Lebanon and the region. In this work, we extend the MLLMGuard benchmark, originally designed for the English and Chinese languages, to include Arabic and French by the means of translation. Using the GuardRank framework which accompanies the benchmark, we assess the safety of an MLLM model across five dimensions: privacy, bias, toxicity, legality, and truthfulness. The results demonstrate that MLLMs remain susceptible to adversarial prompts in both Arabic and French. We further demonstrate that the integration of a lightweight safety prompt reduces the attack success rate by 10%. The research aims at raising awareness on the insecurities of MLLM and calls for more robust adversarial defenses."

The realization of highgain for such integrated devices is made more challenging by tight optical confinement and low propagation loss. In this work, we present efficient amplification in erbium-ytterbium-based heterogeneous paperclip slot waveguide via silicon nitride photonics integrated circuits. By carefully designing a heterogeneous device using optical mode propagation and dispersion-engineered, this heterostructure features a low propagation loss and high single-mode conservation at 1530 nm. A comprehensive erbiumytterbium co-doped amplifier dynamic modeling is established by introducing a quenching process, which further optimizes the parameters to improve the amplifier performance. The simulation results demonstrate that a heterogeneous paperclip slot waveguide can potentially achieve up to 27 dB/cm modal gain per unit length. This work provides a predictive design framework for endowing silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits with efficient amplification and enriches the integration of active functionalities on silicon."

    "abstract": "Robotic manipulators have nonlinear and coupled dynamics, and this situation makes accurate modeling and control difficult under parameter uncertainties and external effects. Despite the numerous suggestions for adaptive, learning-based and robust controllers, their effectiveness often depends on accurate dynamic models. The Koopman operator framework offers a data-driven alternative by representing nonlinear dynamics through linear evolution in a lifted observable space, with extended-state formulations capturing states, control inputs, and physics-informed features for improved fidelity. This paper proposes a Koopman Explicit Model Following Control (KEMFC) framework that integrates extended-state Koopman identification with Explicit Model Following Control (EMFC) for robot manipulators exhibiting nonlinear dynamics. An extended-state Koopman identification is accomplished to predict control torque from the positions and velocities of the robot manipulators. The identified Koopman operator is integrated with an EMFC law to enhance tracking performance under the presence of load, friction, and uncertainties. Numerical simulations of a three-degree-of-freedom anthropoid robotic manipulator demonstrate enhanced tracking precision and robustness. The simulation results demonstrate that KEMFC provides a systematic, data-driven methodology for model-following control for robotic systems, outperforming traditional model-based computed torque control."

Robust learning, excellent parameter adjustment, and quicker convergence are guaranteed by the Squaquila optimiser. The results demonstrate notable gains over current deep models in AQI, WPL, and WGI forecasting. The findings suggest that the model is precise, fast in learning and resistant to errors in forecasting spatial-temporal changes within the environment."

    "abstract": "Depression is a critical mental health disorder that patients often hesitate to disclose, hindering timely diagnosis and treatment. With the widespread availability of wireless infrastructure, Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI) enables contactless human activity recognition (HAR) and continuous characterization of daily behavioral patterns. This study investigates CSI-based HAR as a non-intrusive modality for depression screening and monitoring. CSI signals from five daily activities were collected using Raspberry Pi 4 devices, processed through amplitude extraction, denoising, and wavelet transformation before classification using LSTM and SVM models. The LSTM achieved 98.3% accuracy, outperforming the SVM baseline, and was deployed in a real-time dashboard with MQTT-based logging. To extend beyond classification, a rule-based framework was implemented to estimate daily depression risk from LSTM-derived activity sequences. Behavioral features were mapped to relative-risk multipliers based on prior studies, adjusted for coverage and data quality, and transformed into probabilities using a logistic function. The framework outputs risk probability and confidence scores, enabling interpretable, longitudinal monitoring. These results demonstrate the potential of CSI-based HAR, combined with rule-based modeling, to support unobtrusive screening and clinician-guided intervention for depression in everyday environments. Ethical and privacy considerations were addressed to ensure that the proposed system preserves user confidentiality while remaining appropriate for non-clinical research applications."

    "abstract": "Most existing generation scheduling models for power systems under demand uncertainty rely on energy-based formulations with a finite number of time periods, which may fail to ensure that power supply and demand are balanced continuously over time. To address this issue, we propose a robust generation scheduling model in a continuous-time framework, employing a decision rule approach. First, for a given set of demand trajectories, we formulate a general robust generation scheduling problem to determine a decision rule that maps these demand trajectories and time points to the power outputs of generators. Subsequently, we derive a surrogate of it as our model by carefully designing a class of decision rules that are affine in the current demand, with coefficients invariant over time and constant terms that are continuous piecewise affine functions of time. As a result, our model can be recast as a finite-dimensional linear program to determine the coefficients and the function values of the constant terms at each breakpoint, solvable via the cutting-plane method. Our model is non-anticipative unlike most existing continuous-time models, which use Bernstein polynomials, making it more practical. We also provide illustrative numerical examples."

However, It is difficult for ordinary users to recognize Crop Wild Relatives (CWRs), and even trained taxonomists must rely on herbarium specimens and spend considerable time studying them to confirm each species. So as per the requirement of the researchers, we tested seven optimized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures - VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and Xception using images of seven crop wild relatives of wheat and rice namely Triticum polonicum, T. durum, T. dicoccum, T. aestivum, Oryza sativa, O. rufipogon, and O. nivara. The dataset was relatively small, consisting of 1,600 images collected and conserved at ICAR-NBPGR, with contributions from both herbarium specimens as well as live plants samples from field. Images were divided into training, validation, and testing sets. Each model was evaluated on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score and graphs depicted modelwise. Xception model performs well and achieve 93% accuracy with consistently high recall and F1-scores. EfficientNet and DenseNet121 also performed competitively same as got 92% accuracy. MobileNet, while recording the lowest accuracy as 89.74%, offers practical benefits for portable or mobile applications where lightweight models are preferred. Overall, the results underline how CNN-driven identification can simplify the study of CWRs and help scientists, breeders, and farmers tap into valuable genetic resources. To extend its use beyond laboratories, we are developing a mobile app that will let users identify species directly from field images-an effort aimed at supporting sustainable crop improvement and food security worldwide.

    "abstract": "Spatial transcriptomics technologies carry out advanced sequencing analysis of molecular profiles with a spatial context, providing multi-source information essential for elucidating biological regulatory mechanisms. Nonetheless, it poses challenges in the integration of raw spatial coordinates with high-dimensional gene expression profiles in their native feature space. While spatial-aware methods effectively aggregate molecular information from local spatial neighborhoods, they fail to explore the long-range relationships associated with gene expression data. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel approach termed GraphSTAR that encodes both spatial and gene expression data into undirected graphs, characterizing the local spatial proximity and global transcriptional similarity, respectively. Through a graph aggregation process, GraphSTAR integrates these diverse data sources within a joint graph structure, effectively modeling both local neighborhood relationships and long-range functional associations. Subsequently, a reassembled graph neural network is established by incorporating the graph aggregation into the feed-forward propagation using proximal operators, progressively refining spatial-informed latent representation to decipher spatial expression patterns of genes. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphSTAR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both spatial domain identification and cell-type annotation tasks."

We study the fairness concept of v-GNEs from a comparability perspective and show that it makes an implicit assumption of unit comparability of agent’s cost functions, one of the strongest comparability notions. Further, we introduce a new solution concept, f-GNE in which a fairness metric is chosen a priori which is compatible with the comparability at hand. We introduce an electric vehicle charging game to demonstrate the fragility of v-GNE fairness and compare it to the f-GNE under various fairness metrics."

In the field of contemporary education, IKS provides useful information to solve worldwide problems like global warming, mental health problems, and ethical dilemma of artificial intelligence. In this paper, I have pointed out how IKS can be relevant in the current academic model based on its ability to bring diversity to education by promoting interdisciplinary learning, sustainability, and creative problem-solving. This has been demonstrated in the use of Vedic mathematics in techniques of computation, Ayurveda in the fields of modern medicine and the application of ancient architectural practice in the sustainability of urban design. Also, such principles as dharma (righteousness) and ahimsa (non-violence) offer a strong ethical base of solving modern challenges. Although implementing IKS in mainstream education is characterized by such challenges as a lack of awareness and resources, there are efforts to implement it, and the National Education Policy 2020 encourages its integration. The combination of conventional wisdom and contemporary approaches will help IKS produce culturally grounded, internationally effective people, which will make education innovative, inclusive, and sustainable in the 21st century."

To this end, we leverage a time-reversed system formulation and recast the attack design problem as a robust stabilization problem, the solvability of which—depending on adversarial disruption and disclosure resources—certifies the system's vulnerability to such cyber-attacks. Additionally, we introduce a barrier function-based methodology to incorporate stealth constraints, enabling a quantitative analysis of the trade-offs between attack impact and detectability. The proposed framework thus provides a rigorous foundation for cyber-resilience certification, security standardization, and the development of attack detection and mitigation strategies in industrial control systems and CPS."

In this paper, we propose a closely-coupled approach to address this problem and achieve photorealistic and faithful reproductions. Specifically, we propose a two-step image restoration model that consists of the following steps: Firstly, we train a BaseNet that incorporates a filtered feature fusion module (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$F^{3}M$</tex-math></inline-formula>) to purify degraded feature maps. Secondly, while keeping the BaseNet fixed, we train a DetailNet that utilizes a feature probabilistic model to generate high-frequency detail information. The proposed framework not only separates the reconstruction and generation processes but also deeply analyzes their interactions, leading to an optimized balance between perceptual quality and fidelity. Our approach is validated through extensive experiments on both synthetic datasets and real-world facial photographs, demonstrating significant improvements in Frechet Inception Distance (FID) scores while maintaining identity consistency. The experimental results highlight our method's state-of-the-art performance, achieving superior visual quality and processing efficiency compared to existing methods."

This paper introduces SIDRAH, a dual-phase detection framework that combines BERT-based contextual embeddings with a deep neural network (DNN) pipeline for both binary SQLi detection and fine-grained attack categorization. SIDRAH operates in two stages: an offline phase for dataset preparation, model training, and optimization, and an online phase for realtime query analysis and classification. Evaluated on benchmark datasets and diverse payload collections, SIDRAH demonstrated robust performance and accurate classification across multiple SQLi attack categories, highlighting its potential for deployment as a scalable, low-latency middleware solution for securing web applications."

We model the assignment of agents to tasks as a multi-agent constrained reinforcement learning problem in which the task specifications are set as constraints involving the global state of the team whose compliance is revealed by a vector of reward signals. We derive a stochastic dual algorithm to solve this feasibility problem in a distributed fashion over a stochastic communication network with intermittent links, with two theoretical innovations with respect to standard dual designs. First, we incorporate the dual variables into the system state to enable a cyclic assignment of agents to tasks for the relevant case in which there are more tasks than agents. And secondly, we introduce a contraction in the dual update to control the aggregate effect of communication errors across the stochastic network links. These modifications to the dual dynamics allow us to establish theoretical feasibility guarantees with probability one, which we further corroborate in a numerical experiment involving the patrolling of multiple areas by a team of robots."

Robust segmentation and effective preprocessing are necessary to highlight minute distinctions between authentic and tampered areas. This work introduces a heterogeneous thresholding approach that incorporates the Alpha-Trimmed Mean into the Minimum Cross-Entropy Thresholding (MCET) framework with different trimming parameters. The suggested method improves segmentation accuracy and facilitates trustworthy localization of forged areas by adaptively finding a balance between sensitivity to structural details and resistance to outliers. Tests on real and artificially altered medical images show that low to moderate trimming values (d = 10–40) give better segmentation metrics than standard homogeneous methods. This shows that it could be useful as a preprocessing step for clinical and forensic image authentication."

    "abstract": "Data-Driven methods have become popular tools for tackling increasingly complex design problems in systems and control. In safety critical settings, deploying these methods requires rigorous safety and performance guarantees. Unfortunately, existing approaches often achieve this requirement at the cost of sacrificing valuable data for testing and calibration, or by restricting the design space, thus leading to suboptimal performances. In this work, we introduce Pick-To-Learn (P2L) for Systems and Control, a framework that builds on recent results in sample compression theory to equip any data-driven control method with safety and performance guarantees. Crucially, P2L enables the use of all available data to jointly synthesize and certify the design, eliminating the need to set aside data for calibration or validation purposes. As a result, P2L delivers designs and certificates that improve the current state of the art. We demonstrate this on existing benchmarks in reachability analysis."

    "abstract": "Classic machine learning and deep learning methods in medicine are susceptible to computational and data privacy problems, especially in creating high-definition 3D visualizations from medical image scanning. This is a very significant problem in medical imaging, where patient privacy must be safeguarded. To counter these challenges, the present study proposes an innovation combining Federated Learning (FL) and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). Federated Learning preserves privacy by locally training models on decentralized data, with data never exposed to centralized storage and transmission attacks. Not only does this enhance privacy, but it also minimizes bandwidth demands within distributed healthcare systems, increasing it to be more scalable. At the same time, integration with NeRF improves 3D reconstruction quality, i.e., brain tumors from MRI images, with better detail and accuracy for diagnosis and treatment planning. The outcomes demonstrate groundbreaking improvements in patient privacy protection, computation efficiency, and accuracy of tumor segmentation. The federated VNet model enhanced with differential privacy methods was more accurate in terms of the Dice coefficient without additional computation overhead. The findings indicate the potential of fusing privacy-preserving machine learning and cutting-edge imaging methods as a valuable, scalable next-generation medical diagnosis and treatment planning solution."

These substations rely on intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) for real-time data exchange and control defined by the IEC 61850 standard of the Generic Object-Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) protocol. Presently, the predominant approach for anomaly detection in standardized GOOSE communications relies on Machine Learning (ML) techniques. While these methods demonstrate impressive accuracy, ML techniques face the challenge of needing retraining whenever new attack types arise. This retraining process involves gathering extensive datasets, leaving the system vulnerable in the interim. The proposed work aims to utilize the contextual understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT for anomaly detection in the GOOSE protocol. We achieved this by developing a method to feed ChatGPT full GOOSE network packet traces and provide suggestions on identifying attack types, thereby incorporating Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) training. We also aimed to explore the potential of LLMs to offer comprehensive insights and explanations, known as Natural Language Explanations, regarding potential attacks.

In Sri Lanka, there were over 300,000 DHH individuals who relied on Sri Lankan Sign Language (SLSL), which consists of Sinhala and Tamil sign variations, and technological solutions leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) remain limited. This paper presents a systematic review of research on SLSL recognition, emphasizing recent developments in Computer Vision, Deep Learning (DL), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) for SLSL translation. It highlighted technologies such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), MediaPipe-based feature extraction, few-shot learning, and multimodal systems, while identifying the present gaps, including the grammatically correct sentence level recognition, fingerspelling and lexical limitations and limited integration with Large Language Models (LLMs) like Generative Pre-training Transformer (GPT). This paper also explores and discusses the publicly available datasets, including the SSL50 and SSL400, highlighting their role in SLSL recognition and language translation using a critical analysis. Finally, it proposes a conceptual end-to-end framework that connects gesture recognition with LLM-based system to enable natural, context-aware communication for the Sri Lankan DHH community. The study concludes by outlining key research directions for developing scalable, inclusive, and linguistically grounded SLSL-LLM systems for accessibility in Sri Lanka and other Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs)."

We first demonstrate correctness and monotone refinement of guarantees for two subsystems. Then, we extend our approach to general networks of L subsystems using weighted combinations of interconnection effects. We instantiate the framework on linear systems by meeting finite-horizon safety, exact-time reachability, and finite-horizon reachability specifications, and on nonlinear systems by fulfilling general finite-horizon specifications. Our approach is demonstrated through numerical linear examples and a nonlinear DC microgrid case study, showcasing the impact of our framework on verifying temporal logic specifications with compositional reasoning."

In these systems, the agents’ collective behavior can drive the ES into undesirable states and significantly compromise its stability and safety. In this paper, we propose a method using control barrier functions to design payoffs that can guide the population’s strategy selection while ensuring safe and stable behavior of the ES. We first address the need to avoid undesirable population states in the EDM. We then extend our approach to coupled EDM-ES systems, where the designed payoffs can prevent undesirable states and guarantee convergence to a target state. Finally, we establish general conditions under which the designed payoffs remain effective across different classes of EDMs, ensuring broad applicability. Numerical simulations validate our approach in both standalone EDMs and coupled EDM-ES systems that satisfy the proposed conditions."

To support the usability framework, the initiated study integrates the application of theoretical assessment by conducting McCall’s Quality Model with the numeric assessment of actual usage. Subsequent t-tests, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests are performed to determine the probability of predominance between usability score outcomes, which serves as empirical verification of the proposed framework. Based on synthetic data and activity scenarios, this research performs comprehensive comparative experiments across various e-commerce platforms. A detailed analysis of a case establishes the integration of the levels of user experience and system requirements as well as the benefits and drawbacks of the suggested model. Effects established show that utilization of the proposed model provides modularity and versatility, alongside with high user satisfaction and system efficiency. This research benefits the field by translating the theory into empirical analysis to give a solid structure that can be applied in highly complex distributed database systems.

The approach relies on position measurements of vehicles surrounding the autonomous vehicle (AV), obtained through remote sensing, resulting in a subsequent time delay due to communication latency. The proposed deep learning KKL observer is designed to compensate for this delay and to ensure global asymptotic convergence of the estimation of position and speed by using a chain of sub-observers. We employ an unsupervised learning-based approach to identify the nonlinear injective map involved in the KKL observer design, as well as its left inverse. Based on the obtained mappings, a chain of observers is designed in the latent space, ensuring global asymptotic convergence in both coordinates. The performance of the proposed deep learning-based KKL chain of observer estimation approach is evaluated through numerical simulations and validated using experimental data. Our findings underscore the importance of the KKL-based chain of observers in compensating for output-delayed measurements, thereby establishing a relationship between delay bounds and the number of sub-observers while ensuring stable performance in mixed-autonomy traffic environments."

    "abstract": "With the advancement of wireless communication innovation to 5G, VANET transcends preservation, analysis, security, and energy constraints to produce a smart and effective next-generation transit infrastructure. A huge volume of organized and unorganized information has been produced from many uses in the smart city setting over the past decade due to the rapid development of innovations like the IoTs, edge computing, and 5G. As a result, advanced methods that can effectively handle such massive amounts of data must be developed. Uses for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), among the key elements of smart cities, include entertainment, tracking, real-time traffic inspection, and more. Nonetheless, the investigation sector has serious worries about its accessibility, efficiency, and security. Due to their heavy reliance on centralized systems and the associated costs of significant network installation, the current approaches as wireless networks and cloud computing, is not exactly ideal. Classical data analysis techniques are additionally unable to effectively handle scaled and flexible statistics. To address these problems, this paper suggests an innovative vehicle communication method in which edge computation systems are suggested to enhance wireless network security. Secured V2V and V2E communication is subsequently developed utilizing a statistical structure called the Quotient filtering system. For VANETs with edge computing units and 5G networks, an intelligent security architecture has been developed to improve communication and computational skills in the context of contemporary smart cities. It was shown empirically that using edge points as a bridge between the cloud and the automobile lowers access delay and prevents core system traffic, enabling prompt decision-making depending on traffic conditions in the automobile's geographical area. The suggested plan functions better than traditional vehicle systems by offering a safe, energy-effective platform with the least amount of latency."

Classical identification methods typically assume system stability or rely on multiple independent trajectories, which limits their applicability to real-world scenarios where only a single rollout is available. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient online algorithm for system identification based on a novel autoregressive with exogenous input (ARX) formulation derived using the Cayley-Hamilton theorem. This transformation allows us to express the outputs as a linear function of a fixed number of past inputs and outputs, leading to a bounded-noise regression problem regardless of the trajectory length. Our method enables recursive parameter identification using instrumental variable approach and avoids the unbounded noise growth common in existing Markov-parameter-based methods. We provide a theoretical analysis of the model structure and validate its effectiveness through numerical simulations. Compared to recent methods such as prefiltered least squares and multi-rollout ordinary least squares, our approach achieves significantly lower estimation error, particularly in the marginally stable regimes."

    "abstract": "The increasing complexity of machine learning models highlights the need for interpretability, especially in critical domains requiring trust and transparency. Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) is a popular eXplainable AI (XAI) method that provides localized, instance-specific explanations using an interpretable surrogate model. However, its effectiveness is limited by the lack of systematic guidelines for tuning its hyperparameters. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing Automatic LIME (AutoLIME), a bi-level optimization framework to tune LIME’s kernel width. Additionally, we introduce PieceWise Affine LIME (PWA-LIME), a clustering-based extension of LIME for multi-instance explanations, particularly useful for interpreting black-box models of dynamical systems. Preliminary numerical results validate the potential of these methods in explaining opaque dynamical models."

As systems are now more and more complex, especially with the development of AI and data science, the concept has thus become more ambiguous. Furthermore, many such systems are for safety-critical operation. More research is needed to enhance system reliability and safety by incorporating proper maintenance strategies. In this talk, we will explore several challenges related to dependability from both analytical and management decision-making perspectives. We will present our previous and ongoing research aimed at enhancing system modeling and reliability analysis for intelligent systems."

    "abstract": "In the past couple of decades, non-quadratic convex penalties have reshaped signal processing and machine learning; in robust control, however, general convex costs break the Riccati and value function structure that make the design tractable. Practitioners thus default to approximations, heuristics or robust model predictive control that are solved online for short horizons. We close this gap by extending H<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">∞</inf> control of discrete-time linear systems to strictly convex penalties on state, input, and disturbance, recasting the objective with Bregman divergences that admit a completion-of-squares decomposition. The result is a closed-form, time-invariant, full-information stabilizing controller that minimizes a worst-case performance ratio over the infinite horizon. Necessary and sufficient existence/optimality conditions are given by a Riccati-like identity together with a concavity requirement; with quadratic costs, these collapse to the classical H<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">∞</inf> algebraic Riccati equation and the associated negative-semidefinite condition, recovering the linear central controller.

    "abstract": "Flapping-Wing Aerial Vehicles (FWAVs) offer unique advantages over traditional fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft, including superior maneuverability, energy efficiency, and the capability to navigate through cluttered environments. These features make them highly promising for applications in reconnaissance, search, rescue, and exploration of confined spaces. However, many designs cannot morph or fold their wings, significantly restricting their adaptability during flight. Without active morphing, these vehicles struggle to optimize their wing configurations for different flight modes, reducing overall efficiency and agility. Additionally, many of them are designed with synchronized wing motions, preventing independent control of the left and right wings or variations in flapping amplitudes, which further limits their dynamic performance and maneuverability. To overcome these challenges, a biologically inspired FWAV, KRoSwan, featuring an active folding-wing mechanism, is developed. This system employs servo motors as direct-drive actuators, enabling simultaneous control of both flapping and folding motions. This novel approach significantly enhances the degrees of freedom in wing movement, granting improved agility and adaptability. The methodology involves designing the robotic platform, formulating its dynamic and aerodynamic models, and conducting extensive flight tests to validate its performance. This research advances the development of FWAVs by integrating active wing morphing and independent wing control, paving the way for more agile, adaptable, and efficient bio-inspired aerial robots."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel method for computing the optimal feedback gain of the infinite-horizon Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem via an ordinary differential equation. We introduce a novel continuous-time Bellman error, derived from the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which quantifies the suboptimality of stabilizing policies and is parametrized in terms of the feedback gain. We analyze its properties, including its effective domain, smoothness, and coerciveness, and show the existence of a unique stationary point within the stability region. Furthermore, we derive a closed-form gradient expression of the Bellman error that induces a gradient flow. This converges to the optimal feedback and generates a unique trajectory that exclusively comprises stabilizing feedback policies. Additionally, this work advances interesting connections between LQR theory and Reinforcement Learning (RL) by redefining suboptimality of the Algebraic Riccati Equation (ARE) as a Bellman error, adapting a state-independent formulation, and leveraging Lyapunov equations to overcome the infinite-horizon challenge. We validate our method in a simulation and compare it to the state of the art."

    "abstract": "Robotic table-top grasping, a.k.a. bin-picking of unknown heterogeneous objects that are put together is a challenging problem due to clutter and uncertainty in depth-data. Out of many types of solutions to this problem, one uses a category-agnostic instance segmentation step before a grasp-planning step to segment out the object boundaries. Recently, various such methods have been proposed that use depth data produced from industrial-grade sensors, as input to their trained deep-learning models to reliably segment out the object instances in the cluttered bin. However, generally, with the commonly used commodity-grade depth sensors, the obtained depth data is noisy, particularly unreliable for non-opaque and thin objects. One other challenge could be time efficiency if the grasp-planning step needs to process each of the segmented objects in the grasp-planning step. To address these challenges, we propose a unified depth-independent CNN design that aims to co-learn category-agnostic instance segmentation, instance- wise grasp-confidence-scores (GCS), and monocular depth estimation, given the RGB image of the scene as the input. The estimated depth is used to detect collisions in grasp pose prediction and to transform the planner grasp pose to the 3D world coordinates. A novel GCS branch is developed into the instance-segmentation model to help filter the detected object instances based on their graspability, avoiding the need of processing each object for grasp planning. A custom-generated synthetic dataset is leveraged to train the proposed CNN architecture. We show through experimentation that our proposed bin-picking system can reliably pick various kinds of unknown objects (opaque, non-opaque, and thin objects) from a clutter of around 20-40 objects."

In general, the level of uncertainty about the environment perceived by a competitor directly affects their performance. Therefore, having a clear understanding between uncertainty and performance has become a relevant research interest. Intuitively, it is expected that reducing uncertainty offers better guarantees in terms of the resulting performance. However, in this work, we provide a characterization that shows that reduced uncertainty does not guarantee better performance. Furthermore, it can be detrimental. We present such characterization in the context of asymmetric all-pay auctions, a standard model to study competitive interactions. By analyzing the resulting behavior of the competitors in terms of the Bayesian Nash equilibrium, we identify scenarios where acquiring better information not only does not affect the performance but also can be detrimental to it."

Multiple metrics including contextual accuracy, relevance, factual consistency, latency and cost-efficiency serve as evaluation criteria for the models. The outcomes of other models are extrapolated from Gemini's complete implementation through extensive documentation and public benchmarks along with qualitative evaluation methods. The evaluation demonstrates that Gemini delivers better contextual relevancy along with faster inference speeds but GPT-4 demonstrates stronger coherence combined with more precise factual accuracy.

A transformation is designed to convert the nonlinear system into a linear one, utilizing the Volterra integral operator to mitigate the effects of initialization errors. Neural network techniques are then applied to learn both the transformation and its inverse. As a result, the state variables of the nonlinear system can be accurately tracked using the estimated transformation, providing enhanced robustness against measurement noise and model uncertainty. Specifically, the proposed approach reduces the trade-off between convergence speed and noise immunity, which is often influenced by the choice of observer eigenvalue. The paper provides comprehensive error analysis and validation through simulations."

    "abstract": "For personalized anesthesia, it is crucial to have accurate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models of anesthetic drugs. Typically, total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) relies on the combined administration of propofol and remifentanil, which affect the bispectral index (BIS). This paper proposes a model reduction method that exploits the use of a fixed administration ratio between propofol and remifentanil, which is consistent with the clinical practice. Using a fourth-order ARX model, we estimate the effect-site concentration and fit the BIS response using a Hill function, thus implicitly considering the coadministration as if it was a single drug. The identification process is performed using a branch and bound approach, leveraging BIS data obtained during the induction of anesthesia. The identified model is then validated during the maintenance phase of anesthesia against models that are usually employed in clinical practice, where propofol and remifentanil are separately modeled. Results obtained on real BIS data show the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

Intrusion detection system can easily handle high frequency known attacks but the detection of low frequency attacks always presents a significant challenge. The low frequency attacks usually remain undetected, primarily due to imbalanced dataset. Traditional Machine learning Classifiers often underperform in identifying low frequency attacks when encounters imbalanced data distribution. This paper addresses the problem of imbalanced dataset and proposes its solution through application of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Random Oversampling techniques. Adequate representation of minority classes is confirmed by Random Oversampling during model training, and GANs creates realistic synthetic samples of these classes. Proposed method incorporated both the techniques on a benchmark intrusion dataset UNR-IDD. Decision tree is selected as classifier and finds that through GAN low occurrence detection accuracy increases by 22% and with Random Oversampling detection accuracy of low occurrence attacks improves by 24%, without substantially raising the false positives."

To verify the system performance, load tests were respectively carried out under the PLC control mode and the emergency control mode, and the calculations were conducted through the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) model.

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as powerful and flexible platforms for a wide range of intelligent vision applications, including surveillance, search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and traffic analysis. At the core of these applications lies Visual Object Detection (VOD), which provides the fundamental capability of identifying and localizing objects of interest from aerial imagery. However, UAV-based visual detection remains a highly challenging problem due to factors such as drastic object scale variation, frequent occlusions, complex background clutter, and motion-induced distortions caused by dynamic aerial viewpoints. These challenges significantly degrade the robustness and generalization ability of existing detectors, particularly in small-object and high-altitude scenes. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a semantic-enhanced detection framework that integrates text-guided semantic priors into a Detection Transformer (DETR)-based architecture for UAV imagery. Leveraging multimodal learning, the proposed method incorporates high-level textual descriptions extracted via a pretrained vision-language model to enrich the visual feature representation and enhance discriminative capacity under challenging aerial conditions. Specifically, semantic embeddings from the text modality are fused with multiscale image features within the transformer encoder, enabling the detector to reason about object semantics, contextual relationships, and category dependencies in a unified end-toend manner. This multimodal enhancement enables the model to adapt more effectively to varying scenes and object scales without requiring extensive manual tuning. The proposed method is extensively validated on multiple benchmark UAV datasets, including VisDrone-2019 and UAVVaste, where it demonstrates superior detection performance, particularly in scenarios involving small objects and dense occlusions."

    "abstract": "Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS) deployment has been growing exponentially due to the fast integration of Electric Vehicles (EVs). These stations do not just handle the transfer of energy between the power grid and EVs, but also the delicate payment and user authentication procedures. Therefore, EVCS systems are becoming appealing to cyber attackers that want to take advantage of the existing vulnerabilities at grid interfaces and payment points. Privacy integrity and availability of such essential infrastructures are seriously threatened by data-leaking events, malware infection, ransomware and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. “we have to have a substantial amount of control over the data, both on an information network and the physical operations themselves.” — these breaches can also result in theft or alteration of financial data, and mismanagement of charging operations, energy theft and potentially destabilization of the grid. This study prescribes a holistic cybersecurity architecture including solutions for both grid communication links, as well as payment processing subsystems at EVCS locations. The method combines multi-factor authentication, anti-malware, malware detection/prevention, and secure communication protocols for an end-to-end secure operation. To avoid unauthorized access or manipulation in the command of energy transfer, encrypted communication with mutual authentication is implemented on grid interfaces. Tokenization, two-factor authentication and process of identification and verification for advanced fraud detection are methods that protect the payment gateways and financial transactions. Malware is combated with constant system monitoring, signature-based scanning and AI-based anomaly detection that can detect zero-day threats by identifying when things are not operating as they should be. Also, the solution includes firmware integrity check to prevent malicious attacks and uses segmentation to separate the payment network from the grid control systems, allowing the two to be isolated from each other - thus reducing the likelihood of cross system compromise. The experimental results are obtained on a simulated EVCS network with real-world charging and payment transactions data for different cyberattack scenarios, such as man-in-the-middle, SQL injection, phishing-based credential theft, and malware injection. Experiments showed a 97.8 % detection rate, a 90 % of the payment fraud attempts prevented and a very low overhead <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(&lt;50 \\text{ms})$</tex> to normal charging or payment operations. The proposed framework provides a mechanism to make the infrastructure of EVCS a layered defensed system that can address operation and finance security issues together. The project increases trust in EV uptake, strengthens regulatory adherence to data protection laws, and erects a resilient shield against advancing cyber threats within an expanding smart mobility environment. This study illustrates that, in addition to safeguarding monetary transactions, active cybersecurity is necessary to ensure the security of the operation of power systems linked to EV charging systems."

Leveraging a synthetic dataset comprising diverse investor profiles characterized by income, risk tolerance, investment goals, and horizons the model categorizes users into risk segments and maps them to asset allocation strategies using historical return data from three ETFs: SPY, QQQ, and AGG. The system integrates SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) and decision trees to provide human-interpretable justifications for each recommendation. Results confirm that portfolio allocations align with established investment theory, with high risk profiles yielding higher returns alongside greater volatility. Statistical validation (p<0.001) supports a significant positive relationship between risk score and portfolio performance. The incorporation of explainability techniques improved clarity and user trust, demonstrating the practical value of transparent AI in digital wealth management and regulatory compliance."

    "abstract": "We study the problem of constructing controlled supermartingale functions to synthesize feedback laws that guarantee safety properties of stochastic differential equations (SDE) with control inputs. SDEs are widely used to model continuous time stochastic processes with applications ranging from financial markets to biology. In this paper, we extend classic notions from martingale theory for stochastic processes to prove that a given SDE will not exit a safe region over some finite time horizon with high probability. Our notion considers time-varying supermartingale functions that provide sharper probability bounds when compared to those that are time-independent. Furthermore, we study the controlled version of these supermartingales and the problem of synthesizing feedback control law that will maintain the state within a safe set with high probability over a given finite time horizon. We provide a projection-based algorithm for synthesizing polynomial, time-varying controlled supermartingales and corresponding feedback laws using sum-of-square (SOS) programming techniques. We implement our approach on some challenging numerical examples to demonstrate how it can synthesize control feedback laws that provide upper bounds on the probability of safety violations over a given time horizon."

We propose a data-driven procedure to learn these projections from trajectories and demonstrate its effectiveness through a 180-dimensional robotic system. Our reduced-order models achieve up to fivefold improvement in trajectory tracking accuracy under model predictive control compared to the state of the art."

    "abstract": "Accurate forecasting of tourist arrivals in Sri Lanka, a vital economic sector, is challenged by significant volatility and structural breaks, particularly the profound COVID-19 pandemic. This research develops and evaluates a comprehensive deep learning pipeline for predicting univariate monthly tourist arrivals to support strategic planning. The paper’s contribution is threefold: first, we propose an interpretable N-BEATS model that utilizes a novel two-stage transfer learning strategy to explicitly manage the COVID-19 structural break. An ablation study demonstrates that our transfer learning methodology significantly reduces forecast error by 59.7% (RMSE: 42,252 to 17,007) compared to standard end-to-end training ($\\mathrm{p}=0.027$, Diebold-Mariano test). Second, we rigorously benchmark this model against a strong Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) baseline, providing comprehensive comparative analysis across 13 key performance metrics and statistical tests. The proposed N-BEATS model achieves consistent improvements over LSTM across all metrics ($\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}} \\boldsymbol{:} \\mathbf{0. 8 6 6}$ vs $\\mathbf{0. 8 2 4}$; MAPE: $\\mathbf{7. 5 5 \\%}$ vs $\\mathbf{9. 7 3 \\%}$; RMSE: 17,007 vs 19,470) while providing interpretable trend-seasonality decomposition unavailable in black-box LSTM architectures. Third, we provide a completely replicable implementation to facilitate widespread real-world applications. Beyond accuracy gains, this work critically contributes a validated methodological framework for effectively handling structural breaks in tourism forecasting, offering a vital case study for time series prediction in volatile contexts."

Although research in this area has accelerated, reproducible evaluation, leak-proof validation, and cost-aware deployment are inconsistently addressed, limiting practical impact. A dual-reviewer Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol was applied across IEEE Xplore, Scopus, Web of Science, SSRN, and the ACM Digital Library to screen studies on equity forecasting using Open-High-Low-Close-Volume (OHLCV), returns, and volatility. The review synthesizes model families and features, normalizes evaluation practices around rolling-origin, walk-forward, and embargoed splits, and appraises deployment realism via transaction costs, slippage, order execution logic, latency, and capacity constraints. Outcomes highlight recurrent risks: split leakage, lookahead in indicator computation, weak or absent baselines, omission of costs, and sparse external or cross-market tests; under these controls, deep learning often fails to dominate simpler machine learning alternatives, and feature engineering with rigorous leakage control frequently determines success. The study standardizes primary metrics including Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and directional accuracy, and recommends statistical testing via the Superior Predictive Ability (SPA) test with False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction. The contribution is a taxonomy linking methods, markets, and evaluation outcomes, together with a deploymentaware reporting framework that specifies leakage controls, cost modeling, latency, and capacity indicators. Transaction costs reshape apparent performance. The guidance supports researchers and practitioners in designing comparable, reproducible studies and in selecting methods suited to realistic trading constraints."

    "abstract": "To match the growing demand for bio-methane production, anaerobic digesters need to embrace the co-digestion of different feedstocks; in addition, to improve the techno-economic performance, an optimal and time-varying adaptation of the input diet is required. These operation modes constitute a very hard challenge for the limited instrumentation and control equipment typically installed aboard full-scale plants. A model-based predictive approach may be able to handle such control problem, but the identification of reliable predictive models is limited by the low information content typical of the data available from full-scale plants’ operations, which entail high parametric uncertainty. In this work, the application of a tube-based robust nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is proposed to regulate bio-methane production over a period of diet change in time, while warranting safe operation and dealing with uncertainties. In view of its upcoming validation on a true small pilot-scale plant, the NMPC capabilities are assessed via numerical simulations designed to resemble as much as possible the experimental setup, along with some practical final considerations."

Current E-learning systems face significant vulnerabilities, including unauthorized access, data breaches, identity fraud, and compromised assessment integrity, collectively threatening user privacy and institutional credibility. Existing security implementations often create friction through cumbersome authentication procedures, complex password requirements, and intrusive monitoring systems that negatively impact user satisfaction and learning outcomes. The significant research gap addressed in this comprehensive review is understanding the optimal balance between robust security implementations and seamless user experience in E-learning environments, where traditional security measures frequently conflict with usability principles. This study proposes the Security-Enhanced User Experience Model for E-learning (SEUEM) systems, a conceptual framework integrating advanced security constructs, including biometric authentication, machine learning-based trust models, and blockchain credentialing into established user experience frameworks. Key contributions include adaptive authentication mechanisms that adjust security levels based on contextual risk assessment, frictionless biometric systems enhancing both security and user convenience, and blockchain-based credentialing systems ensuring tamper-proof certification while maintaining accessibility. Future research directions encompass quantifying the cognitive load of multifactor authentication protocols, balancing surveillance with learner autonomy and ethics, incorporating accessibility in biometric systems, and addressing blockchain credentialing scalability under high-volume assessment conditions."

Following the PRISMA framework, 26 peer-reviewed studies published between 2018 and 2025 were analyzed to identify trends, pedagogical outcomes, and research gaps. Unlike previous surveys that primarily focused on algorithmic performance, this review uniquely emphasizes the pedagogical integration of AI-driven SQL tutoring tools. A two-dimensional taxonomy was developed to categorize reviewed studies based on NLP technique type (rule-based, Seq2Seq, and Large Language Model) and application focus (educational or general-purpose). The synthesis reveals that LLM-based systems dominate recent developments, offering enhanced contextual understanding and adaptive feedback. However, challenges remain regarding scalability, error interpretation, and alignment with instructional design principles. Findings indicate that NLPpowered chatbots significantly improve learner engagement, motivation, and conceptual understanding by enabling natural language query generation and real-time feedback. Nonetheless, pedagogical grounding and long-term learning evaluation are limited. The review identifies key future directions, including pedagogically informed feedback mechanisms, scalable model design, and integration into learning management systems. Overall, this review contributes a structured synthesis and taxonomy that links technical progress with educational theory, providing a foundation for developing intelligent, theory-driven SQL tutoring systems that bridge language, logic, and learning."

This research addresses the limitations of manual and conventional analysis by investigating the efficacy of machine learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), for automated anomaly detection. A quantitative experimental methodology was employed, wherein a controlled lab environment was established to simulate three common and critical attack techniques: Brute Force, Privilege Escalation (specifically UAC Bypass), and Log Clearing. The resulting dataset underwent rigorous preprocessing, including feature engineering, dimensionality reduction via PCA, and class balancing using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). A GNN model was developed to capture the complex relational structure inherent in log data and its performance was benchmarked against a suite of traditional machine learning classifiers. The results demonstrate the clear superiority of the graph-based approach, with the GNN achieving an accuracy of 96.56% and an F1-score of 97.93%, significantly outperforming the next-best model, Random Forest (92.04% accuracy). The findings confirm that by modeling the contextual relationships between events, rather than treating them as isolated data points, GNNs provide a more robust and accurate method for identifying malicious activities. Key contributions of this research include the generation of a new, high-fidelity labeled dataset based on realistic attack simulations and empirical evidence that graph-based models can substantially enhance the speed and precision of DFIR processes, offering a powerful tool for modern cybersecurity operations."

The kernel of the modulation operator for input-output systems is called the modulating function, having the resulting filter characteristics dictated by this choice. Since this selection is crucial in the filter design process, different functions have been proposed over the years, until a different approach was introduced: obtaining the modulating function as a solution to an auxiliary problem. This approach is, in fact, common within mathematics, and well-known functions, such as hyperbolic sine and cosine, are obtained as the solution to a particular auxiliary system. Intriguingly, hyperbolic functions generate 4 new types of modulating functions in a simple manner. Moreover, 12 types of mixed hyperbolic modulating functions are obtained by using different hyperbolic functions to satisfy the boundary conditions. Lastly, an application example shows that hyperbolic modulating functions can display significantly lower bias than polynomial modulating functions."

    "abstract": "Persistence of excitation (PE) is an important requirement for the successful operation of data-driven predictive control, as it ensures that the input–output data contains sufficient information about the underlying system dynamics. Nonetheless, this property is usually assumed rather than guaranteed. This paper introduces a novel data-driven predictive control formulation that maintains PE. The technical development that allows this is the characterisation of the nonexciting input set (NIS), i.e., the set of inputs that lead to loss of PE, and the consequent derivation of a pair of disjoint, linear inequality constraints on the input, termed NIS exclusion PE (NISE–PE) constraint, that, if satisfied, maintain PE. When used in a predictive control formulation, these constraints lead to a mixed-integer optimal control problem with a single binary variable or, equivalently, a pair of disjoint quadratic programming problems that can be efficiently and reliably solved. Numerical examples show how these constraints are able to maintain PE during the controller’s operation, resulting in improved performance over conventional approaches for both time-invariant and time-varying systems."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of pest populations in urban environments leads to high risks for health, food security, and urban infrastructure. Pest identification must be accurate to take effective measures to control the pests. Urban pests, however, tend to have visual traits that match the background, thus making it difficult to spot them due to the background clutter, visual obstruction and morphological similarity among the species. This study investigates the use of fine-tuned Vision Transformers (ViTs) for urban pest classification and benchmarks their performance against a conventional ResNet-50 convolutional neural network. A comprehensive dataset of 25,990 images of 19 pest species was captured that include various types of real-world settings. Both models were trained under identical pre-processing and augmentation settings. Model performance was evaluated using precision, accuracy, recall, and F1-score and finally validated by independent two-sample t-tests. This finding indicated that ViT achieved a test accuracy of 97.86%, outperforming ResNet50 ‘s accuracy of 88.38%. Moreover, ViT attained enhanced mean precision (0.977 vs. 0.884), recall (0.979 vs. 0.891), and F1score (0.979 vs. 0.881), with all enhancements being statistically significant ($p\\lt0.05$). These findings confirm that there are high accuracy and generalization of ViTs, but also demonstrate increased resistance to visual clutter and occlusion. The present research offers a statistically valid analysis of ViT performance in urban pest classification and thus demonstrates the possibility of deploying it in real-time in smart pest management systems."

We show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy by providing numerical results on a neural network trained to approximate a Model Predictive Controller (MPC).

To maintain long-term identity tracking across multiple sessions and camera views, an OmniScale ReIdentification (ReID) model is integrated with a curated reference-image-set of workers. This enables the system to associate detected individuals with named profiles, allowing precise violation attribution and temporal tracking beyond single-day monitoring. The reference-image-set enhances the reliability of person matching and ensures that compliance logs are consistently linked to the correct worker.

Traditional deterministic models and reactive maintenance strategies are inadequate for modern industrial applications, where assets are expected to operate continuously under varying loads and environmental conditions. The challenge is compounded by the prevalence of censored data, where the exact time of failure is unknown for many components. To address this critical need, this paper proposes a novel framework for a digital twin dedicated to prognostics and health management (PHM). Our methodology leverages the power of survival analysis, a statistical branch uniquely suited to modeling time-to-event data with censoring. We utilize a Random Survival Forest model to establish a probabilistic relationship between operational parameters and a component's remaining useful life (RUL). The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset, integrating physically-informed features to enhance its predictive capability. Through a rigorous cross-validation process, we demonstrate the robustness and generalization of our approach. The framework's performance is evaluated using key metrics that assess both its ability to rank components by their failure risk and the accuracy of its probabilistic predictions over time. The results indicate that the developed digital twin possesses an exceptional ability to differentiate between high and low-risk components and provides highly reliable survival probability curves. This capability enables a significant paradigm shift from reactive to proactive maintenance, allowing for the optimization of asset management, the reduction of unplanned downtime, and a marked improvement in system safety. The proposed framework provides a compelling and generalizable solution for building effective digital twins that can guide decision-making in real-world engineering applications."

We first introduce a hybrid linear system (HLS) representation to describe the input/output behavior of sampled-data systems. Based on this HLS representation, we next establish some DLMI conditions that ensure that the ${{\\mathcal{L}}_{\\infty /2}}$-induced norms are less than a pregiven γ (> 0). These conditions lead to controller synthesis procedures for ensuring that the resulting sampled-data systems are asymptotically stable and their ${{\\mathcal{L}}_{\\infty /2}}$-induced norms are less than a pregiven γ (> 0). Finally, some numerical examples are given to validate the theoretical results developed in this paper."

This study investigates the prevalence and impact of the hue effect within undergraduate software engineering teams in Sri Lanka, focusing on its influence on peer and instructor evaluations, leadership selection, and role distribution. Using a quantitative, cross-sectional survey, data were collected from 192 undergraduates with prior group project experience via a structured, five-section questionnaire. Responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics and unsupervised machine learning (K-Means clustering) to identify underlying patterns in perceptions of bias, teamwork dynamics, and self-awareness. The Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis identified three distinct clusters: (1) students with balanced perceptions of fairness and teamwork, (2) students more sensitive to bias and undervaluation, and (3) students demonstrating heightened selfreflection and awareness of their team role and influence. Analysis of mitigation strategies revealed strong student support for structured rubrics and moderate support for anonymous peer evaluations, alongside preferences for instructor-led monitoring, role rotation, and bias-awareness training. The findings highlight that evaluation fairness in team projects is shaped not only by technical contribution but also by interpersonal impressions, with implications for inclusivity, motivation, and equitable skill recognition. This research contributes context-specific evidence from South Asia, offering actionable recommendations for academic policy, including structured evaluation criteria, partial anonymity in peer reviews, and targeted interventions to address perception-based bias in collaborative learning environments."

Traditional control systems are often ill equipped to handle the complex, constantly changing conditions of a modern smart grid. This paper introduces a new framework that uses Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to automate and optimize smart grid operations. At the core of our approach is a Deep Q Network (DQN) agent, which learns to make intelligent, real-time decisions about managing energy flow choosing whether to store, release, or conserve power. The agent was trained within a simulated urban environment, driven by a dataset reflecting hourly changes in power demand and green energy production. Its objective was to master a policy that maximizes a custom reward signal, carefully designed to weigh the competing goals of grid stability and overall energy efficiency. Our findings confirm the viability of using DRL as a powerful tool for autonomous grid management, contributing to the development of more reliable and sustainable energy infrastructure for future cities."

To this end, a dynamic threshold switching (DTS) scheme is introduced, enabling real-time selection between THz and RF links based on the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio. A complete analytical framework is developed, incorporating hardware impairments, pointing errors, and generalized <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\alpha -\\mu$</tex-math></inline-formula> fading in both RF and THz domains. The model incorporates deterministic RIS gains and frequency-dependent THz absorption, offering practical insights into the joint impact of RIS geometry, beam width, and switching thresholds. Closed-form expressions for outage probability, symbol error rate, ergodic capacity, and energy efficiency are derived. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the proposed model and demonstrate that the hybrid system outperforms single-band THz or RF links and traditional diversity combining schemes. Additionally, increasing RIS elements improves performance and reduces transmit power requirements, with energy efficiency trends identifying optimal RIS configurations for practical deployment. These findings establish RIS-assisted hybrid THz/RF systems as a key enabler of reliable, high-capacity 6G communication for autonomous vehicles and smart factories."

The framework integrates hybrid natural language generation with a context-aware collaborative filtering recommendation engine, supported by fine-tuned transformer models for intent recognition and entity extraction. This combination enables the chatbot to deliver highly relevant, individualized suggestions while maintaining conversational fluidity. In contrast to traditional rule-based or classic machine learning baselines, the proposed system demonstrates measurable improvements in both accuracy and user experience. The adoption of distributed caching mechanisms ensures low-latency responses, allowing the chatbot to scale effectively in high-traffic retail environments. Empirical evaluations show significant gains in query classification accuracy, entity F 1 score, recommendation relevance, and dialogue completion, with users reporting overall higher satisfaction in experiments conducted on the MultiWOZ 2.1 retail subset. Beyond technical performance, the system showcases how intelligent dialogue agents can drive business value by improving product discovery, increasing conversion rates, and fostering stronger customer engagement. Future research should focus on dynamic knowledge integration, improved handling of context-switching, and continual learning to enhance adaptability in evolving retail scenarios.

    "abstract": "The dual control problem, first introduced by Feldbaum in the 1960s, is recognized as encapsulating the \"exploration versus exploitation\" dilemma, central to online learning and control. Numerous heuristic-based exploration methods have been developed to facilitate active learning. However, the theoretically optimal solution provided by dynamic programming (DP) remains computationally intractable for most problems due to the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we revisit the DP framework within the context of regret minimization for a simple real-time optimization problem, aiming to identify valuable insights and uncover new avenues for simplified DP-based exploration strategies. By deriving the two-horizon DP solution in our simple setting, we observe that the optimal input is obtained by solving a closed-form optimization problem composed of two distinct components representing exploration and exploitation separately, clearly highlighting their inherent trade-off. For longer horizons, receding and cyclic horizon control based on the iterative application of the two-horizon DP provide possible approximations, reducing computational complexity while yielding useful suboptimal control policies. A key advantage of the DP-based exploration method is its ability to automatically adjust the exploration based on the current exploitation and system uncertainty. The proposed method is studied numerically through comparative evaluations against classical heuristic exploration methods from the literature."

We prove that this adaptive controller provides desirable linear-like closed-loop behavior which guarantees a bound consisting of: exponential decay with respect to the initial condition, a linear-like convolution bound with respect to the exogenous inputs, and a constant scaled by the square root of the constant in the denominator of the parameter estimator update law. This implies that the system has a bounded gain. Moreover, asymptotic tracking is also proven when the disturbance is constant."

Firstly, a large language model-based resource prediction method that combines graph convolutional networks and multi-head self-attention mechanism is introduced to effectively capture spatio-temporal correlations and predict future resource requirements. Next, in order to ensure a deterministic quality of service (QoS) and optimize migration decisions, a DT-assisted VNF migration model composed of energy consumption, latency, and load balancing is constructed, and a joint optimization model for VNF migration and DT re-association aimed at maximizing the long-term utility of the system is established. Finally, a migration algorithm based on heterogeneous multi-agent proximal policy optimization is proposed to solve the VNF migration problem according to the resource requirements predicted by the model. To address the problem of excessive synchronization delays of DT nodes originally associated with nodes after migration, a counterfactual multi-agent algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of DT re-association. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm improves prediction accuracy, ensures load balancing, and reduces system energy consumption and synchronization delays."

The Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) extends traditional scheduling by allowing each operation to be processed on multiple machines, enhancing practical applicability but increasing computational complexity. Existing methods, ranging from exact solvers to heuristic/metaheuristic algorithms, either incur high computational costs or yield suboptimal solutions. Recent reinforcement learning (RL)based approaches attempt a balance between optimality and efficiency; however, intrinsic characteristics of FJSP remain underutilized for better solution quality. This paper introduces the Action-Priority Driven Policy Optimization (APDPO) method, explicitly designed to address three critical challenges: achieving superior solutions, improving interpretability via an intuitive policy representation, and enhancing computational efficiency through direct, gradient-free policy updates. A policy improvement theorem ensures performance enhancement under specified conditions. Comparative evaluations confirm that APDPO outperforms existing approaches by delivering better solution quality, reduced computational requirements, and greater decision transparency."

    "abstract": "A Large Language Model (LLM) is an AI system that uses deep learning and extensive data to comprehend, process, and produce human-like language. Globally, LLMs have shown promising results and have gained widespread acceptance. However, this widespread adoption and numerous applications of LLMs have simultaneously heightened their appeal as targets for malicious attackers. Attackers continuously develop new strategies to disrupt computer systems and also attack LLM in many ways. In addition, LLMs have intrinsic vulnerabilities and limitations that can be leveraged and exposed to a range of cyberattacks. Among these, Denial of Service (DoS) is a prevalent threat that disrupts the functionality of LLMs by inundating them with excessive input or even making them completely unavailable. In addition to traditional concurrent-based DoS attacks, we also explore a novel prompt-based attack, where repeating tokens within a single input prompt can internally overload the LLM and trigger failure, even without concurrency. This paper explores how LLMs react to such attacks, demonstrating their behavior under varying levels of DoS attacks, and comparing the outcomes. It also investigates how repeated token prompt structures can cause instability, revealing a new class of input-driven DoS vulnerabilities in LLMs. Our experiments on three open-source LLMs confirm that both high-concurrency and repeated token inputs can significantly degrade performance, increase response time, and even lead to system crashes under high load. Furthermore, to address the concurrency-based DoS attack, we have implemented and validated a queue-based mitigation approach in our companion work."

By developing new sufficient conditions under which a stochastic game is a Markov potential game, we show that the problem of computing an equilibrium for the proposed model is equivalent to solving a single-agent Markov decision process. These new conditions are general and may apply to other applications. An equilibrium is computed for an IEEE test system to empirically demonstrate the near-optimal efficiency of the pricing policy."

LAHM was developed to produce fine multipole patterns and address these performance limitations. This study extends LAHM by superimposing a distributed external magnetic field tailored to the target pattern. The field is generated by a pre-patterned multipole master NdFeB magnet (B<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r</sub> = 1.30 T, H<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">cj</sub> = 2388 kA/m) placed on a uniform reverse-field source, which strengthens the local magnetizing field in the target areas and attenuates it elsewhere. Experiments employing 0.3-mm-thick NdFeB samples demonstrate that distributed-field LAHM increases the magnetization ratio by 10.8% and the peak-to-peak surface magnetic flux density by 54.2 mT compared with conventional uniform-field LAHM. These results indicate a potential route to higher-performance multipole magnets for MEMS applications."

    "abstract": "As urban areas grow and public spaces fill with activity, keeping these environments safe has become increasingly challenging. This makes it more important than ever to develop smarter video surveillance systems that can keep up with the pace of city life. Detecting unexpected or suspicious behavior remains a major challenge, and focusing on anomaly detection helps bridge this gap by allowing automated systems to pinpoint events that differ from typical activities. Anomaly detection in video frames is essential for modern surveillance, especially in busy public environments. This research introduces a hybrid deep learning model that combines FlowNet to extract motion information, ResNet50 for capturing detailed feature representations, and Faster R-CNN for classifying anomalies at the frame level. FlowNet analyzes motion between frames, ResNet50 provides rich semantic features, and Faster RCNN uses these features to identify unusual events. The model was tested on the UCSD Ped 1 dataset and CUHK Avenue, a recognized benchmark in video anomaly detection, and achieved a leading accuracy of 98.01% and 91.03% at the singleframe level. These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating motion-based and appearance-based deep learning methods for robust anomaly detection in complex surveillance scenarios."

    "abstract": "Audio watermarking typically requires specialized decoders or machine learning models, which can be computationally expensive and vulnerable once decoding strategies are exposed. To address this, we present a decoder-free audio watermarking method that inherits the information-theoretic (unconditional) security properties of visual cryptography and ensures that no information about the embedded secret can be inferred from fewer than t shares. These masks are treated as secret images and encoded using visual cryptography schemes (VCS/EVCS), enabling the embedding and recovery of secret signals without any explicit decoder. Simply adding t or more shares reconstructs the secret signal. EVCS also conceals information by making the shares resemble natural audio, enhancing resistance to side-channel attacks. Experiments on multi-speaker mixtures confirm successful signal reconstruction across different sparsity and density conditions. Local convolution also improves recovery when share masks are available. A potential application includes location-based access control, where secret audio is unlocked only by combining recordings from specific sites. Our results highlight the feasibility of lightweight, decoder-free, and information-theoretically secure audio steganography."

This necessitates a systematic analysis of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) technology developments. This study introduces a hierarchical framework based on large language models (LLM) and applies it to 6,859 EUV-related papers published from 2015 to 2024. The framework combines clustering, summarization, evaluation, selection, and a decision stage guided by an LLM-based AI agent to build a hierarchical tree, and it then analyzes the hierarchy step by step to track emerging trends in the field. Emerging trends in EUV research include algorithmic metrology and overlay modeling, illumination engineering with pupil mapping, and advances in multi-beam mask writing along with the supplier ecosystem. This hierarchical framework is expected to not only determine the future direction of EUV technology but also broadly apply LLM-based methods to identify various emerging trends."

By designing specific control inputs applied to targeted nodes, it becomes possible to isolate and retrieve parameters effectively. Crucially, we show that this process must be conducted online to achieve full identification, as control inputs must adapt to previously unknown states and parameters."

In particular, it is hypothesized that the intruder has model knowledge, disclosure and disruptions resources in charge to secretly tamper by false data injections the data exchanged between the controller-to-actuator and sensor-to-controller channels. The proposed architecture is capable to promptly detect the attack occurrence by exploiting set-membership properties of control unit, to accurately estimate the malicious perturbation via the moving horizon estimation procedure, and to formally prove that the resulting compensation is always feasible."

The key challenge that we address is balancing computational resources against control performance, which is important as constructing near-optimal inputs often requires substantial amount of computations. TROOP addresses this trade-off by adopting an online best-first search strategy inspired by A<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">⋆</sup>, allowing for efficient estimates of the optimal value function. The control laws obtained guarantee both near-optimality and stability properties for the closed-loop system. These properties depend on the planning depth, which determines how far into the future the algorithm explores and is closely related to the amount of computations. TROOP thus strikes a balance between computational efficiency and control performance, which is illustrated by numerical simulations on an example."

    "abstract": "Objectives: Managing acute heart failure (AHF) involves the dual challenges of stabilizing hemodynamics while minimizing myocardial oxygen consumption. This is a clinically significant and technically challenging issue due to complex cardiovascular interactions and trade-offs between therapeutic goals. We aim to develop a discrete hemodynamic control framework for autonomous drug therapy that enhances both control versatility and clinical potential. Methods: A comprehensive multi-input, multi-output model was derived to capture causal relationships linking drug infusion, cardiovascular parameters, and hemodynamic responses. Based on this model, we designed an optimal control framework capable of regulating arbitrary hemodynamic targets (e.g., arterial pressure, cardiac output, left atrial pressure, right atrial pressure), minimizing myocardial oxygen consumption, accommodating multiple guideline-concordant drug classes, and enforcing clinical constraints such as dosage limits and contraindications. The discrete design enables compatibility with standard hemodynamic measurements in ICU/CCU settings. Control performance was validated using a cardiovascular simulator. Results: The system achieved multi-dimensional regulation of hemodynamics and reduced myocardial oxygen consumption across a range of AHF scenarios. It also identified pharmacologically untreatable cases by evaluating the reachable hemodynamic range. Performance remained stable despite inter-patient variability in drug sensitivities, circulatory properties, and baroreflex activity. Conclusions: The proposed system may function as a physician-assistive tool and a foundation for autonomous drug therapy in AHF. Significances: By integrating physiologically grounded modeling with practical clinical constraints, the system offers a novel and scalable approach to optimize drug therapy in AHF. It has the potential to improve treatment precision, reduce clinician burden, and advance next-generation critical care."

The imaging is tackled in a 2-D scenario and formulated as a linearized electromagnetic inverse scattering problem under the Born approximation. Analytical ray-based and full-wave numerical models are exploited to evaluate the incident field and the Green’s function, which are the key quantities for the kernel of the relevant scattering integral equation. The inverse problem is regularized via Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (TSVD). The main goal of this work is to provide a theoretical analysis about how multipath, characterizing indoor signal propagation, affects the imaging performance. In particular, we focus on the analysis in terms of the retrievable spectral content of the unknown contrast function and regularized point spread function. Numerical results highlight the role of multipath information as well as the challenges towards the achievement of a reliable target imaging."

The system of rates and queues is modeled by a fluid differential equation system, and analyzed via convex optimization. A first, myopic policy is proposed, based on task delay-to-service. Under a simplified dynamic fluid queue model, we prove global convergence to an equilibrium point which minimizes the mean setup time; however queueing delays are incurred with this method. A second proposal is then developed based on proximal optimization, which explicitly models the setup queue and is proved to reach an optimal equilibrium, devoid of queueing delay. Results are demonstrated through a simulation example."

To characterize multi-MA-assisted UAV-to-UAV wideband fading channels, we propose a three-dimensional arbitrary-elevation two-concentric-cylinders reference model. Based on this model, we derive the space-time-frequency correlation function (STF-CF) in closed form. From the STF-CF, we also obtain the space-Doppler power spectral density (SD-PSD) and the power space-delay spectrum (PSDS). The excellent agreement between the theoretical PSDS and some previously reported measurement data demonstrates the utility of the reference model. We then establish corresponding simulation models, which produce consistent results with the derived expressions. By leveraging the closed-form correlation function, the gradient of the log-determinant of spatial correlation matrix with respect to the MA positions can be conveniently obtained, which may serve as a method to maximize the ergodic capacity of the multi-MA assisted wideband UAV-to-UAV channels."

Unlike iterative approximation using dynamic programming in the DRL, a closed-form expression for the random return can be exactly characterized in the distributional LQR, which is defined over infinitely many random variables. In recent work [1], [2], it has been shown that this random return can be well approximated by a finite number of random variables, which we call truncated random return. In this paper, we study the truncated random return in the distributional LQR. We show that the truncated random return can be naturally expressed in the quadratic form. We develop a sufficient condition for the positive definiteness of the block symmetric matrix in the quadratic form and provide the lower and upper bounds on the eigenvalues of this matrix. We further show that in this case, the truncated random return follows a positively weighted non-central chi-square distribution if the random disturbances admits Gaussian, and its cumulative distribution function is log-concave if the probability density function of the random disturbances is log-concave."

We study the fair control problem, that is, to maximise the probability of satisfying an Linear Temporal Logic subject to an action-based fairness constraint for uncertain dynamical systems. The action-based fairness of epistemic disturbances can be defined flexibly: by their observed behaviour and/or by their interaction with control input, enabling both input-dependent and independent disturbance modelling. We develop a sound and complete methodology to perform correct-by-design synthesis. We show that this optimal control problem is equivalent to a reachability problem in the fairness-realisable sub-product Markov decision process. We validate our results over a case study of room temperature regulation."

    "abstract": "Routers use queues to temporarily hold packets when they can’t process them immediately. Congestion occurs when the arrival rate of packets exceeds the processing capacity, leading to increased queuing delay. Active Queue Management (AQM) strategies aim to reduce congestion and queuing delay by draining packets from queues. Traditionally, AQMs are placed in the Egress pipeline of Programmable Data Plane (PDP) hardware due to the availability of queue delay information there. We argue that this approach wastes the router’s resources because the dropped packet has already consumed the entire pipeline of the device. We propose ingress Random Early Detection (iRED) as a more efficient P4-AQM approach fully implemented in PDP hardware, that introduces the concept of disaggregated AQM, effectively resolving the egress drop problem. iRED also supports the Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable Throughput (L4S) framework, saving device pipeline resources by dropping packets in the Ingress block. Our experiments with a Tofino2 programmable switch achieved a rate of 1Tbps and show that iRED can reduce router resource consumption by up to 10x in memory usage, 12x fewer processing cycles, and 8x less power consumption for the same traffic load. It achieves fairness in bandwidth usage for different types of traffic and significantly improves Quality of Service (QoS) in Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) with up to a 2.34x improvement in Frames Per Second (FPS) and a 4.77x increase in video player buffer fill. We believe this is a pioneering work to highlight the egress drop problem and deeply explore its potential damage to network performance."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a systematic investigation into path planning and trajectory tracking for autonomous vehicles. By integrating an improved A* algorithm, a fuzzy dynamic window approach, and a Fuzzy PID control strategy, the proposed method enables effective driving of an autonomous vehicle. Firstly, in the global path planning phase, to address the issues of low computational efficiency and suboptimal path quality in traditional A* algorithms for large-scale map searches, an improved A* algorithm incorporating an enhanced heuristic function, redundant node removal strategy, and path smoothing approach is introduced, significantly increasing search efficiency and optimizing path quality. Secondly, in the local path planning phase, the dynamic adjustment of vehicle speed and steering is achieved by combining fuzzy logic control with the dynamic window approach. This allows for smooth obstacle avoidance in dynamic environments. Furthermore, a path smoothing algorithm is integrated to refine the generated trajectory, ensuring its continuity and smoothness. Finally, a Fuzzy PID control algorithm is integrated into the trajectory tracking controller. By introducing fuzzy logic, the PID parameters are adaptively adjusted to ensure precise vehicle following of the planned path, improving path tracking stability and response speed. The proposed method is validated and evaluated in a variety of complex road scenarios using a real vehicle based on ROS. The simulation and real-world experimental results clearly illustrate that the proposed method achieves substantially better performance than conventional approaches with regard to path planning efficiency, obstacle avoidance success rate, and path smoothness."

To reduce the computational cost associated with finite-element (FE) simulations of insulated HTS coils, the simultaneous multi-scale homogeneous (SMSH) method can be considered. It combines a macroscopic-scale homogenized magnet model with multiple single-tape models and solves both scales monolithically. In this work, the SMSH method is reformulated using the h-φ thin-shell (TS) approximation, where analyzed tapes are collapsed into thin surfaces, simplifying mesh generation. Moreover, the magnetic field is expressed as the gradient of the magnetic scalar potential outside the analyzed tapes. The discretized field is then described with nodal functions, further reducing the size of the FE problem compared to standard h formulations. The proposed h-φ SMSH-TS method is verified against state-of-the-art homogenization methods on a 2-D benchmark problem of stacks of HTS tapes. The results show good agreement in terms of AC losses, turn voltage and local current density, with a significant reduction in simulation time compared to reference models. All models are open-source."

Although the traditional CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) and Tucker models can directly complete high-order data, they encounter trouble in rank estimation. While the Bayesian tensor completion model within a probabilistic framework can improve performance and facilitate rank estimation, they face significant efficiency challenges when handling large-scale high-order data. To mitigate these shortcomings, a Bayesian high-order tensor completion (BHOTC) model is proposed in this article. The proposed model is founded upon high-order t-SVD, enabling the direct completion of high-order data without dimensionality reduction. Moreover, within a fully Bayesian framework and benefiting from the hierarchical sparsity priors, the model automatically extracts the potential low-rank structure from high-order data, which significantly enhances the accuracy and robustness. For model learning, a faster variational inference approach is developed in the frequency domain to estimate the posterior parameters, which greatly reduces the time overhead. The advantages of our model are that it considers the high-order tensor completion tasks within the Bayesian framework and develops a faster posterior inference approach. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of BHOTC, demonstrating its ability to deliver high-accuracy predictions on sparsely observed tensors—such as courier location distribution in social intelligence systems—as well as high-quality reconstruction on dense tensors, including visual data such as facial images."

    "abstract": "Traditional pedestrian detection methods based on red-green-blue (RGB) images struggle in adverse illumination, but a key capability required for pedestrian detection is all-day detection due to its critical role in diverse applications, e.g., security, surveillance, and autonomous driving. To address this issue, multispectral pedestrian detection attempts to introduce thermal images to supplement the RGB images, since they can be captured based on heat radiation difference without relying on external light sources. However, how to fuse the two modalities effectively is still lacking in-depth investigation. To prompt this field, we propose an implicit illumination-aware representation to address the limited availability of specific illumination labels in existing multispectral datasets, coupled with a prefusion feature alignment strategy to reconcile spatial misalignments of identical objects across modalities. We also identify four critical fusion challenges, revealing persistent limitations in existing multispectral detectors’ ability to holistically address these issues, particularly regarding underdeveloped cross-modal interactions and suboptimal cross-domain feature fusion. To this end, we propose a universal multispectral pedestrian detection paradigm (UMPDP), which includes a modality alignment module (MAM) for adaptive feature space alignment, a differential modality fusion module (DMFM) to enhance the relationship of different modalities, and a task-conditioned illumination module (TCIM) to dynamically adjust network weights based on illumination condition. Extensive experiments on KAIST and CVC-14 datasets demonstrate the general effectiveness of our proposed method.

    "abstract": "With the emergence of information overload in the Social Internet of Things (SIoT), personalized recommender systems have become essential for helping users locate the items they need. Effectively modeling the heterogeneous relationships across multiple information sources and weighting them according to their varying importance, especially under sparse social interactions in the SIoT, remains a key challenge. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Multi-source Adaptive Relational Graph Convolutional Network (MARGCN) framework for recommender systems. Useruser and useritem interactions are modeled as two relational graphs, and their embedded features are aggregated using graph convolutional networks (GCNs). A multi-source relationship perception model is designed to dynamically perceive and measure the importance of multiple relationships within the graph structure, thereby enhancing the ability to recognize heterogeneous information. An adaptive information fusion model is then constructed to dynamically integrate representations from different sources through a learnable fusion strategy, avoiding information loss or redundancy caused by simple weighting. Users and items are ultimately represented by aggregating and updating their embeddings via GCNs. Experiments show that compared with the most advanced methods, MARGCN improves the hit rate (HR) and the normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) by 2.66%, 0.52%, and 3.93% in HR@5, HR@10, and HR@15 and by 1.58%, 1.32%, and 3.14% in NDCG@5, NDCG@10, and NDCG@15, respectively."

    "abstract": "Large-scale battery energy storage systems are increasingly integrated into the grid through transmission lines. Protecting these lines using distance relays is challenging due to the bidirectional nature of battery current flow and the current control scheme of the interfacing inverter, which affects the magnitude and phase angle of the relay current during faults. As a result, the impedance calculated by the distance relay at the battery end often remains outside the tripping zone for various faults. This paper presents a Zone-1 protection algorithm for transmission lines connected to converter-interfaced battery storage. The method estimates the positive sequence line impedance up to the fault point by determining the phase angle of the faulted loop current and computing the equivalent grid impedance and its voltage. Using the substitution theorem, the fault path current angle is resolved to address nonhomogeneity in the system. The proposed algorithm is validated using PSCAD/EMTDC simulations on a modified New England 39-bus system with battery storage. The method accurately detects faults under various charging/discharging modes and reactive power support scenarios, in accordance with IEEE Std P2800-2022. A comparative assessment demonstrates its reliability across different fault types, resistances, and locations."

Such a perspective leads to a few implications, including the observation that duality between the Riccati equations arising in various contexts is simply related to a choice of coordinates for the Hamiltonian dynamics. Similar arguments are then extended to the nonlinear setting. It is shown that, by relying on such alternative view point, the computational complexity associated to the solution of nonlinear optimal control problems over an infinite horizon tantamounts to the solution of an Algebraic Riccati Equation, for the linearized problem, and a quasi-linear partial differential equation."

Federated Learning in the Sky (FLS) enables UAV swarms to collaboratively learn while keeping data local, offering a cost-effective and efficient paradigm for diverse applications. However, the pre-training negotiation of protocol and quantization parameters remains an overlooked attack surface in dynamic swarms with potentially malicious participants. We present a lightweight, end-to-end secure framework that couples Feldman’s verifiable-secret-sharing (VSS) with a randomized multi-hash data representation (Hash-Comb [1]). Feldman’s protocol secures the negotiation and distribution of the Hash-Comb quantization hyperparameters through a verifiable security-with-abort mechanism resilient to dishonest-majority adversaries, while incurring minimal computational and communication overhead suitable for UAV platforms. The randomized Hash-Comb guarantees Rényi differential privacy for training data and model updates and reduces bandwidth via quantization. We further provide a formal analysis proving that our framework preserves Feldman’s security guarantees under dishonest-majority settings. The resulting architecture is easy to implement, flexible across hierarchical FLS deployments, and maintains model utility while protecting both the negotiation phase and training. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework to explicitly secure parameter negotiation in FLS, closing a critical gap in privacy-preserving federated learning for UAV swarms."

SuReLoNet integrates a surrogate module that approximates baseline network dynamics with a residual learner that compensates for systematic prediction errors introduced by routing variability, interference, and stochastic propagation. Experimental results on synthetic and simulation-driven datasets show that SuReLoNet achieves superior accuracy across tasks, including an RMSE of 0.0584 for delay prediction, 0.4482 for hop count estimation, and perfect classification accuracy (1.0) for fallback decisions, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines such as ANN, SVR, and remaining competitive with random forest regressors.

Specifically, it achieves simultaneous optimization across global modules of uplink AI/ML-based joint source-channel coding with modulation, and downlink AI/ML-based modulation with precoding and corresponding data detection, reducing traditional inter-module information barriers to facilitate end-to-end optimization toward global objectives. Moreover, multiple enhancement mechanisms are also proposed, including i) an AI/ML-based cross-layer modulation approach with theoretical analysis for downlink transmission that breaks the isolation of inter-layer features to expand the solution space for determining improved constellation, ii) a utility-oriented precoder construction method that shifts the role of the AI/ML-based CSI feedback decoder from recovering the original CSI to directly generating precoding matrices aiming to improve end-to-end performance, and iii) incorporating modulation into AI/ML-based CSI feedback to bypass bit-level bottlenecks that introduce quantization errors, non-differentiable gradients, and limitations in constellation solution spaces. Furthermore, AI/ML-based control agents for optimized transmission schemes are proposed that leverage AI/ML to perform model switching according to channel state, thereby enabling integrated control for global throughput optimization. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed solutions in terms of block error rate and throughput. These extensive simulations employ more practical assumptions that are aligned with the requirements of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), which hopefully provides valuable insights for future 3GPP standardization discussions."

In particular, we investigate five entropy-based measures: approximate entropy, sample entropy, gaussian kernel approximate entropy, fuzzy entropy, and modified sample entropy. Only four values from these features are fed into a Deep Neural Network (DNN), which is capable of detecting fake speech with an accuracy exceeding 80%. To enhance efficiency, this study proposes a dual-model framework that integrates two complementary approaches: one combining entropy features with a DNN, and the other utilizing a gammatone filter bank with the ResNet-18 architecture, thereby improving the robustness of detection. Experiments conducted on the ASVspoof 2019 dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 96.50% accuracy, an F1 -score of 98.04%, and an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 5.93%, outperforming baseline models in terms of EER."

In particular, we establish conditions on when a ROM of locomotion yields stable walking on the full-order hybrid dynamics. To achieve this result, given an ROM we synthesize a zero dynamics manifold encoding the behavior of the ROM—controllers can be synthesized that drive the FOM to this surface, yielding hybrid zero dynamics. We prove that a stable periodic orbit in the ROM implies an input-to-state stable periodic orbit of the FOM’s hybrid zero dynamics, and hence the FOM dynamics.

This simplification overlooks the complexity and heterogeneity inherent in human mobility patterns, often leading to suboptimal predictions. Recently, methods adopting the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">“decompose, then predict” (DTP)</i> paradigm have gained traction. These methods break down data into smaller, manageable subcomponents, each predicted using dedicated parameters. Although effective in practice, DTP methods face unresolved theoretical questions: What type of decomposition truly makes subcomponents more manageable than the original data? To address this, we present an information theory-based analysis that derives sufficient conditions for a decomposition algorithm to reduce data-induced prediction errors. These conditions suggest that an effective algorithm should ensure decomposed components are as independent as possible, a principle we term the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Component Independence Principle</i>. Guided by this principle, we introduce the Theory-guided Graph Decomposition Learning (TGDL) framework, which decomposes graph-based multivariate time series data into approximately independent subgraph components that are easier to predict than the original data. Moreover, TGDL is a portable framework that can be integrated into any graph-based traffic prediction model to improve its predictive performance. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. With a solid theoretical foundation, our TGDL enhances the performance of diverse traffic prediction models, yielding an average improvement of 19.37% across experiments.

    "abstract": "Transformer architecture has shown significant potential in various visual tasks, including point cloud registration. Positional encoding, as an order-aware module, plays a crucial role in Transformer framework. In this paper, we propose OIF-PCR++, a conditional positional encoding (CPE) method for point cloud registration. The core CPE module utilizes length and vector encoding at different stages, conditioned on the relative pose states between the point clouds to be registered. As a result, it progressively alleviates the feature ambiguity through the incorporation of geometric cues. Building upon the proposed CPE, we introduce an iterative positional encoding optimization pipeline comprising two stages: 1) We find one correspondence via a differentiable optimal transport layer, and use it to encode length information into the point cloud features, which alleviates challenges arising from differing reference frames by enhancing spatial consistency. 2) We apply a progressive direction alignment strategy to achieve rough alignment between the paired point clouds, and then gradually incorporate direction information with the aid of this alignment, further enhancing feature distinctiveness and reducing feature ambiguity. Through this iterative optimization process, length and direction information are effectively integrated to achieve consistent and distinctive positional encoding, thus enabling the learning of discriminative point cloud features. Additionally, we present an inlier propagation mechanism that harmoniously integrates consistent geometric information for positional encoding. The proposed positional encoding is highly efficient, introducing only a marginal increase in computational overhead while significantly improving feature distinguishability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across indoor, outdoor, object-level, and multi-way benchmarks, while also generalizing well to complex real-world scenarios. The code will be released upon acceptance to support the research community."

    "abstract": "The scarcity of labeled samples results in the challenge of small-sample-size in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. Transfer learning offers hope for solving this problem. In cross-domain transfer learning, the source domain boasts abundant labeled training samples, whereas the target domain comprises only limited labeled training samples. Leveraging the information from the source domain can benefit the classification of the target domain. However, inconsistencies in land-cover classes between source and target domains may hinder knowledge transfer between domains. Fortunately, few-shot learning (FSL) provides an effective solution to this challenge. In recent years, meta-learning has gained widespread attention as a mainstream approach within FSL. This paper proposes a novel method for cross-domain heterogeneous HSI classification, called cross-domain meta-learning with feature alignment (CD-MFA). CD-MFA enhances the generalization performance of the inner-loop optimization by incorporating task-adaptive loss function. The adaptive weighting strategy is used in the outer-loop optimization to balance the classification losses of the source and target domains to learn more discriminative features. Additionally, by aligning the features of the source and target domains under the guidance of the Gaussian prior, the impact of domain shift can be mitigated. It is worth noting that CD-MFA is trained concurrently on both the source and target domains so that the two domains are will bound, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. Experimental results on four publicly available HSI datasets validate the effectiveness of CD-MFA."

We design a codebook mapping distinct orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) subcarriers to unique spatial angles, enabling full angular coverage within a single OFDM symbol. To address practical TTD limitations–finite delay range and resolution–we propose a multi-stage delay-phase-precoding (MSDPP) architecture that mitigates hardware-induced distortions. Simulations demonstrate that MSDPP achieves near-optimal spectral efficiency (SE) with at least a 2 dB gain over state-of-the-art designs, alongside up to 63% higher energy efficiency (EE)."

    "abstract": "This article addresses the formation control problem of underactuated multi-autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on the communication network and complex uncertainties, including unknown ASV dynamics, external disturbances, and obstacles. First, a novel distributed target estimator (DTE) using a first-order low-pass filter is designed to estimate the state of the target based on partial observability under target information constraints and DoS attacks. Second, a safe guidance law for the ASVs is developed using the estimated target state and a control barrier function. Third, a “dual-adaptation control and learning” bidirectional fusion model is constructed. Specifically, on one hand, a distributed adaptive formation controller based on value decomposition reinforcement learning (VDRL) is designed. By decomposing the global value function, this controller addresses the credit allocation issue in cooperative formation and allows the ASVs to adjust their strategies autonomously based on the environment. On the other hand, an adaptive mechanism is used to improve the computation strategy of the global value function in VDRL, enhancing the learning efficiency and stability of the reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm in complex environments. The proposed VDRL-based formation control algorithm of the underactuated multi-ASVs ensures accurate target state estimation and convergence of formation errors under DoS conditions. A rigorous theoretical analysis is further used to ensure the closed-loop stability of the multi-ASV systems. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed formation control algorithm."

Analytical results show that the brute-force complexity scales as O(N) for OTFS and O(N2) for AFDM, where N is the number of subcarriers, indicating that AFDM has superior resilience over OTFS. Simulation results demonstrate that AFDM is capable of preventing reliable demodulation at the eavesdropper side with a bit error rate (BER) of 0.5, while OTFS allows partial signal recovery under equivalent conditions."

These advantages make CNNs useful in various vision applications, enabling them to perform tasks such as environment perception, object identification and detection, pattern recognition, and object tracking. However, executing CNNs requires a substantial amount of computing power and memory resources, necessitating a high-performance desktop graphics processing unit (GPU), which is not suitable for edge applications, such as autonomous vehicles, mobile robots, and drones, which are limited in terms of power and size. This article proposes a hardware FPGA accelerator that supports quantized neural network (QNN) inference with 8-bit precision for both activations and weights. The accelerator utilizes a unified data flow to execute both CNNs and Depth-wise CNNs, supporting any arbitrary shapes of activation and weights. The entire design is implemented on the Xilinx ZCU102 evaluation board, achieving peak performance of 143 Giga Operations Per Second (GOPS) with power consumption of 4 watts. The accelerator achieves a 2× speedup over the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 when executing MobileNetV1 with an input size of 128×128, resulting in a 43% reduction in total power consumption."

    "abstract": "Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems have emerged as a transformative architecture for sixth generation (6G) communication networks, where distributed access points (APs) collaborate to simultaneously serve all user equipments (UEs). However, in time division duplex (TDD) systems, the reciprocity of uplink channel and downlink channel is disrupted by hardware imperfections in radio frequency (RF) chains, leading to significant degradation in system performance. This paper begins with a theoretical analysis of the downlink performance under a conjugate beamforming scheme, considering scenarios with and without channel calibration. A key theoretical insight highlights the limitation of conventional least squares (LS) calibration method, which fails to achieve high calibration accuracy even with an unlimited number of pilot observations. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel channel calibration approach based on a diffusion model, designed to successively refine the calibration vector obtained from the LS calibration method. Furthermore, to address the shortcomings of conventional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) training architectures, we introduce an innovative bridge-based diffusion model that maps the distribution of LS calibration vectors to their perfect counterparts. The proposed diffusion neural network architecture employs a conditional generative process, integrating a message passing neural network (MPNN) to incorporate domain-specific calibration insights. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed calibration method compared to existing methods, with supplementary experiments and in-depth analyses confirming the efficacy of the proposed successive refinement design."

The constantfeedback gains commonly used in the literature are replaced with dynamic gains. An event-triggered mechanism is developed to initiate the growth of these dynamic gains. When the state's variations exceed a predetermined threshold, the dynamic gains will increase at a specific rate during the subsequent interval. For any predetermined threshold, it is rigorously proven that these dynamic gains experience a finite number of growth intervals, leading the state to converge within this threshold in finite time. Then, the event-triggered dynamic gains are integrated into the fault-tolerant control scheme, enabling the state to converge into a prescribed neighborhood of zero without requiring prior knowledge of actuator faults and external disturbances. Finally, two numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness and innovation of the proposed scheme."

LLMbased chatbots offer a scalable solution, yet most existing systems are restricted to single-turn, solution-oriented responses. We propose an Agentic Stage-Based LLM Framework for Multi- Turn Mental Health Support Conversations in Thai, structuring conversations around five core counseling stages: rapport building, problem identification, goal setting, working, and termination. Drawing from Person-Centered Therapy (PCT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), our framework incorporates two key components: an approach-selection agent that selects appropriate counseling approaches and a monitoring agent that manages stage transitions in multi-turn conversations. We evaluated the proposed framework against three single-agent baselines using LLM-simulated users and compared positive user reaction rates as judged by LLMs. Our framework achieved a 79.01% positive user reaction rate, outperforming single agents with standard, AugESC, and COOPER-CoT prompts by 8.91%, 11.68%, and 17.02%, respectively. Ablation studies validated the necessity of each agentic module in the proposed framework, with results surpassing single-agent baselines without stage-based architecture by 96.15% and 88.46% in Process and Working evaluations, respectively. A/B testing with real users and evaluation by 3 counseling practitioners demonstrated significant improvements in seven of eight mental health support evaluation metrics, highlighting the potential to deliver LLM-based mental health support in Thai."

Building on this technique, we propose two models: the sparse probabilistic tree (SPT) and the sparse probabilistic ensemble tree (SPET). SPT improves robustness in single-tree settings by probabilistically exploring diverse partition structures, while SPET extends this mechanism to ensemble learning, promoting model diversity and stability. SPT successfully handled the XOR dataset, a representative nonlinear classification problem that typically challenges traditional decision trees. In additional analyses comparing the number of trees, SPET showed greater stability and accuracy even with fewer trees, demonstrating its efficiency. On high-dimensional and class-imbalanced manufacturing datasets, SPET achieved the highest average F1 score and ROC AUC with competitive generalization gaps compared to widely-used ensemble models, demonstrating strong robustness to overfitting. SPET also maintained reliable performance across public benchmark datasets, indicating its adaptability to diverse data environments. These results suggest that SPS is a lightweight and effective regularization strategy for improving the generalization of tree-based models in practical applications."

Firstly, a new data-driven switching control approach is proposed to utilize the data to directly design consensus protocol, thus avoiding the subsystem matrix dependency of switched MASs. Subsequently, an online transfer mechanism is developed with data from similar systems. On this basis, the control gain can be updated online using a small amount of real-time data from the switched MASs, breaking through the difficulty of not being able to calculate the gain due to data scarcity. Notably, the effect of noise is considered for both offline and online data collection. Theoretical analysis shows that the switched MASs can realize the asymptotic consensus when the average dwell time satisfies specific conditions. Finally, a numerical experiment is given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy."

    "abstract": "In industrial settings, the health state of a product is often difficult to observe directly. Instead, it is typically inferred from noisy degradation data that are related to the system’s operational condition. However, existing methods commonly neglect parameter uncertainty and lack the ability to perform real-time state estimation. To address these challenges, this article proposes a Bayesian inference framework for accurate online identification of system degradation states. Specifically, a Wiener process model with measurement noise is developed, and prior distributions are introduced to capture parameter uncertainty. In the offline training stage, historical measurement data are utilized to approximate the joint posterior distribution of the latent degradation states and model parameters via variational Bayesian methods. In the online stage, a state-space formulation is adopted to dynamically update the posterior distribution using real-time observations, enabling dynamic estimation of the degradation state. The proposed approach significantly reduces both storage and computational costs. Numerical simulations and real-world case studies demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency."

Although least squares (LS) methods have displayed certain potential for improving parameter robustness in model predictive control (MPC) applications, the influence of the inevitable data noises has not been fully considered in such a data-based method. Aiming to improve the robustness against data noises, an adaptive ridge regression (ARR) data-driven current prediction is proposed for permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) drives in this article. The proposed method introduces an online evaluation of data noise severity through a variance inflation factor (VIF). A dynamic ridge coefficient adjustment mechanism according to the VIF is then applied. As a result, an adaptive penalization to the data noises is achieved, leading to an improved robustness. Experimental verification on a PMSM drive system shows improvements compared to conventional LS methods, especially under challenging low-speed operating conditions where noise sensitivity is most evident. The proposed ARR method preserves the parameter-independent benefits of data-driven approaches while achieving superior current prediction accuracy in noisy settings, thereby advancing the practical implementation of robust MPC strategies for PMSM drives."

This process retrieved 87 records, from which a small but focused body of studies met the inclusion criteria. The concentration of relevant works underscores both the novelty of the field and the urgent need for foundational research, while ensuring transparency, reproducibility, and rigor in identifying and analyzing the emerging body of relevant work. For <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">RQ2 (Transferability of Insights)</i>—investigating what lessons from English language learning can inform Arabic contexts—we employed a purposeful sampling strategy, selecting representative and influential English-language studies from systematic reviews and expert recommendations. This combination balances breadth with depth: the systematic search establishes a reliable evidence base, while purposeful sampling enables focused analysis of best practices in mature domains. Building on these methods, the paper makes three contributions: it delivers a comprehensive synthesis of current trends, applications, and limitations of GenAI in language education; it identifies the unique opportunities and challenges for Arabic, particularly its linguistic complexity and resource scarcity; and it highlights ethical and cultural considerations, including bias, data privacy, and the preservation of linguistic identity. To our knowledge, this is the first survey dedicated to GenAI in Arabic language education, offering a structured foundation for future research, pedagogical innovation, and responsible implementation."

To improve the accuracy and efficiency of ballistic trajectory prediction and firing condition inversion, this paper proposes an intelligent prediction framework that fuses deep learning with ensemble optimization. First, a TCN-BiGRU-Attention model is designed for the localization of enemy launch points. Subsequently, a Particle Swarm Optimization - Extreme Learning Machine - Adaptive Boosting (PSO-ELM-AdaBoost) ensemble algorithm is adopted to rapidly derive the optimal firing conditions for striking the identified enemy launch points. Simulation results demonstrate that the TCN-BiGRU-Attention model reduces the comprehensive prediction error regarding range and lateral deviation to 7.89 m in the enemy launch point localization task. Furthermore, the PSO-ELM-AdaBoost algorithm exhibits superior performance in the firing condition inversion task; the prediction errors for the initial firing angle and initial velocity are only 0.06° and 0.058 m/s, respectively, representing accuracy improvements of 50% and 18% compared to the traditional ELM method. By constructing a dual-stage \"trajectory prediction-parameter inversion\" architecture, this study reduces the single-computation time to the millisecond level, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. These results indicate that the proposed framework possesses potential applicability under simulation validation conditions, providing methodological references and theoretical support for the design of sensing data fusion, real-time reasoning, and decision support modules in future C4ISR and Military Internet of Things (MIoT) systems."

In contrast to frequency division multiplexing or microwave multiplexing, where signal modulation inherently provides immunity to low-frequency noise, conventional TDM systems can be susceptible to 1/f noise from downstream electronics as the TES signals remain in the low-frequency band. In our approach, the operating point of the SQUID amplifier alternates between positive and negative gain slopes at the frame frequency, combined with synchronized digital inversion of the error signals prior to flux-locked loop integration. This modulation scheme shifts the readout noise, including the 1/f components of low noise amplifiers, analog-to-digital converters and room temperature electronics, into the frame frequency range where it can be separated from the DC-TES signal by decimation filtering. Laboratory validation using an 8 column × 32 row TDM platform designed for Athena X-IFU applications shows a reduction in 1/f noise from 73 pA/√Hz@1Hz (9.3 μΦ₀/√Hz) to 21 pA/√Hz@1Hz (2.7 μΦ₀/√Hz) in channels with no TES connected, with the additional benefits of a 14-fold reduction in SQUID bias sensitivity through dynamic resistance matching and a 6.5-fold reduction in temperature-induced baseline drift. The technique avoids the disadvantage of doubling white noise, which occurs with conventional noise subtraction methods, and at the same time achieves a comparable suppression of 1/f noise. Implementation requires only minor firmware modifications to existing TDM systems, making it easily implementable for far-infrared bolometric and X-ray spectroscopy applications."

    "abstract": "In this study, a novel optimal tracker is developed for the linear quadratic tracking (LQT) problem using an output–feedback adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) framework. By leveraging the minimal polynomial of the exosystem matrix, we parameterize the steady-state input, state, and output, and incorporate them into the performance index of the LQT formulation. Unlike existing studies on LQT, in this study, we introduce a high-order filter to make the signals related to the high-order derivatives of the system output and input observable. Subsequently, we develop an incremental data ADP algorithm to learn the optimal dynamic output–feedback tracker, eliminate the impact of high-order filtering error and state reconstruction error on the iterative learning equation (ILE) within a specified time. Finally, the comprehensive simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed output–feedback tracker."

    "abstract": "Genetic algorithms are practical tools for solving complex optimization problems; however, the performance of many existing solutions is often limited by their inability to utilize modern CPU capabilities fully. This paper introduces EvoAVX, an open-source island-based genetic algorithm library engineered for minimal computational overhead. EvoAVX addresses the lack of specialized, high-performance libraries by leveraging AVX-512 intrinsics to optimize genetic operators, statistics calculations, and the pseudorandom number generator. The library provides a built-in, selectable set of vectorized operators. Static polymorphism is implemented via C++ templates to ensure fast, compile-time operator resolution. EvoAVX employs a double-precision real-valued gene representation. The Island model is built on the Message Passing Interface, which enables distributed computing. Our performance evaluation shows notable improvements in execution time compared to popular libraries for evolutionary computation. The performance advantages of EvoAVX are particularly pronounced in scenarios where the fitness evaluation is computationally inexpensive, making it an ideal tool for high-throughput optimization tasks."

    "abstract": "Hypergraphs provide a natural framework for modeling higher-order interactions among nodes, with real-world hypergraph data often exhibiting weighted and heterogeneous structures. In this article, we propose a preferential attachment hypergraph model that incorporates randomness in two key components: the number of hyperedges a node connects to upon arrival, and the size of each hyperedge. By allowing these quantities to follow arbitrary probability distributions, the model generalizes prior fixed-parameter settings and better reflects empirical observations. We analytically derive the asymptotic degree distribution under mild assumptions, showing that it follows a power-law whose exponent is governed by the distribution of hyperedge sizes. Moreover, we show that the distribution of hyperedge counts significantly influences the degree behavior in the small-degree regime, where deviations from ideal power-law patterns are often seen in real-world networks. We also demonstrate that the overall degree distribution can be expressed as a mixture of fixed-count degree distributions. Simulation results and real data analyses support the theoretical findings and highlight the practical relevance of the proposed model."

    "abstract": "Accurate measurement of current switching transients in SiC and GaN power converters requires current sensors with bandwidths exceeding 100 MHz, along with high immunity, sensitivity, isolation, and usability. Magnetic coils are typically the least invasive type of sensor but can be challenging to design and may be unsuitable in high EMI environments. This paper explores the use of coreless twin-coil magnetic current sensors in compact power circuits with complex magnetic fields. A design method is presented to achieve the required bandwidth, immunity, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), guided by 2D gain and immunity plots to optimise orientation relative to adjacent currents. Equations for gain and bandwidth as functions of geometry are experimentally verified using a vector network analyser. The method is validated in two scenarios: individual gate current sensing on adjacent, parallel-connected power devices, and power loop current sensing on a 30 mm wide PCB trace with a closely spaced return path on an adjacent layer. The gate sensor achieves an SNR above 10, a 660 MHz bandwidth, and closely matches current sense resistor measurements. The power loop current sensor has similar accuracy to a commercial Rogowski coil. These results demonstrate removable high bandwidth AC current sensors that minimally impact compact, optimised circuits, and show promise for application in power modules."

This study aims to mitigate the cascading effects of node failures caused by disastrous events. Specifically, it addresses the problem of selecting a fixed number of nodes for protection to minimize the impact of initial failures in interdependent networks. A key challenge in this problem, referred to as the hardening problem, is that the significance of individual nodes cannot be assessed in isolation due to mutual dependencies. To address this, we propose a method that quantifies node significance using Shapley values, a concept from cooperative game theory, to account for the combined effects of multiple node failures. Once all nodes are evaluated for their significance, the most significant ones are selected for protection in order. We conducted simulation experiments to compare the proposed method with other approaches. The results show that our method achieves the best performance."

    "abstract": "Enterprise has started to leverage Augmented Reality (AR) to increase productivity, allow real-time cooperation and augmented decision making. AR-enabled productive spaces can connect virtual overlays with the user's real-world, overlaying relevant data directly into his/her field of view. But this smooth transition also presents major cybersecurity issues. Real-time AR data overlays that, in many scenarios, are wirelessly transmitted, are vulnerable to interception, manipulation and injection of adverse content by adversaries. These kinds of cyberattacks can result in data leaks, disruption to operations, or even health risks for personnel in mission-critical situations like factory floors, medical procedures or out in the field. A multitiered cybersecurity framework for safeguarding AR- enabled spaces from interception and tampering of real-time data overlays is proposed in this research. The cure uses encrypted data streaming, zero-trust network architecture, AI-based anomaly detection and handshake authentication. Encrypted communication paths, seeded with dynamic key exchange, guarantee against undue eavesdropping of transmitted overlays. Zero-trust guidelines allow for the dynamic authentication of both devices and users to protect against unauthorized access of AR streams AI-driven threat detection observes the flow of data in real-time to identify any abnormal behavior patterns, such as surprising overlay changes or suspicious traffic. Integrity verification mechanisms, deployed at the edge, cross-verify the data authenticity prior to rendering it on the user code naveen s3 s device, preventing the delivery of tampered content. The proposed framework was tested with a simulated AR environment which fuses collaborative CAD modelling, live IoT sensor feed and remote expert facility. Several hypothetical cyberattack models including the man-in-the- middle (MITM) interception, overlay injection and replay attacks were reproduced. The experimental results show that the proposed CGI can detect overlay manipulation attacks with a detection rate of 94.5% and prevent interception 98% of times with no visible delay in rendering (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$&lt;30 ~\\text{ms}$</tex>). This research reveals the pressing requirement for strong cyber- defense within AR work environments, which are quickly expanding from niche applications to enterprise standards. This approach can protect real-time AR content against disclosure, alteration, and denial of service-related threats on both network level and application level. Results lay a foundation for the development of secure, scalable strategies for performing AR deployments that maintain the rich, high-speed experience that is necessary for effective workspace operations and protect against emerging cyber threats."

This paper proposes a joint optimization framework based on blockchain intelligence, which aims to solve the challenges of task offloading, resource trading, and data security in LAEN by deeply integrating the security and trust mechanisms of blockchain with the dynamic decision-making capabilities of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). First, a system model integrating secure task offloading and efficient resource trading is constructed, enabling collaborative work between air and ground nodes through cross-chain technology. To ensure data confidentiality and integrity, Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) theory is used to quantitatively evaluate the system's security. Next, this paper utilizes a series of DRL approaches to jointly optimize relay chain node selection, communication decisions, task offloading decisions, and computational resource allocation. To further enhance the system's privacy protection capabilities, we design an improved Payment Channel Network (PCN) routing scheme to maximize transaction security and privacy. Finally, extensive simulation results show that the proposed scheme has significant advantages over existing algorithms in terms of task execution latency, average utility and transaction success rate."

The intelligent invoice recognition framework optimizes input quality through image preprocessing modules (tilt correction, contrast enhancement, noise removal), embeds LEF low-frequency enhancement module on the basis of Yolov4 to enhance the global structural information of invoices, combines CBAM attention mechanism to focus on key field areas, uses ECioU loss function to improve the accuracy of bounding box localization, and simplifies the backbone network to achieve lightweight design and adapt to ordinary hardware environments of small and medium-sized enterprises. The intelligent accounting system automates the entire process of invoice recognition, verification, duplicate checking, and accounting entry by integrating with tax inspection interfaces, building a unique database index, and pre-set accounting entry templates. The experimental results showed that the accuracy of invoice field extraction improved by Yolov4 reached 96.8%, mAP@0.5 96.5%; The intelligent accounting system reduces the processing time of a single invoice by 94.8% compared to manual methods, and achieves a 100% verification and duplicate reimbursement interception rate.

TBFV is characterized by its ability to automatically verify the correctness of all program paths explored during testing, while also having the potential to uncover previously untested paths. This dual capability supports both validation and verification, enhancing the overall assurance of software quality. I will explain the core principles of TBFV, specific techniques it employs for fault prevention, validation, and verification, as well as the key challenges associated with its practical implementation.

    "abstract": "Nowadays, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become essential assets for defense operations, providing efficient and precise communication and surveillance capabilities in complex and hostile environments. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled jamming poses a critical threat to the security and reliability of UAV communication networks. To address this, we propose an offline-learning anti-jamming framework that leverages advanced algorithms, including deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and decision transformers (DT), to enhance UAV performance in intelligent jamming environments. This work adopts an offline, cloud-based training paradigm for anti-jamming, which learns from historical decision trajectories to handle uncertain and unseen jamming patterns and enable reliable decision making. The proposed framework constrains cumulative reward loss within a predefined bound while improving training stability and reducing the time complexity of DRL-based decision model training. The proposed framework exhibits greater performance of UAVs in controlling AI-enabled jams by showing remarkable results for the performance metrics such as Bit Error Rate (BER), Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), Jamming Detection Time (JDT), and latency (delay in response). The extensive experimental outcomes illustrate the efficiency of the proposed framework in complex defense operations and uncertain environments for mitigating AI-enabled attacks by counteracting the jamming attempts."

    "abstract": "While federated learning (FL) eliminates the transmission of raw data over a network, it is still vulnerable to privacy breaches from the communicated model parameters. Differential privacy (DP) is often employed to address such issues. However, the impact of DP on FL in multi-tier networks – where hierarchical aggregations couple noise injection decisions at different tiers, and trust models are heterogeneous across subnetworks–is not well understood. To fill this gap, we develop Multi-Tier Federated Learning with Multi-Tier Differential Privacy (<monospace xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M2FDP</monospace>), a DP-enhanced FL methodology for jointly optimizing privacy and performance over such networks. One of the key principles of <monospace xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M2FDP</monospace> is to adapt DP noise injection across the established edge/fog computing hierarchy (e.g., edge devices, intermediate nodes, and other tiers up to cloud servers) according to the trust models in different subnetworks.

However, existing pansharpening networks often use fixed spatial degradation to construct training data. Moreover, conventional fusion paradigms in both spatial and frequency domains generally rely on predetermined strategies, which fail to dynamically adapt to the distinctive characteristics of individual images. To solve the above problems, we proposed a frequency-guided detail injection pansharpening network (FreDA), which consists of a spectral restriction sub-network (SimNet) and an image fusion sub-network (FNet). The SimNet uses the learnable convolution layer to characterize the degradation parameters, which is used to construct spectral restriction loss. The FNet is constructed with the proposed frequency-guided detail injection (FGI) module, which is designed based on the relationship between frequency information and image degradation condition. The proposed FreDA framework introduces a degradation-aware synchronization mechanism that dynamically aligns spatial degradation patterns with adaptive detail injection weights, achieving significant quality enhancement in multi-satellite data. Extensive experiments on both simulated and full-resolution datasets demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, rigorous module-level ablation studies validate the indispensability of each component."

    "abstract": "Metal-coated optical fibers are widely employed in sensing applications owing to their superior mechanical strength and corrosion resistance. However, their calibration at elevated temperatures is hindered by hysteresis, manifested as discrepancies between heating and cooling cycles, primarily caused by residual strain from mismatched thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) between the metal coating and silica cladding. This research introduces an optimal heat treatment procedure aimed at minimizing the impact of the mismatch in TECs between the cladding and the coating materials that causes the residual strain in gold (Au) and copper (Cu) coated fibers for achieving reliable distributed high temperature sensing up to 500 °C using Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometry (OFDR) technology. The treatment facilitates stress relaxation and microstructural modifications, including surface diffusion, grain growth and oxidation (for Cu coatings), which collectively induce partial interfacial delamination and thereby suppress hysteresis. This work presents the first comprehensive experimental study to systematically investigate and demonstrate the mitigation of hysteresis through an optimized heat treatment process and its underlying mechanisms in metal-coated fibers, supported by microstructural insights. The identified treatment range of 25–300 °C achieves substantial reductions in residual strain, lowering hysteresis effects by approximately 90.2% in Cu-coated fibers and 86.6% in Au-coated fibers. Furthermore, Au-coated fibers exhibit a consistently lower degree of hysteresis than Cu-coated fibers under comparable thermal conditions. Heat treatment also enhances temperature sensitivity, with improvements of approximately 28.9% for Cu-coated fibers and 6.6% for Au-coated fibers. Post-treatment strain analysis confirms maximum sustainable strain limits of ~6000 με for Au-coated fibers and ~12,000 με for Cu-coated fibers. Both fiber types also demonstrated excellent thermal stability, maintaining consistent performance across three heating cycles between 25 °C and 300 °C over a 20-hour period. Collectively, the findings not only advance the scientific understanding of residual strain relaxation mechanisms but also provide a practical route toward robust, precise, and reliable distributed sensing for demanding industrial environments such as the steel, oil and gas sectors."

In particular, we study the data power control optimization problem to maximize the weighted sum of the spectral efficiencys (SEs), where each network user must satisfy its minimum SE demand. By adjusting the SE contribution weights for terrestrial and aerial users, we selectively prioritize certain user groups. Such model enhances current connectivity by addressing the needs and utilization behaviors of different user groups. In this context, we first introduce a centralized solution as the upper bound of solving the problem, which is mainly based on convex optimization. Then, we propose three decentralized solutions to solve the problem. The first solution focuses on coordinate descent techniques and still benefits from the support of convex optimization. Meanwhile, the other two proposed solutions utilize distributed deep reinforcement learning, harnessing advanced machine learning techniques to build adaptive, self-improving systems designed to improve autonomously within intricate environments. Moreover, in the context of our learning-based approaches, we outline practical signaling considerations for a decentralized model. In our model, each user acts as an independent agent and tries to find the best policy locally, while minimizing the need for information exchange. In our analysis, we explore the implications of weighing the performance of ground and aerial users in terms of SE. Finally, the numerical analysis reveals that the performance of our decentralized solutions closely matches that of the centralized and convex approach."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a broadband high-gain monopulse continuous transverse stub (CTS) array antenna based on gap waveguide technology, with its operating bandwidth covering the full W-band. The antenna comprises a novel hybrid beamformer and monopulse comparator network and a 16-element corporate-fed CTS array. A broadband sum and difference mode simultaneous excitation approach within the parallel-plate waveguide is explored, using a dual-mode planar horn with orthogonal port excitation. This approach is further implemented in dual reverse pillbox systems, combined with a magic-T and an E-plane divider, to realize a low-complexity monopulse array feed network with minimal components, thereby enabling broadband operation and high efficiency for the entire antenna. A prototype of the antenna has been fabricated and tested, with the measured results showing excellent agreement with simulations. The antenna operates over a bandwidth of 75-110 GHz (37.8%), with reflection coefficients of all three ports below -10 dB and isolation better than 30 dB. The measured gain of the sum beam ranges from 30.1 to 33 dBi, with an average total efficiencies of 63.4% across the entire operating band. Moreover, for the difference beam, the measured null depth is less than -35dB, and the amplitude imbalance is better than 0.2 dB. The proposed antenna combines broad bandwidth, high gain, and high efficiency with ease of fabrication and assembly, making it suitable for mm-wave and sub-THz tracking applications."

    "abstract": "Direction modulation is a modulation technique where the beam direction changes with the transmission time, providing beam scanning within the pulse transmission time for array antennas. For array radars, intra-pulse beam scanning is a degree of freedom that has not been fully utilized but can be exploited. Based on this degree of freedom, this paper proposes the concept of space-time array (STA) radar, which refers to a radar where the transmit beam in the spatial dimension varies flexibly in the temporal dimension (including intra-pulse and inter-pulse). The STA radar achieves coverage of the region of interest through intra-pulse beam scanning during transmission and covers the same region through multi-beam reception. Both transmission and reception use high-gain beams, sharing a single array antenna through the T/R components. A significant advantage of STA radar is that it enables array radars to perform multiple radar functions simultaneously, without being constrained by the limitation of traditional phased array radars that require multiple functions to be executed sequentially in time. This paper presents the concept, principles, simulations, and potential advantages of STA radar. STA radar represents an approach to achieving important radar capabilities that are not easily achievable with current array radar architectures."

    "abstract": "Utilizing remote sensing satellites for ecological area observation to provide timely high-resolution imagery is crucial for detailed ecological analysis. However, the extensive coverage of ecological areas and the limitation that a single satellite can only cover a limited target area at any given time lead to complex scheduling conflicts of imaging resources, thereby reducing observation coverage and mission completion rates. To address these challenges, this paper firstly proposes an multi-satellite cooperative regional target mission scheduling framework that integrates satellites, target areas and ground stations. Specifically, the target areas are segmented into grid spaces, upon which an adaptive scanning area calculation model driven by satellite attitude is developed. Additionally, a strip segmentation method tailored for regional targets is designed to maximize observation efficiency while minimizing resource wastage. The communication constraints between the satellite and the ground station are also fully considered in the framework to ensure that the acquired observation data can be efficiently and reliably transmitted to the ground station. Furthermore, this paper introduces a Multi-Agent Deep Policy Gradient Satellite Regional Mission Scheduling (MSRTS) algorithm that promotes collaboration through a shared resource pool among all agents. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MSRTS algorithm significantly enhances the mission completion rate, with an average increase in benefits of approximately 9.72%. These f indings provide robust technical support for future large-scale real-time ecological remote sensing monitoring across multiple regions."

    "abstract": "A multi-surfaces low-specific absorption rate (SAR) multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antenna for mobile phone is proposed based on collinear reverse currents and multiple hotspots, and implemented by reactance loading. The proposed antenna element mainly consists of a common-mode (CM) dipole, a T-shaped power divider, and a center-loaded inductor. The T-shaped power divider is used to generate multiple peak points of tangential electric field and SAR by exciting the dual-end-fed CM dipole with collinear reverse current. The center-loaded inductor, analyzed by an equivalent circuit, further modifies the current distribution to uniform energy distribution, resulting in a multi-surface low-SAR antenna. Furthermore, by analyzing the position and the phase of the four antennas, the multi-surface low-SAR MIMO antenna is obtained. The fabricated antenna element and MIMO antenna can cover the -6dB bandwidth of 3.4 GHz-3.6 GHz, with the isolation of better than 17.5dB, envelope correlation coefficients (ECCs) of lower than 0.065 and efficiencies ranges from 85% to 95% and from 79.1% to 85.1%, respectively. The normalized measured SARs for the antenna element and MIMO antenna are 0.82 W/kg and 0.42 W/kg, respectively, which not only comply with the standards, but also ensure that SARs of the proposed antenna across multiple surfaces remain consistently low."

The device employs infrared or ultrasonic sensors to detect environmental obstacles, converting this information into tactile and auditory feedback, providing users with a broader and more accurate spatial awareness. The collected data is processed and translated into tactile signals (vibration) or auditory signals (via sound transducers). The interval of these signals varies based on the distance from obstacles, enabling users to make quick and safe decisions in real time (empirical tests indicated an average detection accuracy above 92% and a latency of approximately 120–150 ms between detection and feedback). Currently, the most common mobility aids for visually impaired individuals are white canes and guide dogs, which have significant limitations. Canes are restricted to detecting obstacles from waist level downward and have a short range, while guide dogs are expensive and require extensive training. Hence, developing a portable and discreet technology capable of detecting obstacles beyond the reach of traditional canes is essential to improve the independence and safety of these individuals. The device was designed to be lightweight, comfortable, and aesthetically discreet, without compromising the user’s autonomy or quality of life. Financial accessibility is also prioritized, with efforts to utilize low-cost materials and technologies to enable large-scale production, benefiting as many individuals as possible. By addressing a recurrent challenge with a practical solution, this project offers a novel approach to mobility, autonomy, and inclusion for visually impaired individuals, expanding their ability to interact with their surroundings."

At its core, WeatherCycle employs a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">lumina-chroma decomposition</i> strategy to decouple degradation from content without modeling complex weather, enabling domain conversion between degraded and clean images.

    "abstract": "To enable high-current, internally-cooled high temperature superconductors (HTS) for fusion magnets, we developed a Stacks-in-Conduit Conductor (SICC) manufacturing process and produced prototype conductors. The SICC consists of a densely stacked REBCO tape bundle enclosed in a metal conduit (jacket) with an internal coolant channel, combining the high current density of stacked HTS tapes with the robust mechanical support and cooling of a cable-in-conduit design. A four-step continuous fabrication line was established, including automated tape stacking, bundle restacking, helical reinforcement insertion, and multi-stage roll forming into a square cross-section. Using aluminum dummy bundles and stainless steel (STS) tape stacks, we carried out forming trials to analyze mechanical and geometrical characteristics. An initial single-helix internal support led to a “wiggling” surface defect on the jacket, but this was resolved by adopting a double-helix (two counter-wound copper spirals) that cancels asymmetric forces, yielding a smooth outer surface. Micro-focus X-ray CT imaging confirmed that the HTS tape bundle remains intact after forming. These results demonstrate a viable manufacturing route for HTS SICC, and provide key insights on mechanical reinforcement and process optimization. The developed techniques lay a foundation for future SICC prototypes using actual HTS tapes, moving toward high-field fusion magnet applications."

    "abstract": "Timely and accurate detection of bearing faults is critical to the reliability of rotating machinery, yet models trained under fixed conditions often fail on unseen domains owing to distribution shifts. To overcome this limitation, we develop DGNSCA—a Domain Generalization Network that leverages Similarity guidance, Class-conditional feature alignment, and Adversarial training to learn domain-agnostic yet class-discriminative features. The architecture is built on a 1D convolutional neural network and incorporates three key modules: global distribution alignment to extract domain-invariant features, class-conditional contrastive learning to enhance intra-class consistency across domains, and adversarial training to improve generalization. DGNSCA further introduces a domain-similarity-guided decision module that adaptively aggregates per-source predictions via similarity weights, enabling robust inference without access to target-domain data. Comprehensive evaluations on two widely recognized benchmark datasets show that DGNSCA consistently surpasses current leading methods regarding accuracy, precision, and F1-score. Ablation analyses further validate the distinct contribution of each module within the framework. These results indicate that DGNSCA provides a reliable and scalable solution for intelligent fault diagnosis under realistic, distribution-shifted operating conditions."

This paper discusses the validation model output that runs based on the actual data using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling software. The model itself is derived from the information system theories. The validation from the model itself proves that the output from each construct is well balanced and can be used for future research, especially in the IT service support area. For this purpose, the items from the Service Quality (SERVQUAL) and IT Service Expertise were evaluated using questionnaires. As for the example of practical, the data derived from an actual study which was conducted on 305 users from different companies and organizations, including educational services, was applied. The questionnaire consists of 18 questions with 5 scales of Likert points that were used to identify the item data consistency. The association between observed parameters or indicators and their corresponding latent constructs or factors is represented by outer loadings in Partial Least Squares Structural Equation (PLS-SEM). The indicators are related to the fundamental construct that they are intended to measure; these values are essential. Based on the sufficient strength, the measured outer loading values, which range from 0.649 to 0.892, show high reliability through representing latent structures, as indicated by values near 0.90, while values above 0.60 are typically regarded as acceptable. Strong item-to-construct relationships are reflected in this model range."

By collecting joint and end effector vibration signals through an accelerometer array, adaptive noise suppression is achieved by embedding non local blocks (FCN-NLB) into a fully convolutional neural network. Combined with multi-layer unsupervised feature learning of deep belief networks (DBN) and multi-source evidence fusion of Dezert Smarandache theory (DSmT), a three-level diagnostic system of “noise reduction feature extraction decision optimization” is constructed. The experiment shows that the framework improves the signal-to-noise ratio to 11.3 dB in a -10 dB noise environment, and the diagnostic accuracy of four joint concurrent faults reaches 94.3%, which is 9.3% higher than a single DBN model. The study has verified the effectiveness of deep learning and multi-source information fusion in complex industrial scenarios, providing a robust and generalized solution for robot fault diagnosis. In the future, we will focus on model lightweight design and multimodal data fusion to promote practical applications in industrial fields."

Existing methods have trouble combining information from different scales and lowering their complexity.

To overcome these limitations, a novel and extremely light-weight HACNet model with just 1.43 million parameters, has been proposed. It contains a novel Hierarchical Attention-Compression Module (HACM) to boost feature representational capacity. A Feature Aggregation Unit (FAU) uses dense connectivity and a Triplet Attention layer to fuse multi-scale feature maps, and the Attentional Compression Unit (ACU) reduces dimensionality using strided convolution and channel and spatial attention mechanisms. Experimental results on the Covid19 radiography dataset and the ChestX-ray8 dataset demonstrate strong classification capabilities of the proposed model in identifying diseases from x-ray images. The proposed model is computationally efficient than popular computer vision models and demonstrates excellent qualitative capabilities as demonstrated from t-SNE plots."

    "abstract": "Deploying deep learning for chest X-ray interpretation in clinical settings faces persistent challenges, including heavy computational requirements, high latency, and limited hardware resources that restrict the use of state-of-the-art models. To address these constraints, knowledge distillation is leveraged to compress a high-capacity DenseNet121 into a streamlined ResNet18 while maintaining clinical performance. The approach is benchmarked using the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset, targeting multi-label disease classification. Results show that the distilled student achieves a mean ROC-AUC of 0.81, exceeding the teacher’s 0.79, while reducing multiply-add operations by 36%, slashing inference latency by a factor of 4.6 (0.20 ms vs. 0.92 ms per image), and cutting peak GPU memory usage by 60% (85 MB vs. 209 MB). These outcomes confirm that efficient model compression through knowledge distillation enables rapid, reliable, and resource-friendly deployment of diagnostic AI in real-world medical environments."

    "abstract": "Water is the essence of life that is necessary for all living beings. Nonetheless, surface water contamination with lead (Pb) contributes to the onset of different ailments, and conventional approaches to identifying lead pollution are inefficient and time-consuming. Hence, this study presents remote sensing and computer vision methods for detecting lead contamination in several locations of the Indus River. The proposed technique utilizes multispectral satellite images to highlight the areas of water bodies polluted with lead. Moreover, machine learning and deep learning approaches, such as the Random Forest (RF), VGG16UNET model, and the Fully Convolutional Network(FCN), are used to detect lead contamination. The results show that the RF outperformed other algorithms and achieved 73% accuracy. The VGG16UNET model outperformed other deep models like DeepLabv3. The VGG16UNET achieved a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) score of 0.70. However, FCN had the greatest mIoU, at 0.65, for the augmented solution. Thus, the proposed method has enhanced the monitoring of the aquatic bodies in real-time with maximum area coverage. Moreover, the efficiency and accuracy achieved with the proposed method can help the officials and management to identify areas with polluted water."

    "abstract": "This paper studies a combined space partitioning and network flow optimization problem, with applications to large-scale electric power, transportation, or communication systems. In dense wireless networks for instance, one may want to simultaneously optimize the assignment of many spatially distributed users to base stations and route the resulting communication traffic through the backbone network. We formulate the overall problem by coupling a semi-discrete optimal transport (SDOT) problem, capturing the space partitioning component, with a minimum-cost flow problem on a discrete network. This formulation jointly optimizes the assignment of a continuous demand distribution to certain endpoint network nodes and the routing of flows over the network to serve the demand, under capacity constraints. As for SDOT problems, we establish that the formulation of our problem admits a tight relaxation taking the form of an infinite-dimensional linear program, derive its finite-dimensional dual, and prove that strong duality holds. We leverage this theory to design a distributed dual (super)gradient ascent algorithm solving the problem, where nodes in the graph perform computations based solely on locally available information. Simulation results illustrate the algorithm’s performance and its applicability to an electric power distribution network reconfiguration problem."

Although it is incurable, detecting it at an early stage leads to better management. Doctors rely on respiratory sounds, particularly crackles and wheezes which are hard to detect even by experts to identify COPD. The most effective diagnostic tool currently is the spirometry, but it is not always available in primary care or resource limited settings. In this study, we used the ICBHI 2017 Respiratory Sound Database to evaluate two hybrid deep learning architectures for anomaly level classification under cycle based splits as a lightweight baseline, with attention mechanisms and patient-level splits left for future work. Data augmentation and class balancing were applied to improve recognition of underrepresented classes. After applying augmentation and class balancing, our CNN-BiGRU model achieved promising results, reaching 74% accuracy, 0.90 AUC, 78% specificity, and 69% sensitivity. The models were evaluated under a cycle-level split condition that reflects real-world scenarios where systems repeatedly process data from the same patients under chronic conditions such as COPD. This work is presented as a step towards COPD-targeted screening. A future step will be mapping from discovered anomalies to specific disease patterns, including COPD."

    "abstract": "In biology, homeostasis is the process of maintaining a stable internal environment, which is crucial for optimal functioning of organisms. One of the key homeostatic mechanisms is thermoregulation that allows the organism to maintain its core temperature within tight bounds despite being exposed to a wide range of varying external temperatures. Instrumental in thermoregulation is the presence of thermosensitive neurons at multiple places throughout the body, including muscles, the spinal cord, and the brain, which provide spiking sensory signals for the core temperature. In response to these signals, thermoeffectors are activated, creating a negative spiking feedback loop. Additionally, a feedforward signal is provided by warmth and cold-sensitive neurons in the skin, offering a measure for the external temperature. This paper presents an electronic circuit-based architecture design to replicate the biological process of thermoregulation, combined with a formal mathematical analysis. The considered architecture consists of four temperature sensitive neurons and a single actuator, configured in a negative feedback loop with feedforward control. To model the overall system mathematically, hybrid dynamical system descriptions are proposed that are used to analyze and simulate the performance of the design. The analysis and numerical case study illustrate the crucial role of feedforward control in reducing the dependency on the external temperature."

    "abstract": "The comprehensive integration of wireless technology in intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) demands rigorous and practical Over-the-air (OTA) performance testing. However, the large physical dimensions of vehicles render direct application of standardized mobile phone testing methods outlined by Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association and 3rd Generation Partnership Project impractical. Employing compact antenna test range for vehicle testing faces significant challenges such as high costs and potential safety hazards during 3D rotation for a vehicle, while existing spherical near-field testing methods fail to accurately evaluate the Total Radiated Power (TRP) and Total Isotropic Sensitivity (TIS) for multi-antenna spatial diversity systems, a common configuration in modern ICVs to ensure robust coverage. This paper proposes a novel, efficient, and comprehensive measurement methodology specifically designed for TRP and TIS testing of multiple transceivers, addressing the gap in current approaches. The solution involves characterizing the passive radiation patterns of the vehicle’s multiple antennas and functionally isolating individual transceivers to determine their respective port radiated power and radiated sensitivity. These parameters are then used to calculate the effective isotropic radiated power and effective isotropic sensitivity, ultimately deriving the overall multi-antenna TRP and TIS. In addition to precision, a significant advantage of this method is its dramatically reduced test time; for instance, TIS measurement for a single frequency band can be completed within thirty minutes instead of the dozens of hours required by traditional methods. This approach represents the only viable and practical solution for wireless performance evaluation of ICVs."

The framework ensures constraint satisfaction, recursive feasibility, and closed-loop stability. Numerical simulations with unmanned aerial vehicles validate the method, demonstrating effective attack detection and recovery while maintaining formation integrity.

The use of the FSS is to improve the performance of the antenna by acting as a reflector and is based on a Split Ring Resonator (SRR) design. In a free-space environment, the integration reduced the reflection coefficient (S11) to -60 dB at 2.45 GHz (F1) and -40 dB at 5.8 GHz (F2). Additionally, the gain increased significantly, reaching 4.31 dBi and 4.64 dBi at F1 and F2, respectively. When evaluated on a human tissue (ht) model, the antenna's performance was shown to be stable and safe, with average SAR values of 1.1 W/Kg and 0.48 W/Kg for 1g and 10g, respectively, at both frequencies. It is a promising solution for high-performance wearable devices because these values are significantly lower than the IEEE 802.15.6 Standard. It is noteworthy that this initial work used a multi-layer model to simulate the human body for biomedical patient tracking applications. For every simulation, CST Microwave Studio was utilized.

The process integrates a laser rangefinder for displacement measurement and an inclinometer for attitude determination, with spatial correlation achieved through a monocular camera tracking the laser spot projected onto a flat plate. Accordingly, we propose a combined calibration algorithm for the pose measurement system, using an auxiliary camera and a double-sided target.

    "abstract": "The accurate classification of Low, Slow, and Small (LSS) targets in low-altitude airspace is a critical challenge for surveillance and safety systems. While radar provides essential data, methods relying on a single information source, such as micro-Doppler signatures or kinematic tracks, are often unreliable due to low radar cross-sections and complex clutter environments. Consequently, multimodal fusion has emerged as a promising direction. However, the performance of conventional fusion algorithms is often compromised by their static fusion strategies, where fixed weights assigned during training cannot adapt to real-world scenarios in which the quality of a data stream may degrade. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the Multimodal Adaptive Feature Fusion Network (MAFF-Net), a multilevel dual-branch architecture designed to overcome the vulnerabilities of both single-source methods and static fusion. At each hierarchical level, a Semantic Bridge Module (SBM) first aligns heterogeneous features from different modalities using contrastive learning. Crucially, an Adaptive Fusion Module (AFM) then dynamically arbitrates the contribution of each information stream, enabling the network to intelligently rely on higher-quality data and mitigate the effects of signal distortion or loss. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset collected from five distinct geographical sites, MAFF-Net achieves 91.01% accuracy, outperforming other advanced fusion methods by up to 2.0 percentage points. The model's robustness and practical utility are further validated through extensive cross-site testing and a successful in-the-field deployment."

The major advantages of this inverter circuit with cyclic ON and OFFcontrol include simple, independent power control for every load, high efficiency for wide range of power variations, soft-switching and reduced number of switches per load. This configurationcan be easily extended for multiple loads by addition of another inverter legs. This configuration has been simulated using PSIM software. A 629 W experimental prototype is built to verify thetheoretical analysis. A peak efficiency of 96.1% is obtained.

Conventional deep learning frameworks for CSLR consist of a single or multimodal feature extractor, a sequence-learning module and a decoder for outputting glosses. The sequence learning module is a crucial part wherein transformers have demonstrated their efficacy in the sequenceto- sequence tasks. However, experimentation in the sequencelearning component for sign language is limited. In this work, we present an innovative CSLR framework, ConSignformer, which combines the strengths of a hybrid network built with S3DCNN and a Conformer-based sequence-learning backbone. To enhance the sequence learning capabilities of the Conformer module, we propose a novel unsupervised pretraining strategy called Regressional Feature Extraction, which uniquely leverages sign pose videos as training data and employs Mean Squared Error loss. We then introduce Cross-Modal Relative Attention (CMRA), which further enhances the ability of the Conformer to learn and utilize complex relationships within the RGB and keypoints data. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the adopted pretraining strategy and demonstrate how CMRA contributes to the recognition process. Remarkably, by leveraging a Conformer-based backbone, our CSLR model achieves state-ofthe-art performance on the benchmark datasets: PHOENIX-2014 and PHOENIX-2014T."

Since the exact GCI fusion of two PMB densities is intractable, we derive a principled approximation. Specifically, we approximate the power of a PMB density as an unnormalised PMB density, which corresponds to an upper bound of the PMB density. Then, the GCI fusion rule corresponds to the normalised product of two unnormalised PMB densities. We show that the result is a Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM), which can be expressed in closed form. Future prediction and update steps in each filter preserve the PMBM form, which can be projected back to a PMB density before the next fusion step. Experimental results show the benefits of this approach compared to other distributed multi-object filters."

This paper proposes a deep learning-based method to reconstruct a Toeplitz and positive-definite array covariance matrix with the unit nuclear norm property. Rather than emphasizing the neural network architecture, our focus is placed on the design of the network output layer and the loss function. The output layer is designed to generate a learned spatial spectrum consisting of a fixed-size set of DOAs and their corresponding signal-to-noise ratios, based on which a Toeplitz and positive-definite covariance matrix is reconstructed. The unit nuclear norm constraint is hard-encoded into the covariance matrix without hyperparameters. The loss function is derived from a whitened fitting error, followed by a projected multiplicatively symmetric transformation. The Toeplitz and positive-definite structure fully captures the properties of a true covariance matrix, while the unit nuclear norm constraint promotes sparsity and eliminates the need to add an extra output head for noise variance estimation. The new loss function enhances the accuracy of estimating the smaller eigenvalues of the reconstructed matrix. Based on the reconstructed covariance matrix, the signal number and DOA estimation can be performed using conventional methods. Numerical simulations and outdoor measurements are utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method with the uniform linear array (ULA) and non-uniform linear array (NULA), as well as its robustness to array nonidealities."

The challenge of suppressing interferences, including scattering and coupling, in the tri-band array is holistically addressed across wide bands. Guided by characteristic mode analysis (CMA), a segmented spiral radiator is efficiently developed to mitigate scattering and coupling at high frequencies while preserving radiation performance at low frequencies. Compared to a conventional tube radiator, the proposed spiral exhibits a reduced radar cross-section (RCS) over an ultra-wide range of 4.7-21.5 GHz (128.2%). With the aid of serial resonators, impedance matching of the segmented-spiral-based dipole antenna is achieved across the low band (LB) of 3.05-4.68 GHz (42.2%), spanning the 5G band 3.3-4.2 GHz. Moreover, suppressors are placed near the LB ports to further reduce the cross-band coupling. Middle band (MB) and high band (HB) antennas operate in 6.2-10.0 GHz (46.9%) and 10.0-15.6 GHz (43.8%), respectively, collectively covering the anticipated 5G-Advanced and 6G centimetric band of 6.425-15.35 GHz. Both the MB and HB antennas employ a planar magnetoelectric (ME) dipole structure, which prevents common-mode resonances in the LB and MB, and mitigates the scattering from the MB antenna in the HB. In this tri-band array, radiation patterns remain undistorted across the LB, MB, and HB, and the isolation between any two ports exceeds 20 dB over all three bands."

First of all, the hover point selection is formulated as a trade-off between the number of hover points and sensing distances. At each hover point, the UAV transmits ISAC signals for target sensing and maintains a communication link with the USV. Secondly, the system operates in two modes: <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">flight mode</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">hover mode</i>. In flight mode, the UAV and USV maintain stable communication while navigating safely to the hover points. In hover mode, the UAV remains stationary to perform S&C tasks, ensuring that each target meets the required cumulative sensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and that the communication rate with the USV is maintained. To solve the trajectory and beamforming optimization problem, we combine techniques such as Semidefinite Relaxation (SDR) and Successive Convex Approximation (SCA). Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves notably lower energy consumption than the baseline scheme. They also reveal that the design of hover points achieves a balance between system energy consumption and the upper bound of sensing performance."

    "abstract": "Disaggregation of the Radio Access Network (RAN) imposes stringent fronthaul latency and physical-layer performance requirements on supporting the optical transport infrastructure. This paper evaluates the feasibility of Access–DU–Access (A–DU–A) routes in a converged metro–access optical network, jointly considering Bit Error Rate (BER) and the fronthaul latency constraint of 250 μs, considering functional split 7.2 defined by 3GPP. Two deployment scenarios are examined: (i) DU/CU hosting at metropolitan Points of Presence (PoPs) and (ii) DU/CU hosting at external data centers (DCs). Using Cassini and Phoenix whiteboxes hosting pluggable DCO transceivers (TRxs), the analysis quantifies the impact of modulation format, BER thresholds, and end-to-end propagation latency on service feasibility. Results show that metro-based hosting supports 87.9% latency-compliant routes compared to 47.6% under data-center hosting, and that Cassini consistently provides higher BER feasibility across modulation formats. The findings demonstrate that physical-layer impairments and functional placement must be jointly optimized to support latency-constrained, virtualized RAN transport in converged metro–access networks."

    "abstract": "Distributed computing has been widely applied in distributed edge networks for reducing the processing burden of high-dimensional data centralization, where a high-dimensional computational task is decomposed into multiple low-dimensional collaborative processing tasks or multiple edge nodes use distributed data to train a global model. However, the computing power of a single-edge node is limited, and collaborative computing will cause information leakage and excessive communication overhead. In this paper, we design a parallel collaborative distributed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and propose a three-phase parallel collaborative ADMM privacy computing (3P-ADMM-PC2) algorithm for distributed computing in edge networks, where the Paillier homomorphic encryption is utilized to protect data privacy during interactions. Especially, a quantization method is introduced, which maps the real numbers to a positive integer interval without affecting the homomorphic operations. To address the architectural mismatch between large- integer and Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) computing, we transform high-bitwidth computations into low-bitwidth matrix and vector operations. Thus the GPU can be utilized to implement parallel encryption and decryption computations with long keys. Finally, a GPU-accelerated 3P-ADMM-PC2 is proposed to optimize the collaborative computing tasks. Meanwhile, large-scale computational tasks are conducted in network topologies with varying numbers of edge nodes. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed 3P-ADMM-PC2 has excellent mean square error performance, which is close to that of distributed ADMM without privacy-preserving. Compared to centralized ADMM and distributed ADMM implemented with Central Processing Unit (CPU) computation, the proposed scheme demonstrates a significant speedup ratio."

The core innovation is a local ray incidence-based technique that computes the reflection and multi-reflection components from targets and the coupling scattering components between targets and the background. This approach generates ray tubes exclusively from the target facet model. The background facet model is subsequently processed to perform ray-triangle intersection tests, while coupling scattering components are modified using the four-path principle. Background scattering is calculated via coherent-incoherent models, and diffraction components are computed using the Equivalent Electromagnetic Current (EEC) method. The accuracy of the proposed method is validated against full-wave numerical solvers, showing good agreement in radar cross-section (RCS) fluctuations. Compared to the traditional Shooting and Bouncing Rays (SBR) technique with EEC, the proposed method achieves a significant reduction in simulation time. This capability enables the rapid simulation of SAR images for targets on complex rough surfaces."

However, many educational games are designed as serious games, focusing less on engaging elements. Furthermore, DGBL has remained unexplored in the context of materials science and engineering. This study develops and evaluates a novel framework, television media-based educational game (TMEG). The study hypothesizes that integrating elements that make television series engaging into educational games can significantly enhance the learning experience. The study explored: 1) how to integrate TV media elements into educational games and 2) the effect of such integration on learning outcomes. The proposed three-layered TMEG framework includes: an input layer combining MSE content with narrative/design elements from student-preferred TV series; a game cycle layer enabling iterative judgment-behavior-feedback loops that transition students from declarative to applied knowledge; and an outcome layer targeting behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement, fostering improved content understanding. A pilot game was developed using the TMEG framework and evaluated with 96 undergraduate students. Data were collected through pre-/post-tests, the system usability scale (SUS), and qualitative feedback. Results showed a statistically significant improvement in test scores (from 74% to 89%) with topic-level scores indicating the highest gains in concepts involving multistep reasoning. The mean SUS score of 76.5 and qualitative feedback indicated strong usability. TMEG offers a novel approach to engineering education by embedding conceptually rigorous content within familiar and engaging media-based narratives. It shows strong potential to improve STEM learning outcomes, particularly in MSE."

Despite rapid method growth, the field lacks a consolidated, reproducible map with normalized evaluation and clear cross-domain comparability. Using a dual-reviewer protocol across IEEE Xplore, Scopus, Web of Science, and ACM Digital Library (last search 2025-09-14), the review conducts quality appraisal, taxonomy synthesis, science mapping, and narrative synthesis with random-effects meta-analysis when metrics align. The protocol records timeslice granularity, alignment strategies, preprocessing, and vocabulary drift handling, and normalizes evaluation nomenclature. Evidence is organized across LDA/DTM, ETM/CTM, BER Topic, and dynamic embedding families and cataloged using coherence by Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI), topic stability, topic diversity, alignment quality, and human intruder accuracy. The synthesis indicates that reported performance and mixture reliability are sensitive to preprocessing, alignment, and evaluation choices; stability across resampling and time is as critical as coherence; contextualized models often increase coherence yet may reduce temporal smoothness without explicit alignment; and adding human judgment frequently reshuffles model rankings. Coverage spans time-stamped benchmarks such as 20 Newsgroups temporal variants, Reuters RCV1/RCV2, arXiv and PubMed abstracts, social or news streams, and parliamentary and legal texts. The review delivers a taxonomy, a science map, and a standardized reporting and replication template.

Output from these resources is subject to unpredictable fluctuations driven by meteorological conditions, particularly wind speed and solar irradiance. This intermittency differentiates these resources from dispatchable conventional generation and necessitates the development of robust forecasting tools to maintain system reliability and operational efficiency. As the penetration of variable renewable energy (VRE) increases, accurate short-term and day-ahead forecasting becomes critical for grid stability, unit commitment, economic dispatch, and ancillary services planning. Over the past two decades, countries with high VRE integration have accumulated extensive experience in the development and deployment of forecasting methodologies. A wide range of forecasting models, techniques, and institutional frameworks have been tested and refined, resulting in the emergence of internationally recognized practices. However, it is noted that like electricity demand forecasting, there is no one-size-fits-all approach in VRE forecasting, and hence, VRE forecasting must be tailored to specific system characteristics and regional conditions. <p xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">This article synthesizes global experiences in the design, implementation, and institutional administration of VRE forecasting systems.

Against the typically adopted off-policy PI based approaches for safe RL, our approach proposes on-policy PI algorithm under input saturation to iteratively learn the optimal control policy. To ensure safety during the exploration phase, where the high magnitude of exploration noise could compromise system safety, a so called fall-back policy is proposed and incorporated.

In the setting of a linearized Bayesian formulation incorporating prior information about the parameters, a general concave design criterion is utilized to quantify the anticipated estimation accuracy. This design criterion is maximized by selecting a best subset of gauged sites from among a given and possibly very large finite set of candidate sites. To circumvent the inherent combinatorial nature of this problem combined with the correlation structure of the errors, a convex relaxation is proposed here, which results from the decomposition of the covariance kernel into the sum of a positive definite matrix and a scalar multiple of the identity matrix. A relaxed problem is then formulated and solved using extremely efficient simplicial decomposition. Since the optimal relaxed solution is a measure on the set of candidate sites, randomization is used to convert it into a nearly optimal sensor configuration. Simulation experiments regarding a process of induction heating are reported to validate the presented approach."

Hybrid wind farms (HWFs) with both grid-following (GFL) and grid-forming (GFM) wind turbines (WTs) are better adapted to wide-ranging changes in grid state. However, the frequency support capability of each wind turbine in an HWF depends on factors like wind speed and control type. Current controls do not fully exploit the grid frequency support potential of each WT in different states. Hence, this paper first analyzes the frequency regulation characteristics of GFL WTs and virtual synchronous generator (VSG)-based GFM WTs, revealing the uniformity between them. Furthermore, a distributed cooperative frequency control (DCFC) for HWFs is proposed to improve grid frequency stability. DCFC uses a leaderless consistency algorithm to allocate the output active power of each wind turbine according to the state of the different WTs. Additionally, the adaptive optimisation feature of DCFC adjusts the frequency support coefficients of the wind turbines in real time as their rotor kinetic energy varies, improving the safety of the WTs. Finally, the GFL and GFM frequency regulation uniformity theory and the DCFC are comprehensively verified. The results show that DCFC improves the security of the WTs and enhances the frequency support capability compared to centralised control."

The suggested system is unlike the traditional static models in the sense that it includes a closed loop of observe, generate, evaluate and act so that iterative correction to the system is feasible with the changing data and performance of the system. The framework utilizes hybrid generative processes in advancing specific hypotheses, which are then critically appraised on the basis of multi-objective premises comprising classification accuracy, minority class recall and computing efficiency. Observations of hypothesis that surpass the acceptance criterion are advanced to be the new foundation models thereby guaranteeing adaptive enhancement.We performed an example of the methodology by running a 10-iteration distributed assessment on the Adult Income data with the nodes simultaneously training and testing hypothesis under a federated-like scheme. Findings demonstrate that results consistently gain over the base, logistic regression model with feature selection-based hypotheses scoring a +3.83 percentage point accuracy pick up and a +35.29 percentage point minorities recall lift, which is maintained, in all iterations. The methodology is also designed to guarantee domain specific flexibility, decision-making transparency, and effective resource consumption, serving the current shortage of sustained adaptation, hypothesis-based research, and benchmarking of generative Artificial intelligence systems. This framework gives both a scalable and repeatable process of implementing self-evolution on various, concrete research and industrial settings."

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a favorable candidate to support the forthcoming 6G applications. However, conventional ISAC systems, constrained to operate within predetermined frequency ranges, remain highly susceptible to narrowband, fixed-frequency jamming, which poses significant challenges in hostile electromagnetic environments. In this paper, a dual-band anti-jamming ISAC system operating in the D-band is proposed using permutation frequency hopping (PFH). Compared with traditional single-band frequency hopping spread spectrum systems, the dual-band PFH system exploits frequency diversity, maintaining sensing and communication even when one sub-band is jammed. Besides, it possesses superiorities of non-repeating adjacent frequencies and zero maximum out-of-phase Hamming autocorrelation, thereby enhancing anti-jamming robustness and reducing the probability of signal interception by hostile receivers. By leveraging the opposite-phase characteristic of linear frequency modulation-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signal, the low-cost self-coherent communication receiver is realized. The dual-band PFH system reduces the functional interruption probability under various broadband noise jamming of 32.22%, 61.72% and 83.27%, respectively. In the sensing receiver, the identification of five interference types is realized by dual-band signatures. Finally, the coherent fusion processing enables a large equivalent bandwidth resolution and thus an enhanced spectral efficiency. In experiments, a dual-band signal centered at 132 GHz is generated. A data rate of ∼470 Mbit/s and an equivalent range resolution of 1.94 cm are achieved. By processing simulated echoes, the two-dimensional imaging resolution of ∼1.875 cm × ∼1.99 cm is obtained. The proposed scheme offers a promising solution for anti-jamming ISAC system in complex electromagnetic environments."

While behavioral biometrics provide a promising complementary solution, their application to fighting games, characterized by rapid, skillful controller inputs, remains underexplored. This study proposes a player authentication method for fighting games that applies keystroke-authentication principles to controller input dynamics. We conducted experiments using 99 matches from nine professional players of Street Fighter 6 and demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach, showing an area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC) of $\\mathbf{7 5. 7 \\%}$. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that the biometric signal is highly context-dependent: in-combat data yielded higher performance than idle-time data. These findings validate the applicability of keystroke-dynamics principles to controller dynamics and establish an interpretable baseline."

In this work, a framework borrowing from principles of continuum dynamics is proposed for scalable trajectory generation of multi-agent systems. The problem is presented as an optimal control problem (OCP), transcribed to a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem with Bernstein polynomials, which gives a solution as a time-dependent solid. This solution inherently guarantees inter-agent collision avoidance and leverages the unique properties of the Bernstein basis to ensure adherence to constraints including obstacle collision avoidance."

    "abstract": "The combination of wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) and mode division multiplexing (MDM) is a promising route to drastically increase the capacity of optical wireless communication (OWC). However, the development of mode multiplexers/demultiplexers (MUXs/DeMUXs) that concurrently deliver low insertion loss and low inter-mode crosstalk over a wide optical band remains challenging. Moreover, while 800G coherent optical modules are commercially available, their use in ultra-high-capacity OWC systems lacks experimental validation. To address these issues, this work presents an integrated solution employing a novel multi-channel, MIMO-free spatial mode MUX/DeMUX based on multi-plane light conversion (MPLC) alongside commercial 800G coherent transponders for ultra-high capacity OWC system. This setup enables the first demonstration of a real-time OWC system with a net data rate of 204 Tb/s. The implemented mode MUX/DeMUX exhibits >27.91dB isolation and power losses below 18.91dB (C6T-band) and 18.71dB (L6T-band), enabling MIMO-free operation. These results provide critical insights for future ultra-high-capacity OWC systems."

    "abstract": "We study the invertibility of nonlinear dynamical systems from the perspective of contraction and incremental stability analysis and propose a new invertible recurrent neural model: the BiLipREN. In particular, we consider a nonlinear state space model to be robustly invertible if an inverse exists with a state space realisation, and both the forward model and its inverse are contracting, i.e. incrementally exponentially stable, and Lipschitz, i.e. have bounded incremental gain. This property of bi-Lipschitzness implies both robustness in the sense of sensitivity to input perturbations, as well as robust distinguishability of different inputs from their corresponding outputs, i.e. the inverse model robustly reconstructs the input sequence despite small perturbations to the initial conditions and measured output. Building on this foundation, we propose a parameterization of neural dynamic models: bi-Lipschitz recurrent equilibrium networks (biLipREN), which are robustly invertible by construction. Moreover, biLipRENs can be composed with orthogonal linear systems to construct more general bi-Lipschitz dynamic models, e.g., a nonlinear analogue of minimum-phase/all-pass (inner/outer) factorization. We illustrate the utility of our proposed approach with numerical examples."

The ultimate challenge was to create an intelligent diagnostic system that was capable of accurately labeling the status of CKD when analyzed against the set of patient data that could be gathered by IoT sensors. Complex performance measures such as accuracy, recall, precision, <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{F 1}$</tex>-score and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were employed to measure the performance of the model. The trained and validated model was then based on the CKD data to reflect the real-world data situation in the healthcare sector. The outcome revealed that the accuracy of the hybrid deep learning model was 95% and overall accuracy was 0.96 of AUC, 92.5 F1-score, 92 percent of recall, and 93 percent of precision. These findings showed a striking performance of the model to accurately classify non-CKD and CKD conditions as well as reduce the number of false conclusions. Although ROC and precisionrecall curves exemplified exemplary resilience when processing unbalanced medical data, the confusion matrix demonstrated satisfactory consistency in classification, which is why the system can be considered an effective tool to detect CKD at its early stages, positively affecting the health of patients and decreasing the load on the healthcare system. In general, this paper has shown the role that hybrid deep learning models and IoT frameworks can take in the development of proactive and intelligent healthcare systems."

The current paper suggests a Unified IoT Framework, which would consolidate the smart parking management and EV charging infrastructure based on a multi-layered architecture of IoT sensors, edge gateways, and cloud analytics. The system includes ultrasonic and infrared (IR) sensors to understand the occupancy of parking slots, the current and voltage sensors to track the EV charging parameters. Information is gathered using microcontrollers and handled locally on Jetson Nano edge gateways and transferred to a cloud backend via MQTT over LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, or Wi-Fi, depending on the environmental conditions. The design uses dynamic slot assignment using Q-learning, predictive pricing, and blockchain-based billing to enhance integrity and confidence to the users. An experimental analysis in a testbed of 50 parking slots and 10 EV charging stations showed that the occupancy detection accuracy could be measured at 98.2 on average, and that billing integrity and network uptime were 100.0 and 99.5 respectively. The edge processing latency was below 50 ms which confirms the responsiveness of the system. The integrated platform also realized an efficient load balancing of energy with 23.5% of the charging energy coming out of solar panels demonstrating its sustainability. The findings have validated the fact that the suggested framework is strong, flexible, and prepared to implement in reality in cities and suburbs."

To address these challenges, we propose a gradient-based controller embedding sample-and-hold mechanisms to handle packet losses. We analyze the resulting stochastic closed-loop system through the lens of stochastic timescale separation. This perspective allows us to establish the almost sure global asymptotic convergence of the closed-loop system to a set in which first-order optimality conditions of the underlying nonconvex optimization problem are satisfied. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to support our theoretical findings."

Currently, conventional single-source methods are constrained by modality-specific limitations and struggle to balance accuracy with real-time performance. This paper proposes the Multi-Source Information Fusion Estimation Framework (MSIF-EF) that leverages digital map priors, onboard vision, and vehicle-response information to estimate typical paved-road features. The proposed framework establishes a closed-loop pipeline-prior acquisition, online verification, and information updating–in which map priors condition the estimator's initial state; onboard vision and vehicle dynamic responses cross-validate recognition in real time to correct prior biases; and a writeback mechanism enables dynamic correction and continual updating of map data. Simulation studies show that, with map priors available, the proposed MSIF-EF markedly shortens convergence time and improves recognition accuracy relative to dynamics-based estimators; when priors are missing or degraded, it still sustains high accuracy over single-modality baselines while updating the map online."

    "abstract": "Creating detailed 3D characters from a single image remains challenging due to the difficulty in separating semantic components during generation. Existing methods often produce entangled meshes with poor topology, hindering downstream applications like rigging and animation. We introduce SeparateGen, a novel framework that generates high-quality 3D characters by explicitly reconstructing them as distinct semantic components (e.g., body, clothing, hair, shoes) from a single, arbitrary-pose image. SeparateGen first leverages a multi-view diffusion model to generate consistent multi-view images in a canonical Apose. Then, a novel component-aware reconstruction model, SC-LRM, conditioned on these multi-view images, adaptively decomposes and reconstructs each component with high fidelity. To train and evaluate SeparateGen, we contribute SC-Anime, the first large-scale dataset of 7,580 anime-style 3D characters with detailed component-level annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SeparateGen significantly outperforms stateof- the-art methods in both reconstruction quality and multiview consistency. Furthermore, our component-based approach effectively resolves mesh entanglement issues, enabling seamless rigging and asset reuse. SeparateGen thus represents a step towards generating high-quality, application-ready 3D characters from a single image. The SC-Anime dataset and our code will be publicly released."

These attacks generate serious concerns for the traditional security systems in maintaining accuracy, privacy, false-positive control, and resilience in modern distributed environments. To cope with these concerns, this paper proposes QFedPhish, a quantum-inspired federated learning approach designed to identify and detect AI-generated phishing attacks. A combination of real-world phishing logs with synthetically generated large language model-based phishing attempts is built as a representative dataset. This data is then transformed through a quantum-inspired feature encoder, where random Fourier features and tensor-network compression capture subtle stylometric and structural cues that distinguish phishing content from legitimate content. Next, each participating client locally trains a lightweight classifier on the resulting embeddings, enabling model adaptation to heterogeneous environments without exposing raw data. Finally, model updates are aggregated using federated learning enhanced with differential privacy and resilient aggregation mechanisms. It mitigates risks of data leakage and poisoning attacks. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that QFedPhish consistently outperforms the best benchmark models, achieving gains of 0.10% in accuracy, 0.33% in precision, 0.41% in F1-score, 0.61% in AUC, along with reducing communication overhead by 3.89% and improving convergence speed by 3.66%."

    "abstract": "Land surface temperature (LST) is a key parameter for characterizing land–atmosphere interactions, energy balance, and ecological processes. Previous studies have incorporated topographic effects in mountainous LST (MLST) retrieval, yet systematic quantification of the seasonal magnitude of these effects remains lacking. In this study, Landsat-8 thermal infrared data are employed from the sensor's observational perspective, and representative images for spring, summer, autumn, and winter are selected across the Tibet Plateau, enabling the determination of seasonal topographic effects (ΔLST), where ΔLST refers to the difference between LST retrieved without and with consideration of topographic effects. Results indicate that ΔLST is primarily controlled by topographic factors, including small-scale self-heating parameters (SSP), sky view factor (SVF), and land surface emissivity (LSE). Among the seasons, topographic effect is most pronounced in summer, with ΔLST exceeding 8 K in rugged areas with low emissivity. ΔLST exhibits clear dependence on slope and aspect, with south-facing slopes generally higher than north-facing slopes, and increasing with slope steepness, indicating that steep slopes are more sensitive to solar radiation. Further analysis reveals that ΔLST is positively correlated with SSP, and negatively correlated with SVF and LSE, with the strongest correlations observed in summer, suggesting that topographic radiation imbalance is the dominant mechanism controlling MLST variability. Note that when SSP is close to 1.0, SVF is close to 0.0, and LSE is close to 1.0, ΔLST is minimal, and topographic effects on LST can be neglected. Overall, the seasonal pattern of ΔLST follows the order: summer > autumn ≈ spring > winter, and a recent increasing trend in ΔLST implies enhanced thermal responses in mountainous regions under climate warming. These findings improve understanding of topographic influences on MLST retrieval and provide more reliable LST data for studies of energy balance, evapotranspiration, and ecological processes."

It also facilitates precise estimation of Huygens resonance positions. The method offers high predictive accuracy and significantly accelerates the identification of optimal frequency ranges and unit cell parameters, streamlining the metasurface design process. To validate the proposed technique, a focusing transmission metasurface based on a triple-layer Jerusalem cross unit cell is designed, simulated, and experimentally characterized. The metasurface demonstrates robust transmission amplitude and near-complete phase control across the 6–8-GHz band. Measurements confirm stable focusing performance with minimal focal drift over a 28.6% ultrawide bandwidth."

First, accurately modeling nonlinear dynamics remains diﬃcult. Second, variables directly related to control objectives often cannot be directly measured during operation. Although high-cost sensors can measure these variables during model development, their use in practical deployment is typically infeasible. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Predictive Virtual Sensor Identification (PVSID) framework that leverages temporary high-cost sensors during the modeling phase to create virtual sensors for NMPC implementation. We validate PVSID on a Two-Degree-of-Freedom (2-DoF) direct-drive robotic arm with complex joint interactions. The tip position is measured using a motion capture system during modeling, while encoders and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) are utilized in NMPC. Experimental results show that our NMPC with identified virtual sensors achieves precise tip trajectory tracking without requiring the motion capture system during operation. PVSID offers a practical solution for implementing optimal control in nonlinear systems where the measurement of key variables is constrained by cost or operational limitations."

    "abstract": "In the clinic, brain tumor detection and semantic segmentation are critical tasks in medical image analysis, particularly in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which assists clinicians in diagnosing and monitoring tumor progression. However, convolutional models struggle with long-range information due to limited kernel sizes, which affects the precision of tumor segmentation, especially for tumors of varying sizes. On the other hand, transformer architecture excels at capturing long-range dependencies across domains such as computer vision. This inspired the adoption of vision transformer-based architectures for improved medical image analysis. This study presents SUFTD2, a novel segmentation framework that combines (Swin UNET Transformers) Swin UNETR with a finetuned Detectron2 model to detect and segment brain tumors precisely. Swin UNETR treats brain tumor segmentation as a sequence-to-sequence tumor prediction task, projecting multi-modal image data into a 1D sequence for processing by a hierarchical Swin UNETR encoder. This encoder extracts features at multiple resolutions using shifted windows for self-attention computation. A finetuned model from the Detectron2 model zoo is also used to detect tumor locations and regions. Our suggested framework supports continuous, decentralized medical monitoring by bridging AI-driven segmentation with connected healthcare infrastructure. It incorporates explainable AI (XAI) methods, including LIME and SHAP, to highlight tumor regions that influence predictions, thus improving clinical trust and interpretability. Using XAI and consumer-deployable technologies, the framework advances the accessibility and transparency of brain tumor diagnostics enabled by ubiquitous consumer electronics, aligning with next-generation connected healthcare goals. The proposed XAI-integrated Swin UNETR framework, which leverages consumer electronics for deployment, makes more advanced brain tumor diagnostics available and transparent. The proposed scheme has been tested on the BraTS2020 dataset. We use several performance evaluation matrices to evaluate the experimental outcomes of the proposed scheme. The proposed approach demonstrates outperformance compared to state-of-the-art models."

    "abstract": "The shift towards renewable energy has increased interest in dc microgrids as a promising integration solution. However, managing power-sharing, state-of-charge (SoC) balancing, and reliable ac coupling without communication remains challenging, necessitating advanced control methods. This article introduces a novel state-of-grid-based control for dc microgrids, enabling communication-free power-sharing and SoC balancing across battery systems, even with significant line resistances, while supporting synergistic ac coupling. Each battery locally projects its SoC into a small voltage offset around the nominal dc bus level; the resulting bus voltage therefore mirrors the average SoC of the entire microgrid. By using an analogous mapping for ac frequency, a single voltage–frequency metric unifies dc and ac domains. A small-signal Lyapunov analysis proves local exponential stability under realistic parameter spreads. The controller is implemented on a laboratory microgrid comprising two battery emulators, photovoltaic generation, programmable loads, and a Silicon Carbide interlink converter. Hardware results in islanded and grid-connected modes confirm voltage regulation, SoC equalization, and seamless power exchange."

    "abstract": "A new solution strategy, utilizing ramp functions, is proposed for solving LP problems arising in Model Predictive Control. The solution strategy can take a general LP formulation, and avoids the increase in optimization variables resulting from converting the LP problem into standard form. Unlike the simplex method, there is no need to find an initial feasible solution. Numerical experiments demonstrate a significant increase in solution speed compared to the previously proposed ramp-based Simplex [1], and compares favorably to a state-of-the-art commercial solver like CPLEX [2] for small to moderately sized problems."

    "abstract": "Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting and rating practices continue to face persistent challenges related to data transparency, reliability, and stakeholder trust. Existing processes are frequently fragmented and susceptible to greenwashing, limiting their effectiveness in guiding responsible investment and corporate accountability. This paper proposes a blockchain-based artifact designed to enhance the integrity of ESG reporting by combining blockchain's immutability and decentralized consensus with established ESG frameworks such as GRI and MSCI. Using a design science research approach, the study develops a prototype system that automates key reporting functions through smart contracts, enabling transparent data provenance, standardized disclosures, and multi-stakeholder participation. The artifact is evaluated through a Delphi study involving experts in sustainability, information systems, and governance. The results highlight blockchain's strong potential to improve ESG data trustworthiness while emphasizing the need for scalability enhancements and strategies that support user adoption across industries. Overall, the study contributes to the information systems literature on emerging technologies for sustainability by demonstrating how decentralized ledgers can strengthen ESG reporting processes and foster greater alignment between corporate practices and global environmental and governance objectives."

    "abstract": "As a key support for business decision-making, the operational efficiency and flexibility of the management accounting system directly affect the timeliness and accuracy of management decisions. Traditional management accounting systems rely on manual entry of accounting vouchers, which makes it difficult to meet the real-time accounting needs of high concurrency transaction scenarios. In addition, the deep coupling between business rules and code leads to delayed response to rule changes, and the heterogeneity of multi-source data formats also exacerbates the difficulty of maintaining data consistency. In response to the above issues, this article designs and implements a management accounting system based on the Drools rule engine. The system adopts a B/S architecture and a three-layer system of “presentation layer business logic layer data access layer”, building three core subsystems of rule management, rule engine, and data processing: using Drools to achieve visual configuration and dynamic updates of accounting rules, relying on the Rete algorithm to optimize the matching efficiency between transaction data and rules, combining message queues and cross database technology to process real-time and batch transaction data, and realizing automatic generation of accounting vouchers and entries. The experimental results show that the system's single note taking time has been reduced to milliseconds, the response time for rule updates has been shortened from hours to minutes, and the accuracy of continuous operation data has reached over 99.9 %. This effectively improves the efficiency, flexibility, and data consistency of management accounting, providing reliable technical support for dynamic business scenarios of enterprises."
