    "abstract": "Statistical inference in contextual bandits is complicated by the adaptive, non-i.i.d. nature of the data. A growing body of work has shown that classical least-squares inference may fail under adaptive sampling, and that constructing valid confidence intervals for linear functionals of the model parameter typically requires paying an unavoidable inflation of order $\\sqrt{d \\log T}$. This phenomenon -- often referred to as the price of adaptivity -- highlights the inherent difficulty of reliable inference under general contextual bandit policies. A key structural property that circumvents this limitation is the \\emph{stability} condition of Lai and Wei, which requires the empirical feature covariance to concentrate around a deterministic limit. When stability holds, the ordinary least-squares estimator satisfies a central limit theorem, and classical Wald-type confidence intervals -- designed for i.i.d. data -- become asymptotically valid even under adaptation, \\emph{without} incurring the $\\sqrt{d \\log T}$ price of adaptivity. In this paper, we propose and analyze a penalized EXP4 algorithm for linear contextual bandits. Our first main result shows that this procedure satisfies the Lai--Wei stability condition and therefore admits valid Wald-type confidence intervals for linear functionals. Our second result establishes that the same algorithm achieves regret guarantees that are minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors, demonstrating that stability and statistical efficiency can coexist within a single contextual bandit method. Finally, we complement our theory with simulations illustrating the empirical normality of the resulting estimators and the sharpness of the corresponding confidence intervals."

    "abstract": "We combine a cryogenic BiCMOS integrated circuit, which generates high-speed return-to-zero (RTZ) pulses, with a superconducting Josephson junction array. The BiCMOS circuit acts as a cryogenic pulse pattern generator, delivering data rates of 30 Gb/s, while consuming 302 mW at 4 K. Each electrical pulse of the serializer effectively transfers one magnetic flux quantum through every Josephson junction, so that the average output voltage of the array produces well-defined plateaus (Shapiro steps) in its current-to-voltage characteristic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first integration of a Josephson junction array with a cryogenic BiCMOS chip. The presented results pave the way toward a hybrid and fully integrated Josephson arbitrary waveform synthesizer (JAWS) that can generate ultra-low-noise signals for quantum voltage metrology and quantum information systems."

Sn intercalation effectively decouples the buffer layer, yielding quasi-free-standing monolayer graphene (QFMLG) while introducing local lattice distortions. Bias-dependent STM imaging revealed the coexistence of conventional and Kekule-ordered graphene domains, governed by the underlying Sn(1x1) reconstruction at the SiC interface. The measured STS spectra exhibit good agreement with DFT results. However, achieving homogeneous Sn(1x1) domains remains challenging, apparently, due to strain within the Sn monolayer, which drives the emergence of Kekule distortions and the associated electronic band-gap opening omogeneously in graphene. These findings highlight the crucial role of intercalant homogeneity and strain in tuning graphene`s structural and electronic properties."

    "abstract": "We identify the scaling limit of full-plane Kadanoff-Ceva fermions on generic, non-degenerate $s$-embeddings. In this broad setting, the scaling limits are described in terms of solutions to conjugate Beltrami equations with prescribed singularities. For the underlying Ising model, this leads to the scaling limit of the energy-energy correlations and reveals a connection between the scaling limits of (near-)critical planar Ising models and quasiconformal mappings. For grids approximating bounded domains in the complex plane, we establish, in the scaling regime, the conformal covariance of the energy density on critical doubly periodic graphs. We complement this result with an analogous statement in the case where the limiting conformal structure generates a maximal surface $(z,\\vartheta)$ in Minkowski space $\\mathbb{R}^{(2,1)}$. All scaling factors obtained are local and expressed in terms of the geometry of the embedding, even in situations where they vary drastically from one region to another. These results confirm the predictions of Chelkak and highlight that the scaling limits of generic (near-)critical Ising models naturally live on a substantially richer conformal structure than the classical Euclidean one."

Electrical resistivity, in the temperature range from 4.2 to 300 K, as well as field dependences of the Hall effect and magnetization at T = 4.2 K in magnetic fields up to 100 kOe and 70 kOe, respectively, were measured. Experimental data are in good agreement with the results of the theoretical DFT calculations of the electronic structure and magnetic moments. In the band structure of Co$_2$MnSi, half-metallicity is formed with the full spin polarization and the half-metallic gap of about 0.6 eV. In Co$_2$MnZ (Z = Al, Ge, Sn), it is shifted from the Fermi energy by the hole pockets at the point $Γ$, preventing thereby the formation of the half-metallic state. In a peculiar case of Co$_2$MnGa, the antisite defects are expected to determine structural and electronic properties. For the Co$_2$MnAl and Co$_2$MnGa topological semimetals, Weyl topological points are found at the Fermi energy; however, for Z = Si, Ge, Si, these features are located deeper within to the valence band. The results show that Co$_2$MnGe and Co$_2$MnSn are usual ferromagnets, Co$_2$MnAl and Co$_2$MnGa alloys are topological semimetals that can find application in microelectronics, while Co$_2$MnSi is a half-metallic ferromagnet that is in high demand in spintronics."

The scheme is based on finite difference approximations that ensure a stable coupling among the velocity, density and phase field, with symmetric operators acting on the discretized viscosity terms. Standard explicit methods suffer from severe time-step restrictions due to the presence of second to fourth-order diffusion terms introduced by the Cahn-Hilliard and Navier-Stokes operators. To overcome these challenges, we develop an IMEX Runge-Kutta scheme that treats the stiff terms implicitly while the convective terms are dealt with explicitly, with the advantage that only linear systems are solved at each stage. Numerical experiments are performed to verify the stability, accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "Although diffusion transformer (DiT)-based video virtual try-on (VVT) has made significant progress in synthesizing realistic videos, existing methods still struggle to capture fine-grained garment dynamics and preserve background integrity across video frames. They also incur high computational costs due to additional interaction modules introduced into DiTs, while the limited scale and quality of existing public datasets also restrict model generalization and effective training. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, KeyTailor, along with a large-scale, high-definition dataset, ViT-HD. The core idea of KeyTailor is a keyframe-driven details injection strategy, motivated by the fact that keyframes inherently contain both foreground dynamics and background consistency. Specifically, KeyTailor adopts an instruction-guided keyframe sampling strategy to filter informative frames from the input video. Subsequently,two tailored keyframe-driven modules, the garment details enhancement module and the collaborative background optimization module, are employed to distill garment dynamics into garment-related latents and to optimize the integrity of background latents, both guided by keyframes.These enriched details are then injected into standard DiT blocks together with pose, mask, and noise latents, enabling efficient and realistic try-on video synthesis. This design ensures consistency without explicitly modifying the DiT architecture, while simultaneously avoiding additional complexity. In addition, our dataset ViT-HD comprises 15, 070 high-quality video samples at a resolution of 810*1080, covering diverse garments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KeyTailor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of garment fidelity and background integrity across both dynamic and static scenarios."

    "abstract": "An up-down chain is a Markov chain in which each transition is a two-step process that moves up to a larger object and then back down to an object of the original size. The first goal of this paper is to present a general framework for analyzing these chains and computing their scaling limits. This approach unifies much of the existing literature while extending it in several directions. These include explicit conditions for constructing integrable up-down chains and convergence results for families of intertwined processes. The latter contribute to the method of intertwiners of Borodin and Olshanski. The second goal is to highlight a notable application of this framework to the settings of permutations and graphs. Here, we identify some integrable up-down chains and construct their scaling limits, a family of permuton- and graphon-valued Feller diffusions. Both the up-down chains and the limiting diffusions exhibit ergodicity, diagonalizable semigroups, and explicit expressions for the maximal separation distance to stationarity. For the diffusions, the stationary measures are the recursive separable permutons and recursive cographons recently introduced by the authors, and the separation distances turn out to be related to the Dedekind eta function."

    "abstract": "We study in this paper the quantum phase transition (QPT) from normal phase (NP) to superradiant phase (SP) for $N$ three-level atoms in a single-mode optical cavity for both Hermitian and non Hermitian Hamiltonians, where the $Ξ$-type three-level atom is described by spin-$1$ pseudo-spin operators. The long standing gauge-choice ambiguity of $\\mathbf{A\\cdot p}$ and $\\mathbf{d\\cdot E}$ called respectively the Coulomb and dipole gauges is resolved by the time-dependent gauge transformation on the Schrödinger equation. Both $\\mathbf{A\\cdot p}$ and $\\mathbf{d\\cdot E}$ interactions are included in the unified gauge, which is truly gauge equivalent to the minimum coupling principle. The Coulomb and dipole interactions are just the special cases of unified gauge. Remarkably three interactions lead to the same results under the resonant condition of field-atom frequencies, while significant difference appears in red and blue detunings. The QPT is analyzed in terms of spin coherent-state variational method, which indicates the abrupt changes of energy spectrum, average photon number as well as the atomic population at the critical point of interaction constant. Crucially, we reveal the sensitive dependence on the initial optical-phase, which is particularly useful to test the validity of three gauges experimentally. The non-Hermitian atom-field interaction results in the exceptional point (EP), beyond which the semiclassical energy function becomes complex. However the energy spectrum of variational ground state is real in the absence of EP, and does not become complex. The superradiant state is unstable due to the non-Hermitian interaction induced photon-number loss. Thus only the NP exists in the non-Hermitian Dicke Model Hamiltonian."

    "abstract": "The parallel advances in language modeling and speech representation learning have raised the prospect of learning language directly from speech without textual intermediates. This requires extracting semantic representations directly from speech. Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce SpidR, a self-supervised speech representation model that efficiently learns representations with highly accessible phonetic information, which makes it particularly suited for textless spoken language modeling. It is trained on raw waveforms using a masked prediction objective combined with self-distillation and online clustering. The intermediate layers of the student model learn to predict assignments derived from the teacher's intermediate layers. This learning objective stabilizes the online clustering procedure compared to previous approaches, resulting in higher quality codebooks. SpidR outperforms wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, WavLM, and DinoSR on downstream language modeling benchmarks (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC). Second, we systematically evaluate across models and layers the correlation between speech unit quality (ABX, PNMI) and language modeling performance, validating these metrics as reliable proxies. Finally, SpidR significantly reduces pretraining time compared to HuBERT, requiring only one day of pretraining on 16 GPUs, instead of a week. This speedup is enabled by the pretraining method and an efficient codebase, which allows faster iteration and easier experimentation. We open-source the training code and model checkpoints at https://github.com/facebookresearch/spidr."

    "abstract": "The classical two-capacitor paradox of the lost energy is revisited from an electronic circuit security stand-point. The paradox has been solved previously by various researchers, and the energy lost during the charging of capacitors has been primarily attributed to the heat and radiation. We analytically prove this for various standard resistor-capacitor (RC) and resistor-inductor-capacitor (RLC) circuit models. From the perspective of electronic system security, electromagnetic (EM) side-channel analysis (SCA) has recently gained significant prominence with the growth of resource-constrained, internet connected devices. This article connects the energy lost due to capacitor charging to the EM SCA leakage in electronic devices, leading to the recovery of the secret encryption key embedded within the device. Finally, with an understanding of how lost energy relates to EM radiation, we propose adiabatic charging as a solution to minimize EM leakage, thereby paving the way towards low-overhead EM SCA resilience."

Sci. 2025], the authors studied the following natural question: find sufficient and necessary conditions for a domain $Ω$ in a metric space $X$ to be quasihyperbolic John. It was proved that Gromov hyperbolic John domains are quasihyperbolic John, quantitatively. As an application, they obtained a characterization of uniform domains in Ahlfors regular spaces. In a recent work, using a deep improved characterization of Gromov hyperbolicity, Guo, Huang and Wang [arXiv 2025] proved the quantitative equivalence bteween inner uniformity and the quasihyperbolic John condition in metric doubling spaces. However, the proof does not yield a similar characterization for uniform domains. In this article, we find a new elementary approach to successfully extend the above characterization to uniform domains: a domain $Ω$ in a doubling length space $X$ is uniform if and only if it is linearly locally connected (LLC) and satisfies the ball separation condition, if and only if it is LLC-1 and quasihyperbolic John, quantitatively. This substantially improved the corresponding results of Zhou and Ponnusamy. Our new approach also allows us to give an alternative proof of the inner uniformity result of Guo-Huang-Wang without using the improved characterization on Gromov hyperbolicity."

The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) magnets generally coexisting with different types of magnetic interactions poses a challenge for topological magnonic manipulation. Here we investigate the topological magnon phases of 2D Kagome ferromagnet with multiple magnetic anisotropic interactions, i.e. Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and pseudo-dipolar interaction (PDI). It is found that the different sole magnetic anisotropic interactions introduce completely distinct topological phase diagrams and topological states. The multiple topological magnon phases with high Chern number emerge due to the distinct anisotropic interactions. Moreover, the interplay of the multiple anisotropic DMI and PDI interactions involved with Dirac and flat bands controls a variety of topological phase transitions, implying greater manipulation potential. In addition, the sign reversal of thermal Hall and Nernst conductivities induced by temperature is found in particular topological phase regions, namely topological origin, relating to the energy gap and Berry curvature (Chern number) in the vicinity of magnetic phase transition from the thermal fluctuations, providing a possible explanation for the experimental puzzles. All these results demonstrate that the novel topological magnonic properties in Kagome magnet with multiple magnetic anisotropic interactions can realize a potential platform for magnonic devices and quantum computing."

We propose a human behavior-inspired agentic framework, SlideTailor, that progressively generates editable slides in a user-aligned manner. Instead of requiring users to write their preferences in detailed textual form, our system only asks for a paper-slides example pair and a visual template - natural and easy-to-provide artifacts that implicitly encode rich user preferences across content and visual style. Despite the implicit and unlabeled nature of these inputs, our framework effectively distills and generalizes the preferences to guide customized slide generation. We also introduce a novel chain-of-speech mechanism to align slide content with planned oral narration. Such a design significantly enhances the quality of generated slides and enables downstream applications like video presentations. To support this new task, we construct a benchmark dataset that captures diverse user preferences, with carefully designed interpretable metrics for robust evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework."

In contrast, active systems, composed of self propelled units, inject energy at microscopic scales and therefore exhibit an inverse cascade, giving rise to distinctly unconventional flow patterns. Here, we investigate an active mixture consisting of both apolar and polar self driven components, a setting expected to display richer behaviours than those found in living liquid crystal (LLC) systems, where the apolar constituent is passive. Using numerical solutions of the corresponding hydrodynamic equations, we uncover a variety of complex dynamical states. Our results reveal a non-monotonic response of the apolar species to changes in the density and activity of the polar component. In an intermediate regime, reminiscent of LLC-induced disorder, the system develops a dynamically disordered phase characterised by high-density, chaotically evolving band-like structures and by the continual creation and annihilation of half integer topological defects. We show that this regime exhibits spatiotemporal chaos, which we quantify through two complementary measures: the spectral properties of density fluctuations and the maximal Lyapunov exponent. Together, these findings broaden the understanding of complex transitions in active matter and suggest potential experimental realisations in bacterial suspensions or synthetic microswimmer assemblies."

    "abstract": "The nonintegrable transverse-field Ising model is a common platform for studying ergodic quantum dynamics. In this work, we introduce a simple variant of the model in which this ergodic behaviour is suppressed by introducing a spatial inhomogeneity in the interaction strengths. For this we partition the chain into two equal segments within which the spins interact with different coupling strengths. The ratio of these couplings defines an inhomogeneity parameter, whose variation away from unity leads to constrained dynamics. We characterize this crossover using multiple diagnostics, such as the long-time saturation of out-of-time-ordered correlators, level-spacing statistics, and the spectral form factor. We further examine the consequences for operator growth in Krylov space and for entanglement generation in the system's eigenstates. Together, these results demonstrate that introducing a macroscopic inhomogeneity in coupling strengths provides a minimal, disorder-free route to breaking ergodicity in this specific model of interacting spins."

    "abstract": "We investigate the spontaneous motion of an elliptical Janus particle, driven by Marangoni forces, on a water surface to understand how particle shape and size influence its dynamics. The Janus particle is one-half infused with a substance such as camphor, which lowers the surface tension upon release onto the water surface. The resulting surface tension gradient generates Marangoni forces that propel the particle. For fully camphor-infused (non-Janus) particles, previous studies have shown that motion occurs along the short axis of the ellipse. However, for Janus particles, our experiments reveal a much richer steady-state dynamics, depending on both the particle's eccentricity and size. To understand these dynamics, we develop a numerical model that captures the connection between the spatio-temporal evolution of the camphor concentration field and the Marangoni force driving the particle. Using this model, we simulate the motion of particles with varying eccentricities - from nearly circular to highly elongated shapes. The simulations qualitatively reproduce all the trajectories observed in experiments and provide insights into how particle geometry influences the dynamics of chemically driven anisotropic particles. With the help of the numerical model, we compute a full phase diagram characterising the dynamical states as a function of surfactant properties."

The static properties of the system are analyzed through a projection method derived from the displacement operator. We find that only a single exceptional point (EP) emerges, in contrast to non-Hermitian spin--boson models with finite modes, which typically exhibit multiple EPs. Notably, only a single real eigenvalue is found before the EP, which differs markedly from typical non-Hermitian systems where a pair of real eigenvalues precedes the EP. The time evolution of observables is further investigated via the Dirac--Frenkel time-dependent variational principle. Compared to its Hermitian counterpart, the non-Hermitian model exhibits distinct dynamical signatures, most notably the emergence of oscillations with periodic amplified amplitude. In the $\\mathcal{PT}$-unbroken phase, the system exhibits sustained oscillatory dynamics with suppressed decoherence, whereas in the $\\mathcal{PT}$-broken phase, additional dissipative channels accelerate decoherence and drive rapid convergence toward a stable steady state. These results shed light on how $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry protects coherent light--matter interactions in non-Hermitian quantum systems."

    "abstract": "A new source in solar corona scattering photospheric and chromospheric Fraunhofer spectral lines is detected below a height of one solar radius above solar limb, consisting of tenuous and cool neutral atoms and much fewer once ionized ions. It is demonstrated via maps at the sample Fraunhofer lines within the band from 516.38 to 539.89nm, reconstructed from one set of spatially successive raster scanning data. The dataset was obtained from a spectrograph during the total solar eclipse on April 8, 2024, at Oden, Arkansas, USA. It is revealed from these maps that both the scattering and its spatial distribution depend on spectral lines, yielded from different ionization and excitation states of neutral metal atoms and ions. The distributions show asymmetry and feature of diffusion originated from the photosphere and chromosphere. Ratio of the Fraunhofer line depth to the continuum intensity evaluated over the observational band peaks at 0.25$\\%$ and has an average of 0.32$\\%$. More discrete and weaker diffusion of emission counterparts of some Fraunhofer lines are detected simultaneously. These properties are critically different from those owned by that F-corona yielded via dust grain scattering beyond heights of about two and half solar radii. Hence a term 'inner F-corona' is dubbed for the assembly of scattering by this new particle source. It becomes definite now that the solar corona consists of not only free electrons and ions but also much fewer yet non-negligible neutral atoms. It is emphasized that global distributions of the outward neutral atom fluxes and coronal magnetic loops can make the abnormal Cowling resistance the most primary mechanism responsible for the coronal heating, via collisions of the neutral atoms injected with ions in the coronal loops. This likes the heating process in Tokamak with neutral beam injection(NBI)."

    "abstract": "Unified hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration aims to recover various degraded HSIs using a single model, offering great practical value. However, existing methods often depend on explicit degradation priors (e.g., degradation labels) as prompts to guide restoration, which are difficult to obtain due to complex and mixed degradations in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a Degradation-Aware Metric Prompting (DAMP) framework. Instead of relying on predefined degradation priors, we design spatial-spectral degradation metrics to continuously quantify multi-dimensional degradations, serving as Degradation Prompts (DP). These DP enable the model to capture cross-task similarities in degradation distributions and enhance shared feature learning. Furthermore, we introduce a Spatial-Spectral Adaptive Module (SSAM) that dynamically modulates spatial and spectral feature extraction through learnable parameters. By integrating SSAM as experts within a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, and using DP as the gating router, the framework enables adaptive, efficient, and robust restoration under diverse, mixed, or unseen degradations. Extensive experiments on natural and remote sensing HSI datasets show that DAMP achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates exceptional generalization capability.

    "abstract": "The memory of contemporary Large Language Models is bound by a physical paradox: as they learn, they fill up. The linear accumulation (O(N)) of Key-Value states treats context as a warehouse of static artifacts, eventually forcing a destructive choice between amnesia and latency. We challenge this discrete orthodoxy, proposing that long-term memory is not the storage of items, but the persistence of a trajectory. We introduce Phonetic Trajectory Memory (PTM), a neuro-symbolic architecture that encodes language not as a sequence of tensors, but as a continuous path on an ergodic manifold governed by irrational rotation matrices. By decoupling the navigation (an invariant O(1) geometric signal) from the reconstruction (a probabilistic generative act), PTM achieves a compression magnitude of greater than 3,000x relative to dense caches. We demonstrate that retrieval becomes a process of resonance: the phonetic trace stabilizes the model against hallucination via \"Signal Consensus\" mechanism, securing up to approximately 92% factual accuracy. While this aggressive abstraction alters generative texture, it unlocks immediate access latency (approximately 34ms) independent of depth. Our results suggest that infinite context does not require infinite silicon; it requires treating memory not as data to be stored, but as a reconstructive process acting on a conserved, undying physical signal."

    "abstract": "Simultaneous load forecasting across multiple entities (e.g., regions, buildings) is crucial for the efficient, reliable, and cost-effective operation of power systems. Accurate load forecasting is a challenging problem due to the inherent uncertainties in load demand, dynamic changes in consumption patterns, and correlations among entities. Multi-task learning has emerged as a powerful machine learning approach that enables the simultaneous learning across multiple related problems. However, its application to load forecasting remains underexplored and is limited to offline learning-based methods, which cannot capture changes in consumption patterns. This paper presents an adaptive multi-task learning method for probabilistic load forecasting. The proposed method can dynamically adapt to changes in consumption patterns and correlations among entities. In addition, the techniques presented provide reliable probabilistic predictions for loads of multiples entities and assess load uncertainties. Specifically, the method is based on vectorvalued hidden Markov models and uses a recursive process to update the model parameters and provide predictions with the most recent parameters. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using datasets that contain the load demand of multiple entities and exhibit diverse and dynamic consumption patterns. The experimental results show that the presented techniques outperform existing methods both in terms of forecasting performance and uncertainty assessment."

It is shown that conventional convolution quadrature (CQ) methods, which rely directly on the generating function of linear multistep methods, cannot generate completely monotonic sequences beyond first-order accuracy. We rigorously prove that for any linear multistep method of second-or higher-order, the associated generating function $δ(ζ)$ cannot satisfy both that \\(-δ(ζ)\\) is a Pick function and that it is analytic on \\((-\\infty,1)\\) - a key requirement for constructing completely monotonic sequences. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we introduce a reconstruction of the generating function's structure. By strategically incorporating the theory of Pick functions, we successfully construct a second-order completely monotonic sequence. This theoretical advance leads to a discrete scheme that inherits the continuous model's energy decay property, guaranteeing unconditional stability. Numerical experiments confirm the convergence rates and energy dissipation behavior of the proposed method."

Our simulator incorporates active moderation mechanisms through two distinct variants: a basic moderator, which implements uniform, non-personalized interventions, and smart moderator, which leverages user-specific psychological profiles based on Dark Triad traits to apply personalized, threshold-driven moderation. By varying parameter configurations, the simulator allows for systematic exploration of how different moderation strategies influence user state transitions over time. Simulation results demonstrate that while generic interventions can curb toxicity under certain conditions, profile-aware moderation proves significantly more effective in limiting both the spread and persistence of toxic behavior.

We analyze a multitask variant of fitted Q-iteration that jointly learns a shared representation and task-specific value functions via Bellman error minimization on offline data. Under standard realizability and coverage assumptions commonly used in offline reinforcement learning, we establish finite-sample generalization guarantees for the learned value functions. Our analysis explicitly characterizes how pooling data across tasks improves estimation accuracy, yielding a $1/\\sqrt{nT}$ dependence on the total number of samples across tasks, while retaining the usual dependence on the horizon and concentrability coefficients arising from distribution shift. In addition, we consider a downstream offline setting in which a new task shares the same underlying representation as the upstream tasks. We study how reusing the representation learned during the multitask phase affects value estimation for this new task, and show that it can reduce the effective complexity of downstream learning relative to learning from scratch. Together, our results clarify the role of shared representations in multitask offline Q-learning and provide theoretical insight into when and how multitask structure can improve generalization in model-free, value-based reinforcement learning."

Designed to leverage quantitative techniques for enhanced risk assessment, portfolio optimization, and trading strategies in volatile environments, the architecture employs FinBERT, a transformer-based NLP model, to extract sentiment from ESG texts, followed by unsupervised clustering (UMAP/HDBSCAN) to identify 5 latent ESG regimes, validated via PCA. These regimes are mapped to economic conditions using a dense neural network and gradient boosting classifier, achieving 84.04% training and 82.0% validation accuracy. Concurrently, time-series models (SRNN, MLP, LSTM, GRU) forecast daily closing prices, with GRU attaining an R-squared of 0.801 and LSTM delivering 52.78% directional accuracy on intraday data. A strong correlation between S&P SL20 and S&P 500, observed through moving average and volatility trend plots, further bolsters forecasting precision. A rule-based fusion logic merges ESG and time-series outputs for final market signals.

Decoupling these properties remains a critical challenge for functional applications. Here, we demonstrate that pattern engineering in metallic glasses (MGs) enables unprecedented kinetic ultrastability while retaining thermodynamic metastability and intrinsic plasticity. Through atomistic simulations guided by machine-learning interatomic potentials and replica-exchange molecular dynamics, we reveal that clustering oxygen contents, driven by reaction-diffusion-coupled pattern dynamics, act as localized pinning sites. These motifs drastically slow structural relaxation, yielding kinetic stability comparable to crystal-like ultrastable glasses while retaining an energetic as-cast state. Remarkably, the thermodynamically metastable state preserves heterogeneous atomic mobility, allowing strain delocalization under mechanical stress. By tailoring oxygen modulation via geometric patterning, we achieve an approximately 200 K increase in the onset temperature of the glass transition (Tonset) while maintaining fracture toughness akin to conventional MGs. This work establishes a paradigm of kinetic stabilization without thermodynamic compromise, offering a roadmap to additively manufacture bulk amorphous materials with combined hyperstability and plasticity."

    "abstract": "Multi-agent systems have extended the capability of agentic AI. Instead of single inference passes, multiple agents perform collective reasoning to derive high quality answers. However, existing multi-agent orchestration relies on static heuristic workflows such as fixed loop limits and barrier synchronization. These ad-hoc approaches waste computational resources, incur high latency due to stragglers, and risk finalizing transient agreements. We argue that reliable multi-agent reasoning requires a formal foundation analogous to classical distributed consensus problem. To that end, we propose a formal model of the multi-agent refinement problem. The model includes definitions of the correctness guarantees and formal semantics of agent reasoning. We then introduce Aegean, a consensus protocol designed for stochastic reasoning agents that solves multi-agent refinement. We implement the protocol in Aegean-Serve, a consensus-aware serving engine that performs incremental quorum detection across concurrent agent executions, enabling early termination when sufficient agents converge. Evaluation using four mathematical reasoning benchmarks shows that Aegean provides provable safety and liveness guarantees while reducing latency by 1.2--20$\\times$ compared to state-of-the-art baselines, maintaining answer quality within 2.5%. Consistent gains across both local GPU deployments and commercial API providers validate that consensus-based orchestration eliminates straggler delays without sacrificing correctness."

    "abstract": "Current LLM-based driving agents that rely on unstructured plain-text memory suffer from low-precision scene retrieval and inefficient reflection. To address this limitation, we present RESPOND, a structured decision-making framework for LLM-driven agents grounded in explicit risk patterns. RESPOND represents each ego-centric scene using a unified 5 by 3 matrix that encodes spatial topology and road constraints, enabling consistent and reliable retrieval of spatial risk configurations. Based on this representation, a hybrid rule and LLM decision pipeline is developed with a two-tier memory mechanism. In high-risk contexts, exact pattern matching enables rapid and safe reuse of verified actions, while in low-risk contexts, sub-pattern matching supports personalized driving style adaptation. In addition, a pattern-aware reflection mechanism abstracts tactical corrections from crash and near-miss frames to update structured memory, achieving one-crash-to-generalize learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RESPOND. In highway-env, RESPOND outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based and reinforcement learning based driving agents while producing substantially fewer collisions. With step-wise human feedback, the agent acquires a Sporty driving style within approximately 20 decision steps through sub-pattern abstraction. For real-world validation, RESPOND is evaluated on 53 high-risk cut-in scenarios extracted from the HighD dataset. For each event, intervention is applied immediately before the cut-in and RESPOND re-decides the driving action. Compared to recorded human behavior, RESPOND reduces subsequent risk in 84.9 percent of scenarios, demonstrating its practical feasibility under real-world driving conditions. These results highlight RESPONDs potential for autonomous driving, personalized driving assistance, and proactive hazard mitigation."

    "abstract": "The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) is currently bottlenecked by the Verifiability Trilemma, which posits that a decentralized inference system cannot simultaneously achieve high computational integrity, low latency, and low cost. Existing cryptographic solutions, such as Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (ZKML), suffer from superlinear proving overheads (O(k NlogN)) that render them infeasible for billionparameter models. Conversely, optimistic approaches (opML) impose prohibitive dispute windows, preventing real-time interactivity, while recent \"Proof of Quality\" (PoQ) paradigms sacrifice cryptographic integrity for subjective semantic evaluation, leaving networks vulnerable to model downgrade attacks and reward hacking. In this paper, we introduce Optimistic TEE-Rollups (OTR), a hybrid verification protocol that harmonizes these constraints. OTR leverages NVIDIA H100 Confidential Computing Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to provide sub-second Provisional Finality, underpinned by an optimistic fraud-proof mechanism and stochastic Zero-Knowledge spot-checks to mitigate hardware side-channel risks. We formally define Proof of Efficient Attribution (PoEA), a consensus mechanism that cryptographically binds execution traces to hardware attestations, thereby guaranteeing model authenticity. Extensive simulations demonstrate that OTR achieves 99% of the throughput of centralized baselines with a marginal cost overhead of $0.07 per query, maintaining Byzantine fault tolerance against rational adversaries even in the presence of transient hardware vulnerabilities."

    "abstract": "By integrating language understanding with perceptual modalities such as images, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) constitute a critical substrate for modern AI systems, particularly intelligent agents operating in open and interactive environments. However, their increasing accessibility also raises heightened risks of misuse, such as generating harmful or unsafe content. To mitigate these risks, alignment techniques are commonly applied to align model behavior with human values. Despite these efforts, recent studies have shown that jailbreak attacks can circumvent alignment and elicit unsafe outputs. Currently, most existing jailbreak methods are tailored for open-source models and exhibit limited effectiveness against commercial MLLM-integrated systems, which often employ additional filters. These filters can detect and prevent malicious input and output content, significantly reducing jailbreak threats. In this paper, we reveal that the success of these safety filters heavily relies on a critical assumption that malicious content must be explicitly visible in either the input or the output. This assumption, while often valid for traditional LLM-integrated systems, breaks down in MLLM-integrated systems, where attackers can leverage multiple modalities to conceal adversarial intent, leading to a false sense of security in existing MLLM-integrated systems. To challenge this assumption, we propose Odysseus, a novel jailbreak paradigm that introduces dual steganography to covertly embed malicious queries and responses into benign-looking images. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our Odysseus successfully jailbreaks several pioneering and realistic MLLM-integrated systems, achieving up to 99% attack success rate. It exposes a fundamental blind spot in existing defenses, and calls for rethinking cross-modal security in MLLM-integrated systems."

A key aspect of our approach is its emphasis on stability, ensuring reliable performance even when one of the features is degraded or misleading. Given a noisy mixture and two potentially unreliable cues, a dedicated network is trained to dynamically balance their contributions-or disregard the less informative one when necessary. We evaluate the system under challenging conditions by simulating inference-time errors using a simple direction of arrival (DOA) estimator and a noisy spectral enrollment process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model successfully extracts the desired speaker even in the presence of substantial reference inaccuracies."

Conventional rule-based metrics merely score programs based on their surface-level similarities with reference programs instead of analyzing functionality and code quality in depth. To address this limitation, researchers have developed LLM-as-a-judge metrics, prompting LLMs to evaluate and score code, and curated various code evaluation benchmarks to validate their effectiveness. However, these benchmarks suffer from critical limitations, hindering reliable assessments of evaluation capability: Some feature coarse-grained binary labels, which reduce rich code behavior to a single bit of information, obscuring subtle errors. Others propose fine-grained but subjective, vaguely-defined evaluation criteria, introducing unreliability in manually-annotated scores, which is the ground-truth they rely on. Furthermore, they often use uncontrolled data synthesis methods, leading to unbalanced score distributions that poorly represent real-world code generation scenarios. To curate a diverse benchmark with programs of well-balanced distributions across various quality levels and streamline the manual annotation procedure, we propose AXIOM, a novel perturbation-based framework for synthesizing code evaluation benchmarks at scale. It reframes program scores as the refinement effort needed for deployment, consisting of two stages: (1) Rule-guided perturbation, which prompts LLMs to apply sequences of predefined perturbation rules to existing high-quality programs to modify their functionality and code quality, enabling us to precisely control each program's target score to achieve balanced score distributions.

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to address knowledge-intensive queries requiring domain-specific or up-to-date information. To handle complex multi-hop questions that are challenging for single-step retrieval, iterative RAG approaches incorporating reinforcement learning have been proposed. However, existing iterative RAG systems typically plan to decompose questions without leveraging information about the available retrieval corpus, leading to inefficient retrieval and reasoning chains that cascade into suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce Early Knowledge Alignment (EKA), a simple but effective module that aligns LLMs with retrieval set before planning in iterative RAG systems with contextually relevant retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments on six standard RAG datasets demonstrate that by establishing a stronger reasoning foundation, EKA significantly improves retrieval precision, reduces cascading errors, and enhances both performance and efficiency. Our analysis from an entropy perspective demonstrate that incorporating early knowledge reduces unnecessary exploration during the reasoning process, enabling the model to focus more effectively on relevant information subsets. Moreover, EKA proves effective as a versatile, training-free inference strategy that scales seamlessly to large models. Generalization tests across diverse datasets and retrieval corpora confirm the robustness of our approach. Overall, EKA advances the state-of-the-art in iterative RAG systems while illuminating the critical interplay between structured reasoning and efficient exploration in reinforcement learning-augmented frameworks.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness as zero-shot time series (TS) forecasters. The key challenge lies in tokenizing TS data into textual representations that align with LLMs' pre-trained knowledge. While existing work often relies on fine-tuning specialized modules to bridge this gap, a distinct, yet challenging, paradigm aims to leverage truly off-the-shelf LLMs without any fine-tuning whatsoever, relying solely on strategic tokenization of numerical sequences. The performance of these fully frozen models is acutely sensitive to the textual representation of the input data, as their parameters cannot adapt to distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet highly effective strategy to overcome this brittleness: injecting noise into the raw time series before tokenization. This non-invasive intervention acts as a form of inference-time augmentation, compelling the frozen LLM to extrapolate based on robust underlying temporal patterns rather than superficial numerical artifacts. We theoretically analyze this phenomenon and empirically validate its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks. Notably, to fully eliminate potential biases from data contamination during LLM pre-training, we introduce two novel TS datasets that fall outside all utilized LLMs' pre-training scopes, and consistently observe improved performance. This study provides a further step in directly leveraging off-the-shelf LLMs for time series forecasting."

Despite their recent success, multimodal RAG in the audio-visual domain remains challenging due to 1) limited modality coverage and multi-hop connectivity of existing MMKGs, and 2) retrieval based solely on similarity in a shared multimodal embedding space, which fails to filter out off-topic or redundant knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose M$^3$KG-RAG, a Multi-hop Multimodal Knowledge Graph-enhanced RAG that retrieves query-aligned audio-visual knowledge from MMKGs, improving reasoning depth and answer faithfulness in MLLMs. Specifically, we devise a lightweight multi-agent pipeline to construct multi-hop MMKG (M$^3$KG), which contains context-enriched triplets of multimodal entities, enabling modality-wise retrieval based on input queries. Furthermore, we introduce GRASP (Grounded Retrieval And Selective Pruning), which ensures precise entity grounding to the query, evaluates answer-supporting relevance, and prunes redundant context to retain only knowledge essential for response generation. Extensive experiments across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that M$^3$KG-RAG significantly enhances MLLMs' multimodal reasoning and grounding over existing approaches."

Existing pruning approaches treat either tokens or heads in isolation, relying on heuristics or first-order signals, which often sacrifice accuracy or fail to generalize across inputs. We introduce HEART-ViT, a Hessian-guided efficient dynamic attention and token pruning framework for vision transformers, which to the best of our knowledge is the first unified, second-order, input-adaptive framework for ViT optimization. HEART-ViT estimates curvature-weighted sensitivities of both tokens and attention heads using efficient Hessian-vector products, enabling principled pruning decisions under explicit loss budgets.This dual-view sensitivity reveals an important structural insight: token pruning dominates computational savings, while head pruning provides fine-grained redundancy removal, and their combination achieves a superior trade-off. On ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1K with ViT-B/16 and DeiT-B/16, HEART-ViT achieves up to 49.4 percent FLOPs reduction, 36 percent lower latency, and 46 percent higher throughput, while consistently matching or even surpassing baseline accuracy after fine-tuning, for example 4.7 percent recovery at 40 percent token pruning. Beyond theoretical benchmarks, we deploy HEART-ViT on different edge devices such as AGX Orin, demonstrating that our reductions in FLOPs and latency translate directly into real-world gains in inference speed and energy efficiency. HEART-ViT bridges the gap between theory and practice, delivering the first unified, curvature-driven pruning framework that is both accuracy-preserving and edge-efficient."

Using a shared set of scrambled cube states, identical prompts and parsers, and a single distance-to-solved metric, we compare recent MLLMs side by side as a function of scramble depth. Across seven MLLMs, accuracy drops sharply with depth; once a trajectory stalls or diverges, models rarely recover, and high face-reconstruction accuracy does not guarantee competent action selection or multi-step execution. A pronounced closed- vs open-source gap emerges: the strongest closed model leads on both single-step perception tasks and multi-step control tasks, while open-weight models cluster near chance on the hardest settings; yet even the best MLLM degrades at higher cube complexity. A simple self-correction via reflective thinking yields modest gains but can also introduce overthinking. Cube Bench offers a compact, reproducible probe of sequential spatial reasoning in MLLMs."

In particular, we investigate Wolfram model multiway rewriting systems based on string substitutions. Multiway systems were proposed by S. Wolfram as generic model systems for multicomputational processes, emphasizing their significance as a foundation for modeling complexity, nondeterminism, and branching structures of measurement outcomes. Here, we investigate a specific class of multiway systems based on cyclic character strings with a neighborhood constraint - the latter called Leibnizian strings. We show that such strings exhibit a Fermi-Dirac distribution for expectation values of occupation numbers of character neighborhoods. A Leibnizian string serves as an abstraction of a $N$-fermion system. A multiway system of these strings encodes causal relations between rewriting events in a nondeterministic manner. The collection of character strings realizes a $\\mathbb{Z}$-module with a symmetric $\\mathbb{Z}$-bilinear form. For discrete spaces, this generalizes the notion of an inner product over a vector field. This admits a discrete analogue of the path integral and a $S$-matrix for multiway systems of Leibnizian strings. The elements of this $S$-matrix yield transition amplitudes between states of the multiway system based on an action defined over a sequence of Leibnizian strings. We then show that these $S$-matrices give explicit representations of quantum gates for qubits and qudits, and also circuits composed of such gates. We find that, as formal models of nondeterministic computation, rewriting systems of Leibnizian strings with causal structure encode representations of the CNOT, $π/8$, and Hadamard gates. Hence, using multiway systems one can represent quantum circuits for qubits."

Proof of the completeness of the squared eigenfunctions is provided. Our closure relation accounts for the singularities of the scattering data at the branch points of the continuous spectrum, which leads to the correct discrete eigenfunctions of the closure relation. Using the one-soliton closure relation and its discrete eigenmodes, the slow-time evolution equations of the soliton parameters are determined. Moreover, the first-order correction integral to the dark soliton is shown to contain a pole due to singularities of the scattering data at the branch points. Analysis of this first-order correction integral leads to predictions for the height, velocity and phase gradient of the shelves, as well as a formula for the slow time evolution of the soliton's phase, which in turn allows one to determine the slow-time dependence of the soliton center. All the results are corroborated by direct numerical simulations, and compared with earlier results."

    "abstract": "Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) offer fast, parallel token generation, but their standalone use is plagued by an inherent efficiency-quality tradeoff. We show that, if carefully applied, the attributes of dLLMs can actually be a strength for drafters in speculative decoding with autoregressive (AR) verifiers. Our core insight is that dLLM's speed from parallel decoding drastically lowers the risk of costly rejections, providing a practical mechanism to effectively realize the (elusive) lengthy drafts that lead to large speedups with speculative decoding. We present FailFast, a dLLM-based speculative decoding framework that realizes this approach by dynamically adapting its speculation length. It \"fails fast\" by spending minimal compute in hard-to-speculate regions to shrink speculation latency and \"wins big\" by aggressively extending draft lengths in easier regions to reduce verification latency (in many cases, speculating and accepting 70 tokens at a time!). Without any fine-tuning, FailFast delivers lossless acceleration of AR LLMs and achieves up to 4.9$\\times$ speedup over vanilla decoding, 1.7$\\times$ over the best naive dLLM drafter, and 1.4$\\times$ over EAGLE-3 across diverse models and workloads.

    "abstract": "Given a Boolean relational specification between inputs and outputs, the problem of functional synthesis is to construct a function that maps each assignment of the input to an assignment of the output such that each tuple of input and output assignments meets the specification. The past decade has witnessed significant improvement in the scalability of functional synthesis tools, allowing them to handle problems with tens of thousands of variables. A common ingredient in these approaches is their reliance on SAT solvers, thereby exploiting the breakthrough advances in SAT solving over the past three decades. While the recent techniques have been shown to perform well in practice, there is little theoretical understanding of the limitations and power of these approaches. The primary contribution of this work is to initiate a systematic theoretical investigation into the power of functional synthesis approaches that rely on NP oracles. We first show that even when small Skolem functions exist, naive bit-by-bit learning approaches fail due to the relational nature of specifications. We establish fundamental limitations of interpolation-based approaches, proving that even when small Skolem functions exist, resolution-based interpolation must produce exponential-size circuits. We prove that access to an NP oracle is inherently necessary for efficient synthesis. Our main technical result shows that it is possible to use NP oracles to synthesize small Skolem functions in time polynomial in the size of the specification and the size of the smallest sufficient set of witnesses, establishing positive results for a broad class of relational specifications."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a random gradient-free method for optimization in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, applicable to functional optimization in diverse settings. Though such problems are often solved through finite-dimensional gradient descent over a parametrization of the functions, such as neural networks, an interesting alternative is to instead perform gradient descent directly in the function space by leveraging its Hilbert space structure, thus enabling provable guarantees and fast convergence. However, infinite-dimensional gradients are often hard to compute in practice, hindering the applicability of such methods. To overcome this limitation, our framework requires only the computation of directional derivatives and a pre-basis for the Hilbert space domain, i.e., a linearly-independent set whose span is dense in the Hilbert space. This fully resolves the tractability issue, as pre-bases are much more easily obtained than full orthonormal bases or reproducing kernels -- which may not even exist -- and individual directional derivatives can be easily computed using forward-mode scalar automatic differentiation. We showcase the use of our method to solve partial differential equations à la physics informed neural networks (PINNs), where it effectively enables provable convergence."

We report theoretical results for superconducting device performance -- dissipation, quality factor and frequency shift anomalies -- based on self-consistent calculations of the current response and penetraion of the electromagnetic field at the vacuum-superconducting interface. Key results include the prediction of a non-monotonic anomaly in the low-frequency superfluid fraction and penetration depth at very low temperatures related to the sub-gap quasiparticle spectrum. Dissipation of microwave power is predicted from intra- and inter- impurity band transitions at GHz frequencies at low temperatures, including a physical mechanism responsible for residual resistance. We predict anomalies in the resonant frequency, $f(T)$, and quality factor, $Q(T)$, of high-Q SRF cavities operating in the GHz range at low-temperatures that are sensitive to non-magnetic and paramagnetic impurity disorder."

Our main result is the significantly improved sample complexity for learning such low-degree polynomials. We show that, for any regression risk $\\eps \\in (0,1)$, a carefully designed two-layer NN with channel attention and finite width of $m \\ge Θ({n^4 \\log (2n/δ)}/{d^{2\\ell_0}})$ trained by the vanilla gradient descent (GD) requires the lowest sample complexity of $n \\asymp Θ(d^{\\ell_0}/\\eps)$ with probability $1-δ$ for every $δ\\in (0,1)$, in contrast with the representative sample complexity $Θ\\pth{d^{\\ell_0} \\max\\set{\\eps^{-2},\\log d}}$, where $n$ is the training daata size. Moreover, such sample complexity is not improvable since the trained network renders a sharp rate of the nonparametric regression risk of the order $Θ(d^{\\ell_0}/{n})$ with probability at least $1-δ$. On the other hand, the minimax optimal rate for the regression risk with a kernel of rank $Θ(d^{\\ell_0})$ is $Θ(d^{\\ell_0}/{n})$, so that the rate of the nonparametric regression risk of the network trained by GD is minimax optimal. The training of the two-layer NN with channel attention consists of two stages. In Stage 1, a provable learnable channel selection algorithm identifies the ground-truth channel number $\\ell_0$ from the initial $L \\ge \\ell_0$ channels in the first-layer activation, with high probability. This learnable selection is achieved by an efficient one-step GD update on both layers, enabling feature learning for low-degree polynomial targets.

This long-standing discrepancy, referred to as the gallium anomaly, has posed a significant challenge to our understanding of both experimental methods and theoretical predictions. In this work, we revisit the theoretical calculation of the neutrino capture cross-section by moving beyond the standard treatment of the leptonic wave functions, revealing limitations in the commonly used factorization approach based on the detailed balance principle. Incorporating phenomenologically constrained Gamow-Teller transition densities, able to correctly reproduce the precisely measured half-life of $^{71}{\\textrm{Ge}}$, we find that the revised cross-section can be significantly reduced, potentially resolving the gallium anomaly without invoking new physics."

    "abstract": "Analyzing causality in multivariate systems involves establishing how information is generated, distributed and combined, and thus requires tools that capture interactions beyond pairwise relations. Higher-order information theory provides such tools. In particular, Partial Information Decomposition (PID) allows the decomposition of the information that a set of sources provides about a target into redundant, unique, and synergistic components. Yet the mathematical connection between such higher-order information-theoretic measures and causal structure remains undeveloped. Here we establish the first theoretical correspondence between PID components and causal structure in both Bayesian networks and hypergraphs. We first show that in Bayesian networks unique information precisely characterizes direct causal neighbors, while synergy identifies collider relationships. This establishes a localist causal discovery paradigm in which the structure surrounding each variable can be recovered from its immediate informational footprint, eliminating the need for global search over graph space. Extending these results to higher-order systems, we prove that PID signatures in Bayesian hypergraphs differentiate parents, children, co-heads, and co-tails, revealing a higher-order collider effect unique to multi-tail hyperedges. We also present procedures by which our results can be used to characterize systematically the causal structure of Bayesian networks and hypergraphs. Our results position PID as a rigorous, model-agnostic foundation for inferring both pairwise and higher-order causal structure, and introduce a fundamentally local information-theoretic viewpoint on causal discovery."

Our model also allows for occasional behavioral switches, which rational individuals also take into account when formulating their Nash-equilibrium strategies. While this modeling approach is general, here we develop it for individuals choosing their \"contact rates\" within a particular Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible-Dead (SIRSD) epidemics model. The latter is based on a frequency-based force of infection and the mortality rate that rapidly increases once the proportion of infected individuals exceeds some prescribed threshold, resulting in a strain on medical resources. Numerical tests illustrate the properties of our model and highlight the ways in which additional/non-rational behavioral patterns and behavioral switching increase the impact of infectious diseases. The paper aims to build a bridge between two distinct communities of epidemiological modelers and to promote the consideration of behavioral patterns in broader Mean Field Games literature."

The main contribution of the paper is to establish sufficient conditions for Normal approximation for sequences of such functionals over growing regions. Specifically, for any fixed region, we provide an upper bound on the Wasserstein distance between each functional and the standard Normal distribution. We then apply these results to several examples. Inspired by problems in computer science, we prove a Normal approximation for the rectilinear crossing number, arising from projections of certain random graphs onto a 2-dimensional plane. From the field of topological data analysis, we examine two types of barcode summaries, the inversion count and the tree realization number, and establish Normal approximations for both summaries under suitable models of the topological lifetimes."

We address these challenges via the following three contributions. First, we introduce AlignPose, a 6D object pose estimation method that aggregates information from multiple extrinsically calibrated RGB views and does not require any object-specific training or symmetry annotation. Second, the key component of this approach is a new multi-view feature-metric refinement specifically designed for object pose. It optimizes a single, consistent world-frame object pose minimizing the feature discrepancy between on-the-fly rendered object features and observed image features across all views simultaneously. Third, we report extensive experiments on four datasets (YCB-V, T-LESS, ITODD-MV, HouseCat6D) using the BOP benchmark evaluation and show that AlignPose outperforms other published methods, especially on challenging industrial datasets where multiple views are readily available in practice."

The proposed method leverages Schmidt spectrum optimization (SSO) to minimize circuit depth while preserving the entanglement structure inherent to MPS representations, thereby enabling scalable state preparation on near-term quantum hardware. The core idea is to \\textit{disentangle} the target MPS using a sequence of optimised local unitaries, and then reverse this process to obtain a state preparation circuit. Specifically, we define a loss function directly on the Schmidt spectra of intermediate states and use automatic differentiation to optimise each circuit layer so as to systematically reduce entanglement entropy. Once a disentangling sequence has been learned, we take the adjoints of the optimised unitaries to obtain a shallow-depth circuit that approximately reconstructs the target MPS from the computational all-zero state. We benchmark SSO across a range of MPS approximations to the ground states of local Hamiltonians and demonstrate state-of-the-art shallow-depth performance, improving accuracy by up to an order of magnitude over existing methods. Finally, we provide numerical evidence that SSO mitigates the adverse time-complexity scaling observed in previous disentangling-based approaches."

The Riesz representer is a key component in debiased machine learning for constructing $\\sqrt{n}$-consistent and efficient estimators in causal inference and structural parameter estimation. To estimate the Riesz representer, direct approaches have garnered attention, such as Riesz regression and the covariate balancing propensity score. These approaches can also be interpreted as variants of direct density ratio estimation (DRE) in several applications such as average treatment effect estimation. In DRE, it is well known that flexible models can easily overfit the observed data due to the estimand and the form of the loss function. To address this issue, recent work has proposed modeling the density ratio as a product of multiple intermediate density ratios and estimating it using score-matching techniques, which are often used in the diffusion model literature. We extend score-matching-based DRE methods to Riesz representer estimation. Our proposed method not only mitigates overfitting but also provides insights for causal inference by bridging marginal effects and average policy effects through time score functions."

This paper introduces the Bank Risk Interlinkage with Dynamic Graph and Event Simulations (BRIDGES) framework, which analyzes systemic risk based on the level of information complexity (zero-order, first-order, and second-order). BRIDGES utilizes the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance to construct a dynamic network for 551 BRICS banks based on their strategic similarity, using zero-order information such as annual balance sheet data from 2008 to 2024. It then employs first-order information, including trends in risk ratios, to detect shifts in banks' behavior. A Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGNN), as the core of BRIDGES, is deployed to learn network evolutions and detect second-order information, such as anomalous changes in the structural relationships of the bank network. To measure the impact of anomalous changes on network stability, BRIDGES performs Agent-Based Model (ABM) simulations to assess the banking system's resilience to internal financial failure and external geopolitical shocks at the individual country level and across BRICS nations. Simulation results show that the failure of the largest institutions causes more systemic damage than the failure of the financially vulnerable or dynamically anomalous ones, driven by powerful panic effects. Compared to this \"too big to fail\" scenario, a geopolitical shock with correlated country-wide propagation causes more destructive systemic damage, leading to a near-total systemic collapse. It suggests that the primary threats to BRICS financial stability are second-order panic and large-scale geopolitical shocks, which traditional risk analysis models might not detect."

Our approach is rigorous within the frame of Hilbert space theory. In this context, it is natural to differentiate between states -- and corresponding dynamics -- that involve only finitely many degrees of freedom, referred to as local, and those that are inherently nonlocal. Previous studies have shown that such systems can support nonlocal coherent states (NCS). In this work, we demonstrate that NCS can dynamically evolve into nonlocal cat states under the influence of a nonlocal Hamiltonian -- specifically, the square of the total number operator. Crucially, the resulting dynamics cannot be decomposed into local factors. Furthermore, we explore broader mathematical implications of these phenomena within the framework of generalized bosons. Our findings highlight that the concepts of coherent states and nonlocal cat states are not inherently bound together; rather, their fusion is a distinctive feature of standard bosons. Finally, we propose that if the generalized boson framework can be physically realized in engineered quantum systems, the phenomena described here may hold significant relevance for both physics and materials science."

Here, we report the observation of magneto-moiré excitons in twisted bilayer CrSBr, correlated with moiré spin textures that emerge below a critical twist angle of ~2°. The nanoscale moiré spin texture imprints distinct signatures onto the optical spectrum, shifting the exciton energy via a periodic magnetic exchange field.

    "abstract": "The nonparametric regression model with normal errors has been extensively studied, both from the frequentist and Bayesian viewpoint. A central result in Bayesian nonparametrics is that under assumptions on the prior, the data-generating distribution (assuming a true frequentist model) and a semi-metric $ρ(.,.)$ on the space of regression functions that satisfy the so called testing condition, the posterior contracts around the true distribution with respect to $ρ(.,.)$, and the rate of contraction can be estimated. In the regression setting, the semi-metric $ρ(.,.)$ is often taken to be the Hellinger distance or the empirical $L^2$ norm (i.e., the $L^2$ norm with respect to the empirical distribution of the design) in the present regression context. However, extending contraction rates to the ``integrated\" $L^2$ norm usually requires more work, and has previously been done for instance under sufficient smoothness or boundedness assumptions, which may not necessarily hold. In this work we show that, for classes of priors based on random basis expansions or Gaussian processes with RKHS of Sobolev type and in the random design setting, such $L^2$ posterior contraction rates can be obtained under substantially weaker assumptions than those currently used in the literature. Importantly we do not require a known a priori upper bound on its supremum norm or that its smoothness is larger than $d/2$, where $d$ is the dimension of the covariates. Our proof crucially relies on an application of the matrix Bernstein concentration inequality to empirical inner product matrices, which require explicit upper bounds on the basis functions at hand that we prove in several cases of interest. In particular we obtain upper bounds on the supremum norm of Mercer eigenfunctions of several reproducing kernels (including several Matérn kernels) which are of independent interest."

In the absence of magnetic field, transport is governed by a single shear viscosity coefficient, whereas the application of a finite magnetic field induces anisotropy, give rise to the five independent shear viscosity coefficients associated with distinct velocity gradient tensors. These coefficient can be physically categorized into perpendicular, parallel and Hall components relative to the magnetic field direction. When the scattering time equals to the cyclotron time, the perpendicular component is suppressed by 80% and parallel component by 50%, and Hall effect can reach maximum. Corresponding magnetic field strength for electron fluid in graphene is around 0.01-0.1 Tesla and the same for non-relativistic electron fluid and ultra-relativistic quark fluid are around 10 Tesla and 10^14 Tesla respectively. They may be considered as required magnetic field strength in three different fluid systems to observe noticeable magnetic field response in their shear viscosity coefficients."

Using both the continuum models and the realistic tight-binding models, we show that the twist angle between the graphene layers can tune the interface states at such stacking faults. The evolution of interface states originates from the interplay between the moiré periodicity and Zak phase topology, predicting the occurrence of nearly flat bands throughout the moiré Brillouin zone. We further investigate the disorder-induced layer polarization and tunable Chern number for flat band, and characterize the relationship between the disorder strength and Chern number in twisted rhombohedral graphite."

    "abstract": "We introduce an end-to-end optimization strategy for quantum machine learning that directly targets performance under finite measurement resources, where learning objectives are defined directly at the level of task performance. The method is applied on a Bayesian quantum metrology task since it provides a natural testbed with known fundamental limits and scaling with system size. The sampling-aware hybrid algorithm achieves a single-shot risk within 1 dB of the -20 dB Bayesian limit using 32 qubits. We extend the Bayesian framework from parameter estimation to global function inference, where the task is to infer a target function of the sensor input drawn from an arbitrary prior, and we demonstrate a clear computational-sensing advantage for direct functional inference over indirect reconstruction. We relate the corresponding Bayesian risk to the Capacity metric and argue that the Resolvable Expressive Capacity provides a natural measure of the space of functions accessible in a single shot. The resulting eigentask analysis identifies noise-robust feature combinations that yield compact estimators with improved accuracy and reduced optimization cost in resource-limited or real-time on-device settings."

However, existing academic benchmarks like BrowseComp often fail to meet real-world demands for open-ended research, which requires robust skills in intent recognition, long-horizon decision-making, and cross-source verification. To address this, we introduce Step-DeepResearch, a cost-effective, end-to-end agent. We propose a Data Synthesis Strategy Based on Atomic Capabilities to reinforce planning and report writing, combined with a progressive training path from agentic mid-training to SFT and RL. Enhanced by a Checklist-style Judger, this approach significantly improves robustness. Furthermore, to bridge the evaluation gap in the Chinese domain, we establish ADR-Bench for realistic deep research scenarios. Experimental results show that Step-DeepResearch (32B) scores 61.4% on Scale AI Research Rubrics. On ADR-Bench, it significantly outperforms comparable models and rivals SOTA closed-source models like OpenAI and Gemini DeepResearch. These findings prove that refined training enables medium-sized models to achieve expert-level capabilities at industry-leading cost-efficiency."

    "abstract": "Coherence in language requires the brain to satisfy two competing temporal demands: gradual accumulation of meaning across extended context and rapid reconfiguration of representations at event boundaries. Despite their centrality to language and thought, how these processes are implemented in the human brain during naturalistic listening remains unclear. Here, we tested whether these two processes can be captured by annotation-free drift and shift signals and whether their neural expression dissociates across large-scale cortical systems. These signals were derived from a large language model (LLM) and formalized contextual drift and event shifts directly from the narrative input. To enable high-precision voxelwise encoding models with stable parameter estimates, we densely sampled one healthy adult across more than 7 hours of listening to thirteen crime stories while collecting ultra high-field (7T) BOLD data. We then modeled the feature-informed hemodynamic response using a regularized encoding framework validated on independent stories. Drift predictions were prevalent in default-mode network hubs, whereas shift predictions were evident bilaterally in the primary auditory cortex and language association cortex. Furthermore, activity in default-mode and parietal networks was best explained by a signal capturing how meaning accumulates and gradually fades over the course of the narrative. Together, these findings show that coherence during language comprehension is implemented through dissociable neural regimes of slow contextual integration and rapid event-driven reconfiguration, offering a mechanistic entry point for understanding disturbances of language coherence in psychiatric disorders."

We study the directed assembly of metallo-dielectric Janus particles (JPs) and passive polystyrene (PS) beads using optoelectrically reconfigurable AC-field patterning, which allows precise control over particle composition and binding sequence. Through experiments, analytical modeling, and simulations, we show that dipolar interactions drive robust JP-JP and JP-PS dimer formation with frequency-dependent stability. At intermediate and high frequencies, JP-PS binding is strongly attractive, whereas at low frequencies it becomes effectively repulsive due to electrical double-layer screening and electrohydrodynamic flows at the metallic hemisphere. In multi-particle systems, PS beads act as cooperative hubs that hierarchically recruit JPs, yielding higher-order hybrid structures. We identify structural isomers - for example, 3JP + 1PS clusters can form chain-like or triangular configurations depending on assembly sequence. Simulations confirm both as equilibrium states, with the triangular isomer slightly more stable. Similar polymorphism appears in larger clusters (4JPs). Overall, we establish a framework for controlled active-passive colloidal assembly, showing how frequency-tunable interactions and structural polymorphism enable the design of reconfigurable colloidal machines for applications in microrobotics, targeted delivery, and adaptive materials."

The analysis introduces a state-switching specification in which the market state is proxied by the slope of the yield curve, and proposes an Aligned Economic Index built from the popular predictors of Welch and Goyal (2008) (augmented with bond and equity premium measures). The Aligned Economic Index under the state-switching model exhibits statistically and economically meaningful in-sample ($R^2 = 5.9\\%$) and out-of-sample ($R^2_{\\text{oos}} = 4.12\\%$) predictive power across both recessions and expansions, while outperforming a range of widely used predictors. In this work, I examine the added value for professional practitioners by computing the economic gains for a mean-variance investor and find substantial added benefit of using the new index under the state switching model across all market states. The Aligned Economic Index can thus be implemented on a consistent real-time basis. These findings are crucial for both academics and practitioners as expansions are much longer-lived than recessions. Finally, I extend the empirical exercises by incorporating data through September 2020 and document sizable gains from using the Aligned Economic Index, relative to more traditional approaches, during the COVID-19 market turbulence."

    "abstract": "Global warming is often framed in broad planetary numbers such as the 1.5 C and 2 C warming thresholds, creating the false impression that individual corporations efforts to reduce emissions are meaningless in the absence of collective action. This perspective causes companies to reduce ambition towards voluntarily cutting emissions, as they believe their pollution has negligible impacts on its own. Reframing the issue to focus on the life-saving potential of individual corporate actions empowers companies to act and holds them accountable for inaction. Here, we show the results from an innovative modeling technique which calculates the avoided deaths from sustainability efforts for 3,084 companies spanning a range of sizes and sectors. From the reported emissions and planned emissions reductions, we create scenarios for 2020-2049 with and without the pledged emissions cuts and calculate the resulting warming from 2020-2100 using a climate emulator. We then use temperatures from these scenarios to calculate the deaths resulting from warming by using mortality damage functions. We find that more than 97% of these companies stand to save at least one life by following through with emissions reduction plans. Additionally, if all 3,084 companies follow through with their emissions reduction plans, over 4.4 million temperature-related deaths can be avoided."

Our results show that the system hosts only two phases: a magnetically ordered canted-$120^\\circ$ phase and an exact dimer singlet product phase. We identify a first-order transition between these two phases at $J_d/J \\approx 1.45$. Within the magnetically ordered phase, we observe small but finite magnetic moments. We also resolve the quantum renormalization of the canting angle, which deviates from the classical prediction over almost the entire magnetically ordered phase."

The model is representative of a network of nonlinear strings, where the strings are coupled to elastic bodies. The coupled system converges to the classical string network model with Kirchhoff and continuity transmission conditions as the spring stiffness terms approach infinity and the masses at the nodes vanish. Due to the presence of point masses at the nodes, the boundary conditions become dynamic, and consequently, the corresponding first-order system of quasilinear balance laws exhibits nonlocal boundary conditions. We demonstrate well-posedness in the sense of semi-global classical solutions \\cite{li} (i.e., for arbitrarily large time intervals provided that the initial and boundary data are small enough) and observe extra regularity at the masses as in \\cite{WangLeugeringLi2017,WangLeugeringLi2019}. We prove local and global-local exact boundary controllability of a star-like network when control is active at the endpoints of the string-spring-mass system, except for one clamped end. In this case, at multiple nodes, a complex smoothing pattern appears, leading to asymmetric control spaces when the springs and masses are present. Furthermore, the rank of the Laplacian matrix at the junction is crucial for the controllability property, particularly in models containing wave equations with degeneration at dynamic boundaries, which can be interpreted as damage in mechanical vibration systems where parts of the springs are missing."

However, existing frameworks largely rely on unstructured natural-language reasoning and accumulate raw intermediate traces in the context, which often leads to unstable reasoning trajectories, context overflow, and degraded performance on complex multi-hop queries. In this study, we introduce Laser, a general framework for stabilizing and scaling agentic search. Laser defines a symbolic action protocol that organizes agent behaviors into three spaces: planning, task-solving, and retrospection. Each action is specified with explicit semantics and a deterministic execution format, enabling structured and logical reasoning processes and reliable action parsing. This design makes intermediate decisions interpretable and traceable, enhancing explicit retrospection and fine-grained control over reasoning trajectories. In coordination with parsable actions, Laser further maintains a compact context register that stores only essential states of the reasoning process, allowing the agent to reason over long horizons without uncontrolled context expansion. Experiments on Qwen2.5/3-series models across challenging multi-hop QA datasets show that Laser consistently outperforms existing agentic search baselines under both prompting-only and fine-tuning settings, demonstrating that Laser provides a principled and effective foundation for robust, scalable agentic search."

This paper proposes a texture basis integrated smooth decomposition (TBSD) approach, which is targeted at efficient anomaly detection in textured images with smooth backgrounds and sparse anomalies. Mathematical formulation of quasi-periodicity and its theoretical properties are investigated for image texture estimation. TBSD method consists of two principal processes: the first process learns the texture basis functions to effectively extract quasi-periodic texture patterns; the subsequent anomaly detection process utilizes that texture basis as prior knowledge to prevent texture misidentification and capture potential anomalies with high accuracy.The proposed method surpasses benchmarks with less misidentification, smaller training dataset requirement, and superior anomaly detection performance on both simulation and real-world datasets."

Thus far, the physical determinants of these devices' performance remain under-explored. We show that under a broad range of conditions, the noise-induced error for spectral reconstruction is governed by the Fisher information. We then use random matrix theory to derive a closed-form relation linking the variance bound to a set of key physical parameters: the spectral correlation length, the mean transmittance, and the number of frequency and measurement channels. The analysis reveals certain fundamental trade-offs between these physical parameters, and establishes the conditions for a spectrometer to achieve ``super-resolution'' below the limit set by the spectral correlation length. Our theory is confirmed using numerical validations with a random matrix model as well as full-wave simulations. These results establish a physically-grounded framework for designing and analyzing performant and noise-robust reconstructive spectrometers."

Covariate effects are allowed to vary across occupational clusters and evolve over time.

Such issues can damage reputations, waste resources, and even endanger lives when flawed studies influence medical or safety-critical systems. This research explores both the offensive and defensive sides of this growing threat. On the attack side, we demonstrate how an author can inject hidden prompts inside a PDF that secretly guide or \"jailbreak\" LLM reviewers into giving overly positive feedback and biased acceptance. On the defense side, we propose an \"inject-and-detect\" strategy for editors, where invisible trigger prompts are embedded into papers; if a review repeats or reacts to these triggers, it reveals that the review was generated by an LLM, not a human. This method turns prompt injections from vulnerability into a verification tool. We outline our design, expected model behaviors, and ethical safeguards for deployment.

Gaussian Interconnected Networks based on the arithmetic of Gaussian integers, offer attractive properties regarding diameter and symmetry. Despite their attractive theoretical properties, adaptive routing techniques in these networks are vulnerable to node and link faults, leading to rapid degradation in communication reliability. Node failures (particularly those following Gaussian distributions, such as thermal hotspots or physical damage clusters) pose severe challenges to traditional deterministic routing. This paper proposes a fault-aware Reinforcement Learning (RL) routing scheme tailored for Gaussian Interconnected Networks. By utilizing a PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) agent with a specific reward structure designed to penalize fault proximity, the system dynamically learns to bypass faulty regions. We compare our proposed RL-based routing protocol against a greedy adaptive shortest-path routing algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the RL agent significantly outperforms the adaptive routing sustaining a Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) of 0.95 at 40% fault density compared to 0.66 for the greedy. Furthermore, the RL approach exhibits effective delivery rates compared to the greedy adaptive routing, particularly under low network load of 20% at 0.57 vs. 0.43, showing greater proficiency in managing congestion, validating its efficacy in stochastic, fault-prone topologies"

    "abstract": "Precisely estimating out-of-sample upper quantiles is very important in risk assessment and in engineering practice for structural design to prevent a greater disaster. For this purpose, the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution has been broadly used. To estimate the parameters of GEV distribution, the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and L-moment estimation (LME) methods have been primarily employed. For a better estimation using the MLE, several studies considered the generalized MLE (penalized likelihood or Bayesian) methods to cooperate with a penalty function or prior information for parameters. However, a generalized LME method for the same purpose has not been developed yet in the literature. We thus propose the generalized method of L-moment estimation (GLME) to cooperate with a penalty function or prior information. The proposed estimation is based on the generalized L-moment distance and a multivariate normal likelihood approximation. Because the L-moment estimator is more efficient and robust for small samples than the MLE, we reasonably expect the advantages of LME to continue to hold for GLME. The proposed method is applied to the stationary and nonstationary GEV models with two novel (data-adaptive) penalty functions to correct the bias of LME. A simulation study indicates that the biases of LME are considerably corrected by the GLME with slight increases in the standard error. Applications to US flood damage data and maximum rainfall at Phliu Agromet in Thailand illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method. This study may promote further work on penalized or Bayesian inferences based on L-moments."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in generative AI have accelerated the production of ultra-high-resolution visual content, posing significant challenges for efficient compression and real-time decoding on end-user devices. Inspired by 3D Gaussian Splatting, recent 2D Gaussian image models improve representation efficiency, yet existing methods struggle to balance compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity in ultra-high-resolution scenarios. To address this issue, we propose SmartSplat, a highly adaptive and feature-aware GS-based image compression framework that supports arbitrary image resolutions and compression ratios. SmartSplat leverages image-aware features such as gradients and color variances, introducing a Gradient-Color Guided Variational Sampling strategy together with an Exclusion-based Uniform Sampling scheme to improve the non-overlapping coverage of Gaussian primitives in pixel space. In addition, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Gaussian Color Sampling method to enhance color initialization across scales. Through joint optimization of spatial layout, scale, and color initialization, SmartSplat efficiently captures both local structures and global textures using a limited number of Gaussians, achieving high reconstruction quality under strong compression. Extensive experiments on DIV8K and a newly constructed 16K dataset demonstrate that SmartSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods at comparable compression ratios and exceeds their compression limits, showing strong scalability and practical applicability. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/lif314/SmartSplat."

While non-verbal communication has been extensively investigated, research on assessing voice-based verbal communication patterns remains relatively understudied. In this study, we propose a framework that automatically assesses verbal communication patterns by constructing networks with utterances transcribed from voice recordings. Through a data collection study, we obtained 84 game sessions from five League of Legends teams and subsequently investigated how verbal communication patterns varied across different conditions. As a result, we revealed that esports players exhibited broader and more balanced participation in collaborative situations, increased utterances over time with the largest rise in decision making, and team-level differences that were contingent on effective professional training. Building upon these findings, this study provides a generalizable tool for analyzing effective team communication."

While Ground Penetrating Radar and Infrared Thermography enable subsurface defect detection, single modal approaches face complementary constraints radar struggles with moisture and shallow defects, while thermography exhibits weather dependency and limited depth. This paper presents a multi modal attention network fusing radar temporal patterns with thermal spatial signatures for bridge deck delamination detection. Our architecture introduces temporal attention for radar processing, spatial attention for thermal features, and cross modal fusion with learnable embeddings discovering complementary defect patterns invisible to individual sensors. We incorporate uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo dropout and learned variance estimation, decomposing uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components for safety critical decisions. Experiments on five bridge datasets reveal that on balanced to moderately imbalanced data, our approach substantially outperforms baselines in accuracy and AUC representing meaningful improvements over single modal and concatenation based fusion. Ablation studies demonstrate cross modal attention provides critical gains beyond within modality attention, while multi head mechanisms achieve improved calibration. Uncertainty quantification reduces calibration error, enabling selective prediction by rejecting uncertain cases. However, under extreme class imbalance, attention mechanisms show vulnerability to majority class collapse. These findings provide actionable guidance: attention based architecture performs well across typical scenarios, while extreme imbalance requires specialized techniques. Our system maintains deployment efficiency, enabling real time inspection with characterized capabilities and limitations."

    "abstract": "Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search (ENAS) has gained attention for automatically designing neural network architectures. Recent studies use a neural predictor to guide the process, but the high computational costs of gathering training data -- since each label requires fully training an architecture -- make achieving a high-precision predictor with { limited compute budget (i.e., a capped number of fully trained architecture-label pairs)} crucial for ENAS success. This paper introduces ENAS with Dual Contrastive Learning (DCL-ENAS), a novel method that employs two stages of contrastive learning to train the neural predictor. In the first stage, contrastive self-supervised learning is used to learn meaningful representations from neural architectures without requiring labels. In the second stage, fine-tuning with contrastive learning is performed to accurately predict the relative performance of different architectures rather than their absolute performance, which is sufficient to guide the evolutionary search. Across NASBench-101 and NASBench-201, DCL-ENAS achieves the highest validation accuracy, surpassing the strongest published baselines by 0.05\\% (ImageNet16-120) to 0.39\\% (NASBench-101). On a real-world ECG arrhythmia classification task, DCL-ENAS improves performance by approximately 2.5 percentage points over a manually designed, non-NAS model obtained via random search, while requiring only 7.7 GPU-days."

Existing deterministic networks render observed regions quickly but blur unobserved areas, whereas stochastic diffusion-based methods hallucinate plausible content yet incur heavy training- and inference-time costs. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework that unifies the strengths of both paradigms. A bidirectional transformer encodes multi-view image tokens and Plucker-ray embeddings, producing a shared latent representation. Two lightweight heads then act on this representation: (i) a feed-forward regression head that renders pixels where geometry is well constrained, and (ii) a masked autoregressive diffusion head that completes occluded or unseen regions. The entire model is trained end-to-end with joint photometric and diffusion losses, without handcrafted 3D inductive biases, enabling scalability across diverse scenes. Experiments demonstrate that our method attains state-of-the-art image quality while reducing rendering time by an order of magnitude compared with fully generative baselines."

Solar Orbiter's Solar Wind Analyzer (SWA) offers unique capabilities to investigate how Alfvénic slow wind differs from fast wind and relate these differences to their solar origins. In September 2022, Solar Orbiter observed several Alfvénic streams: one fast wind, three Alfvénic slow wind (AS1, AS2, AS3), and a moderate fast (FH) interval. We analyze these streams, combining plasma parameters from all SWA sensors with magnetic field measurements from the Magnetometer (MAG). A spectral analysis of magnetic and velocity fluctuations is used to characterize Alfvénicity. The magnetic connectivity of each stream to its solar source is examined using Potential Field Source Surface extrapolation combined with ballistic backmapping from the spacecraft. Proton velocity distribution functions show anisotropies and field-aligned beams characteristic of Alfvénic streams, while electron pitch-angle distributions reveal clear strahl populations. Oxygen and carbon charge-state ratios are low in fast wind but higher in AS1-AS3, consistent with slow wind origins. Magnetic connectivity suggests the fast wind originates from a large coronal hole; AS1 links to a pseudostreamer with high expansion factor; AS2, AS3, and FH connect to a negative-polarity coronal hole whose field lines cross a pseudostreamer that later dissipates. Spectral analysis indicates near energy equipartition in all intervals except AS2. The combined SWA observations offer key insights into the physical processes shaping Alfvénic solar wind streams. Our results reinforce that the simple fast/slow wind classification is inadequate for linking solar wind to sources, and suggest that Alfvénicity relates to the solar source conditions."

We introduce latitude-based adaptive quality parameters through rate-distortion optimization for NVC. The proposed method utilizes vector bank interpolation for latent modulation, enabling flexible adaptation with arbitrary quality parameters and mitigating the limitations caused by rounding errors in the adaptive quantization parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that applying this method to the DCVC-RT framework yields BD-Rate savings of 5.2% in terms of the weighted spherical peak signal-to-noise ratio for JVET class S1 test sequences, with only a 0.3% increase in processing time."

Our development eliminates the need to optimise for the best probe state, while highlighting aspects of detector analysis that fundamentally differ from quantum state estimation. Through proofs, examples and experimental validation, we demonstrate the relevance and robustness of our proposal for current quantum detector technologies. By formalising a dual perspective to state estimation, our framework completes and connects the triad of efficient state, process, and detector tomography, advancing quantum information theory with broader implications for emerging technologies reliant on precisely calibrated measurements."

Styles are expressed not only by the global appearance, but also by the attributes of individual items and their combinations. In this study, we propose an item region-based fashion style classification network (IRSN) to effectively classify fashion styles by analyzing item-specific features and their combinations in addition to global features. IRSN extracts features of each item region using item region pooling (IRP), analyzes them separately, and combines them using gated feature fusion (GFF). In addition, we improve the feature extractor by applying a dual-backbone architecture that combines a domain-specific feature extractor and a general feature extractor pre-trained with a large-scale image-text dataset. In experiments, applying IRSN to six widely-used backbones, including EfficientNet, ConvNeXt, and Swin Transformer, improved style classification accuracy by an average of 6.9% and a maximum of 14.5% on the FashionStyle14 dataset and by an average of 7.6% and a maximum of 15.1% on the ShowniqV3 dataset. Visualization analysis also supports that the IRSN models are better than the baseline models at capturing differences between similar style classes."

Anomaly detection in these non-grid environments is particularly difficult due to the absence of canonical reference points, the sparsity and irregularity of trajectories, and the fact that anomalies may manifest at multiple granularities. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset for anomaly detection in the maritime domain, extending the Open Maritime Traffic Analysis Dataset (OMTAD) into a benchmark tailored for graph-based anomaly detection. Our dataset enables systematic evaluation across three different granularities: node-level, edge-level, and graph-level anomalies. We plan to employ two specialized LLM-based agents: \\emph{Trajectory Synthesizer} and \\emph{Anomaly Injector} to construct richer interaction contexts and generate semantically meaningful anomalies. We expect this benchmark to promote reproducibility and to foster methodological advances in anomaly detection for non-grid spatio-temporal systems."

These ML classifiers are an integral component of today's quantum computer's control and readout stacks. This paper is the first to analyze the susceptibility of such ML classifiers to physical fault-injection which can result in generation of incorrect readout results from quantum computers. The study targets 5-qubit (thus 32-class) readout error-correction model. Using the ChipWhisperer Husky for physical voltage glitching, this work leverages an automated algorithm for scanning the fault injection parameter search space to find various successful faults in all the layers of the target ML model. Across repeated trials, this work finds that fault susceptibility is strongly layer-dependent: early-layers demonstrate higher rates of misprediction when faults are triggered in them, whereas later layers have smaller misprediction rates. This work further characterizes the resulting readout failures at the bitstring level using Hamming-distance and per-bit flip statistics, showing that single-shot glitches can induce structured readout corruption rather than purely random noise. These results motivate treating ML-based quantum computer readout and readout correction as a security-critical component of quantum systems and highlight the need for lightweight, deployment-friendly fault detection and redundancy mechanisms in the quantum computer readout pipelines."

The proposed scheme leverages joint dissipativity-type properties of subsystems described by storage functions, while providing a stability certificate over unknown interconnected networks. In our data-driven framework, we begin by formulating the required conditions for constructing storage functions as a robust convex program (RCP). Given that unknown models of subsystems are integrated into one of the constraints of the RCP, we collect data from trajectories of each unknown subsystem and provide a scenario convex program (SCP) that aligns with the original RCP. We solve the SCP as a linear program and construct a storage function for each subsystem with unknown dynamics. Under some newly developed data-driven compositionality conditions, we then construct a Lyapunov function for the fully unknown interconnected network utilizing storage functions derived from data of individual subsystems. We show that our data-driven {divide and conquer strategy} provides correctness guarantees (as opposed to probabilistic confidence) while significantly mitigating the sample complexity problem existing in data-driven approaches. To illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed results, we apply our approaches to three different case studies involving interconnected homogeneous (nonlinear) networks with unknown models. We collect data from trajectories of unknown subsystems and verify the global asymptotic stability (GAS) of the interconnected system with a guaranteed confidence."

In Stage-1, our model is trained on rationale generation, while in Stage-2, we jointly train on label prediction and rationale generation, applying scheduled sampling to gradually transition from conditioning on gold labels to model predictions. We evaluate Reason2Decide on three medical datasets, including a proprietary triage dataset and public biomedical QA datasets. Across model sizes, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs in prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity (BERTScore, BLEU, LLM-as-a-Judge). In triage, Reason2Decide is rationale source-robust across LLM-generated, nurse-authored, and nurse-post-processed rationales. In our experiments, while using only LLM-generated rationales in Stage-1, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning variants. This indicates that LLM-generated rationales are suitable for pretraining models, reducing reliance on human annotations. Remarkably, Reason2Decide achieves these gains with models 40x smaller than contemporary foundation models, making clinical reasoning more accessible for resource-constrained deployments while still providing explainable decision support."

After soaking the sample in a simulated body fluid (SBF) for 14 days, a layer with the thickness of 8 μm is recognized to be substituted for the primary diopside deposit, suggesting the mineralization of apatite on the surface. Investigations revealed that the newly-formed layer is predominantly composed of Ca, P and Si, albeit with a biased accumulations of P and Si towards the surface and substrate, respectively. The variations in the ionic composition and pH of the SBF due to the incubation of the sample were also correlated with the above-interpreted biomineralization.

This study focuses on Mg-Ca silicate microspheres encapsulated in biodegradable poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) to serve as a biocompatible carrier for the controlled release of vancomycin hydrochloride. In this regard, diopside (MgCaSi2O6), bredigite (MgCa7Si4O16) and akermanite (MgCa2Si2O7) powders were synthesized by sol-gel and subsequent calcination methods. Then, porous akermanite, diopside and bredigite microspheres of 700-1000 um in diameter were fabricated by using carbon porogen, droplet extrusion and sintering, then loaded with the drug and eventually coated with PLGA. The bare microspheres showed a considerable burst release mode of the drug into a physiological medium, whereas PLGA coating of the microspheres reduced the burst release level. To investigate effective mechanisms governing in the drug release from the carriers, the contribution of burst, degradation, and diffusion was analyzed by the sequential quadratic programming algorithm method. It was found that the relative contribution of diffusion to bioresorption is ranked as diopside > akermanite > bredigite, whereas PLGA coating dominates the diffusion mechanism. The dental pulp stem cells cytocompatibility MTT assay of the microspheres also showed that the drug loading deteriorates but PLGA coating improves the cell biocompatibility significantly. Comparatively, the biocompatibility of the PLGA-coated microspheres was ranked as akermanite > diopside > bredigite, as a result of a compromise between the release of the constituting ions of the ceramic carriers and vancomycin molecules. It was eventually concluded that PLGA-coated Mg-Ca silicate microspheres are promising candidates for drug-delivery bone tissue engineering and dental bone grafting applications."

    "abstract": "Matrix Product State (MPS) is a versatile tensor network representation widely applied in quantum physics, quantum chemistry, and machine learning, etc. MPS sampling serves as a critical fundamental operation in these fields. As the problems become more complex, the scale of MPS is rapidly increasing. Traditional data parallelism is limited by memory and heavy I/O in large-scale MPS. Model parallelism that can handle large-scale MPS imposes rigid process bindings and lacks scalability. This work proposes Fast-MPS, a multi-level parallel framework for scalable MPS sampling. Our design combines data parallelism across samples with tensor parallelism along bond dimensions. We eliminate memory and I/O pressure through compression and overlapping, and revive data parallel in large-scale MPS sampling. We evaluate our approach on Gaussian Boson Sampling, a representative and demanding application. Fast-MPS achieves over 10x speedup compared to existing simulators, scales to thousands of processes, and enables simulations with 8,176 sites and bond dimension chi = 10^4, significantly outperforming the state of the art. Fast-MPS has demonstrated great potential in high-performance tensor network applications."

Accurately predicting student engagement is essential for optimizing teaching strategies and providing personalized interventions. However, most approaches focus on single-dimensional feature analysis and assessing engagement based on individual student factors. In this work, we propose a dual-stream multi-feature fusion model based on hypergraph convolutional networks (DS-HGCN), incorporating social contagion of student engagement. DS-HGCN enables accurate prediction of student engagement states by modeling multi-dimensional features and their propagation mechanisms between students. The framework constructs a hypergraph structure to encode engagement contagion among students and captures the emotional and behavioral differences and commonalities by multi-frequency signals. Furthermore, we introduce a hypergraph attention mechanism to dynamically weigh the influence of each student, accounting for individual differences in the propagation process. Extensive experiments on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior performance and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches."

    "abstract": "As Earth's climate changes, it is impacting disasters and extreme weather events across the planet. Record-breaking heat waves, drenching rainfalls, extreme wildfires, and widespread flooding during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and more intense. Rapid and efficient response to disaster events is essential for climate resilience and sustainability. A key challenge in disaster response is to accurately and quickly identify disaster locations to support decision-making and resources allocation. In this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Cross-view Geolocalization approach, called ProbGLC, exploring new pathways towards generative location awareness for rapid disaster response. Herein, we combine probabilistic and deterministic geolocalization models into a unified framework to simultaneously enhance model explainability (via uncertainty quantification) and achieve state-of-the-art geolocalization performance. Designed for rapid diaster response, the ProbGLC is able to address cross-view geolocalization across multiple disaster events as well as to offer unique features of probabilistic distribution and localizability score. To evaluate the ProbGLC, we conduct extensive experiments on two cross-view disaster datasets (i.e., MultiIAN and SAGAINDisaster), consisting diverse cross-view imagery pairs of multiple disaster types (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires, floods, to tornadoes). Preliminary results confirms the superior geolocalization accuracy (i.e., 0.86 in Acc@1km and 0.97 in Acc@25km) and model explainability (i.e., via probabilistic distributions and localizability scores) of the proposed ProbGLC approach, highlighting the great potential of leveraging generative cross-view approach to facilitate location awareness for better and faster disaster response.

    "abstract": "Most computational accounts of cognitive maps assume that stability is achieved primarily through sensory anchoring, with self-motion contributing to incremental positional updates only. However, biological spatial representations often remain coherent even when sensory cues degrade or conflict, suggesting that self-motion may play a deeper organizational role. Here, we show that self-motion can act as a structural prior that actively organizes the geometry of learned cognitive maps. We embed a path-integration-based motion prior in a predictive-coding framework, implemented using a capacity-efficient, brain-inspired recurrent mechanism combining spiking dynamics, analog modulation and adaptive thresholds. Across highly aliased, dynamically changing and naturalistic environments, this structural prior consistently stabilizes map formation, improving local topological fidelity, global positional accuracy and next-step prediction under sensory ambiguity. Mechanistic analyses reveal that the motion prior itself encodes geometrically precise trajectories under tight constraints of internal states and generalizes zero-shot to unseen environments, outperforming simpler motion-based constraints. Finally, deployment on a quadrupedal robot demonstrates that motion-derived structural priors enhance online landmark-based navigation under real-world sensory variability. Together, these results reframe self-motion as an organizing scaffold for coherent spatial representations, showing how brain-inspired principles can systematically strengthen spatial intelligence in embodied artificial agents."

    "abstract": "Accurate and interpretable forecasting of multivariate time series is crucial for understanding the complex dynamics of cryptocurrency markets in digital asset systems. Advanced deep learning methodologies, particularly Transformer-based and MLP-based architectures, have achieved competitive predictive performance in cryptocurrency forecasting tasks. However, cryptocurrency data is inherently composed of long-term socio-economic trends and local high-frequency speculative oscillations. Existing deep learning-based 'black-box' models fail to effectively decouple these composite dynamics or provide the interpretability needed for trustworthy financial decision-making. To overcome these limitations, we propose DecoKAN, an interpretable forecasting framework that integrates multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for decoupling and hierarchical signal decomposition with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) mixers for transparent and interpretable nonlinear modeling. The DWT component decomposes complex cryptocurrency time series into distinct frequency components, enabling frequency-specific analysis, while KAN mixers provide intrinsically interpretable spline-based mappings within each decomposed subseries. Furthermore, interpretability is enhanced through a symbolic analysis pipeline involving sparsification, pruning, and symbolization, which produces concise analytical expressions offering symbolic representations of the learned patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DecoKAN achieves the lowest average Mean Squared Error on all tested real-world cryptocurrency datasets (BTC, ETH, XMR), consistently outperforming a comprehensive suite of competitive state-of-the-art baselines. These results validate DecoKAN's potential to bridge the gap between predictive accuracy and model transparency, advancing trustworthy decision support within complex cryptocurrency markets."

Recently the US government has raised worries that Russia is testing nuclear-armed anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) components, with the possibility that it will place a nuclear weapon in space. Such a device, if detonated, would destroy most of the satellites in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO). This danger is compounded by the lack of a verification mechanism for the OST. No methodologies of verification have been proposed in the open peer reviewed literature. This study presents a concept and a feasibility study for verifying a satellite's compliance to the OST by observing the neutrons induced by spallation from the $\\sim$GeV protons in the inner Van Allen radiation belts. The calculations show that a 9U CubeSat sized detection platform can identify a thermonuclear weapon from the distance of 4 km in approximately one week of observation.

The framework formalizes the traditional geometric construction as a deterministic, reproducible sequence of geometric operations, establishing a clear mapping between measured data, fixed geometric objects, and steady-state operating points. Quantities such as power factor, slip, output power, torque, and efficiency are obtained through explicit geometric relationships on the constructed diagram. Validation using a representative textbook example demonstrates close agreement with classical results.

In it, an efficient edge model handles routine queries, a more capable cloud model addresses complex cases, and human experts are involved only when necessary. We define a misalignment-cost constrained optimization problem, aiming to minimize average processing cost, while guaranteeing alignment of automated answers with expert judgments. We propose a statistically rigorous threshold selection method based on multiple hypothesis testing (MHT) for a query processing mechanism based on knowledge and confidence tests. The approach provides finite-sample guarantees on misalignment risk. Experiments on the TeleQnA dataset -- a telecom-specific benchmark -- demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior cost-efficiency compared to conventional cascaded baselines, while ensuring reliability at prescribed confidence levels."

We consider the problem of obtaining closed-form analytical lower and upper bounds on transition temperatures for such systems. We focus mainly on a class of models known as the gamma-model, which generalizes the Eliashberg theory of Superconductivity where the effective interaction potential scales as V(Omega) ~ 1/|Omega|^gamma. Building on a recent reformulation of Migdal-Eliashberg theory, expressed as a classical infinite spin chain with nonlocal interactions, and employing a simple linear algebra framework, we derive rigorous closed-form expressions for upper and lower bounds on the superconducting transition temperature for any gamma > 0. While our lower bounds coincide precisely with those previously in the literature, our derivation offers a more streamlined and accessible method. Moreover, our upper bounds are substantially tighter than any existing estimates and converge rapidly enough to the numerical results from various prior studies."

However, extending them to powerful nonparametric alternatives is difficult due to the lack of suitable score functions. Through a class of exponentially tilted models, we show that the resulting score-based GoF tests are equivalent to the tests based on integral probability metrics (IPMs) indexed by a function class. When the class is rich, the test is universally consistent. This simple yet insightful perspective enables reinterpretation of classical distance-based testing procedures-including those based on Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance, Wasserstein-1 distance, and maximum mean discrepancy-as arising from score-based constructions. Building on this insight, we propose a new nonparametric score-based GoF test through a special class of IPM induced by kernelized Stein's function class, called semiparametric kernelized Stein discrepancy (SKSD) test. Compared with other nonparametric score-based tests, the SKSD test is computationally efficient and accommodates general nuisance-parameter estimators, supported by a generic parametric bootstrap procedure. The SKSD test is universally consistent and attains Pitman efficiency. Moreover, SKSD test provides simple GoF tests for models with intractable likelihoods but tractable scores with the help of Stein's identity and we use two popular models, kernel exponential family and conditional Gaussian models, to illustrate the power of our method. Our method achieves power comparable to task-specific normality tests such as Anderson-Darling and Lilliefors, despite being designed for general nonparametric alternatives."

A filtering and smoothing algorithm is used to compute the posterior expectations corresponding to the latent regimes and factors. The consistency, convergence rates, and limit distributions of the estimated parameters are established under mild conditions. The effectiveness of this estimation method is also validated by rigorous numerical simulations. Furthermore, we apply the Ms-DMF model to an international trade flow network.

However, these estimators face a fundamental variance trade-off: DSI exhibits high variance in low-noise regimes, whereas TSI suffers from high variance at high noise levels. In this work, we reconcile these approaches by unifying both estimators within the principled framework of control variates. We introduce the Control Variate Score Identity (CVSI), deriving an optimal, time-dependent control coefficient that theoretically guarantees variance minimization across the entire noise spectrum. We demonstrate that CVSI serves as a robust, low-variance plug-in estimator that significantly enhances sample efficiency in both data-free sampler learning and inference-time diffusion sampling."

We further present two diagnostic case studies showing that exploration functions as a critical branching step associated with correctness, and that efficiency-oriented methods selectively suppress evaluative feedback steps rather than uniformly shortening responses.

When a wind turbine harvests energy from free wind, it produces a turbulent region with reduced energy for downstream turbines. Strategies for increasing the efficiency of wind farms by mitigating wake effects have been the subject of much computational research. To this end, both the positioning of the turbines and their cooperative control must be taken into account. Since they are mutually dependent, increasing attention has been paid to the joint consideration of layout design and control. However, joint modeling approaches lead to large-scale and difficult optimization problems, which lack efficient solution strategies. This paper describes an efficient optimization framework for the joint design and steady-state control of wind turbines under a continuous wake effect model. Through a multi-level reformulation of the joint optimization problem, it shows how problem sub-structure can be efficiently exploited to yield order-of-magnitude reduction in convergence times over naive approaches and prior proposals."

Structure-based MRSs have achieved state-of-the-art performance by constructing semantic item graphs, which explicitly model relationships between items based on modality feature similarity. However, such semantic item graphs are often noisy due to 1) inherent noise in multimodal information and 2) misalignment between item semantics and user-item co-occurrence relationships, which introduces false links and leads to suboptimal recommendations. To address this challenge, we propose Item Graph Diffusion for Multimodal Recommendation (IGDMRec), a novel method that leverages a diffusion model with classifier-free guidance to denoise the semantic item graph by integrating user behavioral information. Specifically, IGDMRec introduces a Behavior-conditioned Graph Diffusion (BGD) module, incorporating interaction data as conditioning information to guide the denoising of the semantic item graph. Additionally, a Conditional Denoising Network (CD-Net) is designed to implement the denoising process with manageable complexity. Finally, we propose a contrastive representation augmentation scheme that leverages both the denoised item graph and the original item graph to enhance item representations. \\LL{Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of IGDMRec over competitive baselines, with robustness analysis validating its denoising capability and ablation studies verifying the effectiveness of its key components."

In QIA, operators are expressed as structured combinations of basis elements indexed by Boolean codes, allowing products, commutators, and conjugations to be computed through finite rules on discrete indices rather than through dense matrix arithmetic. This representation unifies combinatorial index structure, explicit matrix realization, and transformation properties under Walsh-Hadamard-type transforms within a single formalism. Using QIA and its associated block-matrix realization, we reformulate the Bernstein-Vazirani hidden-string problem in its phase-oracle form entirely within a real, finite-dimensional algebraic setting. We show that, under structured oracle access, the QIA procedure reproduces the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm exactly and achieves the same asymptotic query complexity and circuit depth as the standard quantum algorithm. In particular, the hidden string is recovered by symbolic manipulation of a sparse algebraic representation of the oracle rather than by numerical simulation of quantum amplitudes. Our results demonstrate that the apparent quantum speed-up in this setting is a consequence of operator structure rather than Hilbert-space dimensionality alone. QIA thus provides a precise language for separating genuinely quantum resources from those arising from algebraic and combinatorial structures and offers a new perspective on the classical simulability of structured quantum circuits."

However, the clinical relevance of the tissue characteristics at the micro- and macro-environment level is limited by the lack of tools that facilitate the measurement of the spatial interaction of individual structure characteristics and their association with clinical parameters. To address these challenges, we introduce HistoWAS (Histology-Wide Association Study), a computational framework designed to link tissue spatial organization to clinical outcomes. Specifically, HistoWAS implements (1) a feature space that augments conventional metrics with 30 topological and spatial features, adapted from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) point pattern analysis, to quantify tissue micro-architecture; and (2) an association study engine, inspired by Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS), that performs mass univariate regression for each feature with statistical correction. As a proof of concept, we applied HistoWAS to analyze a total of 102 features (72 conventional object-level features and our 30 spatial features) using 385 PAS-stained WSIs from 206 participants in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP).

    "abstract": "Crowd-sourced fact-checking provides social media platforms with a promising method of managing misinformation at scale. However, the success of fact-checking programs like X's Community Notes requires the participation of a critical mass of note-writers who have the time and epistemic resources necessary to write and rate high-quality notes. As X's Community Notes program was first established in English-speaking countries, much academic research has focused on English-language notes or notes writ large. Relatively little research has investigated how different linguistic communities utilise Community Notes. Thus, it is unclear whether Community Notes or similar crowd-sourced fact-checking initiatives represent a viable alternative to social media platforms' partnerships with professional fact-checking organisations across linguistic contexts. This research identifies how different linguistic communities participate in volunteer fact-checking efforts on X's Community Notes program and addresses volunteers' reliance on professional fact-checking resources differs across languages. We find that while the Community Notes program has had strong uptake in some linguistic communities, the program has failed to catch on in others. Additionally, we confirm findings that notes that cite professional fact-checkers are considered more helpful, but show that reliance on professional fact-checking overall remains minimal."

However, full field coherent diffraction imaging requires scanning of the sample combined with computational phase retrieval, making it challenging to quickly acquire a large series of dynamic frames. In this work, we demonstrate a technique for extracting dynamic 1D images of the average unit cell in a periodic sample from traditional EUV scatterometry data by analyzing the changing intensities of the far field diffracted orders. Starting from a system of equations relating small changes in far field diffraction to phase and amplitude perturbations at the sample plane, it is shown that under certain conditions, changes to the $n$th diffracted order map exclusively onto the $n$th Fourier component of the perturbation via a closed-form relation. We show through rigorous coupled-wave analysis simulations that our method can provide a good approximation even outside the scalar diffraction theory framework in which it is derived. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate this reconstruction method by exiting 1D nickel nanowires on a diamond substrate using an infrared laser pump pulse, and measuring their relaxation using a time-delayed EUV probe pulse, to visualize nanoscale phonon dynamics."

    "abstract": "Recent research has explored using very large language models (LLMs) as proxies for humans in tasks such as simulation, surveys, and studies. While LLMs do not possess a human psychology, they often can emulate human behaviors with sufficiently high fidelity to drive simulations to test human behavioral hypotheses, exhibiting more nuance and range than the rule-based agents often employed in behavioral economics. One key area of interest is the effect of personality on decision making, but the requirement that a prompt must be created for every tested personality profile introduces experimental overhead and degrades replicability. To address this issue, we leverage interpolative decoding, representing each dimension of personality as a pair of opposed prompts and employing an interpolation parameter to simulate behavior along the dimension. We show that interpolative decoding reliably modulates scores along each of the Big Five dimensions. We then show how interpolative decoding causes LLMs to mimic human decision-making behavior in economic games, replicating results from human psychological research. Finally, we present preliminary results of our efforts to ``twin'' individual human players in a collaborative game through systematic search for points in interpolation space that cause the system to replicate actions taken by the human subject."

    "abstract": "Contact often occurs without macroscopic surface deformation, such as during interaction with liquids, semi-liquids, or ultra-soft materials. Most existing tactile sensors rely on deformation to infer contact, making such light-contact interactions difficult to perceive robustly. To address this, we present LightTact, a visual-tactile fingertip sensor that makes contact directly visible via a deformation-independent, optics-based principle. LightTact uses an ambient-blocking optical configuration that suppresses both external light and internal illumination at non-contact regions, while transmitting only the diffuse light generated at true contacts. As a result, LightTact produces high-contrast raw images in which non-contact pixels remain near-black (mean gray value < 3) and contact pixels preserve the natural appearance of the contacting surface. Built on this, LightTact achieves accurate pixel-level contact segmentation that is robust to material properties, contact force, surface appearance, and environmental lighting. We further integrate LightTact on a robotic arm and demonstrate manipulation behaviors driven by extremely light contact, including water spreading, facial-cream dipping, and thin-film interaction. Finally, we show that LightTact's spatially aligned visual-tactile images can be directly interpreted by existing vision-language models, enabling resistor value reasoning for robotic sorting."

We briefly outline the theoretical formulation of thermodynamic quantities and transport coefficients within these approaches, where quarks are treated with effective masses in the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio and chiral effective models, and hadronic degrees of freedom are employed in the hadron resonance gas model. The transport coefficients are evaluated using the Boltzmann transport equation in the relaxation-time approximation. Following the theoretical overview, we present a comprehensive analysis of the behavior of these quantities as functions of the baryon chemical potential or net baryon density. The Lorenz ratio $κ/(σT)$ is found to increase rapidly-indicating a strong violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law in the low-$μ_{B}$ regime--while approaching the universal value at higher baryon chemical potentials or densities. The shear-viscosity-to-entropy-density ratio $η/s$ remains nearly constant at low $μ_{B}$ but exhibits a gradual increase as $μ_{B}$ grows. We also discuss the qualitative similarities of these trends with those observed in the electron-hole plasma of graphene, an emergent quasi-relativistic system characterized by massless energy-momentum dispersion."

This study compares large language models, including GatorTron-Base (trained on clinical data), Llama 8B, and Mistral 7B, against models like BioBERT, DocBERT, BioClinicalBERT, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec, setting benchmarks for predicting Shock in critically ill patients. Timely prediction of shock can enable early interventions, thus improving patient outcomes. Text data from 17,294 ICU stays of patients in the MIMIC III database were scored for length of stay > 24 hours and shock index (SI) > 0.7 to yield 355 and 87 patients with normal and abnormal SI-index, respectively. Both focal and cross-entropy losses were used during finetuning to address class imbalances. Our findings indicate that while GatorTron Base achieved the highest weighted recall of 80.5%, the overall performance metrics were comparable between SLMs and LLMs. This suggests that LLMs are not inherently superior to SLMs in predicting future clinical events despite their strong performance on text-based tasks. To achieve meaningful clinical outcomes, future efforts in training LLMs should prioritize developing models capable of predicting clinical trajectories rather than focusing on simpler tasks such as named entity recognition or phenotyping."

    "abstract": "Quantum metrology aims to exploit many-body quantum states to achieve parameter-estimation precision beyond the standard quantum limit. For unitary parameter encoding generated by local Hamiltonians, such enhancement is characterized by superlinear scaling of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) with system size. Despite extensive progress, a systematic understanding of which many-body quantum states can exhibit this scaling has remained elusive. Here, we develop a general framework that connects metrological performance to long-range entanglement, state-preparation complexity, and quantum error-correction properties. We prove that super-linear QFI scaling necessarily requires long-range entanglement by deriving rigorous complexity-dependent upper bounds on the QFI. We further show that, for two broad classes of quantum error-correcting codes, nondegenerate codes and Calderbank--Shor--Steane quantum low-density parity-check codes, a nonconstant code distance precludes super-linear QFI scaling for a wide class of local Hamiltonians, revealing a fundamental incompatibility between metrological sensitivity and protection against local noise. Finally, we identify constructive routes that evade this obstruction by exploiting asymmetric code structures. In particular, we show that states associated with classical low-density parity-check codes, as well as asymmetric toric code states, both having asymmetric logical distances, can achieve Heisenberg-limited scaling. Together, our results establish long-range entanglement and asymmetric error correction as the essential resource underlying quantum metrology and clarify the interplay among state complexity, error correction, and metrological power."

However, non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data across clients biases updates and degrades performance. To alleviate these issues, we propose Clust-PSI-PFL, a clustering-based personalized FL framework that uses the Population Stability Index (PSI) to quantify the level of non-IID data. We compute a weighted PSI metric, $WPSI^L$, which we show to be more informative than common non-IID metrics (Hellinger, Jensen-Shannon, and Earth Mover's distance). Using PSI features, we form distributionally homogeneous groups of clients via K-means++; the number of optimal clusters is chosen by a systematic silhouette-based procedure, typically yielding few clusters with modest overhead. Across six datasets (tabular, image, and text modalities), two partition protocols (Dirichlet with parameter $α$ and Similarity with parameter S), and multiple client sizes, Clust-PSI-PFL delivers up to 18% higher global accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines and markedly improves client fairness by a relative improvement of 37% under severe non-IID data. These results establish PSI-guided clustering as a principled, lightweight mechanism for robust PFL under label skew."

This yields an exact linear bound on geometric operator evolution, independent of higher Lanczos coefficients and valid for arbitrary Hamiltonians, integrable or chaotic.

    "abstract": "In many applications of biotechnology, measurements are available at different sampling rates, e.g., due to online sensors and offline lab analysis. Offline measurements typically involve time delays that may be unknown a priori due to the underlying laboratory procedures. This multirate (MR) setting poses a challenge to Kalman filtering, where conventionally measurement data is assumed to be available on an equidistant time grid and without delays. The present study derives the MR version of an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based on sample state augmentation, and applies it to the anaerobic digestion (AD) process in a simulative agricultural setting. The performance of the MR-EKF is investigated for various scenarios, i.e., varying delay lengths, measurement noise levels, plant-model mismatch (PMM), and initial state error. Provided with an adequate tuning, the MR-EKF could be demonstrated to reliably estimate the process state, to appropriately fuse delayed offline measurements, and to smooth noisy online measurements well. Because of the sample state augmentation approach, the delay length of offline measurements does not critically impair state estimation performance, provided observability is not lost during the delays. Poor state initialization and PMM affect convergence more than measurement noise levels. Further, selecting an appropriate tuning was found to be critically important for successful application of the MR-EKF, for which a systematic approach is presented. This study provides implementation guidance for practitioners aiming at successfully applying state estimation for multirate systems. It thereby contributes to develop demand-driven operation of biogas plants, which may aid in stabilizing a renewable electricity grid."

Here we introduce Field-Space attention, a mechanism for Earth system Transformers that computes attention in the physical domain rather than in a learned latent space. By maintaining all intermediate representations as continuous fields on the sphere, the architecture enables interpretable internal states and facilitates the enforcement of scientific constraints. The model employs a fixed, non-learned multiscale decomposition and learns structure-preserving deformations of the input field, allowing coherent integration of coarse and fine-scale information while avoiding the optimization instabilities characteristic of standard single-scale Vision Transformers. Applied to global temperature super-resolution on a HEALPix grid, Field-Space Transformers converge more rapidly and stably than conventional Vision Transformers and U-Net baselines, while requiring substantially fewer parameters. The explicit preservation of field structure throughout the network allows physical and statistical priors to be embedded directly into the architecture, yielding improved fidelity and reliability in data-driven Earth system modeling. These results position Field-Space Attention as a compact, interpretable, and physically grounded building block for next-generation Earth system prediction and generative modeling frameworks."

Herein, we introduce SynCraft, a reasoning-based framework that reframes synthesizability optimization not as a sequence translation task, but as a precise structural editing problem. Leveraging the emergent reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models, SynCraft navigates the \"synthesis cliff\" where minimal structural modifications yield significant gains in synthetic feasibility. By predicting executable sequences of atom-level edits rather than generating SMILES strings directly, SynCraft circumvents the syntactic fragility of LLMs while harnessing their chemical intuition. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that SynCraft outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating synthesizable analogs with high structural fidelity. Furthermore, through interaction-aware prompting, SynCraft successfully replicates expert medicinal chemistry intuition in editing PLK1 inhibitors and rescuing high-scoring but previously discarded RIPK1 candidates in previous molecular generation literatures."

This construction applies to generic spacetimes in arbitrary dimensions and unifies the realizations of supertranslations at null infinity and black hole horizons. The associated symmetry algebra can be realized by light-ray operators defined on the null hypersurface. Within this framework, the gravitational wave memory effect corresponds to a shift of null hypersurfaces in the bulk. As explicit examples, we compute bulk supertranslations in Minkowski spacetime in arbitrary dimensions and in four-dimensional Schwarzschild spacetime, where we uncover a novel curvature-induced memory effect with observable consequences for light propagation."

    "abstract": "The goal of this paper is to provide a new perspective on speech modeling by incorporating perceptual invariances such as amplitude scaling and temporal shifts. Conventional generative formulations often treat each dataset sample as a fixed representative of the target distribution. From a generative standpoint, however, such samples are only one among many perceptually equivalent variants within the true speech distribution. To address this, we propose Linear Projection Conditional Flow Matching (LP-CFM), which models targets as projection-aligned elongated Gaussians along perceptually equivalent variants. We further introduce Vector Calibrated Sampling (VCS) to keep the sampling process aligned with the line-projection path. In neural vocoding experiments across model sizes, data scales, and sampling steps, the proposed approach consistently improves over the conventional optimal transport CFM, with particularly strong gains in low-resource and few-step scenarios. These results highlight the potential of LP-CFM and VCS to provide more robust and perceptually grounded generative modeling of speech."

One important property any such generalization should fulfill is consistency with the classical formulation for a class of spacetimes as large as possible.

We propose CDSP-MoE (Conflict-Driven Subspace Pruning MoE), a framework that addresses these issues through a paradigm shift from isolated expert containers to dynamic expert instantiation within a shared physical subspace. Grounded in the Universal Weight Subspace Hypothesis, CDSP-MoE maintains a super-complete parameter backbone where logical experts are carved out via learnable topology masks. Unlike prior work that uses gradient conflict for token reassignment or optimization surgery, we leverage it as a structural supervisory signal: a Lagged Gradient Game penalizes interfering connections in the shared manifold, enabling the topology to spontaneously prune conflicting pathways and evolve interpretable modular structures. Experimental results demonstrate that CDSP-MoE achieves robust content-driven routing without human-defined task labels, maintaining semantic specialization even under strict blind inference protocols where explicit instructions are absent.

Recent advances suggest that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) offer a promising solution to learning the complex path distributions induced by SDEs. However, a critical bottleneck lies in designing a discriminator that faithfully captures temporal dependencies while remaining computationally efficient. Prior works have explored Neural Controlled Differential Equations (CDEs) as discriminators due to their ability to model continuous-time dynamics, but such architectures suffer from high computational costs and exacerbate the instability of adversarial training. To address these limitations, we introduce HGAN-SDEs, a novel GAN-based framework that leverages Neural Hermite functions to construct a structured and efficient discriminator. Hermite functions provide an expressive yet lightweight basis for approximating path-level dynamics, enabling both reduced runtime complexity and improved training stability. We establish the universal approximation property of our framework for a broad class of SDE-driven distributions and theoretically characterize its convergence behavior. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world systems demonstrate that HGAN-SDEs achieve superior sample quality and learning efficiency compared to existing generative models for SDEs"

We investigate two classic scenarios proposed in the literature, namely, Friends Appreciation ($\\mathsf{FA}$) and Enemies Aversion ($\\mathsf{EA}$): in the former, each agent primarily cares about the number of friends in her coalition, breaking ties based on the number of enemies, while in the latter, the opposite is true. For $\\mathsf{EA}$, we show that our objective is hard to approximate within $O(n^{1-ε})$, for any fixed $ε>0$, and provide a polynomial-time $(n-1)$-approximation. For $\\mathsf{FA}$, we obtain an NP-hardness result and a polynomial-time approximation algorithm. Our algorithm achieves a ratio of $2-Θ(\\frac{1}{n})$ when every agent has at least two friends; however, if some agent has at most one friend, its approximation ratio deteriorates to $n/2$. We recover the $2-Θ(\\frac{1}{n})$ approximation ratio for two important variants: when randomization is allowed and when the friendship relationship is symmetric.

Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias. By jointly exploiting the supervision signals from both the pseudo masks and scribble semantics, ${D}^{3}$ETOR significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks."

Recently, such techniques have been increasingly employed to distort narratives of important events and to spread misinformation on social media, prompting the development of misinformation detectors. In the context of misinformation conveyed through image-text pairs, several detection methods have been proposed. However, these approaches typically rely on computationally intensive architectures or require large amounts of annotated data. In this work we introduce LADLE-MM: Limited Annotation based Detector with Learned Ensembles for Multimodal Misinformation, a model-soup initialized multimodal misinformation detector designed to operate under a limited annotation setup and constrained training resources. LADLE-MM is composed of two unimodal branches and a third multimodal one that enhances image and text representations with additional multimodal embeddings extracted from BLIP, serving as fixed reference space. Despite using 60.3% fewer trainable parameters than previous state-of-the-art models, LADLE-MM achieves competitive performance on both binary and multi-label classification tasks on the DGM4 benchmark, outperforming existing methods when trained without grounding annotations. Moreover, when evaluated on the VERITE dataset, LADLE-MM outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches that utilize more complex architectures involving Large Vision-Language-Models, demonstrating the effective generalization ability in an open-set setting and strong robustness to unimodal bias."

In these settings, the local geometric tensor diverges, rendering standard invariants ill-defined and causing perturbative predictions to deviate from reality by order unity ($\\sim 100\\%$). We resolve this crisis by introducing the \\textbf{Floquet-Monodromy Spectroscopy (FMS)} protocol, a pulse-level control sequence, which experimentally extracts the hidden \\textit{Stokes Phenomenon} -- the \"missing\" geometric data that completes the topological description. By mapping the singularity's Stokes multipliers to time-domain observables, FMS provides a rigorous experimental bridge to \\textbf{Resurgence Theory}, allowing for the exact reconstruction of non-perturbative physics from divergent asymptotic series.

    "abstract": "Multimodal brain decoding aims to reconstruct semantic information that is consistent with visual stimuli from brain activity signals such as fMRI, and then generate readable natural language descriptions. However, multimodal brain decoding still faces key challenges in cross-subject generalization and interpretability. We propose a BrainROI model and achieve leading-level results in brain-captioning evaluation on the NSD dataset. Under the cross-subject setting, compared with recent state-of-the-art methods and representative baselines, metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr show clear improvements. Firstly, to address the heterogeneity of functional brain topology across subjects, we design a new fMRI encoder. We use multi-atlas soft functional parcellations (soft-ROI) as a shared space. We extend the discrete ROI Concatenation strategy in MINDLLM to a voxel-wise gated fusion mechanism (Voxel-gate). We also ensure consistent ROI mapping through global label alignment, which enhances cross-subject transferability. Secondly, to overcome the limitations of manual and black-box prompting methods in stability and transparency, we introduce an interpretable prompt optimization process. In a small-sample closed loop, we use a locally deployed Qwen model to iteratively generate and select human-readable prompts. This process improves the stability of prompt design and preserves an auditable optimization trajectory. Finally, we impose parameterized decoding constraints during inference to further improve the stability and quality of the generated descriptions."

All the films exhibit metallic behavior in the normal state and a superconducting transition at low temperatures, where the superconducting transition temperature is tunable between 4.77 K and 5.73 K. Hall measurements on the films reveal that the under-layer strongly affects the charge carrier type and density, leading to a correlation between increasing carrier concentration and decreasing TC. The Si under-layer introduces the highest disorder yet yields the highest TC, indicating that in the Ti40V60 alloys, moderate disorder suppresses the spin-fluctuations induced pair breaking, thereby enhancing the superconductivity. The comparable TC of the V under-layer and pristine films without under-layer, along with a coherence length (~6.2 nm) much smaller than the film thickness (25 nm), confirms the absence of any significant proximity effects. These findings demonstrate that under-layer engineering provides an effective route to tune the superconducting properties of Ti-V alloy thin films."

    "abstract": "The discovery of ordered magnetism in two-dimensional van der Waals materials at the monolayer limit challenges the Mermin-Wagner theorem, which forbids spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetries in two dimensions at finite temperatures. The persistence of static magnetism in low-dimensions is fundamentally influenced by magnetic anisotropy and the local single-ion crystalline electric field. Crucially, spin-orbit coupling connects the structural properties with spin degrees of freedom. We investigate the magnetic single-ion properties in the van der Waals magnet VI$_3$. Utilizing neutron and x-ray diffraction, we map out the symmetry breaking phase transitions and argue for a single structural transition at T$_S \\sim$ 80 K, driven by an orbital degeneracy, followed by a ferromagnetic transition at a lower temperature, T$_C \\sim$ 50 K. Through a comparative analysis of samples prepared under varying conditions, we suggest that lower temperature transitions reported near $\\sim$ 30 K are not intrinsic to VI$_{3}$. A group theoretical analysis suggests a structural transition from rhombohedral $R\\overline{3}$ to triclinic $P\\overline{1}$ or $P1$. This transition is significant as it suggests the formation of two distinct crystallographyically inequivalent V$^{3+}$ sites, each with distinct spin-orbital properties. Neutron spectroscopy provides evidence for dominant magnetic exchange coupling only between symmetry-equivalent sites in the triclinc unit cell. We suggest this breaks up the low-temperature honeycomb VI$_3$ lattice into two interpenetrating approximately hexagonal planes resulting in a fragmentated honeycomb. Our findings highlight the critical role of magnetoelastic coupling in determining the magnetic and structural phases in two-dimensional van der Waals magnets."

Our assessment utilizes Equation-of-State (EOS) tests to evaluate near-equilibrium properties, such as bulk moduli and equilibrium volumes, alongside extensive Minima Hopping (MH) structural searches to probe the global Potential Energy Surface (PES). Here, we assess universality within the fundamental limit of unary (elemental) systems, which serve as a necessary baseline for broader chemical generalization and provide a framework that can be systematically extended to multicomponent materials. We find that while most models exhibit high accuracy in reproducing equilibrium volumes for transition metals, significant performance gaps emerge in alkali and alkaline earth metal groups. Crucially, our MH results reveal a decoupling between search efficiency and structural fidelity, highlighting that smoother learned PESs do not necessarily yield more accurate energetic landscapes."

To systematically explore this vast compositional space, we construct an ensemble of 30 XGBoost regression models trained on a curated dataset of approximately 2000 binary and ternary hydride entries. The model ensemble is used to screen a broad set of A-B-H compositions at pressures of 100, 200, and 300 GPa, with screening outcomes evaluated statistically based on prediction consistency across ensemble members. This analysis highlights several high-scoring compositional systems, including Ca-Ti-H, Li-K-H, and Na-Mg-H, which were not explicitly included in the training dataset. In addition, feature-importance analysis indicates that elemental properties such as ionization energy and atomic radius contribute significantly to the learned composition-level trends in superconducting transition temperature.

    "abstract": "3D object detection is fundamental for safe and robust intelligent transportation systems. Current multi-modal 3D object detectors often rely on complex architectures and training strategies to achieve higher detection accuracy. However, these methods heavily rely on the LiDAR sensor so that they suffer from large performance drops when LiDAR is absent, which compromises the robustness and safety of autonomous systems in practical scenarios. Moreover, existing multi-modal detectors face difficulties in deployment on diverse hardware platforms, such as NPUs and FPGAs, due to their reliance on 3D sparse convolution operators, which are primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs. To address these challenges, we reconsider the role of LiDAR in the camera-LiDAR fusion paradigm and introduce a novel multi-modal 3D detector, LiteFusion. Instead of treating LiDAR point clouds as an independent modality with a separate feature extraction backbone, LiteFusion utilizes LiDAR data as a complementary source of geometric information to enhance camera-based detection. This straightforward approach completely eliminates the reliance on a 3D backbone, making the method highly deployment-friendly. Specifically, LiteFusion integrates complementary features from LiDAR points into image features within a quaternion space, where the orthogonal constraints are well-preserved during network training. This helps model domain-specific relations across modalities, yielding a compact cross-modal embedding. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that LiteFusion improves the baseline vision-based detector by +20.4% mAP and +19.7% NDS with a minimal increase in parameters (1.1%) without using dedicated LiDAR encoders. Notably, even in the absence of LiDAR input, LiteFusion maintains strong results , highlighting its favorable robustness and effectiveness across diverse fusion paradigms and deployment scenarios."

    "abstract": "Speech processing and translation technology have the potential to facilitate meetings of individuals who do not share any common language. To evaluate automatic systems for such a task, a versatile and realistic evaluation corpus is needed. Therefore, we create and present a corpus of cross-lingual dialogues between individuals without a common language who were facilitated by automatic simultaneous speech translation. The corpus consists of 5 hours of speech recordings with ASR and gold transcripts in 12 original languages and automatic and corrected translations into English. For the purposes of research into cross-lingual summarization, our corpus also includes written summaries (minutes) of the meetings. Moreover, we propose automatic detection of misunderstandings. For an overview of this task and its complexity, we attempt to quantify misunderstandings in cross-lingual meetings. We annotate misunderstandings manually and also test the ability of current large language models to detect them automatically. The results show that the Gemini model is able to identify text spans with misunderstandings with recall of 77% and precision of 47%."

    "abstract": "Spin-active colour centres in 4H silicon carbide are promising candidates as building blocks for quantum information applications. To increase the photon count rate of the emitters at low temperatures, the colour centres must be integrated into nanophotonic structures and characterised under cryogenic conditions. Here, we design and fabricate waveguide structures attached with an efficient Dinosaur photonic crystal reflector at one side. The devices show broadband reflection over a range of 60 THz with a peak reflectance above 80 %. Additionally, colour centres were integrated into these structures and characterised at cryogenic conditions. The emission was collected by a tapered-waveguide-tapered-fibre interface. Although the spectral stability of the emitters must be further improved for high excitation powers, the saturation intensity in standard PLE measurements is about 104 kcps. The count rate can be further improved to about 125 kcps with a charge-resonance check measurement scheme. To highlight the relevance of our devices, we theoretically show that these count rates enable optical single-shot readout with a fidelity exceeding 98 %."

    "abstract": "Most existing image compression approaches perform transform coding in the pixel space to reduce its spatial redundancy. However, they encounter difficulties in achieving both high-realism and high-fidelity at low bitrate, as the pixel-space distortion may not align with human perception. To address this issue, we introduce a Generative Latent Coding (GLC) architecture, which performs transform coding in the latent space of a generative vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE), instead of in the pixel space. The generative latent space is characterized by greater sparsity, richer semantic and better alignment with human perception, rendering it advantageous for achieving high-realism and high-fidelity compression. Additionally, we introduce a categorical hyper module to reduce the bit cost of hyper-information, and a code-prediction-based supervision to enhance the semantic consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our GLC maintains high visual quality with less than 0.04 bpp on natural images and less than 0.01 bpp on facial images. On the CLIC2020 test set, we achieve the same FID as MS-ILLM with 45% fewer bits. Furthermore, the powerful generative latent space enables various applications built on our GLC pipeline, such as image restoration and style transfer. The code is available at https://github.com/jzyustc/GLC."

We formalize reasoning as a latent variable model and derive an expectation-maximization (EM) objective for learning to reason. This view connects EM and modern reward-based optimization, and shows that the main challenge lies in designing a sampling distribution that generates rationales that justify correct answers. We instantiate and compare several sampling schemes: rejection sampling with a budget, self-taught reasoner (STaR), and prompt posterior sampling (PPS), which only keeps the rationalization stage of STaR. Our experiments on the ARC, MMLU, and OpenBookQA datasets with the Llama and Qwen models show that the sampling scheme can significantly affect the accuracy of learned reasoning models. Despite its simplicity, we observe that PPS outperforms the other sampling schemes."

Notably, while defenses may exist for mature domains such as code review, they are often absent in other common applications such as resume screening and peer review. This paper introduces a benchmark to assess this vulnerability in resume screening, revealing attack success rates exceeding 80% for certain attack types. We evaluate two defense mechanisms: prompt-based defenses achieve 10.1% attack reduction with 12.5% false rejection increase, while our proposed FIDS (Foreign Instruction Detection through Separation) using LoRA adaptation achieves 15.4% attack reduction with 10.4% false rejection increase. The combined approach provides 26.3% attack reduction, demonstrating that training-time defenses outperform inference-time mitigations in both security and utility preservation."

Although Si/SiGe heterostructures are commonly used to host spin qubits due to their high mobility and low percolation density, the SiGe spacer creates a gap between the qubits and control electrodes, which limits the ability to tune exchange coupling. As a result, residual coupling leads to unwanted single-qubit phase shifts, making multi-qubit control more difficult. In this work, we explore swapping the roles of overlapping nanogates to overcome this issue. By reconfiguring the gate voltages, we demonstrate in situ role switching while maintaining multi-qubit control. Additionally, this method significantly improves the tunability of exchange coupling by several orders of magnitude over the traditional approach. This strategy reduces unintended single-qubit phase shifts and minimizes the complexity of multi-qubit control, supporting scalable growth with minimal experimental overhead."

This paper bridges that gap by developing mathematically certified, goal-oriented a posteriori defeaturing error estimators for Poisson's equation, linear elasticity, and Stokes flow. First, we derive new reliable energy-norm estimators for features subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions in linear elasticity and Stokes flow, based on existing results for Poisson's equation. Second, we formulate general energy-norm estimators for multiple negative features, subject to either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions for the first time. Finally, we combine these estimators with the dual-weighted residual (DWR) method to obtain reliable estimates for linear QoIs and demonstrate their effectiveness across a range of numerical experiments."

Analytic continuation of this dispersion relation to $ν= -1$ yields a formal zero-frequency endpoint where $j_{-1}(x) = \\cos x / x$ admits the root $x = 0$. We examine this limit in detail, showing that while the mathematics is well-defined, the endpoint does not correspond to a physical electromagnetic mode. The positivity of the angular Sturm-Liouville operator restricts physical eigenvalues to $ν\\geq 0$, placing $ν= -1$ outside the admissible spectrum. We demonstrate that all electromagnetic field components vanish in this limit, even though the underlying Debye potential $Π= \\cos(kr)/kr$ remains non-trivial and exhibits a monopole-type singularity at the origin. This distinction between potential and field reflects the kernel structure of the curl-curl operator for spherically symmetric configurations. The analysis clarifies the boundary between propagating electromagnetic modes and static field configurations in spherical geometry, connecting the formal endpoint to longstanding questions about mode counting in cavity quantization."

By mapping the ladder onto two decoupled non-Hermitian Su--Schrieffer--Heeger (SSH) chains, we uncover a rich structure in parameter space under different boundary conditions. Under periodic boundary conditions, the spectrum admits a fine-tuned line in parameter space with entirely real eigenvalues, while deviations from this line induce a real--complex spectral transition without crossing exceptional points. In contrast, an exact analytical diagonalization under open boundary conditions reveals extended regions in parameter space with purely real or purely imaginary spectra, separated from complex spectral domains by exceptional lines. The intersections of these exceptional lines define triple-junction points where distinct spectral regimes meet, giving rise to a structured phase diagram that is absent under periodic boundary conditions. We further show that flat bands in this system can occur both as Hermitian diabolical points and as non-Hermitian exceptional points, known as exceptional flat bands, where the dynamics is more stringent than in the Hermitian case, leading to distinct spectral and dynamical signatures."

Inspired by FedPIDAvg, we define a round-wise task for FedPOD to enhance training efficiency. FedPIDAvg achieved performance improvement by incorporating the training loss reduction for prediction entropy as weights using differential terms. Furthermore, by modeling data distribution with a Poisson distribution and using a PID controller, it reduced communication costs even in skewed data distribution. However, excluding participants classified as outliers based on the Poisson distribution can limit data utilization. Additionally, PID controller requires the same participants to be maintained throughout the federated learning process as it uses previous rounds' learning information in the current round. In our approach, FedPOD addresses these issues by including participants excluded as outliers, eliminating dependency on previous rounds' learning information, and applying a method for calculating validation loss at each round. In this challenge, FedPOD presents comparable performance to FedPIDAvg in metrics of Dice score, 0.78, 0.71 and 0.72 for WT, ET and TC in average, and projected convergence score, 0.74 in average. Furthermore, the concept of FedPOD draws inspiration from Kubernetes' smallest computing unit, POD, designed to be compatible with Kubernetes auto-scaling. Extending round-wise tasks of FedPOD to POD units allows flexible design by applying scale-out similar to Kubernetes' auto-scaling. This work demonstrated the potentials of FedPOD to enhance federated learning by improving efficiency, flexibility, and performance in metrics."

Despite being widely observed across architectures, existing theoretical treatments lack a unifying framework. We present a theoretical framework that explains a simplicity bias arising from saddle-to-saddle learning dynamics for a general class of neural networks, incorporating fully-connected, convolutional, and attention-based architectures. Here, simple means expressible with few hidden units, i.e., hidden neurons, convolutional kernels, or attention heads. Specifically, we show that linear networks learn solutions of increasing rank, ReLU networks learn solutions with an increasing number of kinks, convolutional networks learn solutions with an increasing number of convolutional kernels, and self-attention models learn solutions with an increasing number of attention heads. By analyzing fixed points, invariant manifolds, and dynamics of gradient descent learning, we show that saddle-to-saddle dynamics operates by iteratively evolving near an invariant manifold, approaching a saddle, and switching to another invariant manifold. Our analysis also illuminates the effects of data distribution and weight initialization on the duration and number of plateaus in learning, dissociating previously confounding factors. Overall, our theory offers a framework for understanding when and why gradient descent progressively learns increasingly complex solutions."

We propose DiTracker, which adapts video DiTs through: (1) query-key attention matching, (2) lightweight LoRA tuning, and (3) cost fusion with a ResNet backbone. Despite training with 8 times smaller batch size, DiTracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging ITTO benchmark and matches or outperforms state-of-the-art models on TAP-Vid benchmarks.

By considering the superposition of degenerate modes, we further examine their angular sensitivity. In addition, we calculate the response of a spherical cavity to non-monochromatic GWs emitted by primordial black hole mergers. We find that, for transient signals, a high quality factor with $Q \\gtrsim 10^5$ does not necessarily enhance experimental sensitivity. In fact, even in the most optimistic scenario, only mergers within the solar system yield an observable energy deposit in the cavity."

We developed SAGE (Secure Agent for Generative Dose Expertise), an LLM-based planning agent for automated SRS treatment planning. Two variants generated plans for each case: one using a non-reasoning model, one using a reasoning model. The reasoning variant showed comparable plan dosimetry relative to human planners on primary endpoints (PTV coverage, maximum dose, conformity index, gradient index; all p > 0.21) while reducing cochlear dose below human baselines (p = 0.022). When prompted to improve conformity, the reasoning model demonstrated systematic planning behaviors including prospective constraint verification (457 instances) and trade-off deliberation (609 instances), while the standard model exhibited none of these deliberative processes (0 and 7 instances, respectively). Content analysis revealed that constraint verification and causal explanation concentrated in the reasoning agent.

We extend the applicability of the method to binaries in eccentric orbits. Considering simulated signals of varying masses, spins, and signal strengths, we demonstrate how the systematic errors resulting from neglecting orbital eccentricity compare with the statistical errors, using a semi-analytic Fisher matrix-based formalism that accounts for both current and future detectors. Further, we quantify the systematic errors by developing a Bayesian inference framework for the current detector network. The inspiral-only aligned spin gravitational wave waveform model for eccentric binaries, TaylorF2Ecc, is employed. For the current detector network, neglecting an initial eccentricity of $e_0^{\\rm inj}=0.1$ defined at $20\\,\\mathrm {Hz} $ can lead to a serious bias in binary parameter inference. Notably, a nearly equal-mass, moderately spinning binary black hole in an eccentric orbit can be identified as a non-black hole binary with extreme spins and asymmetric masses. We demonstrate the criticality of biased estimates that may arise when neglecting the orbital eccentricity while performing tests of black hole nature and discuss prospects."

Under softmax parametrisation, and also with and without entropy regularisation, we prove that PePG converges to performatively optimal policies, i.e. policies that remain optimal under the distribution shifts induced by themselves. Thus, PePG significantly extends the prior works in Performative RL that achieves performative stability but not optimality. Furthermore, our empirical analysis on standard performative RL environments validate that PePG outperforms standard policy gradient algorithms and the existing performative RL algorithms aiming for stability."

    "abstract": "We present a string theory construction in which the particle physics contributions to the one-loop vacuum energy exactly cancel, whilst the gravitational contributions are suppressed in the size of one or two large extra dimensions. This provides an ultraviolet realisation of the Dark Dimension and Supersymmetric Large Extra Dimensions scenarios, with, moreover, an explanation as to why the Standard Model contributions to the vacuum energy cancel without the need of eV mass-splittings. Gravity propagates in micron sized dark dimension(s), whilst the visible and hidden sectors are supported on D-branes. Supersymmetry is broken in the dark dimension(s) à la Scherk-Schwarz, whereas supersymmetry is broken at the string scale, à la Brane Supersymmetry Breaking, in the D-branes sector, without inducing tadpoles. Vacuum energy from the visible sector is cancelled by the vacuum energy of the hidden sector branes. We also discuss moduli stabilization in this set-up, finding that the interplay between the Scherk-Schwarz one-loop contribution and non-perturbative effects can fix the size of the dark dimension(s) to be exponentially large in the inverse string-coupling, leading to an exponentially small total vacuum energy, with all moduli stabilised in a dS saddle."

    "abstract": "Simulators can generate virtually unlimited driving data, yet imitation learning policies in simulation still struggle to achieve robust closed-loop performance. Motivated by this gap, we empirically study how misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-based student observations can limit the effectiveness of imitation learning. More precisely, experts have significantly higher visibility (e.g., ignoring occlusions) and far lower uncertainty (e.g., knowing other vehicles' actions), making them difficult to imitate reliably. Furthermore, navigational intent (i.e., the route to follow) is under-specified in student models at test time via only a single target point. We demonstrate that these asymmetries can measurably limit driving performance in CARLA and offer practical interventions to address them. After careful modifications to narrow the gaps between expert and student, our TransFuser v6 (TFv6) student policy achieves a new state of the art on all major publicly available CARLA closed-loop benchmarks, reaching 95 DS on Bench2Drive and more than doubling prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13. Additionally, by integrating perception supervision from our dataset into a shared sim-to-real pipeline, we show consistent gains on the NAVSIM and Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End driving benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Transport properties of strongly correlated materials have contributions from quasiparticle excitations such as electrons and holes as well as emerging collective excitations such as sounds and plasmons which are sustained by interactions. It was previously shown in [Phys. Rev. B 106, 205127] that thermal excitation of the long-lived plasmons in graphene provides a substantial contribution to heat and momentum transport in the interaction-dominated regime. Detailed information on these excitations is therefore necessary for the understanding of hydrodynamic transport with quantitative precision. On the other hand, dynamics of graphene plasmons is usually studied using the perturbation theory within the Dirac-cone approximation, thus neglecting the effects of a finite Brillouin zone and higher-order perturbative corrections. Both these effects can be however significant for strong-interacting systems including free-standing graphene where the effective coupling constant can reach values up to two. Therefore, in this paper, we studied the behavior of plasmons in half-filled free standing graphene using unbiased Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations. We confirm the existence of well-defined resonance peaks for plasmons around the $Γ$ point, report their dispersion and the dependence of their quasiparticle residue on momentum. Comparison with the Random-phase-approximation (RPA) calculation for the Dirac theory shows that strong interactions and finite Brillouin zone effects, automatically taken into account in QMC calculations substantially alter the results. Our findings highlight the need to account for these effects analytically when developing theories of electronic transport in free-standing graphene."

This new term, that is not present in $F(Φ)R$ scalar-tensor theories, cannot in general be written as a spatial temperature gradient, and therefore obstructs a standard Eckart interpretation of the scalar sector for arbitrary timelike scalar configurations. As a result, requiring an Eckart heat flux $q_a = -K\\bigl(D_a T_g + T_g\\, a_a\\bigr)$ for all such configurations is possible if and only if $F_X(Φ,X)\\equiv 0$, i.e.\\ $F(Φ,X)=F(Φ)$, resulting in a theory that is a subclass of Horndeski. Thus, only Jordan--like theories of the type $F(Φ)R+G(Φ,X)$ admit a global Eckart fluid picture of the scalar sector, while models with $F_X\\neq 0$ can recover an Eckart--like form only on highly symmetric backgrounds where the transverse contribution vanishes or collapses to a single gradient direction.

Yet, current CSB implementations encounter fundamental challenges when reconstructing noisy eigenvalues, particularly in the presence of spectral degeneracies and off-diagonal noise components in the target gate's eigenbasis. These issues become especially pronounced in the strong noise regime for gates with fidelities around $90\\%$. To address these limitations, we introduce an extended CSB model together with a fidelity estimate interval (FEI) -- an interval-valued estimate of the target gate fidelity. Numerical simulation demonstrates that FEI remains sufficiently narrow, with its midpoint reliably approximating the true fidelity. We further validate the protocol on a trapped-ion quantum processor by benchmarking two implementations of the three-qubit Toffoli gate. The results reveal a clear advantage of the qutrit-based implementation over its qubit-based counterpart."

    "abstract": "Precision spectroscopy of atomic hydrogen is an important way to test bound-state quantum electrodynamics (QED), one of the building blocks of the Standard Model. In its simplest form, such a test consists of the comparison of a measured transition frequency with its QED prediction, which can be calculated with very high precision for the hydrogen atom. However, these calculations require some input in the form of physical constants, such as the Rydberg constant $R_\\infty$ and the proton charge radius $r_\\mathrm{p}$, both of which are currently determined to a large degree by hydrogen spectroscopy itself. Therefore, the frequency of at least three different transitions needs to be measured in order to test QED. Equivalently, a comparison of the values of $R_\\infty$ and $r_\\mathrm{p}$ determined from measurements of different transitions constitutes a test of QED. To this end, laser spectroscopy of optical 2S-$n$P transitions has been performed in this work. As these transitions are one-photon transitions, they are affected by a different set of systematic effects than the two-photon transitions on which most other spectroscopic measurements of hydrogen are based. In order to contribute to the test of QED, their transition frequencies must be determined with a relative uncertainty on the order of one part in $10^{12}$, corresponding to approximately 1 kHz in absolute terms. This is in turn approximately a factor of 10000 smaller than the relatively broad natural linewidth of the 2S-$n$P transitions, and a successful measurement requires both a very large experimental signal-to-noise ratio and a detailed theoretical understanding of the line shape of the observed resonance. The 2S-$n$P transitions were probed on a cryogenic beam of hydrogen atoms, which were optically excited to the metastable 2S level. The atomic beam was crossed at right angles with counter-propagating spectroscopy laser beams, which further excited the atoms to the $n$P level. The fluorescence from the subsequent rapid spontaneous decay served as experimental signal. The excitation with two counter-propagating beams led to two Doppler shifts of equal magnitude, but opposite sign, which thus canceled each other out. A velocity-resolved detection was used to determine any residual Doppler shifts, which could be excluded within the measurement uncertainty for both of the measurements discussed below. In a first experiment, the 2S-4P transition was probed. Quantum interference of neighboring atomic resonances produced subtle distortions of the line shape, which were found to be significant because of the very large resolution relative to the linewidth. The line shifts caused by the distortions were directly observed and could be removed by use of a line shape model based on perturbative calculations. With this, the transition frequency was determined with a relative uncertainty of 4 parts in $10^{12}$. In combination with the very precisely measured 1S-2S transition frequency, this allowed the, at the time, most precise determination of $R_\\infty$ and $r_\\mathrm{p}$ from atomic hydrogen. Moreover, good agreement was found with the much more precise value of $r_\\mathrm{p}$ extracted from spectroscopy of muonic hydrogen, which had been in significant disagreement with previous data from (electronic) hydrogen, causing concern about the validity of QED. This result has since been confirmed by other experiments. The 2S-4P measurement is treated in the appendix of this thesis. The 2S-4P measurement, despite its large signal-to-noise ratio, was limited by counting statistics. To improve precision, a transition with a narrower linewidth and an improved experimental signal was necessary. Hence, the study of the 2S-6P transition, which offers a three times smaller natural linewidth, was begun. The atomic beam apparatus was upgraded, resulting in a corresponding decrease of the experimentally observed linewidth, and a close to an order of magnitude larger flux of atoms in the low-velocity tail of the atomic beam. Together with a detector redesign, this led to an up to 16 times larger signal than for the 2S-4P measurement, opening the path to increased precision. The Doppler-shift suppression was also rebuilt to support such precision, including a fiber collimator developed for this purpose, which provides high-quality spectroscopy beams at the new transition wavelength of 410 nm. This enabled a measurement of the 2S-6P transition frequency with a statistical uncertainty of 430 Hz, five times lower than for the 2S-4P measurement and corresponding to a suppression of the Doppler shift by six orders of magnitude. At this level of precision, the light force shift from the diffraction of atoms at the light grating formed by the counter-propagating spectroscopy beams becomes significant. This light force shift was directly observed for the first time for the 2S-$n$P transitions and found to be well-described by a model derived for this purpose. The size of all other systematic effects, except the very precisely known recoil shift, is estimated to be below 500 Hz each. The blind data analysis is ongoing at the time of writing and thus no transition frequencies can yet be given. However, a preliminary analysis suggests a five-fold improvement in the determination of $R_\\infty$ and $r_\\mathrm{p}$ as compared to the 2S-4P measurement, and a two-fold improvement over the currently most precise determination from atomic hydrogen. This places the uncertainty of the determined value of $r_\\mathrm{p}$ within a factor of five of that of the muonic value. The 2S-6P measurement is treated in the main text of this thesis."

Existing approaches often struggle with motion fidelity and spatiotemporal coherence in challenging settings involving fast motion, multi-object interaction, occlusion, and rapid scene changes. SirenPose incorporates physics inspired constraints to enforce coherent keypoint predictions across both spatial and temporal dimensions, while leveraging high frequency signal modeling to capture fine grained geometric details. We further expand the UniKPT dataset to 600,000 annotated instances and integrate graph neural networks to model keypoint relationships and structural correlations. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including Sintel, Bonn, and DAVIS demonstrate that SirenPose consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. On DAVIS, SirenPose achieves a 17.8 percent reduction in FVD, a 28.7 percent reduction in FID, and a 6.0 percent improvement in LPIPS compared to MoSCA. It also improves temporal consistency, geometric accuracy, user score, and motion smoothness. In pose estimation, SirenPose outperforms Monst3R with lower absolute trajectory error as well as reduced translational and rotational relative pose error, highlighting its effectiveness in handling rapid motion, complex dynamics, and physically plausible reconstruction."

The technique has also opened up a new dimension for cryo-EM sample preparation, making it possible to deposit compounds onto a cryo-EM sample while it is frozen, so that upon flash melting, the embedded particles experience an altered environment. For example, we have recently shown that depositing ultrathin silicon dioxide membranes onto a cryo-EM sample causes particles to detach from the interface upon flash melting, removing preferred particle orientation. These experiments also point towards a new strategy for initiating protein dynamics in time resolved experiments by depositing reagents, which will then mix with the sample upon flash melting. Here, we describe an apparatus for physical vapor deposition of compounds onto cryo-EM samples, detailing its design and operation. As a demonstration, we determine that the minimum thickness of silicon dioxide sealing membranes in a laser flash melting experiment is just over two monolayers. We propose that our design can form the basis for an integrated platform for microsecond time-resolved cryo-EM experiments."

The mapping enables us to use analytical results from classical active matter to derive an approximate non-equilibrium steady-state (NESS) distribution for the monitored quantum system. The competition between the coherent Rabi drive and the measurement-induced feedback leads to a rich NESS phase displaying Zeno--anti-Zeno transition--which is statistically equivalent to the propulsion-induced trapping observed in confined active particles."

Both models face challenges, including explaining the nature of dark matter, the origin of the Universe's initial conditions, and the fine-tuning of the Higgs boson mass. This thesis investigates the cosmological implications of spontaneous symmetry breaking to address some of these issues, focusing on theories with a non-trivial vacuum structure. We introduce a novel class of elementary scalars called ''accidents'', which emerge as accidentally flat directions in the vacuum manifold: unlike Nambu-Goldstone boson directions, accident directions are not related to any symmetry. Radiative corrections induce a mass for the accidents that is one-loop suppressed with respect to naive expectations, making them naturally light. We propose that accidents can act as viable dark matter candidates, and as the inflaton driving cosmic inflation. We construct a model of hybrid inflation in which the inflaton potential is an accident direction and is naturally flat. In models of accident inflation where the vacuum manifold has a non-trivial topology, cosmic strings and domain walls form after the end of inflation. Such topological defects generate a stochastic background of gravitational waves. Finally, we investigate the cosmological production of dark magnetic monopoles. Focusing on 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles from SO(3)$\\rightarrow$SO(2) symmetry breaking, we explore both second-order and first-order phase transitions, and we identify the regions of parameter space where the monopole relic density matches the one of dark matter. This model also features stable massive gauge bosons. We find that the relic density of dark gauge bosons is always far larger than the one of monopoles, concluding that dark monopoles cannot constitute a sizeable fraction of dark matter."

    "abstract": "3D image display is essential for next-generation volumetric imaging; however, dense depth multiplexing for 3D image projection remains challenging because diffraction-induced cross-talk rapidly increases as the axial image planes get closer. Here, we introduce a 3D display system comprising a digital encoder and a diffractive optical decoder, which simultaneously projects different images onto multiple target axial planes with high axial resolution. By leveraging multi-layer diffractive wavefront decoding and deep learning-based end-to-end optimization, the system achieves high-fidelity depth-resolved 3D image projection in a snapshot, enabling axial plane separations on the order of a wavelength. The digital encoder leverages a Fourier encoder network to capture multi-scale spatial and frequency-domain features from input images, integrates axial position encoding, and generates a unified phase representation that simultaneously encodes all images to be axially projected in a single snapshot through a jointly-optimized diffractive decoder. We characterized the impact of diffractive decoder depth, output diffraction efficiency, spatial light modulator resolution, and axial encoding density, revealing trade-offs that govern axial separation and 3D image projection quality. We further demonstrated the capability to display volumetric images containing 28 axial slices, as well as the ability to dynamically reconfigure the axial locations of the image planes, performed on demand. Finally, we experimentally validated the presented approach, demonstrating close agreement between the measured results and the target images. These results establish the diffractive 3D display system as a compact and scalable framework for depth-resolved snapshot 3D image projection, with potential applications in holographic displays, AR/VR interfaces, and volumetric optical computing."

    "abstract": "In formal strategic reasoning for Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), agents are typically assumed to (i) employ arbitrarily complex strategies, (ii) execute each move at zero cost, and (iii) operate over fully crisp game structures. These idealized assumptions stand in stark contrast with human decision making in real world environments. The natural strategies framework along with some of its recent variants, partially addresses this gap by restricting strategies to concise rules guarded by regular expressions. Yet, it still overlook both the cost of each action and the uncertainty that often characterizes human perception of facts over the time. In this work, we introduce HumanATLF, a logic that builds upon natural strategies employing both fuzzy semantics and resource bound actions: each action carries a real valued cost drawn from a non refillable budget, and atomic conditions and goals have degrees in [0,1]. We give a formal syntax and semantics, and prove that model checking is in P when both the strategy complexity k and resource budget b are fixed, NP complete if just one strategic operator over Boolean objectives is allowed, and Delta^P_2 complete when k and b vary. Moreover, we show that recall based strategies can be decided in PSPACE. We implement our algorithms in VITAMIN, an open source model checking tool for MAS and validate them on an adversarial resource aware drone rescue scenario."

To illustrate the new method, we apply it to the two-dimensional Hubbard model on the square lattice at zero temperature. This yields formulas for the Hartree-Fock phase boundaries that agree with, but also improve on, earlier numerical results. In particular, our results provide the first rigorous proof of the existence of mixed phases in this model."

    "abstract": "First-principles based crystal structure prediction (CSP) methods have revealed an essential tool for the discovery of new materials. However, in solids close to displacive phase transitions, which are common in ferroelectrics, thermoelectrics, charge-density wave systems, or superconducting hydrides, the ionic contribution to the free energy and lattice anharmonicity become essential, limiting the capacity of CSP techniques to determine the thermodynamical stability of competing phases. While variational methods like the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA) accurately account for anharmonic lattice dynamics \\emph{ab initio}, their high computational cost makes them impractical for CSP. Machine-learning interatomic potentials offer accelerated sampling of the energy landscape compared to purely first-principles approaches, but their reliance on extensive training data and limited generalization restricts practical applications. Here, we propose an iterative learning framework combining evolutionary algorithms, atomic foundation models, and SSCHA to enable CSP with anharmonic lattice dynamics. Foundation models enable robust relaxations of random structures, drastically reducing required training data. Applied to the highly anharmonic H$_3$S system, our framework achieves good agreement with the benchmarks based on density functional theory, accurately predicting phase stability and vibrational properties from 50 to 200 GPa. Importantly, we find that the statistical averaging in the SSCHA reduces the error in the free energy evaluation, avoiding the need for extremely high accuracy of machine-learning potentials. This approach bridges the gap between data efficiency and predictive power, establishing a practical pathway for CSP with anharmonic lattice dynamics."

Here, a fully organic route to fabricate artificial hyperbolic metamaterials based on multilayered thin films of J-aggregate carbocyanine dyes alternated with polyelectrolytes is introduced. These structures exhibit strong optical anisotropy and experimentally support hyperbolic surface exciton polaritons and, for selected dyes, additional surface waves in near-zero permittivity regimes. Spectroscopic ellipsometry confirms a uniaxial dielectric tensor with negative in-plane and positive out-of-plane components, close to the absorption peaks of the constituent J-aggregates. This anisotropy is preserved across individual layers, demonstrating the robustness of the layer-by-layer approach and enabling the coupling of surface exciton polaritons and near-zero permittivity modes even in films only a few nanometres thick. Transfer-matrix simulations based on the obtained dielectric tensor reproduce the coupling conditions for all thicknesses, validating the optical model. Structural characterization reveals the link between optical anisotropy and supramolecular order, with preferential in-plane molecular orientation and the evolution from discrete nanostructures to continuous films as deposition progresses. These organic hyperbolic metamaterial architectures, associated with narrow excitonic resonances from J-aggregates, offer a unique platform for tailoring emission, energy transport, and exploring polariton dynamics at the nanoscale."

    "abstract": "High-fidelity spectrum cartography is pivotal for spectrum management and wireless situational awareness, yet it remains a challenging ill-posed inverse problem due to the sparsity and irregularity of observations. Furthermore, existing approaches often decouple reconstruction from sensing, lacking a principled mechanism for informative sampling. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a unified diffusion-based Bayesian framework that jointly addresses spectrum reconstruction and active sensing. We formulate the reconstruction task as a conditional generation process driven by a learned diffusion prior. Specifically, we derive tractable, closed-form posterior transition kernels for the reverse diffusion process, which enforce consistency with both linear Gaussian and non-linear quantized measurements. Leveraging the intrinsic probabilistic nature of diffusion models, we further develop an uncertainty-aware active sampling strategy. This strategy quantifies reconstruction uncertainty to adaptively guide sensing agents toward the most informative locations, thereby maximizing spectral efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art interpolation, sparsity-based, and deep learning baselines in terms of reconstruction accuracy, sampling efficiency, and robustness to low-bit quantization."

The system incline to use the conventional evaluation index - Allan deviation (ADEV) to reflect the system stability in order to evaluate the noise level. Whereas, ADEV can only provide numerical expression and lacks the time-frequency details. Therefore, a complete evaluation system is required by the system. In this paper, we present a groundbreaking integration of ADEV and wavelet transformed empirical mode decomposition (EMD-WT), establishing a novel analytical framework that enables simultaneous characterization of noise types and time-frequency domain properties. This synergistic approach achieves unprecedented dual-domain resolution in noise discrimination in frequency transfer systems."

We perform a full calculation of the matrix elements using Monte Carlo integration and analyze the elastic differential cross sections and the total reaction cross sections for p+12C, 4,6He+12C, and 12C+12C collisions. We use the variational Monte Carlo wave functions for 4,6He and 12C obtained by using realistic two- and three-nucleon potentials.

This architectural breakthrough simultaneously enables a much smaller device footprint and an extended low-V$π$ bandwidth, without relying on narrowband resonances. Building on this concept, we experimentally demonstrate both a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) and a cascaded PM, and verify their versatility in finite impulse response (FIR) filtering and optical frequency comb (OFC) generation. The recirculating MZM operates as a 4-tap rectangular-window FIR filter with 110 GHz bandwidth in a compact 2.889$\\times$0.58 mm$^2$ footprint. The cascaded PM achieves a 3.40 GHz low-V$π$ bandwidth, a 110 GHz resonant EO bandwidth, and a V$π$L of 0.7 V$\\cdot$cm, and generates 20 OFC lines under a 33 dBm microwave drive. These results demonstrate, for the first time, a practical and highly efficient non-resonant recirculating modulation platform, laying the groundwork for scalable high-order mode recirculating modulators (RMs) and opening new opportunities in optical communications, sensing, and microwave photonics."

The circuit design utilizes the leakage characterization of Dynamic Random Access Memory(DRAM) for timestamp normalization. Custom interdigitated metal-oxide-metal capacitor (MOMCAP) is used to store the charge and low leakage switch (LL switch) is used to extend the effective charge storage time. The 3DS-ISC architecture integrates sensing, memory, and computation to overcome the memory wall problem, reducing power, latency, and reducing area by 69x, 2.2x and 1.9x, respectively, compared with its 2D counterpart. Moreover, compared to works using a 16-bit SRAM to store timestamps, the ISC analog array can reduce power consumption by three orders of magnitude. In real computer vision (CV) tasks, we applied the spatial-temporal correlation filter (STCF) for denoise, and 3D-ISC achieved almost equivalent accuracy compared to the digital implementation using high precision timestamps. As for the image classification, time-surface constructed by 3D-ISC is used as the input of GoogleNet, achieving 99% on N-MNIST, 85% on N-Caltech101, 78% on CIFAR10-DVS, and 97% on DVS128 Gesture, comparable with state-of-the-art results on each dataset.

We developed the Fisher consistency of our methods at the population level and established their consistency and convergence rates. Both methods are easy to implement numerically: the Tucker-form can be implemented through a sequence of least-squares steps, and the CP-form can be implemented through a sequence of singular value decompositions.

First, a shared video encoder feeds into dual decoders, which jointly predict both Chinese character sequences and their standard Pinyin romanization. The multi-task learning of character and phonetic outputs fosters robust visual-semantic representations. During inference, the text decoder generates multiple candidate transcripts. We construct a prompt by concatenating the Pinyin output with these candidate Chinese sequences and feed it to a large language model to resolve ambiguities and refine the transcription. This provides the LLM with explicit phonetic context to correct homophone-induced errors. Finally, we fine-tune the LLM on synthetic noisy examples: we generate imperfect Pinyin-text pairs from intermediate VALLR-Pin checkpoints using the training data, creating instruction-response pairs for error correction. This endows the LLM with awareness of our model's specific error patterns. In summary, VALLR-Pin synergizes visual features with phonetic and linguistic context to improve Mandarin lip-reading performance."

This variational characterization both recovers several classical results and admits a natural convex reformulation. It arises from an alternative approach that directly connects the $(\\boldsymbolσ,\\mathbf{p})$-spectral problem to a class of convex programs. We then develop and analyze a line search Newton-Noda method (LS-NNM) for computing the positive $(\\boldsymbolσ,\\mathbf{p})$-eigenpair of nonnegative tensors. The proposed method integrates Newton method with Noda iteration. The Newton equation is derived from an equivalent nonlinear system, while the eigenvalue sequence is updated by the strategy of the Noda iteration and its variants. To ensure global convergence, we introduce a positivity-preserving line search procedure based on an equivalent constrained optimization problem. The global and quadratic convergence of LS-NNM are established for the class of $(\\boldsymbolσ,\\mathbf{p})$-spectral problem that admits a unique positive $(\\boldsymbolσ,\\mathbf{p})$-eigenpair, as guaranteed by the Perron-Frobenius theorem. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the performance of LS-NNM."

Our sentiment index, GIFsentiment, is constructed from millions of posts in the Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) on a leading investment social media platform. GIFsentiment correlates with seasonal mood variations and the severity of COVID lockdowns. It is positively associated with contemporaneous market returns and negatively predicts returns for up to four weeks, even after controlling for other sentiment and attention measures. These effects are stronger among portfolios that are more susceptible to mispricing. GIFsentiment positively predicts trading volume, market volatility, and flows toward equity funds and away from debt funds. Our evidence suggests that GIFsentiment is a proxy for misperceptions that are later corrected."

However, their efficacy is often compromised by the prevailing reliance on a single, static graph built from indiscriminate features, hindering the ability to model patient-specific pathological relationships. To this end, the proposed Multi-Activation Plane Interaction Graph Neural Network (MAPI-GNN) reconstructs this single-graph paradigm by learning a multifaceted graph profile from semantically disentangled feature subspaces. The framework first uncovers latent graph-aware patterns via a multi-dimensional discriminator; these patterns then guide the dynamic construction of a stack of activation graphs; and this multifaceted profile is finally aggregated and contextualized by a relational fusion engine for a robust diagnosis. Extensive experiments on two diverse tasks, comprising over 1300 patient samples, demonstrate that MAPI-GNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "The exponential proliferation of mobile devices and data-intensive applications in future wireless networks imposes substantial computational burdens on resource-constrained devices, thereby fostering the emergence of over-the-air computation (AirComp) as a transformative paradigm for edge intelligence.} To enhance the efficiency and scalability of AirComp systems, this paper proposes a comprehensive dual-approach framework that systematically transitions from traditional mathematical optimization to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for resource allocation under execution uncertainty. Specifically, we establish a rigorous system model capturing execution uncertainty via Gamma-distributed computational workloads, resulting in challenging nonlinear optimization problems involving complex Gamma functions. For single-user scenarios, we design advanced block coordinate descent (BCD) and majorization-maximization (MM) algorithms, which yield semi-closed-form solutions with provable performance guarantees. However, conventional optimization approaches become computationally intractable in dynamic multi-user environments due to inter-user interference and resource contention. To this end, we introduce a Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based DRL framework capable of adaptively learning optimal policies through environment interaction. Our dual methodology effectively bridges analytical tractability with adaptive intelligence, leveraging optimization for foundational insight and learning for real-time adaptability. Extensive numerical results corroborate the performance gains achieved via increased edge server density and validate the superiority of our optimization-to-learning paradigm in next-generation AirComp systems."

    "abstract": "Class imbalance is a common challenge in machine learning and data mining, often leading to suboptimal performance in classifiers. While deep learning excels in feature extraction, its performance still deteriorates under imbalanced data. In this work, we propose a novel activation function, named OGAB, designed to alleviate class imbalance in deep learning classifiers. OGAB incorporates orthogonality and group-aware bias learning to enhance feature distinguishability in imbalanced scenarios without explicitly requiring label information. Our key insight is that activation functions can be used to introduce strong inductive biases that can address complex data challenges beyond traditional non-linearity. Our work demonstrates that orthogonal transformations can preserve information about minority classes by maintaining feature independence, thereby preventing the dominance of majority classes in the embedding space. Further, the proposed group-aware bias mechanism automatically identifies data clusters and adjusts embeddings to enhance class separability without the need for explicit supervision. Unlike existing approaches that address class imbalance through preprocessing data modifications or post-processing corrections, our proposed approach tackles class imbalance during the training phase at the embedding learning level, enabling direct integration with the learning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution on both real-world and synthetic imbalanced datasets, showing consistent performance improvements over both traditional and learnable activation functions."

    "abstract": "Diffusion models (DMs) have recently achieved impressive photorealism in image and video generation. However, their application to image animation remains limited, even when trained on large-scale datasets. Two primary challenges contribute to this: the high dimensionality of video signals leads to a scarcity of training data, causing DMs to favor memorization over prompt compliance when generating motion; moreover, DMs struggle to generalize to novel motion patterns not present in the training set, and fine-tuning them to learn such patterns, especially using limited training data, is still under-explored. To address these limitations, we propose Modular Image-to-Video Adapter (MIVA), a lightweight sub-network attachable to a pre-trained DM, each designed to capture a single motion pattern and scalable via parallelization. MIVAs can be efficiently trained on approximately ten samples using a single consumer-grade GPU. At inference time, users can specify motion by selecting one or multiple MIVAs, eliminating the need for prompt engineering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MIVA enables more precise motion control while maintaining, or even surpassing, the generation quality of models trained on significantly larger datasets."

However, existing evaluations fail to address this integration, as they are limited to either disembodied social reasoning (e.g., in text) or socially-agnostic physical tasks. Both approaches fail to assess an agent's ability to integrate and trade off both physical and social constraints within a realistic, embodied context. To address this challenge, we introduce Spatially Situated Social Intelligence Test (S$^{3}$IT), a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate embodied social intelligence. It is centered on a novel and challenging seat-ordering task, requiring an agent to arrange seating in a 3D environment for a group of large language model-driven (LLM-driven) NPCs with diverse identities, preferences, and intricate interpersonal relationships. Our procedurally extensible framework generates a vast and diverse scenario space with controllable difficulty, compelling the agent to acquire preferences through active dialogue, perceive the environment via autonomous exploration, and perform multi-objective optimization within a complex constraint network. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on S$^{3}$IT and found that they still struggle with this problem, showing an obvious gap compared with the human baseline. Results imply that LLMs have deficiencies in spatial intelligence, yet simultaneously demonstrate their ability to achieve near human-level competence in resolving conflicts that possess explicit textual cues."

Four classifiers are used: Extreme Gradient Boosting, Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Logistic Regression. Results show that models trained on Bloom filter encodings achieve accuracy similar to models trained on raw data or other transforms. At the same time, the method provides memory savings while enhancing privacy.

In a nation like Bangladesh, enhancing guava production and agricultural practices plays a crucial role in its economy.

Images of guava fruits classified into the Healthy, Fruit Flies, and Anthracnose classes are included in the Guava Fruit Disease Dataset 2024 (GFDD24), which comes from plantations in Rajshahi and Pabna, Bangladesh. This study aims to create models using CNN alongside traditional machine learning techniques that can effectively identify guava diseases in locally cultivated varieties in Bangladesh. In order to achieve the highest classification accuracy of approximately 99.99% for the guava dataset, we propose utilizing ensemble models that combine CNNML with Gradient Boosting Machine. In general, the CNN-ML cascade framework exhibits strong, high-accuracy guava disease detection that is appropriate for real-time agricultural monitoring systems."

    "abstract": "Designing materials that can effectively and repeatedly absorb energy from unpredictable directions represents a grand challenge in modern engineering, crucial for applications from vehicle crashworthiness systems to personal protective equipment. While bistable structures offer a promising pathway towards reusable energy absorbers, their functionality is almost universally constrained to a single loading axis, rendering them vulnerable and ineffective against off axis or oblique impacts. Here, we report the discovery and harnessing of eversion buckling, a distinct pitchfork bifurcation phenomenon in axisymmetric shells, to overcome this fundamental limitation. By strategically designing shell geometries to leverage this mechanism, we have engineered structural units with robust, inplane omnidirectional bistability. This property is characterized by a massive and rapid volumetric contraction upon snapping, which is key to its exceptional performance. When assembled, these structures exhibit an ideal, extended stress plateau, leading to a near perfect energy absorption efficiency dramatically outperforming typical energy absorbing materials. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the system's damping capacity far exceeds its constituent material, and highly tunable, spanning a sixfold range of loss factors which enables load adaptive properties. This design strategy, elucidates a clear mechanism rooted in enhanced friction and sequential stress release, paving the way for a new class of robust, reusable, and load adaptive energy absorbing systems."

    "abstract": "The performance of quantum neural network models depends strongly on architectural decisions, including circuit depth, placement of parametrized operations, and data-encoding strategies. Selecting an effective architecture is challenging and closely related to the classical difficulty of choosing suitable neural-network topologies, which is computationally hard. This work investigates automated quantum-circuit construction for regression tasks and introduces a genetic-algorithm framework that discovers Reduced Regressor QNN architectures. The approach explores depth, parametrized gate configurations, and flexible data re-uploading patterns, formulating the construction of quantum regressors as an optimization process. The discovered circuits are evaluated against seventeen classical regression models on twenty-two nonlinear benchmark functions and four analytical functions. Although classical methods often achieve comparable results, they typically require far more parameters, whereas the evolved quantum models remain compact while providing competitive performance. We further analyze dataset complexity using twelve structural descriptors and show, across five increasingly challenging meta-learning scenarios, that these measures can reliably predict which quantum architecture will perform best. The results demonstrate perfect or near-perfect predictive accuracy in several scenarios, indicating that complexity metrics offer powerful and compact representations of dataset structure and can effectively guide automated model selection. Overall, this study provides a principled basis for meta-learning-driven quantum architecture design and advances the understanding of how quantum models behave in regression settings--a topic that has received limited exploration in prior work. These findings pave the way for more systematic and theoretically grounded approaches to quantum regression."

This document presents an alternative method that estimates air temperature distribution while minimizing the need for a dense network of sensors in the experimental system. The proposed model, DARL (Data of Air and Random Length), can predict the temperature of air circulating inside EAWHEs. DARL is a significant methodological advance that integrates experimental data from boundary conditions with simulations based on pseudo-random numbers (PRNs). These PRNs are generated using Fermat's prime numbers as seeds to initialize the generator. Ordinary linear regressions and robust statistical validations, including the Shapiro-Wilk test and root mean square error, have demonstrated that the model can estimate the thermal distribution of air at different lengths with a relative error of less than 6.2%. These results demonstrate the model's efficiency, predictive capacity, and potential to reduce dependence on sensors."

We show that, in these systems, the SNE consists of two distinct contributions: a direct quasiparticle contribution and an indirect supercurrent contribution. The quasiparticle contribution originates from the momentum space Berry curvature generated by spin-triplet Cooper pairs. The indirect contribution arises from a compensating supercurrent that cancels the bulk thermoelectric charge current. While this contribution vanishes when the condensate has no spin-polarization in momentum space, it can be comparable in magnitude to the quasiparticle contribution in nonunitary superconductors. These results demonstrate that thermoelectric spin supercurrent must be explicitly accounted for when evaluating the SNE in nonunitary superconductors."

PoS protocols suffer from long-range attacks, wherein attackers alter execution history at little cost, and PoW protocols are vulnerable to attackers with enough computational power to subvert execution history. PoS protocols respond by relying on external mechanisms like social consensus; PoW protocols either fall back to probabilistic guarantees, or are slow. We present Sieve-MMR, the first fully-permissionless protocol with deterministic security and constant expected latency that does not rely on external mechanisms. We obtain Sieve-MMR by porting a PoS protocol (MMR) to the PoW setting. From MMR we inherit constant expected latency and deterministic security, and proof-of-work gives us resilience against long-range attacks. The main challenge to porting MMR to the PoW setting is what we call time-travel attacks, where attackers use PoWs generated in the distant past to increase their perceived PoW power in the present. We respond by proposing Sieve, a novel algorithm that implements a new broadcast primitive we dub time-travel-resilient broadcast (TTRB). Sieve relies on a black-box, deterministic PoW primitive to implement TTRB, which we use as the messaging layer for MMR."

    "abstract": "Mesh simplification is the process of reducing the number of vertices, edges and triangles in a three-dimensional (3D) mesh while preserving the overall shape and salient features of the mesh. A popular strategy for this is edge collapse, where an edge connecting two vertices is merged into a single vertex. The edge to collapse is chosen based on a cost function that estimates the error introduced by this collapse. This paper presents a comprehensive, implementation-oriented guide to edge collapse for practitioners and researchers seeking both theoretical grounding and practical insight. We review and derive the underlying mathematics and provide reference implementations for foundational cost functions including Quadric Error Metrics (QEM) and Lindstrom-Turk's geometric criteria. We also explain the mathematics behind attribute-aware edge collapse in QEM variants and Hoppe's energy-based method used in progressive meshes. In addition to cost functions, we outline the complete edge collapse algorithm, including the specific sequence of operations and the data structures that are commonly used. To create a robust system, we also cover the necessary programmatic safeguards that prevent issues like mesh degeneracies, inverted normals, and improper handling of boundary conditions. The goal of this work is not only to consolidate established methods but also to bridge the gap between theory and practice, offering a clear, step-by-step guide for implementing mesh simplification pipelines based on edge collapse."

We give exact formulas governing the ORT measure of a broad class of rank-two mixed states, and numerical solutions for some higher-rank states. We also compare the nonclassicality of these states to their metrological power, thus showing in what regimes the metrological power manages to saturate the ORT bound. Throughout, we consider the role of coherence. In particular, we show that nonclassicality and metrological power never increase under bosonic dephasing, but may plateau in a manner similar to entanglement sudden death. Nevertheless, lowering photon number coherence more freely can sometimes yield more nonclassical and metrologically useful states."

The normalized eigenfunctions and corresponding eigenspectra are derived within a non-Hermitian framework, ensuring consistent probability densities. Conditions for the reality of the spectra are established and used to analyze the dependence of eigenvalue behaviour on potential parameters. The study reveals distinct regimes of spectral characteristics arising from the interplay of complex mass, the Morse parameter, and eigenvalues, leading to the emergence of five intrinsic matter types. By analysing the energy eigenspectra, normalization conditions, and probability density profiles across parameter space, we identify regimes corresponding to real-spectrum Hermitian-like matter, quasi-stable or resonant states, purely complex quantum matter, non-physical, non-normalizable states, and a quasi-classical determinate regime in which the probability density becomes spatially static. One of these system exhibits a non-dissipative, collisionless state with long-range gravitational-like characteristics, suggesting a theoretical analogue for dark matter within a non-Hermitian quantum framework. Further, the five identified classes of matter may be interpreted as distinct phases of a single quantum system governed by complex mass and Morse parameters This classification elucidates the boundary between physical and non-physical regimes in complex quantum systems and provides a unified approach for interpreting stability, resonance, and emergent classicality arising from complex parameters."

    "abstract": "The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) can occur when there is a relative motion between two adjacent fluids. In the case of magnetized plasma, the shear velocity must exceed the local Alfvén speed for the instability to develop. The KHI produces nonlinear waves that eventually roll up into vortices and contribute to turbulence and dissipation. In the solar atmosphere KHI has been detected in coronal mass ejections (CMEs), jets, and prominences, mainly in the low corona. Only a few studies have reported the KHI in the upper corona, and its vortex development there has not been previously observed. We report the event with large-scale KHI waves observed from $\\sim 6$ to 14~$R_{\\odot}$ on 2024-Feb-16 using SOHO/LASCO and STEREO-A coronagraphs. KHI appeared during the passage of a fast CME and evolved into the nonlinear stage showing evidence of vortices. A closely timed subsequent CME in the same region has further developed the fully nonlinear KHI waves along its flank. We find that the radial speed of the CMEs exceeds the estimated local Alfven speed obtained from in-situ Parker Solar Probe (PSP) magnetic field data at perihelia. We propose that such events are rare because the fast CME created specific conditions favorable for instability growth in its trailing edge, including radial elongation of magnetic-field lines, reduced plasma density, and enhanced velocity and magnetic-field shear along the developing interface. The observed growth rate of KHI wave is in qualitative agreement with the theoretical predictions."

We construct transition matrices that capture system dynamics under varying request arrival rates, and derive analytical expressions for key performance metrics, including request satisfaction rate, average waiting time, link utilization efficiency, and average consumed link fidelity. Our analysis reveals that the critical trade-offs of higher request rates lead to faster link consumption with higher fidelity but potentially lower satisfaction rates, while lower request rates allow longer storage times at the cost of lower fidelity of increased decoherence effect. Moreover, this paper proves it is reasonable to leave out polarization rotation when the transmission distance is very short (40-50 km). In summary, this work provides theoretical foundations for designing and optimizing quantum entanglement distribution strategies in satellite networks, with applications to global-scale quantum communications."

    "abstract": "Adjusting for (baseline) covariates with working regression models becomes standard practice in the analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCT). When the dimension $p$ of the covariates is large relative to the sample size $n$, specifically $p = o (n)$, adjusting for covariates even in a linear working model by ordinary least squares can yield overly large bias, defeating the purpose of improving efficiency. This issue arises when no structural assumptions are imposed on the outcome model, a scenario that we refer to as the assumption-lean setting. Several new estimators have been proposed to address this issue. However, they focus mainly on simple randomization under the finite-population model, not covering covariate adaptive randomization (CAR) schemes under the superpopulation model. Due to improved covariate balance between treatment groups, CAR is more widely adopted in RCT; and the superpopulation model fits better when subjects are enrolled sequentially or when generalizing to a larger population is of interest. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop procedures in these settings, as the current regulatory guidance provides little concrete direction. In this paper, we fill this gap by demonstrating that an adjusted estimator based on second-order $U$-statistics can almost unbiasedly estimate the average treatment effect and enjoy a guaranteed efficiency gain if $p = o (n)$. In our analysis, we generalize the coupling technique commonly used in the CAR literature to $U$-statistics and also obtain several useful results for analyzing inverse sample Gram matrices by a delicate leave-$m$-out analysis, which may be of independent interest. Both synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superior finite-sample performance of our new estimator compared to popular benchmarks."

    "abstract": "The rapid adoption of diffusion models (DMs) in the Earth Observation (EO) domain has unlocked new generative capabilities aimed at producing new samples, whose statistical properties closely match real imagery, for tasks such as synthesizing missing data, augmenting scarce labeled datasets, and improving image reconstruction. This is particularly relevant in EO, where labeled data are often costly to obtain and limited in availability. However, classical DMs still face significant computational limitations, requiring hundreds to thousands of inference steps, as well as difficulties in capturing the intricate spatial and spectral correlations characteristic of EO data. Recent research in Quantum Machine Learning (QML), including initial attempts of Quantum Generative Models, offers a fundamentally different approach to overcome these challenges. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce the Quanvolutional Conditioned U-Net (QCU-Net), a hybrid quantum--classical architecture that applies quantum operations within a conditioned diffusion framework using a novel quanvolutional feature-extraction approach, for generating synthetic labeled EO imagery. Extensive experiments on the EuroSAT RGB dataset demonstrate that our QCU-Net achieves superior results. Notably, it reduces the Fréchet Inception Distance by 64%, lowers the Kernel Inception Distance by 76%, and yields higher semantic accuracy. Ablation studies further reveal that strategically positioning quantum layers and employing entangling variational circuits enhance model performance and convergence. This work represents the first successful adaptation of class-conditioned quantum diffusion modeling in the EO domain, paving the way for quantum-enhanced remote sensing imagery synthesis."

This limit is often overcome by introducing active elements. Here, we propose an alternative solution: by tailoring the dispersion relation of a waveguide, the photon pulse emitted by one qubit is passively reshaped into its time-reversed counterpart, thus enabling perfect absorption. We analytically derive the optimal dispersion relations in the limit of small and large qubit-qubit separations, and numerically extend our results to arbitrary separations via multiparameter optimization. We further propose a spatially inhomogeneous waveguide that renders the state transfer robust to variations in qubit separations. In all cases, we obtain near-unity transfer fidelity (>= 98%). Our dispersion-engineered waveguide provides a compact and passive route toward on-chip quantum networks, highlighting engineered dispersion as a powerful resource in waveguide quantum electrodynamics."

We model various stochastic noise sources present in the dataset using stationary Gaussian processes and estimate the noise budget of the InPTA-DR2 using Bayesian inference, involving model selection, Fourier harmonics selection, and parameter estimation for each pulsar. We check the efficacy of our noise characterisation by performing the Anderson-Darling test for Gaussianity on the noise-subtracted residuals. We find that all 11 pulsars with time baseline $\\lesssim2.5\\,\\text{yr}$ show Gaussian residuals and do not have evidence for any red noise process in the optimal model, except for PSR J1944$+$0907, which shows presence of DM noise. PSRs J0437$-$4715, J1909$-$3744 and J1939$+$2134 show preference for the most complicated noise model, having achromatic and chromatic red noise processes. Only 4 out of 15 pulsars with time baseline $\\gtrsim2.5\\,\\text{yr}$ show significant non-Gaussianity in noise-subtracted residuals. We suspect that this may require more advanced methods to model noise processes properly. A comparative study of six pulsars with data removed near solar conjunctions showed deviations from the parameter estimates obtained with the original dataset, indicating potential bias in red noise processes due to unmodeled solar-wind effects. The results presented in this work remain broadly consistent with the InPTA-DR1 noise budget, with better constraints obtained on noise processes for several pulsars and support for achromatic red noise in PSR J1012$+$5307 due to the extended time baseline."

    "abstract": "For nearly two decades, population protocols have been extensively studied, yielding efficient solutions for central problems in distributed computing, including leader election, and majority computation, a predicate type in Presburger Arithmetic closely tied to population protocols. Surprisingly, no protocols have achieved both time- and space-efficiency for congruency predicates, such as parity computation, which are complementary in this arithmetic framework. This gap highlights a significant challenge in the field. To address this gap, we explore the parity problem, where agents are tasked with computing the parity of the given sub-population size. Then we extend the solution for parity to compute congruences modulo an arbitrary $m$. Previous research on efficient population protocols has focused on protocols that minimise both stabilisation time and state utilisation for specific problems. In contrast, this work slightly relaxes this expectation, permitting protocols to place less emphasis on full optimisation and more on universality, robustness, and probabilistic guarantees. This allows us to propose a novel computing paradigm that integrates population weights (or simply weights), a robust clocking mechanism, and efficient anomaly detection coupled with a switching mechanism (which ensures slow but always correct solutions). This paradigm facilitates universal design of efficient multistage stable population protocols. Specifically, the first efficient parity and congruence protocols introduced here use both $O(\\log^3 n)$ states and achieve silent stabilisation in $O(\\log^3 n)$ time. We conclude by discussing the impact of implicit conversion between unary and binary representations enabled by the weight system, with applications to other problems, including the computation and representation of (sub-)population sizes."

    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn a policy that maximizes the expected return using a given static dataset of transitions. However, offline RL faces the distribution shift problem. The policy constraint offline RL method is proposed to solve the distribution shift problem. During the policy constraint offline RL training, it is important to ensure the difference between the learned policy and behavior policy within a given threshold. Thus, the learned policy heavily relies on the quality of the behavior policy. However, a problem exists in existing policy constraint methods: if the dataset contains many low-reward transitions, the learned will be contained with a suboptimal reference policy, leading to slow learning speed, low sample efficiency, and inferior performances. This paper shows that the sampling method in policy constraint offline RL that uses all the transitions in the dataset can be improved. A simple but efficient sample filtering method is proposed to improve the sample efficiency and the final performance. First, we evaluate the score of the transitions by average reward and average discounted reward of episodes in the dataset and extract the transition samples of high scores. Second, the high-score transition samples are used to train the offline RL algorithms. We verify the proposed method in a series of offline RL algorithms and benchmark tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms baselines."

    "abstract": "Text classification plays an important role in various downstream text-related tasks, such as sentiment analysis, fake news detection, and public opinion analysis. Recently, text classification based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has made significant progress due to their strong capabilities of structural relationship learning. However, these approaches still face two major limitations. First, these approaches fail to fully consider the diverse structural information across word pairs, e.g., co-occurrence, syntax, and semantics. Furthermore, they neglect sequence information in the text graph structure information learning module and can not classify texts with new words and relations. In this paper, we propose a Novel Graph-Sequence Learning Model for Inductive Text Classification (TextGSL) to address the previously mentioned issues. More specifically, we construct a single text-level graph for all words in each text and establish different edge types based on the diverse relationships between word pairs. Building upon this, we design an adaptive multi-edge message-passing paradigm to aggregate diverse structural information between word pairs. Additionally, sequential information among text data can be captured by the proposed TextGSL through the incorporation of Transformer layers. Therefore, TextGSL can learn more discriminative text representations. TextGSL has been comprehensively compared with several strong baselines. The experimental results on diverse benchmarking datasets demonstrate that TextGSL outperforms these baselines in terms of accuracy."

Current evaluation methods focus primarily on functional correctness, overlooking the non-functional optimality of generated plans. This gap can lead to significant performance degradation and resource waste. We identify and formalize the problem of Non-optimal Decisions (NoDs), where agents complete tasks successfully but inefficiently. We present NoD-DGMT, a systematic framework for detecting NoDs in embodied agent task planning via diversity-guided metamorphic testing. Our key insight is that optimal planners should exhibit invariant behavioral properties under specific transformations. We design four novel metamorphic relations capturing fundamental optimality properties: position detour suboptimality, action optimality completeness, condition refinement monotonicity, and scene perturbation invariance. To maximize detection efficiency, we introduce a diversity-guided selection strategy that actively selects test cases exploring different violation categories, avoiding redundant evaluations while ensuring comprehensive diversity coverage. Extensive experiments on the AI2-THOR simulator with four state-of-the-art planning models demonstrate that NoD-DGMT achieves violation detection rates of 31.9% on average, with our diversity-guided filter improving rates by 4.3% and diversity scores by 3.3 on average. NoD-DGMT significantly outperforms six baseline methods, with 16.8% relative improvement over the best baseline, and demonstrates consistent superiority across different model architectures and task complexities."

The long-wavelength limit is handled through a reduced dielectric matrix that retains local-field mixing, interfaces and 2D layers are treated with sheet boundary conditions (rather than naïve ultrathin films), and length-velocity equivalence is enforced in practice by including the equal-time (diamagnetic/contact) term alongside the paramagnetic current. Finite temperature is addressed on the Matsubara axis with numerically stable real-axis evaluation (complex polarization propagator), preserving unit consistency end-to-end. The framework enables predictive, unit-faithful observables from radio frequency to ultraviolet-RF/microwave heating and penetration depth, dielectric-logging contrast, interfacial optics of thin films and 2D sheets, and adsorption metrics via imaginary-axis polarizabilities. Numerical checks (gauge overlay and optical $(f)$-sum saturation) validate the implementation.

For one of these paths, the stable mass transfer channel, we now construct detailed binary evolution models which include internal differential rotation as well as mass and angular momentum transfer between the stars, all the way from the zero-age main sequence to the formation of the black holes, only skipping the rapid late burning stages. This allows us to follow the mass and chemical structure evolution of the mass accreting component, which turns out to have a key influence on the phase of reverse mass transfer, that allows the obtained black hole spins and mass ratios to naturally fall into the regime observed for the gravitational-wave source in the 10--25$M_\\odot$ primary black hole mass range. As for this channel, also a large number of progenitor binaries are known, we conclude that it likely contributes to the observed population of gravitational wave sources."

Relative to previous works, our method, \\lieflow, is more flexible in terms of the types of groups it can discover and requires fewer assumptions. Experiments on 2D and 3D point clouds demonstrate the successful discovery of discrete groups, including reflections by flow matching over the complex domain.

The ensemble-averaged stress includes both the particle-induced non-Newtonian stress (PINNS) and an interaction stresslet arising from surface tractions due to the non-Newtonian stress and its induced Newtonian flow. Using a generalized reciprocal theorem, we express this interaction stresslet entirely in terms of the non-Newtonian stress, for a general constitutive model. For weakly non-Newtonian fluids, a regular perturbation expansion combined with the method of characteristics yields all leading-order stress contributions from the Newtonian velocity field alone, avoiding the need to solve coupled partial differential equations. This generalizes the method of Koch et al. (Phys. Rev. Fluids 1, 013301 (2016)) beyond polymeric fluids to any weakly non-Newtonian medium driven by velocity and its gradients. We apply the method to two systems: (i) spheres suspended in a fluid of smaller spheroids, where the interaction stress becomes negative for sufficiently anisotropic shapes due to orientation misalignment of the spheroids; and (ii) suspensions in weakly anisotropic nematic liquid crystals. In the latter, assuming a uniform director field fixed by an external field, PINNS vanishes while interaction stresslets remain, either opposing or enhancing background anisotropic stress. These results demonstrate the utility of our framework in capturing first-order particle-microstructure interactions across a broad class of non-Newtonian fluids."

Current methods often overlook the rich hierarchical structures, such as the semantic hierarchy of primitives (e.g., apple fruit) and the conceptual hierarchy between primitives and compositions (e.g, sliced apple apple). A few recent efforts have shown effectiveness in modeling these hierarchies through loss regularization within Euclidean space. In this paper, we argue that they fail to scale to the large-scale taxonomies required for real-world CZSL: the space's polynomial volume growth in flat geometry cannot match the exponential structure, impairing generalization capacity. To this end, we propose H2em, a new framework that learns Hierarchical Hyperbolic EMbeddings for CZSL. H2em leverages the unique properties of hyperbolic geometry, a space naturally suited for embedding tree-like structures with low distortion. However, a naive hyperbolic mapping may suffer from hierarchical collapse and poor fine-grained discrimination. We further design two learning objectives to structure this space: a Dual-Hierarchical Entailment Loss that uses hyperbolic entailment cones to enforce the predefined hierarchies, and a Discriminative Alignment Loss with hard negative mining to establish a large geodesic distance between semantically similar compositions. Furthermore, we devise Hyperbolic Cross-Modal Attention to realize instance-aware cross-modal infusion within hyperbolic geometry. Extensive ablations on three benchmarks demonstrate that H2em establishes a new state-of-the-art in both closed-world and open-world scenarios. Our codes will be released."

Most sparse generators control at most two of these features, and assortativity is often achieved by degree-preserving rewiring, which obscures the mechanism-parameter link. We introduce CoLaS (copula-seeded local latent-space graphs), a modular latent-variable model that separates marginal specifications from dependence. Each node has a popularity variable governing degree heterogeneity and a latent geometric location governing locality. A low-dimensional copula couples popularity and location, providing an interpretable dependence parameter that tunes degree mixing while leaving the chosen marginals unchanged. Under shrinking-range locality, edges are conditionally independent, the graph remains sparse, and clustering does not vanish. We develop sparse-limit theory for degrees, transitivity, and assortativity. Degrees converge to mixed-Poisson limits and we establish a degree-tail dichotomy: with fixed-range local kernels, degree tails are necessarily light, even under heavy-ailed popularity. To recover power-law degrees without sacrificing sparsity or locality, we propose CoLaS-HT, a minimal tail-inheriting extension in which effective connection ranges grow with popularity. Finally, under an identifiability condition, we provide a consistent one-graph calibration method based on jointly matching transitivity and assortativity."

Current models can parse simple, single-target commands but fail when presented with complex geospatial scenarios, e.g., segmenting objects at various granularities, executing multi-target instructions, and interpreting implicit user intent. To drive progress against these failures, we present LaSeRS, the first large-scale dataset built for comprehensive training and evaluation across four critical dimensions of language-guided segmentation: hierarchical granularity, target multiplicity, reasoning requirements, and linguistic variability. By capturing these dimensions, LaSeRS moves beyond simple commands, providing a benchmark for complex geospatial reasoning. This addresses a critical gap: existing datasets oversimplify, leading to sensitivity-prone real-world models. We also propose SegEarth-R2, an MLLM architecture designed for comprehensive language-guided segmentation in RS, which directly confronts these challenges. The model's effectiveness stems from two key improvements: (1) a spatial attention supervision mechanism specifically handles the localization of small objects and their components, and (2) a flexible and efficient segmentation query mechanism that handles both single-target and multi-target scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our SegEarth-R2 achieves outstanding performance on LaSeRS and other benchmarks, establishing a powerful baseline for the next generation of geospatial segmentation.

    "abstract": "Time-series forecasting in real-world applications such as finance and energy often faces challenges due to limited training data and complex, noisy temporal dynamics. Existing deep forecasting models typically supervise predictions using full-length temporal windows, which include substantial high-frequency noise and obscure long-term trends. Moreover, auxiliary variables containing rich domain-specific information are often underutilized, especially in few-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose LoFT-LLM, a frequency-aware forecasting pipeline that integrates low-frequency learning with semantic calibration via a large language model (LLM). Firstly, a Patch Low-Frequency forecasting Module (PLFM) extracts stable low-frequency trends from localized spectral patches. Secondly, a residual learner then models high-frequency variations. Finally, a fine-tuned LLM refines the predictions by incorporating auxiliary context and domain knowledge through structured natural language prompts. Extensive experiments on financial and energy datasets demonstrate that LoFT-LLM significantly outperforms strong baselines under both full-data and few-shot regimes, delivering superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability."

    "abstract": "We develop a simple model of a designer who manages a learning structure. Agents have partial private information about a common-value good. The designer wishes to allocate the good to as many agents as possible without using monetary transfers. We formulate this environment as a mechanism design problem that nests social learning models and characterize an optimal mechanism under general distributions over private information. The optimal mechanism can be summarized by two parameters: one purely adjusts the allocation probability, while the other governs the amount of learning implicitly induced by allocation. Although the designer always prefers to allocate the good, managing incentives for learning leads the optimal mechanism to withhold allocation even when allocation is socially efficient. Our analysis brings the perspective of managing learning structures to market design and introduces a mechanism design approach to social learning."

    "abstract": "In recent years, the integration of pre-trained foundational models with multiple instance learning (MIL) has improved diagnostic accuracy in computational pathology. However, existing MIL methods focus on optimizing feature extractors and aggregation strategies while overlooking the complex semantic relationships among instances within whole slide image (WSI). Although Transformer-based MIL approaches aiming to model instance dependencies, the quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability to large-scale WSIs. Moreover, due to the pronounced variations in tumor region scales across different WSIs, existing Transformer-based methods employing fixed-scale attention mechanisms face significant challenges in precisely capturing local instance correlations and fail to account for the distance-based decay effect of patch relevance. To address these challenges, we propose window scale decay MIL (WSD-MIL), designed to enhance the capacity to model tumor regions of varying scales while improving computational efficiency. WSD-MIL comprises: 1) a window scale decay based attention module, which employs a cluster-based sampling strategy to reduce computational costs while progressively decaying attention window-scale to capture local instance relationships at varying scales; and 2) a squeeze-and-excitation based region gate module, which dynamically adjusts window weights to enhance global information modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that WSD-MIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CAMELYON16 and TCGA-BRCA datasets while reducing 62% of the computational memory. The code will be publicly available."

    "abstract": "As integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems are deployed in next-generation wireless networks, a new security vulnerability emerges, particularly in terms of sensing privacy. Unauthorized sensing eavesdroppers (Eve) can potentially exploit the ISAC signal for their own independent passive sensing. However, solutions for sensing-secure ISAC remain largely unexplored to date. This work addresses sensing-security for OFDM- and OTFS-based ISAC waveforms from a target-detection perspective, aiming to prevent Eves from exploiting the ISAC signal for unauthorized passive sensing. We develop ISAC system models for the base station (BS), communication user equipment, and the sensing Eve, and define a Kullback-Leibler-divergence-based detection metric that accounts for mainlobe, sidelobe, and noise components in the ambiguity function and the resulting range-Doppler maps of the legitimate BS's and Eve's sensing. Building on this analysis, we formulate a sensing-secure ISAC signaling design problem that tunes a perturbation matrix to jointly control signal amplitude and phase in the time-frequency domain and solve it via simulated annealing. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme substantially degrades Eve's detection probability -- from 79.4% to 37.4% for OTFS and from 94.3% to 33.0% for OFDM -- while incurring only a small loss in BS sensing performance. In addition, it allows controllable trade-offs across sensing-security and communication performance."

In this article, we propose the definitions of completely independent $S$-Steiner trees (CISSTs for short) and generalized $k^*$-connectivity, which generalize the definitions of internally disjoint $S$-Steiner trees and generalized $k$-connectivity. Given a connected graph $G = (V,E)$ and a vertex subset $S\\subseteq V, |S|\\geq 2,$ an $S$-Steiner tree of $G$ is a subtree in $G$ that spans all nodes in $S.$ The $S$-Steiner trees $T_1,T_2,\\cdots, T_k$ of $G$ are completely independent pairwise if for any $1\\leq p<q\\leq k,$ $E(T_p)\\cap E(T_q)=\\emptyset$ , $V(T_p)\\cap V(T_q)=S,$ and for any two vertices $x_{1},x_{2}$ in $S$, the paths connecting $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ in $T_p,T_q$ are pairwise internally disjoint. The packing number of CISSTs, denoted by $κ^*_G(S),$ is the maximum number of CISSTs in $G.$ The generalized $k^*$-connectivity $κ_k^*(G)$ is the minimum $κ_G^*(S)$ for $S$ ranges over all $k$-subsets of $V(G).$ We provide a detailed characterization of CISSTs. Also, we investigate the CISSTs of complete graphs and complete bipartite graphs. Furthermore, we determine the generalized $k^*$-connectivity for complete graphs and give a tight lower bound of the generalized $k^*$-connectivity for complete bipartite graphs."

    "abstract": "Collaborative learning has emerged as a key paradigm in large-scale intelligent systems, enabling distributed agents to cooperatively train their models while addressing their privacy concerns. Central to this paradigm is knowledge distillation (KD), a technique that facilitates efficient knowledge transfer among agents. However, the underlying mechanisms by which KD leverages memory and knowledge across agents remain underexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by offering a comprehensive review of KD in collaborative learning, with a focus on the roles of memory and knowledge. We define and categorize memory and knowledge within the KD process and explore their interrelationships, providing a clear understanding of how knowledge is extracted, stored, and shared in collaborative settings. We examine various collaborative learning patterns, including distributed, hierarchical, and decentralized structures, and provide insights into how memory and knowledge dynamics shape the effectiveness of KD in collaborative learning. Particularly, we emphasize task heterogeneity in distributed learning pattern covering federated learning (FL), multi-agent domain adaptation (MADA), federated multi-modal learning (FML), federated continual learning (FCL), federated multi-task learning (FMTL), and federated graph knowledge embedding (FKGE). Additionally, we highlight model heterogeneity, data heterogeneity, resource heterogeneity, and privacy concerns of these tasks. Our analysis categorizes existing work based on how they handle memory and knowledge. Finally, we discuss existing challenges and propose future directions for advancing KD techniques in the context of collaborative learning."

A first-ever pillar-based scoring formulation is derived via Principal Component Analysis, identifying Reproductive Efficiency, Genetic Management, Herd Health, and Herd Management, to construct weighted composite indices.

    "abstract": "In order to account for reionization of the early Universe, galaxies at that time must have had significantly higher escape fractions of Lyman Continuum (LyC) than observed in the present Universe. Any explanation invoked to explain LyC escape must agree with this dramatic cosmic evolution. Galaxy mergers are often suggested as such a regulating mechanism. They occur an order or magnitude more frequently at $z \\ge 3$ than in the local Universe, and they can trigger LyC escape either by inducing strong nuclear starbursts, or by tidally displacing the neutral ISM from the bulk of the stars. In the local Universe, LyC escape has been found to correlate with a range of physical and observable properties closely associated with strong star formation. For this reason, interest in mergers as drivers of LyC escape have been mainly focused on their capacity to induce strong star formation. However, at $z \\ge 2$, these correlations are weaker, and we observe a much more diverse Lyman Continuum Emitter (LCE) population. This suggests that processes external to the LCE galaxies are more important for facilitating the escape at higher redshifts, which makes tidal displacement an interesting explanatory model; however, this has only been conclusively observed once before. In this letter, we present archival JWST/NIRSpec IFU and HST UVIS and IR imaging observations of the z = 3 Lyman-Continuum emitter LACES104037. We find that its Lyman-Continuum escape originates in a tidal bridge in the direction towards an interacting companion galaxy first identified in this work. LyC escape from tidal stripping or in-situ formed stars in tidal features could help explain both the higher cosmic LyC escape fraction and the greater diversity of LCE galaxy properties at higher redshifts."

    "abstract": "Time-resolved measurement of Auger-Meitner (AM) decay [Nature 419, 803 (2002)] marked a milestone in the development of attosecond science. To date, the time constants for the AM decay processes obtained from the time-domain experiments were found to be consistent with the values deduced from conventional energy-domain measurements. One of the main factors limiting the temporal resolution of these studies is the unlocked carrier-envelope-phase (CEP) of the laser pulses used to probe the electronic dynamics triggered by inner-shell photoabsorption. In this work, we report time-resolved inner-shell electron spectroscopy of xenon and krypton using attosecond soft X-ray (atto-SXR) pulses centered at 130 eV in combination with CEP-stabilized few-cycle Yb laser pulses. We observed that the N$_{4,5}$OO Auger electrons from xenon exhibit a clear streaking pattern, but with an unexpected time shift of $\\sim$ 1.32 fs relative to the 4$d$ photoelectrons. Furthermore, the energy-integrated yield of streaked Auger electrons from xenon exhibits a pronounced minimum at a pump-probe time delay of 4 fs. Neither of these observations can be explained by current streaking theories and both are inconsistent with lifetimes inferred from energy-domain measurements. The M$_{4,5}$NN Auger electrons from krypton partly overlap in energy with the 3$d$ inner-shell photoelectrons and do not show these anomalous features. This study offers new insights into the inner-shell electron dynamics of heavy atoms in the giant dipole resonance region, laying the groundwork for attosecond soft X-ray spectroscopy of molecular systems containing iodine or bromine atoms."

    "abstract": "In magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows, incompressibility is assumed for low Mach numbers. However, even at low Mach numbers, the Mach number influences flow and magnetic fields. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a method that can stably analyze low Mach number compressible MHD flows without using the incompressible assumption. This study constructs an energy-conserving finite difference method to analyze compressible MHD flows at low Mach numbers with the nonconservative Lorentz force. This analysis method discretizes the Lorentz force so that the transformation between conservative and nonconservative forms holds. This scheme simultaneously relaxes velocity, pressure, density, and internal energy, and stable convergence solutions can be obtained. In this study, we analyze four types of models and verify the accuracy and convergence of this numerical method. In the analyses of two- and three-dimensional ideal periodic inviscid MHD flows, it is clarified that momentum, magnetic flux density, and total energy are conserved discretely. The total energy is conserved even in a nonuniform grid. Even without correction for the magnetic flux density, the divergence-free condition of the magnetic flux density is satisfied discretely. Analysis of a Taylor decaying vortex under a magnetic field clarifies that the present numerical method can be applied to incompressible flows and can accurately predict the trend of energy attenuation. In the Orszag-Tang vortex analysis, an increase in Mach number reduces the magnitude of vorticity and current density. In addition, compression work increases more than expansion work, and the influence of compressibility appears. An increase in Mach number slightly delays the transition to turbulent flow. This numerical method has excellent energy conservation properties and can accurately predict energy conversion."

    "abstract": "The mod function plays a critical role in numerous data encoding and cryptographic primitives. However, the widely used CKKS homomorphic encryption (HE) scheme supports only arithmetic operations, making it difficult to perform mod computations on encrypted data. Approximating the mod function with polynomials has therefore become an important yet challenging problem. The discontinuous and periodic characteristics of the mod function make it particularly difficult to approximate accurately under HE. Existing homomorphic mod constructions provide accurate results only within limited subranges of the input range, leaving the problem of achieving accurate approximation across the full input range unresolved. In this work, we propose a novel method based on polynomial interpolation and Chebyshev series to accurately approximate the mod function. Building upon this, we design two efficient data packing schemes, BitStack and CRTStack, tailored for small-integer inputs in CKKS. These schemes significantly improve the utilization of the CKKS plaintext space and enable efficient ciphertext uploads. Furthermore, we apply the proposed HE mod function to implement a homomorphic rounding operation and a general transformation from additive secret sharing to CKKS ciphertexts, achieving accurate ciphertext rounding and complete secret-share-to-CKKS conversion. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high approximation accuracy (up to 1e-8). Overall, our work provides a practical and general solution for performing mod operations under CKKS, extending its applicability to a broader range of privacy-preserving computations."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models are increasingly used in conversational systems such as digital personal assistants, shaping how people interact with technology through language. While their responses often sound fluent and natural, they can also carry subtle tone biases such as sounding overly polite, cheerful, or cautious even when neutrality is expected. These tendencies can influence how users perceive trust, empathy, and fairness in dialogue. In this study, we explore tone bias as a hidden behavioral trait of large language models. The novelty of this research lies in the integration of controllable large language model based dialogue synthesis with tone classification models, enabling robust and ethical emotion recognition in personal assistant interactions. We created two synthetic dialogue datasets, one generated from neutral prompts and another explicitly guided to produce positive or negative tones. Surprisingly, even the neutral set showed consistent tonal skew, suggesting that bias may stem from the model's underlying conversational style. Using weak supervision through a pretrained DistilBERT model, we labeled tones and trained several classifiers to detect these patterns. Ensemble models achieved macro F1 scores up to 0.92, showing that tone bias is systematic, measurable, and relevant to designing fair and trustworthy conversational AI."

We derive a matrix-integral representation of this observable for generic four-dimensional superconformal gauge theories. For $U(N)$ maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, we study such matrix integral and show that it localizes to ensembles of superconformal indices near its essential singularities. The latter asymptotic localization explains why a single microcanonical index reproduces the growth of the total number of BPS states in a large-$N$ expansion at charges of order $N^2$, despite exhibiting large sign-oscillations due to the insertion of $(-1)^F$. To compute quantum corrections to entropy, at finite $N$, the correct observable is the protected partition function which by definition is a positive quantity. To study this protected observable, we propose and test an improvement of the Cardy-like method that allows us to identify and compute perturbatively exact expressions for the leading large-$N$ onshell action of eigenvalue-configurations that we call orbifold, dressed orbifold, and eigenvalue-instanton saddles."

Existing analysis methods, such as static analysis, symbolic execution, and fuzzing, depend on binary visibility and functional emulation, making them unreliable when firmware is encrypted or inaccessible. To address this limitation, we propose a binary-free, architecture-agnostic solution that estimates the likelihood of conceptual zero-day vulnerabilities using only high-level descriptors. The approach integrates a tri-LLM reasoning architecture combining a LLaMA-based configuration interpreter, a DeepSeek-based structural abstraction analyzer, and a GPT-4o semantic fusion model. The solution also incorporates LLM computational signatures, including latency patterns, uncertainty markers, and reasoning depth indicators, as well as an energy-aware symbolic load model, to enhance interpretability and operational feasibility. In addition, we formally derive the mathematical foundations of the reasoning pipeline, establishing monotonicity, divergence, and energy-risk coupling properties that theoretically justify the model's behavior. Simulation-based evaluation reveals that high exposure conditions increase the predicted zero-day likelihood by 20 to 35 percent across models, with GPT-4o demonstrating the strongest cross-layer correlations and the highest sensitivity. Energy and divergence metrics significantly predict elevated risk (p < 0.01), reinforcing the effectiveness of the proposed reasoning framework."

    "abstract": "As Vision Transformers (ViTs) become standard vision backbones, a mechanistic account of their computational phenomenology is essential. Despite architectural cues that hint at dynamical structure, there is no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. In this work, we introduce the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), arguing that trained ViTs admit a block-recurrent depth structure such that the computation of the original $L$ blocks can be accurately rewritten using only $k \\ll L$ distinct blocks applied recurrently. Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent computational cost. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors. Altogether, we find a compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, pointing to a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis."

A systematic framework for the enumeration, classification and prediction of secondary structures is critical to determine the biological significance of the molecular configurations of RNA. Chord diagrams are mathematical objects widely used to represent RNA secondary structures and to analyze structural motifs, however a mathematically rigorous enumeration of pseudoknots remains a challenge. We introduce a method that incorporates a distance-based metric $τ$ to analyze the intersection graph of a chord diagram associated with a pseudoknotted structure. In particular, our method formally defines a pseudoknot in terms of a weighted vertex cover of a certain intersection graph constructed from a partition of the chord diagram representing the nucleotide sequence of the RNA molecule. In this graph-theoretic context, we introduce a rigorous algorithm that enumerates pseudoknots, classifies secondary structures, and is sensitive to three-dimensional topological features. We implement our methods in MATLAB and test the algorithm on pseudoknotted structures from the bpRNA-1m database. Our findings confirm that genus is a robust quantifier of pseudoknot complexity."

While tightly coupled acoustic-visual-inertial fusion, typically implemented through an acoustic Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) integrated with visual-inertial measurements, can provide accurate state estimation, the associated graph-based optimization is often computationally prohibitive for real-time deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Here we present FAR-AVIO, a Schur-Complement based, tightly coupled acoustic-visual-inertial odometry framework tailored for underwater robots. FAR-AVIO embeds a Schur complement formulation into an Extended Kalman Filter(EKF), enabling joint pose-landmark optimization for accuracy while maintaining constant-time updates by efficiently marginalizing landmark states. On top of this backbone, we introduce Adaptive Weight Adjustment and Reliability Evaluation(AWARE), an online sensor health module that continuously assesses the reliability of visual, inertial and DVL measurements and adaptively regulates their sigma weights, and we develop an efficient online calibration scheme that jointly estimates DVL-IMU extrinsics, without dedicated calibration manoeuvres. Numerical simulations and real-world underwater experiments consistently show that FAR-AVIO outperforms state-of-the-art underwater SLAM baselines in both localization accuracy and computational efficiency, enabling robust operation on low-power embedded platforms.

    "abstract": "Chaotic free surface flows are challenging problems to simulate numerically, mainly due to the significant changes in geometry and frequent topological changes. Methods that track the evolution of the fluid in a Lagrangian formulation are a natural choice. One such method is the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM). As a hybrid particle-based and mesh-based method, PFEM leverages advantages from both approaches. The equations of motion are solved on a mesh using the finite element method and the obtained velocity field is used to displace the nodes of this mesh, considered as particles carrying all the relevant information across time steps. To avoid element distortion, the mesh is frequently re-generated. This introduces some challenges: How can the new shape of the domain be detected? How can the quality of the elements be kept acceptable? Can adaptive mesh refinement increase the accuracy and efficiency of the solver? Can PFEM simulations be performed in the presence of complex boundary geometries? In this work, three contributions to the geometry and mesh component of PFEM are introduced for three-dimensional free surface flow simulations. First, we propose a different domain reconstruction approach than the classically used alpha-shape procedure, namely through the use of the advected boundary from the previous time step as a predicate to represent the new shape of the domain. Second, an adaptive refinement procedure is proposed in two steps: refinement of the boundary surface followed by quality-based node insertion in the bulk. Third, an approach for managing boundaries in complex geometries is presented. A series of applications is shown to demonstrate the interest of the approach."

    "abstract": "In the immediate aftermath of the Big Bang, the universe existed in an extremely hot, dense state in which particle interactions occurred not in a vacuum but within a thermal medium. Under such conditions, the standard framework of quantum field theory (QFT) requires a finite temperature extension, wherein propagators -- and hence the fundamental structure of the theory -- are modified to reflect thermal background effects. These thermal modifications are central to understanding the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) as a high temperature phase transition, potentially leading to qualitatively different vacuum structures for the Higgs field as the universe cooled. Finite temperature corrections naturally regulate ultraviolet divergences in propagators, hinting at a possible route toward ultraviolet completion. However, these same thermal effects exacerbate infrared pathologies and can lead to imaginary contributions to the effective potential, particularly when analysing metastable or multi-vacuum configurations. Additional theoretical challenges, such as gauge dependence and renormalization scale ambiguity, further obscure the precise characterization of the electroweak phase transition even in minimal extensions of the Standard Model (SM). This review presents the theoretical foundations of finite temperature QFT with an emphasis on how different field species respond to thermal effects, identifying the bosonic sector as the primary source of key theoretical subtleties. We focus particularly on the scalar extension of the SM, which offers a compelling framework for realizing first order electroweak phase transitions, electroweak baryogenesis, and accommodating dark matter candidates depending on the underlying $Z_2$ symmetry structure."

Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising avenue to enhance these capabilities, yet its application in the tabular domain faces three critical hurdles: the scarcity of high-quality agentic trajectories with closed-loop code execution and environment feedback on diverse table structures, the extreme heterogeneity of feedback signals ranging from rigid SQL execution to open-ended data interpretation, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting of general knowledge during vertical specialization. To overcome these challenges and unlock advanced reasoning on complex tables, we introduce \\textbf{TableGPT-R1}, a specialized tabular model built on a systematic RL framework.

CoxPH assumes constant hazard ratios, often failing to capture real-world dynamics, while traditional AFT models are limited by rigid distributional assumptions. Although deep learning models like DeepAFT address these constraints by improving predictive accuracy and handling censoring, they inherit the significant challenge of black-box interpretability. The recent introduction of CoxKAN demonstrated the successful integration of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), a novel architecture that yields highly accurate and interpretable symbolic representations, within the CoxPH framework. Motivated by the interpretability gains of CoxKAN, we introduce KAN-AFT (Kolmogorov Arnold Network-based AFT), the first framework to apply KANs to the AFT model. KAN-AFT effectively models complex nonlinear relationships within the AFT framework. Our primary contributions include: (i) a principled AFT-KAN formulation, (ii) robust optimization strategies for right-censored observations (e.g., Buckley-James and IPCW), and (iii) an interpretability pipeline that converts the learned spline functions into closed-form symbolic equations for survival time. Empirical results on multiple datasets confirm that KAN-AFT achieves performance comparable to or better than DeepAFT, while uniquely providing transparent, symbolic models of the survival process."

This progress is driven by increasingly sophisticated model architectures, such as ResNets, Vision Transformers, and Hybrid Convolutional Neural Networks, that offer enhanced performance at the cost of greater complexity.

SHAP has emerged as a prominent method for providing interpretable visualizations that aid domain experts in understanding model predictions. However, SHAP explanations can be unstable and unreliable in the presence of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. In this study, we address this challenge by using Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify the uncertainty that arises from these unstable explanations in medical imaging applications. The framework uses a belief, plausible, and fusion map approach alongside statistical quantitative analysis to produce quantification of uncertainty in SHAP. Furthermore, we evaluated our framework on three medical imaging datasets with varying class distributions, image qualities, and modality types which introduces noise due to varying image resolutions and modality-specific aspect covering the examples from pathology, ophthalmology, and radiology, introducing significant epistemic uncertainty."

We propose a unified quasi-degenerate orbital mechanism for the emergence of the two-dome parent magnetic/structural phase and the subsequent two-dome SC phase. It is found that the degenerate in-plane anisotropic $d_{xz/yz}$ orbitals dominate the first magnetic/structural and SC phases, while in-plane isotropic orbitals $d_{xy}$ or $d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ with quasi-degeneracy originating from quasi-symmetry drive the emergence of the second magnetic/SC dome phase. Moreover, a matching rule of spin and orbital modes for SC pairing state is proposed in multi-orbital iron-based systems. These results imply an orbital-driven mechanism as well as an orbital-selective scenario, and shed light on the understanding of the multi-dome magnetic and SC phases in multi-orbital systems."

We introduce a new method for testing statistical independence using the quantile dependence function. Rather than assessing whether the value of the test statistic exceeds a single critical threshold and subsequently deciding whether to reject the independence hypothesis, we use so-called critical surfaces that guarantee locally equal probability of exceeding it under independence. This approach enables a detailed examination of local discrepancies and an assessment of their statistical significance while preserving the overall significance level of the test."

    "abstract": "In 2008, melamine in infant formula forced laboratories across three continents to verify a compound they had never monitored. Non-targeted analysis using LC/GC-HRMS handles these cases. But when findings trigger regulatory action, reproducibility becomes operational: can an independent laboratory repeat the analysis and reach the same conclusion? We assessed 103 tools (2004-2025) against six pillars drawn from FAIR and BP4NTA principles: laboratory validation (C1), data availability (C2), code availability (C3), standardised formats (C4), knowledge integration (C5), and portable implementation (C6). Health contributed 51 tools, Pharma 31, and Chemistry 21. Nine in ten tools shared data (C2, 90/103, 87%). Fewer than four in ten supported portable implementations (C6, 40/103, 39%). Validation and portability rarely appeared together (C1+C6, 18/103, 17%). Over twenty-one years, openness climbed from 56% to 86% while operability dropped from 55% to 43%. No tool addressed food safety. Journal data-sharing policies increased what authors share but not what reviewers can run. Tools became easier to find but harder to execute. Strengthening C1, C4, and C6 would turn documented artifacts into workflows that external laboratories can replay."

    "abstract": "As networks evolve toward 5G Standalone and 6G, operators face orchestration challenges that exceed the limits of static automation and Deep Reinforcement Learning. Although Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a path toward intent-based networking, they introduce stochastic risks, including topology hallucinations and policy non-compliance. To mitigate this, we propose Graph-Symbolic Policy Enforcement and Control (G-SPEC), a neuro-symbolic framework that constrains probabilistic planning with deterministic verification. The architecture relies on a Governance Triad - a telecom-adapted agent (TSLAM-4B), a Network Knowledge Graph (NKG), and SHACL constraints. We evaluated G-SPEC on a simulated 450-node 5G Core, achieving zero safety violations and a 94.1% remediation success rate, significantly outperforming the 82.4% baseline. Ablation analysis indicates that NKG validation drives the majority of safety gains (68%), followed by SHACL policies (24%). Scalability tests on topologies ranging from 10K to 100K nodes demonstrate that validation latency scales as $O(k^{1.2})$ where $k$ is subgraph size. With a processing overhead of 142ms, G-SPEC is viable for SMO-layer operations."

Here, we present a scalable and reconfigurable silicon photonic integrated circuit capable of emulating arbitrary non-Hermitian time evolution with high precision. Using this programmable platform, we implement a two-band non-Hermitian Hamiltonian defined on a Klein-bottle topology a nonorientable parameter space that enables exceptional phases forbidden on orientable manifolds. Through an on-chip amplitude-and-phase reconstruction protocol, we retrieve the full complex Hamiltonian at multiple points in parameter space and experimentally map the associated Fermi arc where the imaginary eigenvalue gap closes. The orientation of the measured Fermi arc reveals a nontrivial exceptional topology: it implies the presence of same-charge EPs (or an EP monopole) that cannot annihilate locally on the Klein bottle. Our results demonstrate the first photonic realization of exceptional topology on a nonorientable manifold and establish a versatile platform for exploring exotic non-Hermitian and topological models relevant to classical and quantum photonics."

    "abstract": "The construction of robust solvers for linear systems obtained from the discretization of partial differential equations using Isogeometric Analysis is challenging since the condition number of the system matrix not only grows with the reciprocal square of the grid size (for second order problems), but also exponentially with the spline degree. The Fast Diagonalization method allows the construction of a preconditioner that is robust both in grid size and spline degree. Although this method is efficient in practice, its computational complexity is superlinear in the number of degrees of freedom. In this work, we construct a variant of the Fast Diagonalization method that can exploit the Fast Fourier Transformation. Note that, because of boundary effects, a Fourier Transformation cannot diagonalize the overall problem. We circumvent this issue using a stable splitting of the spline space. The resulting preconditioner is still robust with respect to the grid size and spline degree and can be realized with a computational complexity that grows almost linearly with the number of degrees of freedom."

Here we introduce Latent-X2, a frontier generative model that achieves this goal through zero-shot design of antibodies with strong binding affinities, drug-like properties, and, for the first time for any de novo generated antibody, confirmed low immunogenicity in human donor panels. Latent-X2 is an all-atom model conditioned on target structure, epitope specification, and optional antibody framework, jointly generating sequences and structures while modelling the bound complex. Testing only 4 to 24 designs per target in each modality, we successfully generated VHH and scFv antibodies against 9 of 18 evaluated targets, achieving a 50% target-level success rate with picomolar to nanomolar binding affinities. Designed molecules exhibit developability profiles that match or exceed those of approved antibody therapeutics, including expression yield, aggregation propensity, polyreactivity, hydrophobicity, and thermal stability, without optimization, filtering, or selection. In the first immunogenicity assessment of any AI-generated antibody, representative de novo VHH binders targeting TNFL9 exhibit both potent target engagement and low immunogenicity across T-cell proliferation and cytokine release assays. The model generalizes beyond antibodies: against K-Ras, long considered undruggable, we generated macrocyclic peptide binders competitive with trillion-scale mRNA display screens. These properties emerge directly from the model, demonstrating the therapeutic viability of zero-shot molecular design, now available without AI infrastructure or coding expertise at https://platform.latentlabs.com."

    "abstract": "Spiral structures are one of the most common features in galaxies, yet their origins and evolution remain debated. Stellar age distributions offer crucial insights into galaxy evolution and star formation, though environmental effects can obscure the intrinsic age patterns. Using the Auriga cosmological gravo-magnetohydrodynamical zoom-in simulations, we investigate the azimuthal age distribution of young stars (<2 Gyr) in a sample of five Milky Way-mass spiral galaxies over the past 5 Gyr. We quantify the age gradients across spiral arms using the mean age offset ($Δτ$) and the non-overlap fraction ($f_{non-overlap}$). We further analyse the impact of mergers and fly-by events on the age gradients. Our results show that Auriga spiral galaxies generally feature younger stars in their leading edges compared to the trailing edges, with a typical $Δτ$ between 30 and 80 Myr. However, gas-rich interactions can disrupt this age offset, resulting in similar age distributions on each side of the spiral arms. In three snapshots, we observe similar mean ages on both sides of spiral arms but differing age distribution broadness, coinciding with satellite interactions crossing the host galaxy's disc plane. Our simulation data suggest that the typical azimuthal age variation recovers within ~600 Myr after galaxy interactions. This work highlights the transient role of environmental interactions in shaping spiral arm age patterns."

    "abstract": "We study the two-dimensional hierarchical rectangle packing problem, motivated by applications in analog integrated circuit layout, facility layout, and logistics. Unlike classical strip or bin packing, the dimensions of the container are not fixed, and the packing is inherently hierarchical: each item is either a rectangle or a block occurrence, whose dimensions are a solution of another packing problem. This recursive structure reflects real-world scenarios in which components, boxes, or modules must be packed within higher-level containers. We formally define the problem and propose exact formulations in Mixed-Integer Linear Programming and Constraint Programming. Given the computational difficulty of solving complex packing instances directly, we propose decomposition heuristics. First, we implement an existing Bottom-Up baseline method that solves subblocks before combining them at higher levels. Building upon this, we introduce a novel multilevel Logic-based Benders Decomposition method. This heuristic method dynamically refines block dimension constraints, eliminating the need for manual selection of candidate widths or aspect ratios. Experiments on synthetic instances with up to seven hierarchy levels, 80 items per block, and limited computation time show that the proposed decomposition significantly outperforms both monolithic formulations and the Bottom-Up method in terms of solution quality and scalability."

However, many deployed memory systems primarily optimize compression and storage, with comparatively less emphasis on explicit, closed-loop control of memory retrieval. From this observation, we build memory retrieval as an autonomous, accurate, and compatible agent system, named MemR$^3$, which has two core mechanisms: 1) a router that selects among retrieve, reflect, and answer actions to optimize answer quality; 2) a global evidence-gap tracker that explicitly renders the answering process transparent and tracks the evidence collection process. This design departs from the standard retrieve-then-answer pipeline by introducing a closed-loop control mechanism that enables autonomous decision-making. Empirical results on the LoCoMo benchmark demonstrate that MemR$^3$ surpasses strong baselines on LLM-as-a-Judge score, and particularly, it improves existing retrievers across four categories with an overall improvement on RAG (+7.29%) and Zep (+1.94%) using GPT-4.1-mini backend, offering a plug-and-play controller for existing memory stores."

    "abstract": "Anonymous credentials (ACs) are a crucial cryptographic tool for privacy-preserving authentication in decentralized networks, allowing holders to prove eligibility without revealing their identity. However, a major limitation of standard ACs is the disclosure of the issuer's identity, which can leak sensitive contextual information about the holder. Issuer-hiding ACs address this by making a credential's origin indistinguishable among a set of approved issuers. Despite this advancement, existing solutions suffer from practical limitations that hinder their deployment in decentralized environments: unflexible credential models that restrict issuer and holder autonomy, flawed revocation mechanisms that compromise security, and weak attribute hiding that fails to meet data minimization principles. This paper introduces a new scheme called IRAC to overcome these challenges. We propose a flexible credential model that employs vector commitments with a padding strategy to unify credentials from heterogeneous issuers, enabling privacy-preserving authentication without enforcing a global static attribute set or verifier-defined policies. Furthermore, we design a secure decentralized revocation mechanism where holders prove non-revocation by demonstrating their credential's hash lies within a gap in the issuer's sorted revocation list, effectively decoupling revocation checks from verifier policies while maintaining issuer anonymity. IRAC also strengthens attribute hiding by utilizing zk-SNARKs and vector commitments, allowing holders to prove statements about their attributes without disclosing the attributes themselves or the credential structure. Security analysis and performance evaluations demonstrate its practical feasibility for decentralized networks, where presenting a credential can be finished in 1s."

From this perspective, we treat manifold functions as elements of the dual space. By expanding them in the dual space based on appropriate approximating sequence of bases, we obtain a corresponding method for encoding manifold functions, that is MFE. Especially, we prove that MFE achieves super-algebraic convergence based on smooth bases commonly used in spectral methods, such as Legendre polynomials and Fourier basis. We further extend MFE to handle more complex cases, including joint manifold functions of different dimensions and manifold functions with different measures. In addition, we show the approximation theory for MFE-based operator learning, in particular learning the solution mappings of PDEs defined on varying domains, together with several numerical experiments including the 2-d Poisson equation and the 3-d elasticity problem on the real-world bearing."

However, serving multiple fine-tuned LLMs via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in serverless environments faces critical challenges: reactive adapter loading causes significant cold start latency, and frequent adapter swapping leads to severe GPU memory fragmentation. In this paper, we present Predictive-LoRA (P-LoRA), a proactive and fragmentation-aware serverless inference system for LoRA-based LLMs. P-LoRA introduces two key innovations: (1) a lightweight LSTM-based traffic predictor that forecasts adapter demand and proactively prefetches hot adapters from host memory to GPU, reducing cold start latency by up to 68%; and (2) a page-based adapter memory management mechanism inspired by operating system virtual memory, which keeps GPU memory utilization above 87% even under heterogeneous adapter ranks. We evaluate P-LoRA using production-like workloads derived from the Azure Functions trace. Experimental results demonstrate that P-LoRA achieves 1.52x higher throughput than S-LoRA while reducing the average Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) by 35% under high concurrency scenarios."

An important class of such media lacks a single characteristic relaxation timescale when subjected to a time-dependent stress. Rather, the stress response spans a broad continuum of timescales, a behavior naturally described by a scale-free, fractal-like power-law relaxation modulus. Using a generalization of the fractional Langevin equation, we investigate an active Brownian particle embedded in a power-law viscoelastic environment with translational and rotational dynamics governed by independent fractional orders. We solve the model analytically, develop a numerical scheme to validate the theoretical predictions, and provide tools that can be used in further studies. A rich variety of diffusion regimes emerges, which modify the intermediate-time behavior of the mean squared displacement. Notably, we find that the competition between translational and rotational contributions favors a superdiffusive persistence over the standard ballistic motion, and over-stretches its characteristic timescale, fundamentally altering the standard relation between persistence and propulsion in active matter."

    "abstract": "In distributed computing systems, reducing the communication load during the data shuffling phase is a critical challenge, as excessive inter-node transmissions are a major performance bottleneck. One promising approach to alleviate this burden is Embedded Index Coding (EIC), which exploits cached data at user nodes to encode transmissions more efficiently. However, most prior work on EIC has focused on minimizing code length in wired, error-free environments-an objective often suboptimal for wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where channel conditions and spatial multiplexing gains must be considered. This paper investigates the joint design of EIC and transmit beamforming in MIMO systems to minimize total transmission time, an NP-hard problem. We first present a conventional optimization method that determines the optimal EIC via exhaustive search. To address its prohibitive complexity and adapt to dynamic wireless environments, we propose a novel, low-complexity multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. The proposed framework enables decentralized agents to act on local observations while effectively managing the hybrid action space of discrete EIC selection and continuous beamforming design. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MARL-based approach achieves near-optimal performance with significantly reduced complexity, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality for real-world wireless systems."

    "abstract": "Recognizing whether outputs from large language models (LLMs) contain faithfulness hallucination is crucial for real-world applications, e.g., retrieval-augmented generation and summarization. In this paper, we introduce FaithLens, a cost-efficient and effective faithfulness hallucination detection model that can jointly provide binary predictions and corresponding explanations to improve trustworthiness. To achieve this, we first synthesize training data with explanations via advanced LLMs and apply a well-defined data filtering strategy to ensure label correctness, explanation quality, and data diversity. Subsequently, we fine-tune the model on these well-curated training data as a cold start and further optimize it with rule-based reinforcement learning, using rewards for both prediction correctness and explanation quality. Results on 12 diverse tasks show that the 8B-parameter FaithLens outperforms advanced models such as GPT-4.1 and o3. Also, FaithLens can produce high-quality explanations, delivering a distinctive balance of trustworthiness, efficiency, and effectiveness."

    "abstract": "Hackathons have emerged as dynamic platforms for fostering innovation, collaboration, and skill development in the technology sector. Structural differences across hackathon formats raise important questions about how event design can shape student learning experiences and engagement. This study examines two distinct hackathon formats: a gender-specific hackathon (GS) and a regular institutional hackathon (RI). Using a mixed-methods approach, we analyze variations in team dynamics, project themes, role assignments, and environmental settings. Our findings indicate that GS hackathon foster a collaborative and supportive atmosphere, emphasizing personal growth and community learning, with projects often centered on health and well-being. In contrast, RI hackathon tend to promote a competitive, outcome-driven environment, with projects frequently addressing entertainment and environmental sustainability. Based on these insights, we propose a hybrid hackathon model that combines the strengths of both formats to balance competition with inclusivity. This work contributes to the design of more engaging, equitable, and pedagogically effective hackathon experiences."

    "abstract": "Offline Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) learns rewards and policies aligned with human preferences without the need for extensive reward engineering and direct interaction with human annotators. However, ensuring safety remains a critical challenge across many domains and tasks. Previous works on safe RL from human feedback (RLHF) first learn reward and cost models from offline data, then use constrained RL to optimize a safe policy. While such an approach works in the contextual bandits settings (LLMs), in long horizon continuous control tasks, errors in rewards and costs accumulate, leading to impairment in performance when used with constrained RL methods. To address these challenges, (a) instead of indirectly learning policies (from rewards and costs), we introduce a framework that learns a policy directly based on pairwise preferences regarding the agent's behavior in terms of rewards, as well as binary labels indicating the safety of trajectory segments; (b) we propose \\textsc{PreSa} (Preference and Safety Alignment), a method that combines preference learning module with safety alignment in a constrained optimization problem. This optimization problem is solved within a Lagrangian paradigm that directly learns reward-maximizing safe policy \\textit{without explicitly learning reward and cost models}, avoiding the need for constrained RL; (c) we evaluate our approach on continuous control tasks with both synthetic and real human feedback. Empirically, our method successfully learns safe policies with high rewards, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, and offline safe RL approaches with ground-truth reward and cost."

    "abstract": "The fast online recommendation is critical for applications with large-scale databases; meanwhile, it is challenging to provide accurate recommendations in sparse scenarios. Hash technique has shown its superiority for speeding up the online recommendation by bit operations on Hamming distance computations. However, existing hashing-based recommendations suffer from low accuracy, especially with sparse settings, due to the limited representation capability of each bit and neglected inherent relations among users and items. To this end, this paper lodges a Collaborative Group-Aware Hashing (CGAH) method for both collaborative filtering (namely CGAH-CF) and content-aware recommendations (namely CGAH) by integrating the inherent group information to alleviate the sparse issue. Firstly, we extract inherent group affinities of users and items by classifying their latent vectors into different groups. Then, the preference is formulated as the inner product of the group affinity and the similarity of hash codes. By learning hash codes with the inherent group information, CGAH obtains more effective hash codes than other discrete methods with sparse interactive data. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show the superior performance of our proposed CGAH and CGAH-CF over the state-of-the-art discrete collaborative filtering methods and discrete content-aware recommendations under different sparse settings."

To solve this challenge, we propose LoLA (Long Horizon Latent Action Learning), a framework designed for robot manipulation that integrates long-term multi-view observations and robot proprioception to enable multi-step reasoning and action generation. We first employ Vision-Language Models to encode rich contextual features from historical sequences and multi-view observations. We further introduces a key module, State-Aware Latent Re-representation, which transforms visual inputs and language commands into actionable robot motion space. Unlike existing VLA approaches that merely concatenate robot proprioception (e.g., joint angles) with VL embeddings, this module leverages such robot states to explicitly ground VL representations in physical scale through a learnable \"embodiment-anchored\" latent space. We trained LoLA on diverse robotic pre-training datasets and conducted extensive evaluations on simulation benchmarks (SIMPLER and LIBERO), as well as two real-world tasks on Franka and Bi-Manual Aloha robots. Results show that LoLA significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods (e.g., pi0), particularly in long-horizon manipulation tasks."

The recent increasing demand for edge computing and AI advancements drives the growth of data center storage capacity. Energy efficiency is a cost-effective way to combat climate change, cut energy costs, improve business competitiveness, and promote IT and environmental sustainability. Thus, optimizing data center energy management is the most important factor in the sustainability of the world. Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) is used to represent the operational efficiency of the data center. Predicting PUE using Neural Networks provides an understanding of the effect of each feature on energy consumption, thus enabling targeted modifications of those key features to improve energy efficiency. In this paper, we have developed Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) based PUE prediction model and compared the model performance with GRU. The data set comprises 52,560 samples with 117 features using EnergyPlus, simulating a DC in Singapore. Sets of the most relevant features are selected using the Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) algorithm for different parameter settings. These feature sets are used to find the optimal hyperparameter configuration and train the BiGRU model. The performance of the optimized BiGRU-based PUE prediction model is then compared with that of GRU using mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared metrics."

A considerable challenge for modern low-shot counters are dense regions with small objects. While total counts in such situations are typically well addressed by density-based counters, their usefulness is limited by poor localization capabilities. This is better addressed by point-detection-based counters, which are based on query-based detectors. However, due to limited number of pre-trained queries, they underperform on images with very large numbers of objects, and resort to ad-hoc techniques like upsampling and tiling. We propose CoDi, the first latent diffusion-based low-shot counter that produces high-quality density maps on which object locations can be determined by non-maxima suppression. Our core contribution is the new exemplar-based conditioning module that extracts and adjusts the object prototypes to the intermediate layers of the denoising network, leading to accurate object location estimation. On FSC benchmark, CoDi outperforms state-of-the-art by 15% MAE, 13% MAE and 10% MAE in the few-shot, one-shot, and reference-less scenarios, respectively, and sets a new state-of-the-art on MCAC benchmark by outperforming the top method by 44% MAE.

One of the challenges is apple pose estimation, where key points, such as the calyx, are often occluded. Recently developed pose estimation methods no longer rely on these key points, but still require them for annotations, making annotating challenging and time-consuming. Due to the abovementioned occlusions, there can be conflicting and missing annotations of the same fruit between different images. Novel 3D reconstruction methods can be used to simplify annotating and enlarge datasets. We propose a novel pipeline consisting of 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct an orchard scene, simplified annotations, automated projection of the annotations to images, and the training and evaluation of a pose estimation method. Using our pipeline, 105 manual annotations were required to obtain 28,191 training labels, a reduction of 99.6%. Experimental results indicated that training with labels of fruits that are $\\leq95\\%$ occluded resulted in the best performance, with a neutral F1 score of 0.927 on the original images and 0.970 on the rendered images. Adjusting the size of the training dataset had small effects on the model performance in terms of F1 score and pose estimation accuracy. It was found that the least occluded fruits had the best position estimation, which worsened as the fruits became more occluded. It was also found that the tested pose estimation method was unable to correctly learn the orientation estimation of apples."

We frame both tasks as sequential, tool-guided decisions and introduce MolAct, an agentic reinforcement learning framework that employs a two-stage training paradigm: first building editing capability, then optimizing properties while reusing the learned editing behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize molecular design as an Agentic Reinforcement Learning problem, where an LLM agent learns to interleave reasoning, tool-use, and molecular optimization. The framework enables agents to interact in multiple turns, invoking chemical tools for validity checking, property assessment, and similarity control, and leverages their feedback to refine subsequent edits. We instantiate the MolAct framework to train two model families: MolEditAgent for molecular editing tasks and MolOptAgent for molecular optimization tasks. In molecular editing, MolEditAgent-7B delivers 100, 95, and 98 valid add, delete, and substitute edits, outperforming strong closed \"thinking\" baselines such as DeepSeek-R1; MolEditAgent-3B approaches the performance of much larger open \"thinking\" models like Qwen3-32B-think. In molecular optimization, MolOptAgent-7B (trained on MolEditAgent-7B) surpasses the best closed \"thinking\" baseline (e.g., Claude 3.7) on LogP and remains competitive on solubility, while maintaining balanced performance across other objectives. These results highlight that treating molecular design as a multi-step, tool-augmented process is key to reliable and interpretable improvements."

Firstly, the general theoretical framework of optimizing the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) scheme based on the dynamical quantum geometric tensor is given, and then the dynamical quantum geometric tensor and the nonadiabatic transition rate are calculated by taking the detuned $Λ$-type three-level system and tripod-type four-level system for example. Secondly, the transfer dynamics of the particle population of the system are investigated in detail. For a three-level system, the optimal STIRAP scheme has an efficiency of over 98\\% in transferring the population to the final state, while the transfer efficiency of traditional STIRAP is about 72\\%. The superposition states with arbitrary proportions can be efficiently prepared for a four-level system due to the decoupling of the degenerate dark states. Finally, the influences of system parameters, such as the operation time of the Rabi pulses, the amplitude fluctuation and the single-photon detuning, on the transfer process are discussed. Especially, the phenomenon of the adiabatic resonance transfer is revealed. Choosing the pulse parameters in the resonance window can reduce the infidelity of the population transfer to below $10^{-3}$. It is found that the optimal STIRAP scheme by the dynamical quantum geometric tensor provides faster and more efficient transfer than the traditional STIRAP scheme."

In this study, we demonstrate that such behavior can also arise in a single-network superconducting system that features two distinct types of interactions: short-range electrical connectivity and long-range thermal dependency. Using experimental and simulation methods, we show that when sufficient heat is dissipated within a single-layer disordered superconducting network, the system undergoes a mixed-order phase transition marked by both a discontinuous change in resistance and critical scaling behavior. We find that the emergence and characteristics of these abrupt transitions depend critically on the thermal conductivity of the underlying substrate, establishing heat flow as the origin of the unique phase transition. Additionally, both experimental and numerical results reveal long-lived transient states and scaling dynamics near the critical point, consistent with spontaneous branching processes observed in interdependent networks theory. These findings strongly demonstrate that complex critical phenomena, such as mixed-order transitions, previously attributed to structurally interdependent systems, can also arise within single-layer physical systems when dual interactions coexist. Our results broaden the scope of the theory and experiments of phase transitions in interdependent networks and suggest new ways to design and control phase changes in physical, biological, and technological systems where two interactions are present."

    "abstract": "Binaural reproduction is gaining increasing attention with the rise of devices such as virtual reality headsets, smart glasses, and head-tracked headphones. Achieving accurate binaural signals with these systems is challenging, as they often employ arbitrary microphone arrays with limited spatial resolution. The Binaural Signals Matching with Magnitude Least-Squares (BSM-MagLS) method was developed to address limitations of earlier BSM formulations, improving reproduction at high frequencies and under head rotation. However, its accuracy still degrades as head rotation increases, resulting in spatial and timbral artifacts, particularly when the virtual listener's ear moves farther from the nearest microphones. In this work, we propose the integration of deep learning with BSM-MagLS to mitigate these degradations. A post-processing framework based on the SpatialNet network is employed, leveraging its ability to process spatial information effectively and guided by both signal-level loss and a perceptually motivated binaural loss derived from a theoretical model of human binaural hearing. The effectiveness of the approach is investigated in a simulation study with a six-microphone semicircular array, showing its ability to perform robustly across head rotations. These findings are further studied in a listening experiment across different reverberant acoustic environments and head rotations, demonstrating that the proposed framework effectively mitigates BSM-MagLS degradations and provides robust correction across substantial head rotations."

While this approach can generate high-quality videos, it suffers from slow convergence and is computationally expensive when generating long videos. In this paper, we introduce SemanticGen, a novel solution to address these limitations by generating videos in the semantic space. Our main insight is that, due to the inherent redundancy in videos, the generation process should begin in a compact, high-level semantic space for global planning, followed by the addition of high-frequency details, rather than directly modeling a vast set of low-level video tokens using bi-directional attention. SemanticGen adopts a two-stage generation process. In the first stage, a diffusion model generates compact semantic video features, which define the global layout of the video. In the second stage, another diffusion model generates VAE latents conditioned on these semantic features to produce the final output. We observe that generation in the semantic space leads to faster convergence compared to the VAE latent space. Our method is also effective and computationally efficient when extended to long video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemanticGen produces high-quality videos and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and strong baselines."

We find that, in contrast to generative settings, MLP layers are substantially more prunable, while attention layers remain critical for semantic aggregation. Building on this insight, we propose EffiR, a framework for developing efficient retrievers that performs large-scale MLP compression through a coarse-to-fine strategy (coarse-grained depth reduction followed by fine-grained width reduction), combined with retrieval-specific fine-tuning. Across diverse BEIR datasets and LLM backbones, EffiR achieves substantial reductions in model size and inference cost while preserving the performance of full-size models."

    "abstract": "Divalent atoms have emerged as powerful alternatives to alkalis in ultracold atom platforms, offering unique advantages arising from their two-electron structure. Among these species, ytterbium (Yb) is especially promising, yet its anionic properties and its Rydberg spectrum remain comparatively unexplored. In this work, we perform a first and comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation of ultralong-range Rydberg molecules (ULRMs) of $^{174}$Yb in $6sns\\,^1S_0$ Rydberg states across nearly two decades in principal quantum number $n$ and three orders of magnitude in molecular binding energy. Using the Coulomb Green's function formalism, we compute Born-Oppenheimer molecular potentials describing the Rydberg atom in the presence of a ground-state perturber and achieve quantitative agreement with high-resolution molecular spectra. This enables the extraction of low-energy electron-Yb scattering phase shifts, including the zero-energy $s$-wave scattering length and the positions of two spin-orbit split $p$-wave shape resonances. Our results provide strong evidence that the Yb$^{-}$ anion exists only as a metastable resonance. We additionally show the sensitivity of ULRM spectra to the atomic quantum defects, using this to refine the value for the $6s23f\\, ^1F_3$ quantum defect. Together, these findings establish Yb ULRMs as a powerful probe of electron-Yb interactions and lay essential groundwork for future Rydberg experiments with divalent atoms."

    "abstract": "Large-scale autoregressive models pretrained on next-token prediction and finetuned with reinforcement learning (RL) have achieved unprecedented success on many problem domains. During RL, these models explore by generating new outputs, one token at a time. However, sampling actions token-by-token can result in highly inefficient learning, particularly when rewards are sparse. Here, we show that it is possible to overcome this problem by acting and exploring within the internal representations of an autoregressive model. Specifically, to discover temporally-abstract actions, we introduce a higher-order, non-causal sequence model whose outputs control the residual stream activations of a base autoregressive model. On grid world and MuJoCo-based tasks with hierarchical structure, we find that the higher-order model learns to compress long activation sequence chunks onto internal controllers. Critically, each controller executes a sequence of behaviorally meaningful actions that unfold over long timescales and are accompanied with a learned termination condition, such that composing multiple controllers over time leads to efficient exploration on novel tasks. We show that direct internal controller reinforcement, a process we term \"internal RL\", enables learning from sparse rewards in cases where standard RL finetuning fails. Our results demonstrate the benefits of latent action generation and reinforcement in autoregressive models, suggesting internal RL as a promising avenue for realizing hierarchical RL within foundation models."

Our approach introduces a customized sparse attention mechanism designed to reduce computational complexity while preserving text quality and coherence. In addition, we incorporate a soft absorbing state within the diffusion process to accelerate sequence reconstruction and improve generation precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoE-DiffuSeq significantly improves training efficiency and sampling speed compared to existing diffusion models. These advantages are particularly effective for long document scenarios, including scientific article generation, code repository modeling, and long form dialogue generation. Benchmark results further show that MoE-DiffuSeq improves efficiency, speed, accuracy, and expressiveness, advancing the practical applicability of diffusion models for high quality long form text generation."

The inclusion of Building Information Modeling (BIM) plays a central role in this shift, yet its influence on job satisfaction remains underexplored. In response, this study developed a human-centered measurement model for evaluating job satisfaction in BIM work environments by adapting Hackman and Oldham's Job Characteristics Model for the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry to create a survey that captured industry perspectives on BIM use and job satisfaction. The model uses Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling to analyze the survey results and identify what dimensions of BIM-related work affect job satisfaction. While it was hypothesized that BIM use increases job satisfaction, the results show that only some dimensions of BIM use positively impact BIM job satisfaction; the use of BIM does not guarantee an increase in overall job satisfaction. Additionally, more frequent BIM use was not associated with higher satisfaction levels. These findings suggest that in the AEC industry, sustainable job satisfaction depends less on technological autonomy and more on human-centric factors, particularly collaboration and meaningful engagement within digital workflows."

Most RNA molecules however function through dynamic and heterogeneous structural ensembles. Chemical probing methods (e.g., DMS probing) rely on selective chemical modification of accessible RNA nucleotides to infer base-pairing status, yet the resulting nucleotide-resolution data represent ensemble averages over dynamic RNA conformations. We present MERGE-RNA, a unified, physics-based framework that explicitly models the full experimental pipeline, from the thermodynamics of probe binding to the mutational profiling readout. By integrating measurements across probe concentrations and replicates, our model learns a small set of transferable and interpretable parameters together with minimal sequence-specific soft constraints. This enables the prediction of secondary structure ensembles that best explain the data and the detection of suboptmal structures involved in dynamic processes. We validate MERGE-RNA on diverse RNAs, showing that it achieves strong structural accuracy while preserving essential conformational heterogeneity. In a designed RNA for which we report new DMS data, MERGE-RNA detects transient intermediate states associated with strand displacement, dynamics that remain invisible to traditional methods."

In this work, we introduce a convolutional photonic accelerator that employs programmable kernels manifesting as trainable waveforms in the frequency domain to enable low-energy, high-throughput scalable image classification. The proposed scheme inherently provides dimensionality reduction and feature extraction directly in the optical domain. Numerical results targeting the Fashion-MNIST show that by using only 16 optical nodes, the system's classification accuracy tops at 90.1% when typical backpropagation is used. Moreover, by adapting the training technique to the forward-forward approach, a marginal drop of 1% is recorded compared to the backpropagation scenario, thus showcasing the compatibility of the overall architecture with a hardware-friendly training approach. Finally, we experimentally implement the trained kernels using a programmable waveshaper. Despite the difference between the simulated and experimentally generated transfer functions of the programmable kernels, the classification accuracy based on the experimentally obtained kernels exhibits a marginal 0.2% reduction, proving the validity of the idea and its high robustness to variations of the frequency-applied complex weights."

This paper describes a simple and efficient recipe for layer selection that uses layer importance scores derived from a small amount of training on generic text data. Once the layers have been selected we use a recent pipeline for the distillation process itself \\citep[RADLADS;][]{goldstein2025radlads}, which consists of attention weight transfer, hidden state alignment, KL-based distribution matching, followed by a small amount of finetuning.

To bridge this gap across aspects of dataset, benchmark and model, we introduce DSR Suite. First, we propose an automated pipeline that generates multiple-choice question-answer pairs from in-the-wild videos for DSR. By leveraging modern vision foundation models, the pipeline extracts rich geometric and motion information, including camera poses, local point clouds, object masks, orientations, and 3D trajectories. These geometric cues enable the construction of DSR-Train for learning and further human-refined DSR-Bench for evaluation. Compared with previous works, our data emphasize (i) in-the-wild video sources, (ii) object- and scene-level 3D requirements, (iii) viewpoint transformations, (iv) multi-object interactions, and (v) fine-grained, procedural answers. Beyond data, we propose a lightweight Geometry Selection Module (GSM) to seamlessly integrate geometric priors into VLMs, which condenses question semantics and extracts question-relevant knowledge from pretrained 4D reconstruction priors into a compact set of geometry tokens. This targeted extraction avoids overwhelming the model with irrelevant knowledge. Experiments show that integrating DSR-Train and GSM into Qwen2.5-VL-7B significantly enhances its dynamic spatial reasoning capability, while maintaining accuracy on general video understanding benchmarks."

    "abstract": "We develop a probability-level, manifestly causal formalism for calculations in QFT. The approach involves an implicit summation over final states, which makes causality manifest since retarded propagators emerge naturally. This inclusive summation over final states may also offer insights into the cancellation of IR divergences in physical observables within gauge theories, in accordance with the BN and KLN theorems. To study this, we first conduct particle scattering calculations using conventional methods, determining the quark-antiquark production cross section at first-order in gluon corrections, with careful tracking and cancellation of both IR and UV divergences. We then apply the causal formalism to analogous processes in scalar field theory, introducing novel diagrams that represent algebraic terms at the probability level, akin to Feynman diagrams at the amplitude level. We present a list of rules that generate all probability-level diagrams for particle scattering processes in which one is fully inclusive over final states that contain no initial-state particles. We also investigate the Unruh effect through the lens of the causal formalism. We calculate the transition rate of an accelerating UdW detector coupled to a massive scalar field, from both the perspective of an inertial observer and an accelerating observer. We confirm that the two perspectives give the same transition rate, despite the Rindler observer describing the Minkowski vacuum state as a thermal bath of particles. Numerical results for the transition rate are presented, highlighting the transient effects caused by forcing the field to initially be in the Minkowski vacuum state. Finally, we review the literature regarding the response of an UdW detector on various trajectories in the spacetime of a (3+1)-D Schwarzschild black hole, with a view to extending the analysis in the future using our causal formalism."

When the space dimension is $2$ or when the damping is strong enough, the solution is global in time. In the second part of this work, a microscopic description of this model is introduced in terms of a system of stochastic moderately interacting particles. This system features two main characteristics: the interaction between particles happens through a singular (Coulomb-type) kernel which is attractive; and the particles are subject to demographic events, birth and death due to local competition with other particles. The latter induces a branching structure of the particle system. Then the main result of this work is the convergence of the empirical measure of the particle system towards the Keller--Segel PDE with logistic damping, with a rate of order $N^{-\\frac{1}{2(d+1)}}$."

Within the self-similar framework associated with the four-state Riemann problem, we construct a supersonic sonic patch solution that connects a strictly supersonic region to a sonic boundary along a pseudo streamline. The analysis is based on a characteristic decomposition combined with a partial hodograph transformation, through which the problem is reformulated as a degenerate hyperbolic system. We establish the existence of a globally defined supersonic solution and prove its uniform regularity up to the sonic curve.

The sequence generated by this method converges weakly to a minimizer of the objective function, and the function values converge at a fast rate of $\\mathcal{O}\\left( \\frac{1}{k^2} \\right)$. Moreover, if the objective function is strongly convex, the function values converge at a linear rate."

    "abstract": "We investigate the impact of quantum and thermal phase fluctuations on the suppression of superconducting order in two-dimensional systems. Within the two-dimensional quantum XY model in the phase representation, where on-site interaction terms govern quantum phase fluctuations, we perform extensive path-integral quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The resulting temperature-interaction phase diagram establishes the presence of a well-defined critical line ending at a quantum critical point at vanishing temperature with no indication of reentrant behavior. We further demonstrate that the resistance above the critical line reproduces the two expected different critical behaviors. For stronger interactions, above the quantum critical point, the system exhibits a crossover to an insulating regime at low temperatures. Finally, Monte Carlo calculations of current-current correlation functions enable us to extract the frequency-dependent conductivity in both superconducting and normal regimes, revealing a finite-frequency response that we attribute to quantum phase fluctuations."

This sensor limitation makes the system susceptible to drift from Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), particularly during long and fast flights with aggressive maneuvers. This paper presents the system developed for the championship, which achieved a competitive performance. Our approach corrected VIO drift by fusing its output with global position measurements derived from a YOLO-based gate detector using a Kalman filter. A perception-aware planner generated trajectories that balance speed with the need to keep gates visible for the perception system. The system demonstrated high performance, securing podium finishes across multiple categories: third place in the AI Grand Challenge with top speed of 43.2 km/h, second place in the AI Drag Race with over 59 km/h, and second place in the AI Multi-Drone Race. We detail the complete architecture and present a performance analysis based on experimental data from the competition, contributing our insights on building a successful system for monocular vision-based autonomous drone flight."

Building and operating such beams is an enormous technical challenge, yet they remain our most versatile tool for studying neutrinos. With new experiments such as DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande, and ideas such as neutrino factories, the next generation of beams will address open questions about neutrino mass ordering, CP violation, and possible physics beyond the standard model."

Relative to the standard one-state predictive regression, the state-switching specification increases both in-sample and out-of-sample performance for the set of popular predictors considered by \\textcite{WelchGoyal2008}, improving the out-of-sample performance of most predictors in economically meaningful ways. Second, I propose a new aggregate predictor, the Aligned Economic Index, constructed via partial least squares (PLS).

When the coherent drive is unable to lock the condensate phase, a gapless Goldstone mode is recovered in the Floquet-Bogoliubov dispersion of collective modes. We finally characterize regions of finite-wavevector dynamical instability, where the condensate tends to develop a supersolid-like spatial modulation. While our theoretical framework is directly related to recent experiments with exciton-polariton condensates, it can be applied to describe the effect of external injection also in a variety of spatially extended optical parametric oscillators or laser devices."

This methodology consists of first specifying the form of the equation of state (EoS), rather than prescribing an energy density profile. The usual EoS for the static and SS case, $ρ= -p_r$, is no longer satisfied due to the presence of the HG AE terms. We study three linear EoS associated with: an analogue charged BH, a non-trivial extremal BH, and an ultra-relativistic stiff fluid, respectively. The HG AE terms lead to exotic behaviors, both in the physical properties of the solutions and in their thermodynamics. In Case I, the matter sources can be interpreted as an exotic anisotropic matter distribution, giving rise to an effective electric-potential term in the geometry. In Case II, we obtain a non trivial extremal BH solution for which the event horizon is $n_{\\text{odd}}$ fold degenerate. In Case III, we find a solution with a non trivial repulsive potential, where the influence of the HG AE terms at short scales leads to the formation of a BH remnant whose horizon encloses a central singularity (instead of a de Sitter core as occurs in regular BHs)."

This information is used to identify subslices of codimension one in the complex-structure moduli space, where the Hodge structure splits in particular ways and different type IIB flux vacua emerge. We calculate the corresponding background fluxes and their potential that drives the IIB string compactification to these subslices and analyse the properties of the corresponding physical vacua. We address the question whether the subslices correspond to fixed loci of symmetries acting on the original family and whether they can be identified with consistent complex-structure moduli spaces of Picard-Fuchs systems with standard integral monodromy bases for fewer complex deformation parameters. We distinguish between supersymmetric vacua and singular subslices. In the latter case a standard geometrical basis can be expected if a physical transition leads to a smooth type II vacuum. In many cases the differential equations on the subslice are fulfilled by the restricted periods after adding an inhomogeneous term. This suggests that the resolution of the singularity provides three-chains and we indeed find that the corresponding integrals allow an integral expansion compatible with their interpretation as generating functions of disk instantons."

Two different schemes are considered to regularize the Hamiltonian constraint for the quantum dynamics. In the $μ_0$ scheme in which the quantum parameters are treated as constants, the equations of motion generated by the effective Hamiltonian are solved analytically. The resulting quantum-corrected effective spacetime obviously extends the effective spacetime previously obtained in the literature. In the new effective spacetime, the naked singularity and the central singularity presented in the classical JNW spacetime are resolved by a series of quantum bounces. In the scheme of choosing the quantum parameters as Dirac observables, the effective dynamics is also solved in the light of the solution in $μ_0$ scheme. It turns out that the resulting effective spacetime has singularities due to the appearance of the zero points of the time reparametrization functions. Hence, the effective theory in this scheme does not remain valid throughout the full spacetime."

Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) scans provide complementary information on acute and sub-acute ischemic changes; however, automated lesion delineation remains challenging due to variability in lesion appearance. In this work, we study ischemic stroke lesion segmentation using multimodal diffusion MRI from the ISLES 2022 dataset. Several state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based architectures, including U-Net variants, Swin-UNet, and TransUNet, are benchmarked. Based on performance, a dual-encoder TransUNet architecture is proposed to learn modality-specific representations from DWI and ADC inputs. To incorporate spatial context, adjacent slice information is integrated using a three-slice input configuration. All models are trained under a unified framework and evaluated using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). Results show that transformer-based models outperform convolutional baselines, and the proposed dual-encoder TransUNet achieves the best performance, reaching a Dice score of 85.4% on the test set. The proposed framework offers a robust solution for automated ischemic stroke lesion segmentation from diffusion MRI."

The differences in these architectures arise from the technology that enables the connectivity between physical qubits and the modularity required for the QEC gadgets, which is either based on laser-beam deflectors focused to independent modules hosting mid-size ion crystals, or integrated photonics guided to segmented modules of the trap and allowing for the manipulation of smaller ion crystals. Our approach integrates the transpilation of the QEC gadgets into native trapped-ion primitives and a detailed account of the specific laser addressing and ion transport leading to different amounts of crosstalk errors, motional excitation and idle qubit errors. Combining a microscopically-informed noise model with an efficient Pauli-frame simulator and different scalable decoders, we assess the near-term performance of the color-code memory and teleportation protocols on these architectures. Our analysis demonstrates that modular color-code teleportation is achievable in these near-term trapped-ion architectures, and identifies the integrated-photonics connectivity as the most promising route for longer-term scaling."

We explore exocentric video with ambient sensors as a non-intrusive, scalable alternative. While prior egocentric-wearable works predominantly adopt Global Alignment by encoding entire sequences into unified representations, this approach fails in exocentric-ambient settings due to two problems: (P1) inability to capture local details such as subtle motions, and (P2) over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns, causing misalignment between actions sharing similar temporal patterns with different spatio-semantic contexts. To resolve these problems, we propose DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework. This explicit decomposition preserves local details, while our novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering provide semantic grounding for context-aware alignment. To align the decomposed features, our two-stage approach establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via a spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles easy negatives, hard negatives, and false negatives. Comprehensive experiments with downstream tasks on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over adapted egocentric-wearable baselines."

Piezopolymer-based transducers offer a practical alternative; however, most existing studies focus on piezoelectric materials, while the influence of electrode material and electrode-polymer interface remains underexplored. This study leverages different interface-engineering strategies to examine the influence of electrode-piezopolymer interface morphology on piezoelectric, dielectric, and acoustic behavior in flexible transducers. Devices were fabricated using silver (Ag), gold (Au), graphene flakes (GF), laser-induced graphene (LIG), and Au-decorated LIG electrodes, enabling comparison across interfacial architectures. LIG-based transducers showed strong acoustic and piezoelectric output due to partial infiltration of the piezopolymer into the porous LIG network, which enhances interfacial contact and stress transfer. Au-based transducers achieved comparable acoustic output. In contrast, dense Ag electrodes and layered GF films provided limited coupling, resulting in reduced electromechanical response. LIG-based transducers exhibited the highest flexibility and durability, retaining stable performance after 10,000 bending cycles and an eight-week aging study, whereas GF, Ag, and Au devices degraded under bending, and Ag electrodes declined over time. These findings demonstrate that engineering the electrode-polymer interface is critical for high-performance flexible ultrasound transducers and identify LIG as a strong candidate for wearable imaging applications."

Such summaries can be consumed by static code analysis tools and also help developers understand the behavior of code segments, such as libraries, in order to evaluate their security implications when reused in applications. Our approach is implemented in a tool called Symmaries, which automates the generation of security summaries. We applied Symmaries to Java API libraries to extract their security specifications and to large real-world applications to evaluate its scalability. Our results show that the tool successfully scales to analyze applications with hundreds of thousands of lines of code, and that Symmaries achieves a promising precision depending on the heap model used.

It refers to a design style that enables systems to be developed as suites of small, loosely coupled, and autonomous components (services) that encapsulate functionality and communicate via language-agnostic APIs. However, defining appropriately sized services that capture cohesive subsets of system functionality remains challenging. Existing work often relies on the availability of documentation, access to project personnel, or a priori knowledge of the target number of services, assumptions that do not hold in many real-world scenarios. Our work addresses these limitations using a deep reinforcement learning-based approach to identify appropriately sized services directly from implementation artifacts. We present Rake, a reinforcement learning-based technique that leverages available system documentation and source code to guide service decomposition at the level of implementation methods. Rake does not require specific documentation or access to project personnel and is language-agnostic. It also supports a customizable objective function that balances modularization quality and business capability alignment, i.e., the degree to which a service covers the targeted business capability. We applied Rake to four open-source legacy projects and compared it with two state-of-the-art techniques. On average, Rake achieved 7-14 percent higher modularization quality and 18-22 percent stronger business capability alignment. Our results further show that optimizing solely for business context can degrade decomposition quality in tightly coupled systems, highlighting the need for balanced objectives."

As a transition region, the green valley galaxies can give clues about morphological transformation of galaxies from late- to early-types, and therefore the selection of green valley is of fundamental importance. Aims: In this work, for the first time, we evaluate the selection effects of the most used green valley selection criteria. The aim is to understand how these criteria affect the identification of green valley galaxies, their properties, and their impact on galaxy evolution studies. Methods: Using the SDSS optical and GALEX ultraviolet data at redshift z < 0.1, we selected the eight most commonly used criteria based on colours, specific star formation rate, and star formation rate vs. stellar mass. We then studied the properties of the green valley galaxies (their stellar mass, star formation rate, specific star formation rate, intrinsic brightness, morphological and pectroscopic types) for each selection criterion. Results: We found that when using different criteria, we select different types of galaxies. UV-optical colour-based criteria tend to select more massive galaxies, with lower star formation rates, with higher fractions of composite and elliptical galaxies, than when using pure optical colours. Our results also show that the colour-based criteria are the most sensitive to galaxy properties, rapidly changing the selection of green valley galaxies. Conclusions: Whenever possible, we suggest avoiding the green valley colour-based selection and using other methods or a combination of several, such as the star formation rate vs. stellar mass or specific star formation rate."

    "abstract": "Comparing white matter (WM) connections between adults and neonates using diffusion MRI (dMRI) can advance our understanding of typical brain development and potential biomarkers for neurological disorders. However, existing WM atlases are population-specific (adult or neonatal) and reside in separate spaces, preventing direct cross-population comparisons. A unified WM atlas spanning both neonates and adults is still lacking. In this study, we propose a neonatal/adult brain atlas (NABA), a WM tractography atlas built from dMRI data of both neonates and adults. NABA is constructed using a robust, data-driven fiber clustering pipeline, enabling group-wise WM atlasing across populations despite substantial anatomical variability. The atlas provides a standardized template for WM parcellation, allowing direct comparison of WM tracts between neonates and adults. Using NABA, we conduct four analyses: (1) evaluating the feasibility of joint WM mapping across populations, (2) characterizing WM development across neonatal ages relative to adults, (3) assessing sex-related differences in neonatal WM development, and (4) examining the effects of preterm birth. Our results show that NABA robustly identifies WM tracts in both populations. We observe rapid fractional anisotropy (FA) development in long-range association tracts, including the arcuate fasciculus and superior longitudinal fasciculus II, whereas intra-cerebellar tracts develop more slowly. Neonatal females exhibit faster overall FA development than males. Although preterm neonates show lower overall FA development rates, they demonstrate relatively higher FA growth in specific tracts, including the corticospinal tract, corona radiata-pontine pathway, and intracerebellar tracts. These findings demonstrate that NABA is a useful tool for investigating WM development across neonates and adults."

In the planetary and exoplanetary science literature, the units employed for ``flux'', ``insolation'', ``instellation'', etc., are often cumbersome or inconsistent.

Within this framework, we reinterpret classical arithmetic notions - such as the descent of varieties and of covers - and construct their topological analogues. We formalize the parallel setting between closed subgroups of the absolute Galois group and subgroups of the Mapping Class Group of a base space and their actions on fundamental groups. This provides an analogy between arithmetic and topological invariants, allowing us to define the groups of moduli, definition, and invariance in both settings. Using this unified perspective, some purely group-theoretic proofs provide results in both settings simultaneously. Applications include a topological analogue of Weil's Descent Theorem for mapping class groups and an adaptation of Débes and Douai's cohomological obstructions regarding descent of algebraic covers to the topological setting. Finally, we elevate these results to the categorical level. We demonstrate that the classical Weil cocycle condition is equivalent to the existence of a linearization in the language of equivariant categories. Applying this perspective to the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves $\\mathsf{D^b}(X)$, we show that the equivariant derived category $\\mathsf{D^b}(X)^G$, under the action induced by a Weil descent datum, recovers the derived category of the descended variety."

Silica-based materials, such as diamond-doped silica aerogels, have shown promising optical properties, but their impact on stratospheric chemistry, ozone one in particular, remains largely unknown. Here, we present first-principles molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the heterogeneous reaction between hydrogen chloride ($\\mathrm{HCl}$) and chlorine nitrate ($\\mathrm{ClONO_2}$), two main reservoirs of stratospheric chlorine and nitrogen species, on a dry, hydroxylated $α$-quartz silica interface. Our results reveal a barrierless reaction pathway toward the formation of chlorine gas ($\\mathrm{Cl}_2$), a major contributor to stratospheric ozone loss. We design a heterogeneous kinetic model informed by our MD simulation and available experimental data: despite the barrierless formation of $\\mathrm{Cl_2}$, the higher surface affinities and partial pressures of $\\mathrm{HNO_3}$ and $\\mathrm{HCl}$ compared to those of $\\mathrm{ClONO_2}$ result in a negligible reaction probability, $γ_\\mathrm{ClONO_2}$, upon chlorine nitrate collision with the silica surface. Since $γ_\\mathrm{ClONO_2}$ enters as a proportionality constant in the definition of the heterogeneous reaction rate, our kinetic model indicates that the injection of silica-based aerosols may have only a limited impact on stratospheric ozone depletion driven by $\\mathrm{HCl}$ and $\\mathrm{ClONO_2}$ chemistry. At the same time, our findings also underscore the scarcity of experimental data, the need of better theoretical frameworks for the inclusion of MD results into kinetic models, and the urgency for further experimental validations of silica-based SAI technologies before their deployment in climate intervention strategies."

    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that inference-time reasoning and reflection can improve text-to-image generation without retraining. However, existing approaches often rely on implicit, holistic critiques or unconstrained prompt rewrites, making their behavior difficult to interpret, control, or stop reliably. In contrast, large language models have benefited from explicit, structured forms of **thinking** based on verification, targeted correction, and early stopping. We introduce CRAFT (Continuous Reasoning and Agentic Feedback Tuning), a training-free, model-agnostic framework that brings this structured reasoning paradigm to multimodal image generation. CRAFT decomposes a prompt into dependency-structured visual questions, veries generated images using a vision-language model, and applies targeted prompt edits through an LLM agent only where constraints fail. The process iterates with an explicit stopping criterion once all constraints are satised, yielding an interpretable and controllable inference-time renement loop. Across multiple model families and challenging benchmarks, CRAFT consistently improves compositional accuracy, text rendering, and preference-based evaluations, with particularly strong gains for lightweight generators. Importantly, these improvements incur only a negligible inference-time overhead, allowing smaller or cheaper models to approach the quality of substantially more expensive systems. Our results suggest that explicitly structured, constraint-driven inference-time reasoning is a key ingredient for improving the reliability of multimodal generative models."

In this paper we present a theoretical framework to describe an inverse Compton scattering x-ray source for arbitrary interaction angles between the electron and laser pulse. Importantly the divergence of a tightly focused laser pulse will have a significant impact of the number of scattered x-rays. The parameters of the interaction geometry are optimized for two specific cases: head-on scattering; and a grazing co-propagating interaction angle. For head-on scattering we show that a tight symmetrically focused laser pulse, that balances laser intensity and interaction time, optimizes the x-ray brilliance. For a grazing angle geometry an elliptical focus of the laser pulse is required to mitigate a reduced interaction time. We find that the latter geometry is especially useful for soft x-ray generation."

Using the first technique, we measure a remarkably large Overhauser field of 3.1 T in a geometry close to the Faraday configuration for a 19.7 nm wide quantum well at a temperature of 1.6 K. A nuclear spin temperature of 6.4 $μ$K is measured at an external magnetic field of 0.006 T following an adiabatic sweep from 0.6 T. Despite the quadrupole-induced nuclear spin splitting inherent to nanostructures, the nuclear spin system is found to follow the predictions of spin temperature theory. Using the optical orientation of the photoluminescence, we investigated nuclear spin dynamics at millikelvin temperatures down to 300 mK. At a temperature of 500 mK, an Overhauser field of 160 mT is generated in an oblique but nearly Voigt magnetic field using low optical power to avoid heating. The nuclear polarization build-up time is of 150 s, consistent with earlier reports at higher temperatures, where hyperfine scattering on free photoexcited electrons governs relaxation. At 500 mK, the onset of dynamic self-polarization of nuclear spins is observed, which becomes more pronounced as the lattice temperature is further reduced to 300 mK. The estimated nuclear spin temperature in the dynamic self-polarization regime can be as low as 200 nK."

In this paper, we present a hybrid, physics-guided neural network-based approach that utilizes empirical formulas within the network to combine the advantages of both neural networks and traditional techniques. We evaluate the presented method using data obtained from four similar-sized cargo vessels and compare the results with those of a baseline neural network and a traditional approach that employs empirical formulas. The experimental results demonstrate that the physics-guided neural network approach achieves lower mean absolute error, root mean square error, and mean absolute percentage error for all tested vessels compared to both the empirical formula-based method and the base neural network."

Despite recent progress, existing approaches remain fundamentally limited. Training-free methods often suffer from signal degradation caused by diffusion inversion, while training-based methods, although achieving higher generation quality, are severely constrained by the scarcity of high-quality paired data and task formulations that cover only a narrow subset of editing operations. In addition, standard architectures typically decouple text and audio processing, limiting the ability to align instructions with specific acoustic contexts. To address these challenges, we propose MMEdit, an audio-language-model-driven framework for unified audio editing. We systematically extend task definitions to cover a comprehensive range of editing operations, including addition, replacement, removal, reordering, and attribute modification. Furthermore, we design a scalable data synthesis pipeline to construct large-scale paired datasets with fine-grained event-level annotations. To capture complex editing semantics, we integrate a Qwen2-Audio encoder with an MMDiT-based generator, enabling precise cross-modal alignment and localized editing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior editing localization accuracy, robust instruction following, and high fidelity in non-edited regions."

VQPrompt adds a lightweight bottleneck prompt; Moero embeds a sparse mixture of experts within a deep unrolled network with histogram-based routing. In the multivendor, multisite CMRxRecon25 benchmark, we evaluate fewshot and out-of-distribution generalization. On small datasets, k-space motion-plus-noise improves reconstruction; on the large benchmark it degrades performance, revealing sensitivity to augmentation ratio and schedule. VQPrompt produces modest and consistent gains with negligible memory overhead. Moero continues to improve after early plateaus and maintains baseline-like fewshot and out-of-distribution behavior despite mild overfitting, but sparse routing lowers PyTorch throughput and makes wall clock time the main bottleneck. These results motivate scale-aware augmentation and suggest prompt-based capacity scaling as a practical path, while efficiency improvements are crucial for sparse expert models."

    "abstract": "Data heterogeneity is a significant challenge in modern federated learning (FL) as it creates variance in local model updates, causing the aggregated global model to shift away from the true global optimum. Partial client participation in FL further exacerbates this issue by skewing the aggregation of local models towards the data distribution of participating clients. This creates additional variance in the global model updates, causing the global model to converge away from the optima of the global objective. These variances lead to instability in FL training, which degrades global model performance and slows down FL training. While existing literature primarily focuses on addressing data heterogeneity, the impact of partial client participation has received less attention. In this paper, we propose FedDPC, a novel FL method, designed to improve FL training and global model performance by mitigating both data heterogeneity and partial client participation. FedDPC addresses these issues by projecting each local update onto the previous global update, thereby controlling variance in both local and global updates. To further accelerate FL training, FedDPC employs adaptive scaling for each local update before aggregation. Extensive experiments on image classification tasks with multiple heterogeneously partitioned datasets validate the effectiveness of FedDPC. The results demonstrate that FedDPC outperforms state-of-the-art FL algorithms by achieving faster reduction in training loss and improved test accuracy across communication rounds."

However, the black-box nature of LLMs remains a major barrier to their adoption in high-stakes and safety-critical domains, where explainability and transparency are vital for trust, accountability, and effective human supervision. Despite increasing interest in explainable AI for software engineering, existing methods lack domain-specific explanations aligned with how practitioners reason about SE artifacts. To address this gap, we introduce FeatureSHAP, the first fully automated, model-agnostic explainability framework tailored to software engineering tasks. Based on Shapley values, FeatureSHAP attributes model outputs to high-level input features through systematic input perturbation and task-specific similarity comparisons, while remaining compatible with both open-source and proprietary LLMs. We evaluate FeatureSHAP on two bi-modal SE tasks: code generation and code summarization. The results show that FeatureSHAP assigns less importance to irrelevant input features and produces explanations with higher fidelity than baseline methods. A practitioner survey involving 37 participants shows that FeatureSHAP helps practitioners better interpret model outputs and make more informed decisions. Collectively, FeatureSHAP represents a meaningful step toward practical explainable AI in software engineering. FeatureSHAP is available at https://github.com/deviserlab/FeatureSHAP."

Hindustan Copper Limited (HCL), as India's sole vertically integrated copper producer, is uniquely positioned to pioneer co-recovery of REEs, advance research and development partnerships, and build a comprehensive supply chain. By embedding sustainability, ESG principles, and community trust in its strategy, HCL can evolve into a national champion in this domain."

    "abstract": "Recently, thermally-assisted-occupation density functional theory (TAO-DFT) [J.-D. Chai, J. Chem. Phys. 136, 154104 (2012)] has been demonstrated to be an efficient and accurate electronic structure method for studying the ground-state properties of large multi-reference (MR) systems at absolute zero. To explore the thermal equilibrium properties of large MR systems at finite electronic temperatures, in the present work, we propose the finite-temperature (FT) extension of TAO-DFT, denoted as FT-TAO-DFT. Besides, to unlock the dynamical information of large MR systems at finite temperatures, FT-TAO-DFT is combined with ab initio molecular dynamics, leading to FT-TAO-AIMD. In addition, we also develop FT-TAO-DFT-based quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM), denoted as FT-TAO-QM/MM, to provide a cost-effective description of the thermal equilibrium properties of a QM subsystem with MR character embedded in an MM environment at finite temperatures. Moreover, the FT-TAO-DFT, FT-TAO-AIMD, and FT-TAO-QM/MM methods are employed to explore the radical nature and infrared (IR) spectra of n-acenes (n = 2--6), consisting of n linearly fused benzene rings, in vacuum and in an argon (Ar) matrix at finite temperatures. According to our calculations, for n-acenes at 1000 K or below, the electronic temperature effects on the radical nature and IR spectra are very minor, while the nuclear temperature effects on these properties are noticeable. For n-acene in an Ar matrx at absolute zero, the Ar matrix has minimal impact on the radical nature of n-acene, while the co-deposition procedure of n-acene and Ar atoms may affect the IR spectrum of n-acene."

Specifically, we construct a comprehensive driving knowledge graph that encodes traffic laws, defensive driving principles, and ethical norms, complemented by an efficient LLM-based retrieval mechanism tailored for driving scenarios. Furthermore, we develop a human-preference dataset and train a Value Model to guide interpretable, value-aligned trajectory assessment. Experimental results show that our method substantially improves planning performance while remaining compatible with existing architectures. Notably, KnowVal achieves the lowest collision rate on nuScenes and state-of-the-art results on Bench2Drive."

    "abstract": "Fossil gas is sometimes presented as an enabler of variable solar and wind generation beyond 2050, despite being a primary source of greenhouse gas emissions from methane leakage and combustion. We find that balancing solar and wind generation with pumped hydro energy storage eliminates the need for fossil gas without incurring a cost penalty. However, many existing long-term electricity system plans are biased to rely on fossil gas due to using temporal aggregation methods that either heavily constrain storage cycling behaviour or lose track of the state-of-charge, failing to consider the potential of low-cost long-duration off-river pumped hydro, and ignoring the broad suite of near-optimal energy transition pathways. We show that a temporal aggregation method based on 'segmentation' (fitted chronology) closely resembles the full-series optimisation, captures long-duration storage behaviour (48- and 160-hour durations), and finds a near-optimal 100% renewable electricity solution. We develop a new electricity system model to rapidly evaluate millions of other near-optimal solutions, stressing the importance of modelling pumped hydro sites with a low energy volume cost (<US$50 per kilowatt-hour), long economic lifetime (~75 years), and low real discount rate akin to other natural monopolies (<=3%). Almost every region of the world has access to sufficient 50 - 5000 gigawatt-hour off-river pumped hydro options that enable them to entirely decarbonise their future electricity systems."

    "abstract": "Many engineering tasks require solving families of nonlinear constrained optimization problems, parametrized in setting-specific variables. This is computationally demanding, particularly, if solutions have to be computed across strongly varying parameter values, e.g., in real-time control or for model-based design. Thus, we propose to learn the mapping from parameters to the primal optimal solutions and to their corresponding duals using neural networks, giving a dense estimation in contrast to gridded approaches. Our approach, Optimality-informed Neural Networks (OptINNs), combines (i) a KKT-residual loss that penalizes violations of the first-order optimality conditions under standard constraint qualifications assumptions, and (ii) problem-specific output activations that enforce simple inequality constraints (e.g., box-type/positivity) by construction. This design reduces data requirements, allows the prediction of dual variables, and improves feasibility and closeness to optimality compared to penalty-only training. Taking quadratic penalties as a baseline, since this approach has been previously proposed for the considered problem class in literature, our method simplifies hyperparameter tuning and attains tighter adherence to optimality conditions. We evaluate OptINNs on different nonlinear optimization problems ranging from low to high dimensions. On small problems, OptINNs match a quadratic-penalty baseline in primal accuracy while additionally predicting dual variables with low error. On larger problems, OptINNs achieve lower constraint violations and lower primal error compared to neural networks based on the quadratic-penalty method. These results suggest that embedding feasibility and optimality into the network architecture and loss can make learning-based surrogates more accurate, feasible, and data-efficient for parametric optimization."

Here, we report a flexible CsSnI3 nanowire photodetector that achieves both high near-infrared photoresponse and long-term stability through synergistic aluminium-substrate contact engineering and dipolar interface modification. A 0.2 mm anodized aluminium foil serves as the flexible substrate, where localized laser ablation exposes metallic aluminium regions that act as reductive sites, effectively suppressing Sn2+ oxidation during nanowire growth. Simultaneously, a polar interlayer of 3-fluoro-2-nitroanisole is introduced to improve energy-level alignment, suppress interfacial deprotonation, and enhance charge extraction. The resulting device exhibits a responsivity of 0.39 A W-1, a specific detectivity of 1.38 * 10^13 Jones, and a wide linear dynamic range of 156 dB under 850 nm illumination. Moreover, the device retains over 85% of its initial photocurrent after 60 days in ambient air and maintains 94% of its initial photocurrent after 1000 bending cycles. This work establishes an effective strategy for stabilizing Sn-based perovskites toward high-performance flexible optoelectronic devices."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we revisit the construction of the hairy graph complexes associated to a cyclic operad, by exploiting modules over the appropriate twisted linearization of the downward Brauer category (and working over a field of characteristic zero). The different flavours (even or odd) of complexes appear as forms of Koszul complexes; the Koszul property of the linear category provides an elegant homological interpretation of their homology. This approach allows a second form of Koszul complex to enter the picture. For the `even' flavour, this corresponds to a precursor of the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex of the Conant-Vogtmann Lie algebra associated to a cyclic operad and a symplectic vector space (generalizing Kontsevich's Lie algebras). Again, the cohomology of the Koszul complex has an elegant interpretation. This sheds light on the relationship between the unstable case and Kontsevich's identification (generalized by Conant and Vogtmann) of the homology in the infinite-dimensional case with a form of graph homology (in the even case). We observe that this is already of interest in the case of an algebra with involution, viewed as a cyclic operad."

    "abstract": "High-resolution remote sensing image semantic segmentation (HRSS) is a fundamental yet critical task in the field of Earth observation. However, it has long faced the challenges of high inter-class similarity and large intra-class variability. Existing approaches often struggle to effectively inject abstract yet strongly discriminative semantic knowledge into pixel-level feature learning, leading to blurred boundaries and class confusion in complex scenes. To address these challenges, we propose Bidirectional Co-Refinement Framework for HRSS (BiCoR-Seg). Specifically, we design a Heatmap-driven Bidirectional Information Synergy Module (HBIS), which establishes a bidirectional information flow between feature maps and class embeddings by generating class-level heatmaps. Based on HBIS, we further introduce a hierarchical supervision strategy, where the interpretable heatmaps generated by each HBIS module are directly utilized as low-resolution segmentation predictions for supervision, thereby enhancing the discriminative capacity of shallow features. In addition, to further improve the discriminability of the embedding representations, we propose a cross-layer class embedding Fisher Discriminative Loss to enforce intra-class compactness and enlarge inter-class separability. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA, Vaihingen, and Potsdam datasets demonstrate that BiCoR-Seg achieves outstanding segmentation performance while offering stronger interpretability.

However, existing large-scale datasets like PubLayNet and DocBank lack fine-grained region labels and multilingual diversity, making them insufficient for representing complex document layouts. In contrast, human-annotated datasets such as M6Doc and D4LA offer richer labels and greater domain diversity, but are too small to train robust models and lack adequate multilingual coverage. This gap is especially pronounced for Indic documents, which encompass diverse scripts yet remain underrepresented in current datasets, further limiting progress in this space. To address these shortcomings, we introduce IndicDLP, a large-scale foundational document layout dataset spanning 11 representative Indic languages alongside English and 12 common document domains. Additionally, we curate UED-mini, a dataset derived from DocLayNet and M6Doc, to enhance pretraining and provide a solid foundation for Indic layout models. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning existing English models on IndicDLP significantly boosts performance, validating its effectiveness. Moreover, models trained on IndicDLP generalize well beyond Indic layouts, making it a valuable resource for document digitization. This work bridges gaps in scale, diversity, and annotation granularity, driving inclusive and efficient document understanding."

Our key principle is based on providing slices for (1) error reporting, (2) proof simplification, and (3) preserving successful verification results. By formally defining these different notions on HeyVL, an existing quantitative intermediate verification language (IVL), our concepts (and implementation) can be used to obtain diagnostics for a range of probabilistic programming languages. Slicing for error reporting is a novel notion of error localization for quantitative assertions. We demonstrate slicing-based diagnostics on a variety of proof rules such as quantitative versions of the specification statement and invariant-based loop rules, and formally prove the correctness of specialized error messages and verification hints. We implemented our user diagnostics into the deductive verifier Caesar. Our novel implementation -- called \\emph{Brutus} -- can search for slices which do or do not verify, corresponding to each of the three diagnostic notions. For error reporting (1), it exploits a binary search-based algorithm that minimizes error-witnessing slices. To solve for slices that verify (2 and 3), we empirically compare different algorithms based on unsatisfiable cores, minimal unsatisfiable subset enumeration, and a direct SMT encoding of the slicing problem. Our empirical evaluation of Brutus on existing and new benchmarks shows that we can find slices that are both small and informative."

Through ionic liquid gating, continuous doping control from the underdoped to the overdoped regime was achieved, revealing a symmetric superconducting dome that holds characteristic scaling relations mirror the behavior of strongly correlated superconductors. Strikingly, this system exhibits pronounced non-Fermi liquid transport near optimal doping, characterized by a quasi-linear temperature dependence of resistivity over a wide range and a T2-dependent Hall angle cotangent. The strength of the non-Fermi liquid transport is positively correlated with the superconducting transition temperature, with both evolving synchronously across the phase diagram.

To tackle the two limitations, we propose \\sysname, an LLM-based approach that provides information about where should be patched first. Furthermore, \\sysname improves the iterative repair strategy by assessing the quality of test-failing patches and selecting the best patch for the next iteration. We introduce two dimensions to assess the quality of patches: whether they introduce new vulnerabilities and the taint statement coverage. We evaluated \\sysname on a real-world C/C++ vulnerability repair dataset VulnLoc+, which contains 40 vulnerabilities and their Proofs-of-Vulnerability. The experimental results demonstrate that \\sysname exhibits substantial improvements compared with the Neural Machine Translation-based, Program Analysis-based, and LLM-based state-of-the-art vulnerability repair approaches. Specifically, \\sysname is able to generate 27 plausible patches, which is comparable to or even 8 to 22 more plausible patches than the baselines. In terms of correct patch generation, \\sysname repairs 8 to 13 additional vulnerabilities compared with existing approaches."

In this model, the dark energy component arises from a non-minimally coupled scalar field, decomposed into a smooth background (set to unity to recover General Relativity) and a rapidly varying, massive fluctuation that decays into the dark matter sector. In the near-GR limit, this setup provides a phenomenological extension of $Λ$CDM characterized by two additional parameters: the present-day value of the scalar fluctuation and a normalized decay rate. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of low-redshift cosmological data, comprising Type Ia Supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), and Cosmic Chronometer measurements, we find that the proposed model achieves a better overall fit than $Λ$CDM, while the Bayesian evidence remains statistically inconclusive given the inclusion of two extra parameters. The model predicts a moderate increase in the inferred value of $H_0$ and an improved consistency with DESI BAO data when adopting the SH0ES prior. Furthermore, describing dark matter particle creation as a transition phase in the late Universe offers an intriguing physical interpretation, potentially capturing features already present in current data and providing a promising avenue to explore extensions of the standard cosmological model within modified gravity frameworks."

Furthermore, inherent noise in network statistics induces a partial observability problem, which can mislead data-driven methods like Deep Reinforcement Learning. To bridge this gap, we propose Jazz, a system that re-architects multipath congestion control through a decoupled architecture that separates the decision-making ``brain'' from the in-kernel datapath, enabling it to operate on an external (edge) entity. At its core, Jazz employs a Transformer-based agent that processes sequences of historical observations to overcome the partial observability of single-step reinforcement learning. This allows it to learn and master fluctuating link conditions and intricate cross-path dependencies. Tested on a dual-band (5GHz/6GHz) Wi-Fi testbed, our implementation improves bandwidth efficiency by at least 2.85\\% over conventional methods and maintains 96.2\\% performance under 1\\% packet loss, validating this design as a practical blueprint for agile network intelligence."

A classic result of Goemans and Williamson [SODA 92:307-316] states that the problem of covering a proper set-family by a min-cost edge set admits approximation ratio $2$, by a classic primal-dual algorithm. However, there are several famous algorithmic problems whose set-family ${\\cal F}$ is disjointness-compliable but not symmetric -- among them $k$-Minimum Spanning Tree ($k$-MST), Generalized Point-to-Point Connection (G-P2P), Group Steiner, Covering Steiner, multiroot versions of these problems, and others. We will show that any such problem admits approximation ratio $O(α\\log τ)$, where $τ$ is the number of inclusion-minimal sets in the family ${\\cal F}$ that models the problem and $α$ is the best known approximation ratio for the case when $τ=1$. This immediately implies several results, among them the following two. (i) The first deterministic polynomial time $O(\\log n)$-approximation algorithm for the G-P2P problem. Here the $τ=1$ case is the $k$-MST problem. (ii) Approximation ratio $O(\\log^4 n)$ for the multiroot version of the Covering Steiner problem, where each root has its own set of groups. Here the $τ=1$ case is the Covering Steiner problem. We also discuss the parameterized complexity of covering a disjointness-compliable family ${\\cal F}$, when parametrized by $τ$. We will show that if ${\\cal F}$ is proper then the problem is fixed parameter tractable and can be solved in time $O^*(3^τ)$. For the non-symmetric case we will show that the problem admits approximation ratio between $α$ and $α+1$ in time $O^*(3^τ)$, which is essentially the best possible."

They are a primary tool to quantify the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity and assess associated risks for food security. Despite decades of development, state-of-the-art GGCMs still have substantial uncertainties in simulating complex biophysical processes due to limited process understanding. Recently, machine learning approaches trained on observational data have shown great potential in crop yield predictions. However, these models have not demonstrated improved performance over classical GGCMs and are not suitable for simulating crop yields under changing climate conditions due to problems in generalizing outside their training distributions. Here we introduce NeuralCrop, a hybrid GGCM that combines the strengths of an advanced process-based GGCM, resolving important processes explicitly, with data-driven machine learning components. The model is first trained to emulate a competitive GGCM before it is fine-tuned on observational data. We show that NeuralCrop outperforms state-of-the-art GGCMs across site-level and large-scale cropping regions. Across moisture conditions, NeuralCrop reproduces the interannual yield anomalies in European wheat regions and the US Corn Belt more accurately during the period from 2000 to 2019 with particularly strong improvements under drought extremes. When generalizing to conditions unseen during training, NeuralCrop continues to make robust projections, while pure machine learning models exhibit substantial performance degradation. Our results show that our hybrid crop modelling approach offers overall improved crop modeling and more reliable yield projections under climate change and intensifying extreme weather conditions."

Such a nova is sometimes called a superbright nova. Using our fully self-consistent nova outburst model combined with the optically thick winds on a $1.35 ~M_\\odot$ white dwarf (WD) with a mass accretion rate of $1\\times 10^{-11} ~M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, we have clarified that a strong reverse shock arises $0.3$ days after the outburst, which is just after the maximum expansion of the WD photosphere. The shocked shell is optically thick and expanding with the velocity of $\\sim 3500$ km~s$^{-1}$. Its $V$ brightness reaches maximum of $M_{V,\\rm max}=-10.2$ when the shocked shell expands to $R_{\\rm shell}\\sim 300 ~R_\\odot$ on day $\\sim 0.7$. After that, the shocked shell turns to optically thin and becomes fainter than the brightness of free-free emission from the nova wind. In chronological order, the optical brightness of free-free emission reaches maximum of $M_V=-9$ on day 0.3. However, it is overtaken on day 0.5--0.7 by the $\\sim$1 mag brighter luminosity of the optically thick shocked shell. The GeV gamma-ray flux reaches maximum on day 0.4 because the gamma-rays are emitted by the shock that arises on day 0.3. Our model consistently explains both the superbrightness and chronological order that the gamma-ray peak precedes substantially before the optical $V$ peak. We also present a similar light curve model for another superbright nova V1500 Cyg."

Beginning with the theory and background, we describe how the GW background from first-order PTs (FOPTs) and topological defects such as domain walls (DWs) can constrain the model parameter space at upcoming GW observatories. The first BSM scenario involves a flavon FOPT in two ultraviolet-complete models of the Froggatt-Nielsen (FN) mechanism. In both models, for the FN symmetry-breaking scale $v_s = 10^{4-7}\\,$GeV, the parameter space is constrained by GWs in upcoming observatories such as BBO, DECIGO, CE, and ET. However, the GW spectrum does not discriminate between the two models. Next, we consider FOPT in the doublet left-right symmetric model (DLRSM) during $SU(2)_R\\times U(1)_{B-L}$ breaking. For the breaking scale $v_R=20,\\,30,\\,50\\,$TeV, the parameter space can be constrained by GW observations at BBO, FP-DECIGO, and Ultimate DECIGO. A large number of points with detectable GW signals can be ruled out from the precise measurement of the trilinear Higgs coupling at future colliders. Finally, we discuss the GW spectrum generated by DWs formed after the spontaneous breaking of the discrete $\\mathcal{P}$-symmetry imposed on DLRSM. Using Bayesian analysis, we fit the 15-year NANOGrav dataset to the GW spectrum from DWs in DLRSM and determine the best-fit values of the DW surface tension and the bias potential. The techniques of this thesis can be applied to other BSM scenarios in the future."

Our results call into question the common interpretation that TVPs are due to \"structural instabilities\". Motivated by our theoretical analysis, we model a set of macroeconomic and financial variables as a TVP-VAR with a factor-structure in TVPs. This reveals that most instabilities are driven by a few factors, which comove strongly with measures of macroeconomic uncertainty and the contribution of finance to real economic activity, commonly emphasized as important sources of non-linearities in macroeconomics. Furthermore, our model yields improved forecasts relative to the standard TVP-VAR where TVPs evolve as independent random walks."

    "abstract": "Many existing audio processing and generation models rely on task-specific architectures, resulting in fragmented development efforts and limited extensibility. It is therefore promising to design a unified framework capable of handling multiple tasks, while providing robust instruction and audio understanding and high-quality audio generation. This requires a compatible paradigm design, a powerful backbone, and a high-fidelity audio reconstruction module. To meet these requirements, this technical report introduces QuarkAudio, a decoder-only autoregressive (AR) LM-based generative framework that unifies multiple tasks. The framework includes a unified discrete audio tokenizer, H-Codec, which incorporates self-supervised learning (SSL) representations into the tokenization and reconstruction process. We further propose several improvements to H-Codec, such as a dynamic frame-rate mechanism and extending the audio sampling rate to 48 kHz. QuarkAudio unifies tasks by using task-specific conditional information as the conditioning sequence of the decoder-only LM, and predicting discrete target audio tokens in an AR manner. The framework supports a wide range of audio processing and generation tasks, including speech restoration (SR), target speaker extraction (TSE), speech separation (SS), voice conversion (VC), and language-queried audio source separation (LASS). In addition, we extend downstream tasks to universal free-form audio editing guided by natural language instructions (including speech semantic editing and audio event editing). Experimental results show that H-Codec achieves high-quality audio reconstruction with a low frame rate, improving both the efficiency and performance of downstream audio generation, and that QuarkAudio delivers competitive or comparable performance to state-of-the-art task-specific or multi-task systems across multiple tasks."

    "abstract": "The pre-trained foundation models (PFMs) have become essential for facilitating large-scale multimodal learning. Researchers have effectively employed the ``pre-train, prompt, and predict'' paradigm through prompt learning to induce improved few-shot performance. However, prompt learning approaches for PFMs still follow a parametric learning paradigm. As such, the stability of generalization in memorization and rote learning can be compromised. More specifically, conventional prompt learning might face difficulties in fully utilizing atypical instances and avoiding overfitting to shallow patterns with limited data during the process of fully-supervised training. To overcome these constraints, we present our approach, named RetroPrompt, which aims to achieve a balance between memorization and generalization by decoupling knowledge from mere memorization. Unlike traditional prompting methods, RetroPrompt leverages a publicly accessible knowledge base generated from the training data and incorporates a retrieval mechanism throughout the input, training, and inference stages. This enables the model to actively retrieve relevant contextual information from the corpus, thereby enhancing the available cues. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a variety of datasets across natural language processing and computer vision tasks to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach, RetroPrompt, in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Through detailed analysis of memorization patterns, we observe that RetroPrompt effectively reduces the reliance on rote memorization, leading to enhanced generalization."

When using the full analytic covariance matrix without corrections, we observe apparent auto-correlation signals with significance up to $4σ$. However, this excess is also consistent with a mismatch between the statistical fluctuations estimated from the simulations and those present in the real data. Our findings therefore suggest that the parity-odd signal in the current DESI DR1 LRG sample is consistent with zero.

However, the radar signals are often sparse due to specular reflection, making the extraction of robust features from radar signals highly challenging. To address this, we present milliMamba, a radar-based 2D human pose estimation framework that jointly models spatio-temporal dependencies across both the feature extraction and decoding stages. Specifically, given the high dimensionality of radar inputs, we adopt a Cross-View Fusion Mamba encoder to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from longer sequences with linear complexity. A Spatio-Temporal-Cross Attention decoder then predicts joint coordinates across multiple frames. Together, this spatio-temporal modeling pipeline enables the model to leverage contextual cues from neighboring frames and joints to infer missing joints caused by specular reflections. To reinforce motion smoothness, we incorporate a velocity loss alongside the standard keypoint loss during training. Experiments on the TransHuPR and HuPR datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements, exceeding the baselines by 11.0 AP and 14.6 AP, respectively, while maintaining reasonable complexity.

Here, using molecular dynamics simulations combined with a state-of-the-art annealing protocol, we systematically investigate these behaviors in a model metallic glass across effective quenching rates spanning six orders of magnitude. Through a double-notch model, we show that the normalized interaction distance relative to the single shear band width is significantly larger in slowly quenched samples than in rapidly quenched ones. Atomic-scale analysis reveals that rapidly quenched samples exhibit a high density of pre-existing soft regions, which trigger correlated shear transformation zones through local vortex fields, resulting in propagation path locking and weak inter-band coupling. In contrast, slowly quenched samples exhibit enhanced structural heterogeneity and a right-shifted activation energy spectrum, promoting a single large-scale vortex field ahead of the shear band front. This field facilitates long-range stress transmission and induces shear band deflection, convergence, and coalescence, a transition resembling a \"shielding effect\" in fracture mechanics, where vortex-mediated disturbances destabilize the advancing shear band front. Our findings establish a direct microscopic connection between glass stability and shear-band-mediated plasticity and suggest that regulating shear band interactions offers a promising route to enhance the room-temperature ductility of metallic glasses."

Yet in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), this hierarchy remains poorly understood, as most studies focus on a narrow set of tasks. We introduce SpatialTree, a cognitive-science-inspired hierarchy that organizes spatial abilities into four levels: low-level perception (L1), mental mapping (L2), simulation (L3), and agentic competence (L4). Based on this taxonomy, we construct the first capability-centric hierarchical benchmark, thoroughly evaluating mainstream MLLMs across 27 sub-abilities. The evaluation results reveal a clear structure: L1 skills are largely orthogonal, whereas higher-level skills are strongly correlated, indicating increasing interdependency. Through targeted supervised fine-tuning, we uncover a surprising transfer dynamic-negative transfer within L1, but strong cross-level transfer from low- to high-level abilities with notable synergy. Finally, we explore how to improve the entire hierarchy. We find that naive RL that encourages extensive \"thinking\" is unreliable: it helps complex reasoning but hurts intuitive perception. We propose a simple auto-think strategy that suppresses unnecessary deliberation, enabling RL to consistently improve performance across all levels. By building SpatialTree, we provide a proof-of-concept framework for understanding and systematically scaling spatial abilities in MLLMs."

Motivated by this development, we introduce a channel-level analogue, which we call the random Stinespring superchannel. This consists in a procedure to transform $n$ parallel queries of an arbitrary quantum channel into $n$ parallel queries of the same uniformly random Stinespring isometry, via universal encoding and decoding operations that are efficiently implementable. When the channel is promised to have Choi rank at most $r$, the procedure can be tailored to yield a Stinespring environment of dimension $r$. As a consequence, quantum channel learning reduces to isometry learning, yielding a simple channel learning algorithm, based on existing isometry learning protocols, that matches the performance of the two recently proposed channel tomography algorithms. Complementarily, whereas the optimality of these algorithms had previously been established only up to a logarithmic factor in the dimension, we close this gap by removing this logarithmic factor from the lower bound. Taken together, our results fully establish the optimality of these recently introduced channel learning algorithms, showing that the optimal query complexity of learning a quantum channel with input dimension $d_A$, output dimension $d_B$, and Choi rank $r$ is $Θ(d_A d_B r)$."

The most imminent of these is the Payload for Ultrahigh Energy Observations (PUEO), a long-duration balloon-based experiment that will provide unprecedented sensitivity to neutrinos with energies in the range of ~ 1 - 1000 EeV. In this work, we assess the scientific reach of PUEO. In particular, we evaluate the sensitivity of this observatory to cosmogenic neutrinos and, in turn, to the proton fraction of the ultrahigh-energy cosmic-ray spectrum. We also consider the potential of PUEO to probe scenarios in which neutrinos are produced through the decays of ultraheavy dark matter particles or are radiated from cosmic strings. We find that PUEO will be able to constrain the proton composition of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays in scenarios that feature very strong source evolution and in which protons are accelerated to extremely high energies. Although gamma-ray observations are generally more sensitive to decaying particles than neutrino observations, PUEO is expected to set the strongest neutrino-detector constraints above 10^19 eV. PUEO will also provide the strongest constraints on some models of cosmic strings."

    "abstract": "The Airy wanderer line ensembles are infinite-parameter generalizations of the classical Airy line ensemble that arise naturally as scaling limits of inhomogeneous (spiked) models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. In this paper, we establish several structural properties of these ensembles. Our results show their laws depend continuously on the parameters, which encode the asymptotic slopes of the ensemble's curves near positive and negative infinity. We further prove that these ensembles admit multiple monotone couplings with respect to their parameters. Finally, we show that the Airy wanderer line ensembles are extreme points in the space of all Brownian Gibbsian line ensembles on the real line."

    "abstract": "As systems engineering (SE) objectives evolve from design and operation of monolithic systems to complex System of Systems (SoS), the discipline of Mission Engineering (ME) has emerged which is increasingly being accepted as a new line of thinking for the SE community. Moreover, mission environments are uncertain, dynamic, and mission outcomes are a direct function of how the mission assets will interact with this environment. This proves static architectures brittle and calls for analytically rigorous approaches for ME. To that end, this paper proposes an intelligent mission coordination methodology that integrates digital mission models with Reinforcement Learning (RL), that specifically addresses the need for adaptive task allocation and reconfiguration. More specifically, we are leveraging a Digital Engineering (DE) based infrastructure that is composed of a high-fidelity digital mission model and agent-based simulation; and then we formulate the mission tactics management problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and employ an RL agent trained via Proximal Policy Optimization. By leveraging the simulation as a sandbox, we map the system states to actions, refining the policy based on realized mission outcomes. The utility of the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator is demonstrated through an aerial firefighting case study. Our findings indicate that the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator not only surpasses baseline performance but also significantly reduces the variability in mission performance. Thus, this study serves as a proof of concept demonstrating that DE-enabled mission simulations combined with advanced analytical tools offer a mission-agnostic framework for improving ME practice; which can be extended to more complicated fleet design and selection problems in the future from a mission-first perspective."

    "abstract": "In this work, we model the end-to-end pipeline of the advertising ecosystem, allowing us to identify two main issues with the current trajectory of private advertising proposals. First, prior work has largely considered ad targeting and engagement metrics individually rather than in composition. This has resulted in privacy notions that, while reasonable for each protocol in isolation, fail to compose to a natural notion of privacy for the ecosystem as a whole, permitting advertisers to extract new information about the audience of their advertisements. The second issue serves to explain the first: we prove that \\textit{perfect} privacy is impossible for any, even minimally, useful advertising ecosystem, due to the advertisers' expectation of conducting market research on the results. Having demonstrated that leakage is inherent in advertising, we re-examine what privacy could realistically mean in advertising, building on the well-established notion of \\textit{sensitive} data in a specific context. We identify that fundamentally new approaches are needed when designing privacy-preserving advertising subsystems in order to ensure that the privacy properties of the end-to-end advertising system are well aligned with people's privacy desires."

    "abstract": "We show that the output of a ReLU neural network can be interpreted as the value of a zero-sum, turn-based, stopping game, which we call the ReLU net game. The game runs in the direction opposite to that of the network, and the input of the network serves as the terminal reward of the game. In fact, evaluating the network is the same as running the Shapley-Bellman backward recursion for the value of the game. Using the expression of the value of the game as an expected total payoff with respect to the path measure induced by the transition probabilities and a pair of optimal policies, we derive a discrete Feynman-Kac-type path-integral formula for the network output. This game-theoretic representation can be used to derive bounds on the output from bounds on the input, leveraging the monotonicity of Shapley operators, and to verify robustness properties using policies as certificates. Moreover, training the neural network becomes an inverse game problem: given pairs of terminal rewards and corresponding values, one seeks transition probabilities and rewards of a game that reproduces them. Finally, we show that a similar approach applies to neural networks with Softplus activation functions, where the ReLU net game is replaced by its entropic regularization."

    "abstract": "Large vision-language models (VLMs) typically process hundreds or thousands of visual tokens per image or video frame, incurring quadratic attention cost and substantial redundancy. Existing token reduction methods often ignore the textual query or rely on deep attention maps, whose instability under aggressive pruning leads to degraded semantic alignment. We propose FlashVLM, a text guided visual token selection framework that dynamically adapts visual inputs to the query. Instead of relying on noisy attention weights, FlashVLM computes an explicit cross modal similarity between projected image tokens and normalized text embeddings in the language model space. This extrinsic relevance is fused with intrinsic visual saliency using log domain weighting and temperature controlled sharpening. In addition, a diversity preserving partition retains a minimal yet representative set of background tokens to maintain global context. Under identical token budgets and evaluation protocols, FlashVLM achieves beyond lossless compression, slightly surpassing the unpruned baseline while pruning up to 77.8 percent of visual tokens on LLaVA 1.5, and maintaining 92.8 percent accuracy even under 94.4 percent compression. Extensive experiments on 14 image and video benchmarks demonstrate that FlashVLM delivers state of the art efficiency performance trade offs while maintaining strong robustness and generalization across mainstream VLMs."

    "abstract": "Image fusion aims to synthesize a single high-quality image from a pair of inputs captured under challenging conditions, such as differing exposure levels or focal depths. A core challenge lies in effectively handling disparities in dynamic range and focus depth between the inputs. With the advent of vision-language models, recent methods incorporate textual descriptions as auxiliary guidance to enhance fusion quality. However, simply incorporating coarse-grained descriptions hampers the understanding of fine-grained details and poses challenges for precise cross-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-grained Text-guided Image Fusion (MTIF), a novel fusion paradigm with three key designs. First, it introduces multi-grained textual descriptions that separately capture fine details, structural cues, and semantic content, guiding image fusion through a hierarchical cross-modal modulation module. Second, it involves supervision signals at each granularity to facilitate alignment between visual and textual features and enhance the utility of auxiliary text. Third, it adopts a saliency-driven enrichment module to augment training data with dense semantic content, further strengthening the cross-modal modulation and alignment. Extensive experiments show that MTIF consistently outperforms previous methods on both multi-exposure and multi-focus image fusion tasks."

Quantum multi-programming (QMP) mitigates this by executing multiple circuits in parallel on a single device, but existing methods target superconducting systems with limited connectivity, high crosstalk, and lower gate fidelity. Trapped-ion architectures, with all-to-all connectivity, long coherence times, and high-fidelity mid-circuit measurement properties, presents itself as a more suitable platform for scalable QMP. We present CircPack, a hardware-aware circuit packing framework designed for modular trapped-ion devices based on the Quantum Charge-Coupled Device (QCCD) architecture. CircPack formulates static circuit scheduling as a two-dimensional packing problem with hardware-specific shuttling constraints. Compared to superconducting-based QMP approaches, CircPack achieves up to 70.72% better fidelity, 62.67% higher utilization, and 32.80% improved layer reduction. This framework is also capable of scalable, balanced scheduling across a cluster of independent QCCD modules, highlighting trapped-ion systems' potential in improving the throughput of quantum cloud computing in the near future."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a system for procedurally generating agent-based narratives using large language models (LLMs). Users could drag and drop multiple agents and objects into a scene, with each entity automatically assigned semantic metadata describing its identity, role, and potential interactions. The scene structure is then serialized into a natural language prompt and sent to an LLM, which returns a structured string describing a sequence of actions and interactions among agents and objects. The returned string encodes who performed which actions, when, and how. A custom parser interprets this string and triggers coordinated agent behaviors, animations, and interaction modules. The system supports agent-based scenes, dynamic object manipulation, and diverse interaction types. Designed for ease of use and rapid iteration, the system enables the generation of virtual agent activity suitable for prototyping agent narratives. The performance of the developed system was evaluated using four popular lightweight LLMs. Each model's process and response time were measured under multiple complexity scenarios. The collected data were analyzed to compare consistency across the examined scenarios and to highlight the relative efficiency and suitability of each model for procedural agent-based narratives generation. The results demonstrate that LLMs can reliably translate high-level scene descriptions into executable agent-based behaviors."

Rather, focusing on the case of edge inference, the Transmitter (TX) and the RX cooperate to exchange features of the input data that will be used to predict an unseen attribute of them, leveraging information from collected data sets. This chapter demonstrates that the wireless channel can be used to perform computations over the data, when equipped with programmable metasurfaces. The end-to-end system of the TX, RX, and MS-based channel is treated as a single deep neural network which is trained through backpropagation to perform inference on unseen data. Using Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM), it is shown that this Metasurfaces-Integrated Neural Network (MINN) can achieve performance comparable to fully digital neural networks under various system parameters and data sets. By offloading computations onto the channel itself, important benefits may be achieved in terms of energy consumption, arising from reduced computations at the transceivers and smaller transmission power required for successful inference."

Encouraged by this, we go further and identify a path towards realizing even higher $T_c$'s by changing the cation along the line Nd$\\rightarrow$Sm$\\rightarrow$Y$\\rightarrow$Lu with matching substrates.

Using spin noise spectroscopy, we reveal this interplay for donor-bound electrons in a CdTe/CdMgTe quantum well and spectrally separate electron spin relaxation and dephasing in zero magnetic field. We identify a specific regime of the electron spin dynamics, where temperature-induced activation of spin-independent hopping leads to a monotonic acceleration of electron spin relaxation. This behavior contrasts with bulk CdTe crystals, where the motional narrowing effect is observed. We attribute this difference to the significantly larger inhomogeneous broadening of the donor-related trion resonance in our quantum well compared to bulk samples. The theoretical analysis of the spin noise power and the strength of the spin exchange interaction provides the estimation of the donor concentration in our unintentionally doped structure."

Astrophysical, cosmological, and laboratory constraints require axions to be extremely weakly coupled to Standard Model particles, making them viable dark matter candidates .This PhD thesis presents original results developed over three years of research, focusing on axion cosmology and axion electrodynamics. These topics address the production of axions and their associated topological defects in the early Universe, as well as the interactions of axions with Standard Model particles. The analysis combines methods from non-equilibrium quantum field theory and quantum field theory in curved spacetimes. After reviewing the foundations of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes and cosmology, the thesis introduces the Strong CP problem and the Peccei-Quinn mechanism, including the PQWW axion model and its invisible extensions. Ultraviolet completions of QCD axion theories are discussed in both field-theoretic and extra-dimensional frameworks. A significant part of the thesis is devoted to axion electrodynamics, where a classical axion background modifies Maxwell's equations and electromagnetic observables. The non-equilibrium dynamics of self-interacting axion fields coupled to the Standard Model or to a dark sector are also studied using the two-particle-irreducible effective action, and applied to pre- and post-inflationary cosmological scenarios, yielding new insights and preliminary constraints."

The bulk geometry is dual to a strongly coupled large-$N_c$ gauge theory at finite temperature, backreacted by a finite density of heavy static fundamental quarks. Alongside holographic entanglement entropy (HEE), we analyze entanglement thermodynamics and establish a first law like relation in the small backreaction regime by identifying the deformed black hole at zero temperature as the natural ground state of the dual field theory. Using analytic expansions in the low and high temperature limits, we compute the HEN for adjacent, disjoint and bipartite subsystem configurations and examine its dependence on the backreaction parameter $ρ$. Our results reveal a clear regime dependence: at low temperature, backreaction suppresses the negativity, signaling a reduction of distillable quantum correlations while at high temperature the negativity is enhanced due to the monotonic $ρ$-dependence of near horizon contributions. We further compare the behavior of HEN with HEE and mutual information, demonstrating that entanglement negativity provides a sharper diagnostic of the competition between thermal and quantum correlations in holographic plasmas with matter backreaction."

Here, we introduce a MHz-frequency ultrasonic metamaterial based on laser-engraved glass. By structuring meta-voxels with different engraving patterns, we define a fully-3D, anisotropic metamaterial exhibiting local variations in the sound speed of up to 20% compared to unstructured glass, and losses 100x lower than in comparable 3D printed metamaterials. We use this metamaterial to define a library of standard elements that can be modularly combined to create and shape complex-patterned ultrasonic fields.

The Faraday-onset boundary is well described by a power law close to $\\sqrt{f}$, while the Rosensweig-like peak onset becomes essentially frequency independent at low viscosity.

EPaxos enables parallel execution for independent operations but treats all nodes uniformly, ignoring performance differences. To tackle this problem, we present WOC, a dual-path consensus protocol that dynamically routes operations into two paths based on their access patterns. Independent operations execute through a fast path that uses object-specific weighted quorums and completes in one network round-trip. Conflicting or shared objects route through a leader-coordinated slow path employing node-weighted consensus. Our evaluation demonstrates that WOC achieves up to 4X higher throughput than Cabinet for workloads with >70% independent objects, while maintaining equivalent performance under high contention."

In this paper, we propose UTDesign, a unified framework for high-precision stylized text editing and conditional text generation in design images, supporting both English and Chinese scripts. Our framework introduces a novel DiT-based text style transfer model trained from scratch on a synthetic dataset, capable of generating transparent RGBA text foregrounds that preserve the style of reference glyphs. We further extend this model into a conditional text generation framework by training a multi-modal condition encoder on a curated dataset with detailed text annotations, enabling accurate, style-consistent text synthesis conditioned on background images, prompts, and layout specifications. Finally, we integrate our approach into a fully automated text-to-design (T2D) pipeline by incorporating pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models and an MLLM-based layout planner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UTDesign achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source methods in terms of stylistic consistency and text accuracy, and also exhibits unique advantages compared to proprietary commercial approaches.

We also discuss the importance of the finite parts of loop corrections that can be distinguished from their associated counterterm contributions. As an application, we examine the one-loop primordial bispectrum in the context of the effective field theory of inflation, considering a specific set of interactions, and identifying a contribution distinguishable from its tree-level counterpart."

In this work, we investigate the impact of the most dominant new interaction term, characterized by the coupling $F_2$, in ab initio calculations of medium-mass nuclei. For this, we combine the new $F_2$ interaction with established 3N interactions up to next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^2$LO) and next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) in chiral effective field theory. We explore two fit strategies for the low-energy couplings. The first is based only on few-body observables, while the second also incorporates information from $^{16}$O. Generally, we find that the $F_2$ interaction has a significant impact on energies and radii, however mainly due to changes in the short-range couplings. Overall, we do not find systematic improvements in the reproduction of medium-mass nuclei when the additional $F_2$ interaction is included."

Compared to existing functional depth notions, the regularized projection depth has several advantages: (i) it requires no moment assumptions on the underlying distribution, (ii) it satisfies many desirable depth properties including invariance, monotonicity, and vanishing at infinity, (iii) its sample version uniformly converges under mild conditions, and (iv) it generates a highly robust median. Furthermore, the proposed depth is statistically useful as it (v) does not produce ties in the induced ranks and (vi) effectively detects shape outlying functions.

It connects the spin-dependent cross-section for photoproduction off a particle to the squared ratio of the particle's anomalous magnetic moment and its mass, $(κ/M)^2$. Thus, for a nucleon embedded in a nucleus, the sum rule relates the cross-section to $κ/M$ averaged quadratically over the nucleons comprising the nucleus. This quadratic averaging can be used to constrain the mechanism responsible for the medium modification of the nucleon. We also point out that the global properties of the embedded nucleon like its axial charge, mass or magnetic moment are observables measurable through sum rules."

Frustration is defined using certain rules based on rage bursts, back and forth navigation (U turns), cart churn, search struggle, and long wandering sessions, and applies these rules to 5.4 million raw clickstream events (304,881 sessions). From each session, I build tabular features and train standard classifier models. I also use the full event sequence to train a discriminative LSTM classifier. XGBoost reaches about 90% accuracy, ROC AUC of 0.9579, while the LSTM performs best with about 91% accuracy and a ROC AUC of 0.9705. Finally, the research shows that with only the first 20 to 30 interactions, the LSTM already predicts frustration reliably."

We benchmark three quantum kernel architectures, distinguished by their quantum feature map circuits. A dimensionality argument implies, in principle, an increased expressivity of the quantum kernels over their classical competitors. For each kernel type, we perform an extensive hyperparameter optimization of our tuning algorithm. We confirm the validity of a quantum-inspired approach based on statevector simulation by numerically demonstrating the superiority of two studied quantum kernels over the canonical classical RBF kernel. Finally, we discuss the pathway towards real quantum hardware, mainly driven by a transition to shot-based simulations and evaluating quantum kernels via randomized measurements, which can mitigate the effect of gate errors. The very low qubit requirements and moderate circuit depths, together with a minimal number of trainable circuit parameters, make our method particularly NISQ-friendly."

While providing a reproducible toolkit to generate, intercept and analyze DoH exfiltration, and comparing Machine Learning vs threshold-based detection under adversarial scenarios. The originality of this project is the introduction of an end-to-end, containerized pipeline that generates configurable file exfiltration over DoH using several parameters (e.g., chunking, encoding, padding, resolver rotation). It allows for file reconstruction at the resolver side, while extracting flow-level features using a fork of DoHLyzer. The pipeline contains a prediction side, which allows the training of machine learning models based on public labelled datasets and then evaluates them side-by-side with threshold-based detection methods against malicious and evasive DNS-Over-HTTPS traffic. We train Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression classifiers on a public DoH dataset and benchmark them against evasive DoH exfiltration scenarios. The toolkit orchestrates traffic generation, file capture, feature extraction, model training and analysis. The toolkit is then encapsulated into several Docker containers for easy setup and full reproducibility regardless of the platform it is run on. Future research regarding this project is directed at validating the results on mixed enterprise traffic, extending the protocol coverage to HTTP/3/QUIC request, adding a benign traffic generation, and working on real-time traffic evaluation. A key objective is to quantify when stealth constraints make DoH exfiltration uneconomical and unworthy for the attacker."

This concept of randomness is defined relative to an underlying probability measure P on the space of trajectories. In deterministic models like Newtonian N-particle flow in dilute gases of hard spheres (as considered by Boltzmann) or the Kac ring model these may be reduced to their initial conditions, in which case P makes the particles i.i.d. at t=0. In the (stochastic) Ehrenfest urn model, on the other hand, the importance of trajectories as the decisive random objects comes out more clearly. We consider each of these models from this point of view, including a conceptual analysis of the recent (post-Lanford) microscopic derivation of the full Boltzmann equation for long times. We also show to which extent algorithmic randomness is stronger than necessary for the derivation of Boltzmann-like equations, in giving rise to an infinite number of other macroscopic properties. In the light of Chaitin's incompleteness theorems for algorithmic randomness, the price for this scenario is the impossibility of explicitly displaying algorithmically random microscopic trajectories."

Simply replacing shared normalization with task-specific variants already yields competitive performance, questioning the need for complex designs. Building on this insight, we propose Task-Specific Sigmoid Batch Normalization (TS$σ$BN), a lightweight mechanism that enables tasks to softly allocate network capacity while fully sharing feature extractors. TS$σ$BN improves stability across CNNs and Transformers, matching or exceeding performance on NYUv2, Cityscapes, CelebA, and PascalContext, while remaining highly parameter-efficient. Moreover, its learned gates provide a natural framework for analyzing MTL dynamics, offering interpretable insights into capacity allocation, filter specialization, and task relationships. Our findings suggest that complex MTL architectures may be unnecessary and that task-specific normalization offers a simple, interpretable, and efficient alternative."

The stability criteria for a system with a Watt regulator are also presented in the context of the solvability of a linear matrix inequality. Computer modelling shows that the system exhibits hidden oscillations when the self-regulation effect is present and when it is not. The conditions for computing the hidden boundary of global stability are determined by three parameters in the Watt regulator model."

This situation has changed decisively in recent decades. Modern cosmology is now driven by an unprecedented flow of high-precision data from a wide range of independent probes, including the cosmic microwave background, large-scale structure, supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, gravitational lensing, cosmic chronometers, redshift-space distortions, gravitational-wave standard sirens, and emerging 21-cm observations, among others. This observational wealth is matched by a concrete theoretical and mathematical framework, based on general relativity, which provides the dynamical equations governing the evolution of spacetime and matter at cosmic scales. Combined with explicit background and perturbative equations, this framework enables quantitative, predictive, and falsifiable descriptions of cosmic evolution. Thus, cosmology operates today as a nomological natural science of the observable universe, characterized by general laws, predictive power, and systematic empirical testing. We argue that this epistemic transformation motivates a corresponding conceptual shift, directly analogous to the historical transition from astrology to astronomy. In this sense, the transition from cosmology to \\emph{cosmonomy} should begin to be discussed among cosmologists, or, more precisely, among cosmonomers."

These measures/signals are combinations of entanglement entropy, multi-entropy, entanglement wedge cross sections (EWCS) and multi-EWCS. Our results reveal that in the extremal limits of these two geometric modifications, the multipartite entanglement structures exhibit starkly contrasting behaviors: various measures saturate either their theoretical upper or lower bounds in the respective geometries. This demonstrates that IR deformations provide a practical holographic framework for realizing extremal entanglement regimes. Moreover, it serves as an effective tool for studying quantum marginal problems in holography.

    "abstract": "Cooperative collision avoidance between robots in swarm operations remains an open challenge. Assuming a decentralized architecture, each robot is responsible for making its own control decisions, including motion planning. To this end, most existing approaches mostly rely some form of (wireless) communication between the agents of the swarm. In reality, however, communication is brittle. It may be affected by latency, further delays and packet losses, transmission faults, and is subject to adversarial attacks, such as jamming or spoofing. This paper proposes Contingency Model-based Control (CMC) as a communicationless alternative. It follows the implicit cooperation paradigm, under which the design of the robots is based on consensual (offline) rules, similar to traffic rules. They include the definition of a contingency trajectory for each robot, and a method for construction of mutual collision avoidance constraints. The setup is shown to guarantee the recursive feasibility and collision avoidance between all swarm members in closed-loop operation. Moreover, CMC naturally satisfies the Plug \\& Play paradigm, i.e., for new robots entering the swarm. Two numerical examples demonstrate that the collision avoidance guarantee is intact and that the robot swarm operates smoothly under the CMC regime."

However, existing methods often suffer from multi-source entanglement and audio-visual misalignment, which lead to biases toward louder or larger objects while overlooking weaker, smaller, or co-occurring sources. To address these challenges, we propose DDAVS, a Disentangled Audio Semantics and Delayed Bidirectional Alignment framework. To mitigate multi-source entanglement, DDAVS employs learnable queries to extract audio semantics and anchor them within a structured semantic space derived from an audio prototype memory bank. This is further optimized through contrastive learning to enhance discriminability and robustness. To alleviate audio-visual misalignment, DDAVS introduces dual cross-attention with delayed modality interaction, improving the robustness of multimodal alignment. Extensive experiments on the AVS-Objects and VPO benchmarks demonstrate that DDAVS consistently outperforms existing approaches, exhibiting strong performance across single-source, multi-source, and multi-instance scenarios. These results validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our framework under challenging real-world audio-visual segmentation conditions.

We introduce a general framework for LLM agents to maintain concise contexts through multi-step interaction: Acting through Belief Bottlenecks Expressed in Language (ABBEL), and methods to further improve ABBEL agents with RL post-training. ABBEL replaces long multi-step interaction history by a belief state, i.e., a natural language summary of what has been discovered about task-relevant unknowns. Under ABBEL, at each step the agent first updates a prior belief with the most recent observation from the environment to form a posterior belief, then uses only the posterior to select an action. We systematically evaluate frontier models under ABBEL across six diverse multi-step environments, finding that ABBEL supports generating interpretable beliefs while maintaining near-constant memory use over interaction steps. However, bottleneck approaches are generally prone to error propagation, which we observe causing inferior performance when compared to the full context setting due to errors in belief updating. Therefore, we train LLMs to generate and act on beliefs within the ABBEL framework via reinforcement learning (RL). We experiment with belief grading, to reward higher quality beliefs, as well as belief length penalties to reward more compressed beliefs. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of RL to improve ABBEL's performance beyond the full context setting, while using less memory than contemporaneous approaches."

Two numerical schemes based on the rotational form of the convective term are proposed: a nonlinear scheme and a linear variant. Both schemes exactly preserve the discrete helicity and kinetic energy, and the Picard iteration maintains the conservation properties of the nonlinear scheme.

    "abstract": "Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a vital role in healthcare, surveillance, and innovative environments, where reliable action recognition supports timely decision-making and automation. Although deep learning-based HAR systems are widely adopted, the impact of Activation Functions (AFs) and Model Optimizers (MOs) on performance has not been sufficiently analyzed, particularly regarding how their combinations influence model behavior in practical scenarios. Most existing studies focus on architecture design, while the interaction between AF and MO choices remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we investigate the effect of three commonly used activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh) combined with four optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad) using two recurrent deep learning architectures, namely BiLSTM and ConvLSTM. Experiments are conducted on six medically relevant activity classes selected from the HMDB51 and UCF101 datasets, considering their suitability for healthcare-oriented HAR applications. Our experimental results show that ConvLSTM consistently outperforms BiLSTM across both datasets. ConvLSTM, combined with Adam or RMSprop, achieves an accuracy of up to 99.00%, demonstrating strong spatio-temporal learning capabilities and stable performance. While BiLSTM performs reasonably well on UCF101, with accuracy approaching 98.00%, its performance drops to approximately 60.00% on HMDB51, indicating limited robustness across datasets and weaker sensitivity to AF and MO variations. This study provides practical insights for optimizing HAR systems, particularly for real-world healthcare environments where fast and precise activity detection is critical."

To this end, we propose Jensen-Shannon Divergence Message-Passing (JSDMP), a new learning paradigm for rich-text graph representation learning. Besides considering similarity regarding structure and text, JSDMP further captures their corresponding dissimilarity by Jensen-Shannon divergence. Similarity and dissimilarity are then jointly used to compute new message weights among text nodes, thus enabling representations to learn with contextual and structural information from truly correlated text nodes. With JSDMP, we propose two novel graph neural networks, namely Divergent message-passing graph convolutional network (DMPGCN) and Divergent message-passing Page-Rank graph neural networks (DMPPRG), for learning representations in rich-text graphs. DMPGCN and DMPPRG have been extensively texted on well-established rich-text datasets and compared with several state-of-the-art baselines. The experimental results show that DMPGCN and DMPPRG can outperform other baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed Jensen-Shannon Divergence Message-Passing paradigm"

We combine multi-band light curves from 1999 to 2025 with over 30 epochs of optical to near-infrared spectroscopy (0.5-2.5 $μ$m), analyzing variability patterns, color behavior, and emission line diagnostics. We investigate the temporal evolution of accretion and outflow indicators and their correlation with photometric states. The light curve reveals a transition from sporadic early dimming events to a quasi-periodic pattern since 2018, with eleven major dips showing asymmetry and stochastic sub-structure. Color-magnitude diagrams show classic UXor-like blueing during deep minima, while near-infrared and mid-infrared color changes indicate thermal evolution of disk. Spectroscopic analysis reveals persistent hydrogen, Ca II, He I, and forbidden line emission. Accretion diagnostics track photometric variability, and forbidden lines often intensify during dips, implying a physical link between extinction and outflows. Estimated accretion rates range from $\\sim10^{-8}-10^{-7}$ $M_\\odot$yr$^{-1}$; the outflow rate and density diagnostics are consistent with disk winds and shock-excited jets. V1180 Cas demonstrates dual-mode variability driven by both variable circumstellar extinction and episodic accretion events. The hybrid UXor/EXor behavior, combined with evolving disk signatures and persistent outflows, suggests a young stellar object undergoing coupled accretion-extinction-outflow evolution. Continued monitoring will be essential to fully resolve the physical processes shaping its variability."

    "abstract": "Adsorption energy is a key descriptor of catalytic reactivity. It is fundamentally defined as the difference between the relaxed total energy of the adsorbate-surface system and that of an appropriate reference state; therefore, the accuracy of relaxed-energy prediction directly determines the reliability of machine-learning-driven catalyst screening. E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs) can natively operate on three-dimensional atomic coordinates under periodic boundary conditions and have demonstrated strong performance on such tasks. In contrast, language-model-based approaches, while enabling human-readable textual descriptions and reducing reliance on explicit graph -- thereby broadening applicability -- remain insufficient in both adsorption-configuration energy prediction accuracy and in distinguishing ``the same system with different configurations,'' even with graph-assisted pretraining in the style of GAP-CATBERTa. To this end, we propose QE-Catalytic, a multimodal framework that deeply couples a large language model (\\textbf{Q}wen) with an E(3)-equivariant graph Transformer (\\textbf{E}quiformer-V2), enabling unified support for adsorption-configuration property prediction and inverse design on complex catalytic surfaces. During prediction, QE-Catalytic jointly leverages three-dimensional structures and structured configuration text, and injects ``3D geometric information'' into the language channel via graph-text alignment, allowing it to function as a high-performance text-based predictor when precise coordinates are unavailable, while also autoregressively generating CIF files for target-energy-driven structure design and information completion. On OC20, QE-Catalytic reduces the MAE of relaxed adsorption energy from 0.713~eV to 0.486~eV, and consistently outperforms baseline models such as CatBERTa and GAP-CATBERTa across multiple evaluation protocols."

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been extensively applied in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems due to the capability of enhancing physical layer security (PLS). However, conventional static RIS architectures lack the flexibility required for adaptive beam control in multi-user and multifunctional scenarios. To address this issue without introducing additional hardware complexity and power consumption, in this paper, we exploit a movable RIS (MRIS) architecture, which consists of a large fixed sub-surface and a smaller movable sub-surface that slides on the fixed sub-surface to achieve dynamic beam reconfiguration with static phase shifts. This paper investigates an MRIS-assisted ISAC system under imperfect sensing estimation, where dedicated radar signals serve as artificial noise to enhance secure transmission against potential eavesdroppers (Eves). The transmit beamforming vectors, MRIS phase shifts, and relative positions of the two sub-surfaces are jointly optimized to maximize the minimum secrecy rate, ensuring robust secrecy performance for the weakest user under the uncertainty of the Eves' channels. To handle the non-convexity, a convex bound is derived for the Eve channel uncertainty, and the S-procedure is employed to reformulate semi-infinite constraints as linear matrix inequalities. An efficient alternating optimization and penalty dual decomposition-based algorithm is developed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MRIS architecture substantially improves secrecy performance, especially when only a small number of elements are allocated to the movable sub-surface."

Although recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for policy-grounded moderation, the practical challenges of training these systems to achieve expert-level accuracy in real-world settings remain largely unexplored, particularly in regimes characterized by label sparsity, evolving policy definitions, and the need for nuanced reasoning beyond shallow pattern matching. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical investigation of scaling reinforcement learning (RL) for content classification, systematically evaluating multiple RL training recipes and reward-shaping strategies-including verifiable rewards and LLM-as-judge frameworks-to transform general-purpose language models into specialized, policy-aligned classifiers across three real-world content moderation tasks. Our findings provide actionable insights for industrial-scale moderation systems, demonstrating that RL exhibits sigmoid-like scaling behavior in which performance improves smoothly with increased training data, rollouts, and optimization steps before gradually saturating. Moreover, we show that RL substantially improves performance on tasks requiring complex policy-grounded reasoning while achieving up to 100x higher data efficiency than supervised fine-tuning, making it particularly effective in domains where expert annotations are scarce or costly."

    "abstract": "Controllable Markov chains describe the dynamics of sequential decision making tasks and are the central component in optimal control and reinforcement learning. In this work, we give the general form of an optimal policy for learning controllable dynamics in an unknown environment by exploring over a limited time horizon. This policy is simple to implement and efficient to compute, and allows an agent to ``learn by exploring\" as it maximizes its information gain in a greedy fashion by selecting controls from a constraint set that changes over time during exploration. We give a simple parameterization for the set of controls, and present an algorithm for finding an optimal policy. The reason for this policy is due to the existence of certain types of states that restrict control of the dynamics; such as transient states, absorbing states, and non-backtracking states. We show why the occurrence of these states makes a non-stationary policy essential for achieving optimal exploration. Six interesting examples of controllable dynamics are treated in detail. Policy optimality is demonstrated using counting arguments, comparing with suboptimal policies, and by making use of a sequential improvement property from dynamic programming."

Cross-validation is often computationally prohibitive at scale, while fully Bayesian hyper-parameter learning can be difficult due to the cost of posterior sampling. We develop a generative perspective on hyper-parameter tuning that combines two ideas: (i) optimization-based approximations to Bayesian posteriors via randomized, weighted objectives (weighted Bayesian bootstrap), and (ii) amortization of repeated optimization across many hyper-parameter settings by learning a transport map from hyper-parameters (including random weights) to the corresponding optimizer. This yields a ``generator look-up table'' for estimators, enabling rapid evaluation over grids or continuous ranges of hyper-parameters and supporting both predictive tuning objectives and approximate Bayesian uncertainty quantification. We connect this viewpoint to weighted $M$-estimation, envelope/auxiliary-variable representations that reduce non-quadratic losses to weighted least squares, and recent generative samplers for weighted $M$-estimators."

The 3D altermagnetic topological insulator is characterized by zero-energy surface states in bulk nodal-ring phases and anisotropically shifted surface Dirac cones in topological insulating phases. It is potentially realized in \\mathrm{EuIn_{2}As_{2}}. The altermagnetic order in combination with superconductivity gives rise to highly anisotropic superconducting gaps with crystal-facet-dependent BFSs at the physical boundaries. These particular BFSs provide distinct platforms to realize Majorana zero modes (MZMs). We propose a quasi-1D nanowire in which the anisotropic BFSs experience topological phase transitions due to quantum confinement leading to MZMs at its ends. We further consider vortex phase transitions in the superconducting altermagnetic topological insulators. Remarkably, we find that the altermagnetic order allows us to transit between two distinct type of MZMs, one type is located at the vortex line, while the other type is located at the physical boundaries. Our work paves a new avenue utilizing altermagnetism-induced BFSs to engineer topological superconductivity through crystal anisotropy and quantum confinement."

    "abstract": "An augmented system model provides an effective way to model non-Markovian quantum systems, which is useful in filtering and control for this class of systems. However, since a large number of ancillary quantum oscillators representing internal modes of a non-Markovian environment directly interact with the principal system in these models, the dimension of the augmented system may be very large causing significant computational burden in designing filters and controllers. In this context, this paper proposes an $\\mathscr{H}_2$ model reduction method for the augmented model of linear non-Markovian quantum systems. We first establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the physical realizability of the augmented model of linear non-Markovian quantum systems, which are more stringent than those for Markovian quantum systems. However, these physical realizability conditions of augmented system model pose non-convex constrains in the optimization problem of model reduction, which makes the problem different from the corresponding classical model reduction problem. To solve the problem, we derive necessary conditions for determining the input matrix in the reduced model, with which a theorem for designing the system matrix of the ancillary system in the reduced system is proved. Building on this, we convert the nonlinear equality constraints into inequality constraints so that a semidefinite programming algorithm can be developed to solve the optimization problem for model reduction. A numerical example of a two-mode linear quantum system driven by three internal modes of a non-Markovian environment validates the effectiveness of our method."

Building upon the theoretical framework for microlensing of photon rings, we apply this methodology to both Sgr A* and M87, considering multiple PBH populations: (i) PBH dark matter spikes around central supermassive black holes, (ii) NFW halo contributions in the Milky Way and M87 galaxies, and (iii) foreground Milky Way PBH dark matter affecting M87* observations. The microlensing signal manifests as a time-dependent asymmetry and deformation of the photon ring, providing the most sensitive observable for lensing effects. We assess the detectability of these signatures with future EHT-like interferometers. Our analysis reveals that M87* provides the strongest constraints on PBH dark matter.

These templates are then processed via a schema-driven synthesis engine, ensuring the Large Language Model generates type-safe, prop-drilled components suitable for production environments.

Methods: We developed OLIVER (Optimized LLM-based Inclusion and Vetting Engine for Reviews), an open-source pipeline for LLM-assisted abstract screening. We evaluated multiple contemporary LLMs across two non-Cochrane systematic reviews and performance was assessed at both the full-text screening and final inclusion stages using accuracy, AUC, and calibration metrics. We further tested an actor-critic screening framework combining two lightweight models under three aggregation rules. Results: Across individual models, performance varied widely. In the smaller Review 1 (821 abstracts, 63 final includes), several models achieved high sensitivity for final includes but at the cost of substantial false positives and poor calibration. In the larger Review 2 (7741 abstracts, 71 final includes), most models were highly specific but struggled to recover true includes, with prompt design influencing recall. Calibration was consistently weak across single-model configurations despite high overall accuracy. Actor-critic screening improved discrimination and markedly reduced calibration error in both reviews, yielding higher AUCs. Discussion: LLMs may eventually accelerate abstract screening, but single-model performance is highly sensitive to review characteristics, prompting, and calibration is limited. An actor-critic framework improves classification quality and confidence reliability while remaining computationally efficient, enabling large-scale screening at low cost."

To address this challenge, we propose Visual Attentive Prompting (VAP), a simple-yet-effective training-free perceptual adapter that equips frozen VLAs with top-down selective attention. VAP treats the reference images as a non-parametric visual memory, grounds the personal object in the scene through open-vocabulary detection and embedding-based matching, and then injects this grounding as a visual prompt by highlighting the object and rewriting the instruction. We construct two simulation benchmarks, Personalized-SIMPLER and Personalized-VLABench, and a real-world tabletop benchmark to evaluate personalized manipulation across multiple robots and tasks. Experiments show that VAP consistently outperforms generic policies and token-learning baselines in both success rate and correct-object manipulation, helping to bridge the gap between semantic understanding and instance-level control."

    "abstract": "Automated pavement defect detection often struggles to generalize across diverse real-world conditions due to the lack of standardized datasets. Existing datasets differ in annotation styles, distress type definitions, and formats, limiting their integration for unified training. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark dataset that consolidates multiple publicly available sources into a standardized collection of 52747 images from seven countries, with 135277 bounding box annotations covering 13 distinct distress types. The dataset captures broad real-world variation in image quality, resolution, viewing angles, and weather conditions, offering a unique resource for consistent training and evaluation. Its effectiveness was demonstrated through benchmarking with state-of-the-art object detection models including YOLOv8-YOLOv12, Faster R-CNN, and DETR, which achieved competitive performance across diverse scenarios. By standardizing class definitions and annotation formats, this dataset provides the first globally representative benchmark for pavement defect detection and enables fair comparison of models, including zero-shot transfer to new environments."

    "abstract": "The study of interfacial fluxes under evaporative or condensation processes are ubiquitous in thermal systems, propulsion devices, and many other engineering applications. Most continuum scale models fail to capture the true nature of thermodynamic property variation across the interface, particularly under high-temperature and high-pressure conditions. An improvement over the sharp interface assumption of such continuum scale models is the consideration of a diffused interface and using Kinetic Boundary Conditions (KBCs) to model the mass-transport across the liquid vapor interface. Prior studies on KBCs mainly address monoatomic fluids. Two of the main ingredients required to form KBCs are: density and mass flux. Here, we study a Type-III binary mixture of n-dodecane and nitrogen using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics at near-critical temperatures. Interfacial properties such as thickness, density gradient, and surface tension were analyzed. A key result is the temporal evolution of the evaporation and reflected mass fluxes across the vapor-liquid interface. We observe that both the evaporation and reflection fluxes increase with increasing temperature, indicating enhanced molecular activity and mass transport across the interface at higher Tr. In contrast, the evaporation coefficient alpha_evap decreases from about alpha approximately 0.978 at Tr equals 0.70 to alpha approximately 0.905 at Tr equals 0.95 because the reflected-out flux increases along with the evaporation flux, which reduces the net efficiency of molecular evaporation across the interface. To the authors' knowledge, this is one of the very few studies estimating mass transport coefficients for Type-III binary systems, laying the foundation for KBCs in hydrocarbon and nitrogen mixtures."

Existing weakly supervised approaches often struggle to align fine-grained spatial structures with coarse labels, leading to noisy supervision and degraded mapping accuracy. To tackle this problem, we propose DDTM, a dual-branch weakly supervised framework that explicitly decouples local semantic refinement from global contextual reasoning. Specifically, DDTM introduces a diffusion-based branch to progressively refine fine-scale local semantics under coarse supervision, while a transformer-based branch enforces long-range contextual consistency across large spatial extents. In addition, we design a pseudo-label confidence evaluation module to mitigate noise induced by cross-resolution inconsistencies and to selectively exploit reliable supervisory signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDTM establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Chesapeake Bay benchmark, achieving 66.52\\% mIoU and substantially outperforming prior weakly supervised methods.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel quantitative approach for comparative economic studies, addressing limitations in current classification methods. Conventional approaches in comparative economics often rely on ad hoc and categorical classifications, leading to subjective judgments and disregarding the continuous nature of the spectrum of economic systems. These can result in subjectivity and significant information loss, particularly for countries with systems near categorical borders. To overcome these shortcomings, the present paper proposes distance-based indices for objective categorization, considering economic foundations and using hard data. Accordingly, the paper introduces institutional similarity indices--Capitalism Similarity Index (CapSI), Communism Similarity Index (ComSI), and Socialism Similarity Index (SocSI)-which reflect countries' positions along the economic system continuum. These indices adhere to mathematical rigor and are grounded in the mathematical fields of real analysis, metric spaces, and distance functions. By classifying 135 countries and creating GIS maps, the practical applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated. Results show a high explanatory power of the introduced indices, suggesting their beneficial usage in comparative economic studies. The paper advocates for their adoption due to their objectivity and ability to capture structural and institutional nuances without subjective judgments while also considering the continuous nature of the spectrum of economic systems."

An intrinsic physical quantity for superconductors, i.e., the quadrupole moment serves as the topological invariant, which is always half-quantized due to the particle-hole symmetry. As examples, two types of mixed pairings, $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\\pm id_{xy}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\\pm is$, induced in the bilayer two-dimensional electron gases with Rashba spin-orbit coupling give the quadrupole phase. Extended discussions indicate that the nontrivial phase is robust against relative phase fluctuations in the mixed pairings and the disorders. Our schemes provide realistic platforms to implement Majorana zero modes, paving the way for studying the Majorana physics."

Based on the multivariate center-outward quantile function in Hallin et al.

To address computational and inferential challenges, we incorporate entropy-regularized optimal transport, which ensures faster convergence rate and tractable estimation. We further develop consistent Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Cramér- von Mises type test statistics for MSD, establish bootstrap validity, and demonstrate through extensive simulations good finite-sample performance of the tests. Our approach offers a theoretically rigorous, and computationally feasible solution for comparing multivariate distributions."

The formulated problem is highly non-convex and difficult to solve directly; to address this challenge, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) framework which decomposes the original problem into two tractable sub-problems, namely (i) power allocation optimization sub-problem and (ii) antenna position optimization sub-problem. Both sub-problems are solved using successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm and solved alternatively until convergence. The RSMA access for PASS is compared with conventional non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and space-division multiple access (SDMA) techniques. The performance of discrete antenna activation with PASS strategy is also examined. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly enhances the achievable sum rate compared to other multiple access methods."

    "abstract": "This study investigates nuclear responses to two-body external fields, interpreted as double-phonon excitations, within the subtracted second random-phase approximation (SSRPA) for 16O. To clarify the underlying characteristics of these modes, Hartree-Fock (HF) and SSRPA with the diagonal approximation are first examined. The resulting strength distributions are nearly identical, indicating that residual interactions in the 1p-1h sector contribute only weakly. This behavior contrasts with that of one-body excitations, where coupling between 1p-1h and 2p-2h configurations is essential for generating collectivity. In the full SSRPA calculation, which incorporates the residual interaction among 2p-2h configurations, the strength distributions are substantially modified. The double IS 0+ and 2+ modes show pronounced redistribution, with peaks shifted to lower energies and additional strength emerging at higher energies, whereas the double IV $1^{-}$ mode shifts predominantly to higher energies due to a largely repulsive interaction. Analysis of single transition amplitudes reveals that low-lying resonances are formed coherently through constructive neutron-neutron, proton-proton, and neutron-proton configurations, while high-lying resonances are dominated by neutron-proton configurations, reflecting their higher state density. These results demonstrate that double-phonon excitations cannot be described by simple folding of one-body responses; a fully microscopic treatment of 2p-2h mixing, as provided by SSRPA, is essential."

    "abstract": "Intra-class variability is given according to the significance in the degree of dissimilarity between images within a class. In that sense, depending on its intensity, intra-class variability can hinder the learning process for DL models, specially when such classes are also underrepresented, which is a very common scenario in Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) tasks. This paper proposes a novel method that aims at leveraging classification performance in FGVC tasks by learning fine-grained features via classification of class-wise cluster assignments. Our goal is to apply clustering over each class individually, which can allow to discover pseudo-labels that encodes a latent degree of similarity between images. In turn, those labels can be employed in a hierarchical classification process that allows to learn more fine-grained visual features and thereby mitigating intra-class variability issues. Initial experiments over the PlantNet300k enabled to shed light upon several key points in which future work will have to be developed in order to find more conclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of our method. Our method still achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PlantNet300k dataset even though some of its components haven't been shown to be fully optimized.

To obtain these representations, the proposed method extracts features from training dataset images and create clusters, by applying K-Means, with $K$ equals to the number of classes in the dataset. The segmentation model is a customized narrow ViT, built by replacing the patch embedding layer with a frozen DinoV2, pre-trained on the training dataset for individual species classification. This model is trained to reconstruct the class prototypes of the training dataset from the test dataset images. We then use this model to obtain attention scores that enable to identify and localize areas of interest and consequently guide the classification process. The proposed approach enabled a domain-adaptation from multi-class identification with individual species, into multi-label classification from high-resolution vegetation plots. Our method achieved fifth place in the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge on the private leaderboard, with an F1 score of 0.33331.

Applying this framework to global quenches prepared by boundary states and to local quenches generated by operator insertions, we obtain analytic expressions for the entanglement entropy in general spacetime configurations. The results reveal qualitative differences between spacelike and timelike intervals: the timelike entanglement entropy is time-independent in the global quench model, depends solely on the temporal separation, and universally exhibits a constant imaginary contribution. These features are naturally explained by a generalized quasiparticle picture in which entanglement is produced precisely when one worldline of each quasiparticle pair intersects the interval. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the linear sum rule relating time- and spacelike entanglement persists in both global and local quenches, indicating a broader universality of spacetime entanglement in real-time quantum dynamics."

    "abstract": "Variable selection naturally arises as a useful subject when faced with data with massive predictor space. In addition to the massive dimensionality, the data may be characterized by intra-subject correlation, and cure fraction, which are ubiquitous in longitudinal studies with recurrent events defining the endpoint of interest. However, variable selection methods simultaneously adjusting for intra-subject correlation, and cure fraction are rare. We propose a comprehensive variable selection method for frailty mixture cure models based on penalized least squares approximation via the generalized linear mixed model methodology. The method provides shrinkage estimation and selection of fixed effects in the incidence and the latency submodels, adjusting for intra-subject correlation using a random effect term. The random effect is shared between the incidence and the latency, incorporating a flexible choice of covariance structure, allowing intra-subject correlation to be modeled as either time-invariant or time-varying. Estimation is facilitated by a penalized semiparametric restricted maximum likelihood method using an expectation-maximization algorithm. Two penalty functions, namely the adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (adaptive lasso), and the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) are studied in the proposed method. Simulation studies are considered, benchmarking the method against an oracle procedure to access its finite sample performance. The practical utility of the method is illustrated using data on recurrent events from a breast cancer gene expression study. In the presence of a relatively large predictor space, results show that the method yields plausible interpretability in whole, as opposed to an unpenalized model."

While existing video generative models produce impressive visual predictions, they are difficult to translate into low-level actions. Conversely, latent-action models better align videos with actions, but they typically operate at the single-step level and lack high-level planning capabilities. We bridge this gap by introducing Skill Abstraction from Optical Flow (SOF), a framework that learns latent skills from large collections of action-free videos. Our key idea is to learn a latent skill space through an intermediate representation based on optical flow that captures motion information aligned with both video dynamics and robot actions. By learning skills in this flow-based latent space, SOF enables high-level planning over video-derived skills and allows for easier translation of these skills into actions. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves performance in both multitask and long-horizon settings, demonstrating the ability to acquire and compose skills directly from raw visual data."

We extend the IDS framework to the discounted infinite-horizon setting by introducing a modified information measure and a tuning parameter to modulate the decision-making behavior. We examine two specific problem classes: symmetric bandits and the scenario involving one fair coin. In the symmetric case we show that IDS achieves bounded cumulative regret, whereas in the one-fair-coin scenario the IDS policy yields a regret that scales logarithmically with the horizon, in agreement with classical asymptotic lower bounds.

We demonstrate that this trichotomy has a natural explanation in the representation theory of SO(3). Sectoral harmonics correspond to highest-weight vectors annihilated by the raising operator $L_+$; this annihilation condition reduces to a first-order differential equation admitting solutions for any real $m > 0$, independent of representation-theoretic constraints. Tesseral harmonics arise from the full ladder algebra acting on highest-weight states; for non-integer $m$, this construction yields tesseral modes at $ν= m + k$ for positive integer $k$, with the hypergeometric series terminating when $ν- m$ is a non-negative integer. Zonal harmonics with $m = 0$ require integer $ν$ on the full sphere, but TE-polarised zonal modes survive in wedge geometries because their electric field components automatically satisfy the conducting boundary conditions. Numerical simulations of electromagnetic cavities with conducting wedges confirm these predictions quantitatively: both sectoral modes ($ν= m$) and tesseral modes ($ν= m + k$) are observed with sub-percent frequency agreement, validating the extended framework for non-integer azimuthal index."

    "abstract": "This work presents a comprehensive characterization of the FERS 5202 front-end readout unit when processing signals from Silicon Photo-multipliers (SiPMs). The readout system's performance is characterized in terms of its charge resolution, dynamic range, and noise performance at the single photoelectron level, which is critical for applications requiring detection of low-light signals such as medical imaging, high-energy physics experiments and photon counting applications. The evaluation encompassed both fundamental performance metrics and practical implementation scenarios using Hamamatsu MPPC devices. This work aims to provide valuable reference data not only for our intended muon radiography application but also for the broader scientific community employing SiPMs in diverse experimental contexts."

    "abstract": "Generating realistic and diverse LiDAR point clouds is crucial for autonomous driving simulation. Although previous methods achieve LiDAR point cloud generation from user inputs, they struggle to attain high-quality results while enabling versatile controllability, due to the imbalance between the complex distribution of LiDAR point clouds and the simple control signals. To address the limitation, we propose LiDARDraft, which utilizes the 3D layout to build a bridge between versatile conditional signals and LiDAR point clouds. The 3D layout can be trivially generated from various user inputs such as textual descriptions and images. Specifically, we represent text, images, and point clouds as unified 3D layouts, which are further transformed into semantic and depth control signals. Then, we employ a rangemap-based ControlNet to guide LiDAR point cloud generation. This pixel-level alignment approach demonstrates excellent performance in controllable LiDAR point clouds generation, enabling \"simulation from scratch\", allowing self-driving environments to be created from arbitrary textual descriptions, images and sketches."

While much of the existing work on NTN focuses on theoretical or simulated evaluations, practical implementations remain limited. In this paper, we present SpaceNET, a transparent NTN testbed that leverages the Starlink Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellation in conjunction with Mininet-based emulation to perform end-to-end performance assessments across real-world maritime and terrestrial endpoints that can also be applied to 5th generation (5G). Specifically, we establish a bidirectional link between a ground terminal located in Blacksburg, Virginia, and a maritime terminal aboard a cruise ship near Key West, Florida. We report detailed transmission control protocol (TCP) throughput, user datagram protocol (UDP) throughput, and latency measurements using two different user terminals - a) Smartphone, and b) very small aperture terminal (VSAT), emphasizing the transparent nature of the NTN payload, where the satellite acts solely as a relay node. Our results provide new insights into the performance limits and reliability of commercial LEO-based NTN applications. The SpaceNET testbed offers a reproducible and extensible platform for future research in NTN routing, mobility support, and cross-layer optimization."

    "abstract": "One focal challenge in engineering low-power and scalable all-oxide spintronic devices lies in exploring ferromagnetic oxide material with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and electronic conductivity while exhibiting tunable spin states. Targeting this need, spinel nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4, NCO), featured by room-temperature ferrimagnetically metallic ground state with strong PMA, emerges as a promising candidate in the field of oxide spintronics. The cation distribution disorder inherent to NCO renders competing electromagnetic states and abnormal sign reversal of anomalous Hall effect (AHE), introducing an additional freedom to adjust electromagnetic transports. Here, we unveil multi-state electromagnetic phase modulations in NCO system through controllable cation disorder and proton evolution, extensively expanding electromagnetic phase diagram. The cation disorder in NCO tunable by growth temperature is identified as a critical control parameter for kinetically adjusting the proton evolution, giving rise to intermediate hydrogenated states with chemical stability. Hydrogen incorporation reversibly drives structural transformation and electromagnetic state evolutions in NCO, with rich spin-dependent correlated physics uncovered by combining the AHE scaling relation and synchrotron-based spectroscopy. Our work not only establishes NCO as a versatile platform for discovering spin-dependent physical functionality but also extends the horizons in materials design for state-of-the-art spintronic devices harnessing magneto-ionic control and inherent cation disorder."

    "abstract": "Temporal reasoning over long, multi-session dialogues is a critical capability for conversational agents. However, existing works and our pilot study have shown that as dialogue histories grow in length and accumulate noise, current long-context models struggle to accurately identify temporally pertinent information, significantly impairing reasoning performance. To address this, we introduce Memory-T1, a framework that learns a time-aware memory selection policy using reinforcement learning (RL). It employs a coarse-to-fine strategy, first pruning the dialogue history into a candidate set using temporal and relevance filters, followed by an RL agent that selects the precise evidence sessions. The RL training is guided by a multi-level reward function optimizing (i) answer accuracy, (ii) evidence grounding, and (iii) temporal consistency. In particular, the temporal consistency reward provides a dense signal by evaluating alignment with the query time scope at both the session-level (chronological proximity) and the utterance-level (chronological fidelity), enabling the agent to resolve subtle chronological ambiguities. On the Time-Dialog benchmark, Memory-T1 boosts a 7B model to an overall score of 67.0\\%, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance for open-source models and outperforming a 14B baseline by 10.2\\%. Ablation studies show temporal consistency and evidence grounding rewards jointly contribute to a 15.0\\% performance gain. Moreover, Memory-T1 maintains robustness up to 128k tokens, where baseline models collapse, proving effectiveness against noise in extensive dialogue histories.

    "abstract": "Financial sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in informing investment decisions, assessing market risk, and predicting stock price trends. Existing works in financial sentiment analysis have not considered the impact of stock prices or market feedback on sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose an adaptive framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with real-world stock market feedback to improve sentiment classification in the context of the Indian stock market. The proposed methodology fine-tunes the LLaMA 3.2 3B model using instruction-based learning on the SentiFin dataset. To enhance sentiment predictions, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline is employed that dynamically selects multi-source contextual information based on the cosine similarity of the sentence embeddings. Furthermore, a feedback-driven module is introduced that adjusts the reliability of the source by comparing predicted sentiment with actual next-day stock returns, allowing the system to iteratively adapt to market behavior. To generalize this adaptive mechanism across temporal data, a reinforcement learning agent trained using proximal policy optimization (PPO) is incorporated. The PPO agent learns to optimize source weighting policies based on cumulative reward signals from sentiment-return alignment. Experimental results on NIFTY 50 news headlines collected from 2024 to 2025 demonstrate that the proposed system significantly improves classification accuracy, F1-score, and market alignment over baseline models and static retrieval methods. The results validate the potential of combining instruction-tuned LLMs with dynamic feedback and reinforcement learning for robust, market-aware financial sentiment modeling."

In this work, we propose a novel progressive learned image compression codec for machine perception, PICM-Net, based on trit-plane coding. By analyzing the difference between human- and machine-oriented rate-distortion priorities, we systematically examine the latent prioritization strategies in terms of machine-oriented codecs. To further enhance real-world adaptability, we design an adaptive decoding controller, which dynamically determines the necessary decoding level during inference time to maintain the desired confidence of downstream machine prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enables efficient and adaptive progressive transmission while maintaining high performance in the downstream classification task, establishing a new paradigm for machine-aware progressive image compression."

    "abstract": "Excellent gate electrostatics in field effect transistors (FETs) based on two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide (2D TMD) channels can dramatically decrease static power dissipation. Energy efficient FETs operate in enhancement mode with small and positive threshold voltage (Vth) for n-type devices. However, most state-of-the-art FETs based on monolayer MoS2 channel operate in depletion mode with negative Vth due to doping from the underlying dielectric substrate. In this work, we identify key properties of the semiconductor/dielectric interface (MoS2 on industrially relevant high dielectric constant (k) HfO2, ZrO2 and hBN for reference) responsible for realizing enhancement-mode operation of 2D MoS2 channel FETs. We find that hBN and ZrO2 dielectric substrates provide low defect interfaces with MoS2 that enables effective modulation of the Vth using gate metals of different work functions (WFs). We use photoluminescence (PL) and synchrotron X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements to investigate doping levels in monolayer MoS2 on different dielectrics with different WF gate metals. We complement the FET and spectroscopic measurements with capacitance-voltage analysis on dielectrics with varying thicknesses, which confirm that Vth modulation in ZrO2 devices is correlated with WF of the gate metals - in contrast with HfO2 devices that exhibit signatures of Vth pinning induced by oxide/interface defect states. Finally, we demonstrate FETs using a 2D MoS2 channel and a 6 nm of ZrO2 dielectric, achieving a subthreshold swing of 87 mV dec-1 and a threshold voltage of 0.1 V. Our results offer insights into the role of dielectric/semiconductor interface in 2D MoS2 based FETs for realizing enhancement mode FETs and highlight the potential of ZrO2 as a scalable high-k dielectric."

    "abstract": "We introduce $\\texttt{PairFlow}$, a lightweight preprocessing step for training Discrete Flow Models (DFMs) to achieve few-step sampling without requiring a pretrained teacher. DFMs have recently emerged as a new class of generative models for discrete data, offering strong performance. However, they suffer from slow sampling due to their iterative nature. Existing acceleration methods largely depend on finetuning, which introduces substantial additional training overhead. $\\texttt{PairFlow}$ addresses this issue with a lightweight preprocessing step. Inspired by ReFlow and its extension to DFMs, we train DFMs from coupled samples of source and target distributions, without requiring any pretrained teacher. At the core of our approach is a closed-form inversion for DFMs, which allows efficient construction of paired source-target samples. Despite its extremely low cost, taking only up to 1.7% of the compute needed for full model training, $\\texttt{PairFlow}$ matches or even surpasses the performance of two-stage training involving finetuning. Furthermore, models trained with our framework provide stronger base models for subsequent distillation, yielding further acceleration after finetuning. Experiments on molecular data as well as binary and RGB images demonstrate the broad applicability and effectiveness of our approach."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant promise in automating software vulnerability analysis, a critical task given the impact of security failure of modern software systems. However, current approaches in using LLMs to automate vulnerability analysis mostly rely on using online API-based LLM services, requiring the user to disclose the source code in development. Moreover, they predominantly frame the task as a binary classification(vulnerable or not vulnerable), limiting potential practical utility. This paper addresses these limitations by reformulating the problem as Software Vulnerability Identification (SVI), where LLMs are asked to output the type of weakness in Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) IDs rather than simply indicating the presence or absence of a vulnerability. We also tackle the reliance on large, API-based LLMs by demonstrating that instruction-tuning smaller, locally deployable LLMs can achieve superior identification performance. In our analysis, instruct-tuning a local LLM showed better overall performance and cost trade-off than online API-based LLMs. Our findings indicate that instruct-tuned local models represent a more effective, secure, and practical approach for leveraging LLMs in real-world vulnerability management workflows."

    "abstract": "The gravitational-wave event GW231123_135430 is the heaviest binary black hole system observed by the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA Collaboration to date, with the initial analysis indicating the individual black hole masses lie within or above the theorized pair-instability mass gap of roughly $60$--$130\\,M_\\odot$. The inference further suggests that both black holes possess high spins, measured to be $0.90^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and $0.80^{+0.20}_{-0.51}$. Therefore, the observation of this event suggests the formation of black holes from channels beyond the standard stellar collapse. However, different waveform models yield significantly different parameter estimates, possibly due to missing physics in the models used in inference. In this work, we carry out a reanalysis of GW231123 using a physically complete model, accounting for both spin precession and eccentricity. Our analysis shows that this event does not exhibit strong evidence for eccentricity and the exclusion of eccentricity has minimal impact on inference. Furthermore, for GW231123-like systems, even eccentricities as large as $0.15$ at $10$ Hz do not yield a confident nonzero eccentricity measurement. Through a zero-noise injection recovery study, we show that the observed discrepancies in the parameter estimates can be explained by disagreement in the waveform models at strong spin precession, with the degree of parameter bias in the zero-noise runs being comparable to that observed for the real signal. We also show that inference performed with an eccentric, aligned-spin waveform model can yield a confident nonzero eccentricity measurement due to the degeneracy between eccentricity and spin precession. Bayesian model selection, however, rules out this interpretation in favor of the eccentric, spin precessing hypothesis, which supports zero eccentricity -- a conclusion we confirm with additional zero-noise injection-recovery tests."

Our system retrieves semantically similar images using BEIT-3 (Flickr30k-384 and COCO-384) and SigLIP So-384, reranks them using ORB and SIFT for geometric alignment, and extracts contextual information from related articles via semantic search. A fine-tuned Qwen3 model with QLoRA then integrates this context with base captions generated by Instruct BLIP (Vicuna-7B) to produce event-enriched, context-aware descriptions. Evaluated on the OpenEvents v1 dataset, our approach generates significantly more informative captions compared to traditional methods, showing strong potential for real-world applications requiring deeper visual-textual understanding"

This study investigates whether incorporating road-facing views alongside driver-facing footage improves distraction detection accuracy in naturalistic driving conditions. Using synchronized dual-camera recordings from real-world driving, we benchmark three leading spatiotemporal action recognition architectures: SlowFast-R50, X3D-M, and SlowOnly-R50. Each model is evaluated under two input configurations: driver-only and stacked dual-view. Results show that while contextual inputs can improve detection in certain models, performance gains depend strongly on the underlying architecture. The single-pathway SlowOnly model achieved a 9.8 percent improvement with dual-view inputs, while the dual-pathway SlowFast model experienced a 7.2 percent drop in accuracy due to representational conflicts. These findings suggest that simply adding visual context is not sufficient and may lead to interference unless the architecture is specifically designed to support multi-view integration. This study presents one of the first systematic comparisons of single- and dual-view distraction detection models using naturalistic driving data and underscores the importance of fusion-aware design for future multimodal driver monitoring systems."

We do this by evaluating the learner as the training data is varied according to its metadata. A Gaussian process (GP) surrogate fit to that response surface can inform new data acquisitions. This meta-learning approach offers improvements to learner performance as compared to data with randomly selected metadata, which we illustrate on both classic learning examples, and on a motivating application involving the collection of aerial images in search of airplanes."

A coarse mesh homogenized ESL model efficiently predicts the global displacement field, from which degrees of freedom (DOFs) along stiffened panel boundaries are extracted. A global to local DOF mapping and reconstruction procedure is developed to recover detailed boundary kinematics for local analysis. The reconstructed DOFs, together with panel geometry and loading, serve as inputs to a heterogeneous graph transformer (HGT), a subtype of GNN, which rapidly and accurately predicts the detailed stress and displacement fields for any panel within the hull girder. The HGT is trained using high fidelity 3D panel finite element model with reconstructed boundary conditions, enabling it to generalize across varying panel geometries, loadings, and boundary behaviors. Once trained, the framework requires only the global ESL solution in order to generate detailed local responses, making it highly suitable for optimization. Validation on three box beam case studies demonstrates that the global prediction error is governed by the coarse mesh ESL solution, while the HGT maintains high local accuracy and clearly outperforms conventional ESL based stress estimation method."

However, graph-based deep learning models are vulnerable, as attackers can add fake relationships to evade detection by the classifier. Second, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based attack algorithm named VGAE-MalGAN targeting graph-based GNN Android malware classifiers. The VGAE-MalGAN generator produces adversarial malware API graphs, while the VGAE-MalGAN substitute detector attempts to mimic the target detector. Experimental results show that VGAE-MalGAN can significantly reduce the detection rate of GNN-based malware classifiers. Although the model initially fails to detect adversarial malware, retraining with generated adversarial samples improves robustness and helps mitigate adversarial attacks."

Drawing on Eastern aesthetic philosophies of intentional emptiness, including Chinese negative-space traditions, Japanese \"ma\" concepts, and contemporary design minimalism, we demonstrate how educators can teach students to maintain creative agency while strategically leveraging AI assistance. During this workshop, participants will experience a structured three-phase methodology: creating a human-led narrative foundation, identifying strategic gaps, and collaborating on AI enhancements. The workshop combines theoretical foundations with intensive hands-on practice, enabling participants to create compelling HCI visual narratives that demonstrate effective human-AI partnership. Through sequential art techniques, storyboarding exercises, and guided AI integration, attendees learn to communicate complex interactive concepts, accessibility solutions, and user experience flows while preserving narrative coherence and creative vision. Building on our successful workshops at ACM C&C 2025, this session specifically addresses the needs of the Chinese HCI community for culturally informed and pedagogically sound approaches to AI integration in creative education."

    "abstract": "Broken Access Control (BAC) violations, which consistently rank among the top five security risks in the OWASP API Security Top 10, refer to unauthorized access attempts arising from BAC vulnerabilities, whose successful exploitation can impose significant risks on exposed application programming interfaces (APIs). In recent years, learning-based methods have demonstrated promising prospects in detecting various types of malicious activities. However, in real-network operation and maintenance scenarios, leveraging learning-based methods for BAC detection faces two critical challenges. Firstly, under the RESTful API design principles, most systems omit recording composite traffic for performance, and together with ethical and legal bans on directly testing real-world systems, this leads to a critical shortage of training data for detecting BAC violations. Secondly, common malicious behaviors such as SQL injection typically generate individual access traffic that is inherently anomalous. In contrast, BAC is usually composed of multiple correlated access requests that appear normal when examined in isolation. To tackle these problems, we introduce \\BAC, an approach for establishing a BAC violation detection model by generating and utilizing API traffic data. The \\BAC consists of an API Traffic Generator and a BAC Detector. Experimental results show that \\BAC outperforms current state-of-the-art invariant-based and learning-based methods with the $\\text{F}_1$ and MCC improving by 21.2\\% and 24.1\\%."

    "abstract": "Metaheuristic algorithms for cardinality-constrained portfolio optimization require repair operators to map infeasible candidates onto the feasible region. Standard Euclidean projection treats assets as independent and can ignore the covariance structure that governs portfolio risk, potentially producing less diversified portfolios. This paper introduces Covariance-Aware Simplex Projection (CASP), a two-stage repair operator that (i) selects a target number of assets using volatility-normalized scores and (ii) projects the candidate weights using a covariance-aware geometry aligned with tracking-error risk. This provides a portfolio-theoretic foundation for using a covariance-induced distance in repair operators. On S&P 500 data (2020-2024), CASP-Basic delivers materially lower portfolio variance than standard Euclidean repair without relying on return estimates, with improvements that are robust across assets and statistically significant. Ablation results indicate that volatility-normalized selection drives most of the variance reduction, while the covariance-aware projection provides an additional, consistent improvement. We further show that optional return-aware extensions can improve Sharpe ratios, and out-of-sample tests confirm that gains transfer to realized performance. CASP integrates as a drop-in replacement for Euclidean projection in metaheuristic portfolio optimizers."

We analyze Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B on multilingual inputs in C++, Java, Python, Go, and JavaScript, measuring neuron selectivity and layerwise contributions during generation. We find (1) neurons specialized for individual languages alongside a universal subset supporting general-purpose generation; and (2) lower layers mainly encode language-specific syntax, while middle layers capture semantic abstractions shared across languages, emerging as concept layers. We demonstrate utility on three tasks: neuron-guided fine-tuning for code generation, clone detection via concept-layer embeddings, and concept-layer-guided transfer for code summarization, each yielding consistent gains in multilingual settings."

To address these limitations, we propose SE360, a novel framework for multi-condition guided object editing in 360$^\\circ$ panoramas. At its core is a novel coarse-to-fine autonomous data generation pipeline without manual intervention. This pipeline leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and adaptive projection adjustment for hierarchical analysis, ensuring the holistic segmentation of objects and their physical context. The resulting data pairs are both semantically meaningful and geometrically consistent, even when sourced from unlabeled panoramas. Furthermore, we introduce a cost-effective, two-stage data refinement strategy to improve data realism and mitigate model overfitting to erase artifacts. Based on the constructed dataset, we train a Transformer-based diffusion model to allow flexible object editing guided by text, mask, or reference image in 360$^\\circ$ panoramas. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and semantic accuracy."

In many cases, pair coupled cluster doubles provides a polynomial-cost approximation that closely reproduces the energies of DOCI, but it breaks down in some cases and, as shown herein, it does not provide particularly good density matrices. In this work, we demonstrate that by using the Jordan-Wigner approximation to turn the seniority zero problem back into a fermionic one, we can provide variational results of DOCI quality for the Hubbard model and a few small molecular dissociation examples, with polynomial cost, both for the energies and for density matrices, all while being protected from collapse."

We use two standard sets of cosmological data, one including distant supernovae from Pantheon$+$ and the other from DES-Y5. The rest of the data (BAO from DESI DR2 and CMB from Planck PR4) are shared by the two sets. They are analyzed with the help of \\texttt{CLASS}. No structure formation data are utilized for this analysis and no use is made of the SH0ES calibration of $H_0$. Even so, we find that the flipped RVM and to a lesser extent the $w$XCDM and the RVM with threshold, point to significant evidence of dynamical DE, at a level comparable to $w_0w_a$CDM, more conspicuously for the dataset that involves DES-Y5 observations. We also find that while more traditional models studied in the past, in which there is an exchange between vacuum energy and cold dark matter (through e.g. an interactive source proportional either to the density of dark matter or to that of vacuum) still hint at dynamical DE, the strength of the statistical signal (which we assess through information criteria and other estimators) is nevertheless less pronounced. Finally, we discuss the ability of the various models to explain the data by performing an analysis of their effective equation-of-state parameters and corresponding evolution of their dark energy densities."

We obtain analytic expressions for $ω_{α,β}$ for gapped ground states of non-interacting fermion Hamiltonians as well as ground states of string-net models. In both cases, we find that $ω_{α,β}$ takes a universal value related to the chiral central charge. For integer values of $α$ and $β$, our quantity $ω_{α,β}$ can be expressed as an expectation value of permutation operators acting on an appropriate replica system, providing a natural route to measuring $ω_{α,β}$ in numerical simulations and potentially, experiments."

These contributions establish minimum accuracy as a scalable, theoretically sound tool for pre-screening feature maps on near-term quantum devices."

Existing approaches typically rely on external judges, multi-sample consistency, or text-based self-critique, which incur additional compute or correlate weakly with true correctness. We ask: can LLMs predict their own failures by inspecting internal states during inference? We introduce Gnosis, a lightweight self-awareness mechanism that enables frozen LLMs to perform intrinsic self-verification by decoding signals from hidden states and attention patterns. Gnosis passively observes internal traces, compresses them into fixed-budget descriptors, and predicts correctness with negligible inference cost, adding only ~5M parameters and operating independently of sequence length. Across math reasoning, open-domain question answering, and academic knowledge benchmarks, and over frozen backbones ranging from 1.7B to 20B parameters, Gnosis consistently outperforms strong internal baselines and large external judges in both accuracy and calibration. Moreover, it generalizes zero-shot to partial generations, enabling early detection of failing trajectories and compute-aware control. These results show that reliable correctness cues are intrinsic to generation process and can be extracted efficiently without external supervision."

For this purpose, we used a sample of 366 red giant stars belonging to 25 globular and open clusters, complemented by 52 extremely metal-poor field giant stars. The CaT line strengths are determined by fitting Gaussian-Lorentzian combination profiles using the Python lmfit package, which utilises the algorithms implemented therein. The derived calibration is valid for a wide metallicity range, $-4$\\,dex$ \\lesssim \\mathrm{[Fe/H]} \\lesssim +0.15$, and for ages older than $\\sim$200 Myr.

We propose a modified quantum TUR, which incorporates the charge value and demonstrate that this charge-dependent quantum TUR can only be violated if the highest charge transport process exceeds this charge value. In particular, we establish that the breaking of the quantum TUR solely originates from the charge value of the highest charge transport process. Namely, our analytical considerations do not invoke the existence of superconductivity, and these considerations generally hold for non-interacting electronic transport which can be described by the scattering formalism."

Our results demonstrate that Pt-SNE achieves superior accuracy, with a root-mean-square error (sigma_F) of 0.169 dex compared to LePhare's 0.306 dex. Crucially, Pt-SNE exhibits significantly lower bias (0.029 dex) compared to LePhare (0.286 dex). Pt-SNE also shows greater robustness across all stellar mass ranges, particularly for low-mass galaxies (10^9 to 10^10 solar masses), where it reduces errors by 47-53 %. Even when restricted to only six optical bands, Pt-SNE outperforms LePhare using all 26 available photometric bands, underscoring its superior informational efficiency. Computationally, Pt-SNE processes large datasets approximately 3.2 x 10^3 times faster than LePhare.

    "abstract": "We consider a uniform spanning tree in a $δ$-square grid approximation of a planar domain $Ω$. For given integer $n\\ge 2$, we condition the tree on the following $n$-arm event: we pick $n$ branches, emanating from $n$ points microscopically close to a given interior point, and condition them to connect to the boundary $\\partial Ω$ without intersecting. What can be said about the geometry of these branches? We derive an exact formula for the characteristic function of the total winding of the branches. A surprising consequence of this formula is that in the scaling limit, the behaviour of this function depends on the total number of branches $n$ only through its parity. We also describe the scaling limit of the branches. If $Ω$ is the unit disc, then they hit the boundary (i.e., the unit circle) at random positions which coincide exactly with the eigenvalues of a random matrix of size $n$ drawn from the Circular Orthogonal Ensemble (COE, also called C$β$E with $β=1$). Furthermore, the branches converge to Loewner evolution driven by the circular Dyson Brownian motion with parameter $β= 4$ (i.e., $n$-sided radial SLE$_κ$ with $κ=2$). We thus verify a prediction made by Cardy in this setting. Along the way, we develop a flow-line (imaginary geometry) coupling of $n$-sided radial SLE$_κ$ with the Gaussian free field, which may be of independent interest. Surprisingly, we find that the variance of the corresponding field near the singularity also does not depend on the number $n\\ge 2$ of curves. In contrast, the variance of the the winding of the curves behaves as $κ/n^2$, which agrees with the predictions from the physics literature made by Wieland and Wilson numerically, and by Duplantier and Binder using Coulomb gas methods -- but disagrees with a result of Kenyon."

We derive upper bounds on positional information gain due to nonlocal readout and identify signal processing algorithms that approximate optimal positional inference, as well as simple chemical reaction schemes which implement such algorithms. Our theory suggests that correlational information can be exploited to significantly enhance developmental precision."

We use it as a bridge to compare the chemical and physical roles of metal and ligand orbitals in cuprates and pnictides. In cuprates, ionicity, covalency, and metallicity are tightly interwoven to give rise to high-temperature superconductivity (SC). Their most remarkable property is the interaction of an ionically localized hole on the copper (Cu) with a Fermi liquid (FL) on the oxygens (O), which is critically important for understanding all key properties of these materials. The localization is due to strong correlations on the Cu $3d$ orbital. We describe a scenario in which the localized hole gives rise both to SC by Cooper scattering of O holes, and to Fermi arcs, as observed in cuprate spectroscopy, the latter by a purely kinematic projection of the static local disorder, without invoking any residual interactions between the mobile O FL carriers. In the pnictides, the orbitals responsible for binding and metallic conduction appear to be separate. The Fe $3d$ $e_{g}$ orbitals hybridized with the ligands set the lattice spacing. The $3d$ $t_{2g}$ orbitals overlap directly between the Fe atoms, resulting in several electronic bands appearing at the Fermi level. The ensuing Fermi liquid exhibits both charge and magnetic correlations. We argue that a similar SC scenario as in the cuprates is plausible in the pnictides, except that a light FL scatters on a slow nearly-antiferromagnetic (AF) one, rather than on localized holes as in the cuprates."

    "abstract": "We revisit the near-horizon description of the Kerr space-time in the isolated horizon formalism using a non-twisting null geodesic congruence and eliminate the coordinate and geodesic pathologies that arise when the Carter constant of motion is globally fixed to a single constant. Adopting instead a previously proposed choice of the Carter constant which depends on the polar angle on the horizon, we obtain an analytic construction of the Newman--Penrose tetrad adapted to isolated horizons together with horizon-adapted coordinates in which its defining properties are manifest. We compute the associated curvature scalars and provide initial data on characteristics for the isolated horizon. In addition to an analytical solution, derived by leveraging extensive results on Kerr null geodesics, we develop two complementary series expansions and outline a practical numerical recipe to make the construction readily usable. Relative to earlier treatments, our formulation avoids caustic-induced breakdowns and incomplete coordinate coverage while yielding a detailed description of the Kerr black hole in the isolated horizon approach."

Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) is a popular explainable AI framework, but it lacks efficient implementations for time series and often assumes feature independence when sampling counterfactuals. We introduce SHAPformer, an accurate, fast and sampling-free explainable time-series forecasting model based on the Transformer architecture. It leverages attention manipulation to make predictions based on feature subsets. SHAPformer generates explanations in under one second, several orders of magnitude faster than the SHAP Permutation Explainer. On synthetic data with ground truth explanations, SHAPformer provides explanations that are true to the data. Applied to real-world electrical load data, it achieves competitive predictive performance and delivers meaningful local and global insights, such as identifying the past load as the key predictor and revealing a distinct model behavior during the Christmas period."

The material properties of gelatin change with the ratio of water to gelatin powder used to make a given sample. Characterizing the relationship between this ratio and the material properties of gelatin is crucial to enable its use in mechanics experiments. In this work, compression tests were performed on a texture analyzer on samples which ranged from a 2:1 to 20:1 ratio of water to gelatin powder. In this range, instantaneous stiffnesses were well fit via power law in this ratio and decreased from 277 +/- 30 kPa to 4.34 +/- 0.64 kPa. The dominant (longest) timescales of the samples were well fit via a sigmoid function in this ratio and increased from 29.8 +/- 1.0 s to 621 +/- 92 s. The resulting ratio-property relationships offer a functional way to design gelatin samples for use in mechanics experiments."

This enables effective decoding of spatial language into visual representations, paving the way for automated scene generation aligned with human spatial understanding. Chapter 4 presents a method for translating medical texts into specific 3D locations within an anatomical atlas. We introduce a loss function leveraging spatial co-occurrences of medical terms to create interpretable mappings, significantly enhancing medical text navigability. Chapter 5 tackles translating structured text into canonical facts within knowledge graphs. We develop a benchmark for linking natural language to entities and predicates, addressing ambiguities in text extraction to provide clearer, actionable insights. Chapter 6 explores multimodal fusion methods for compositional action recognition. We propose a method fusing video frames and object detection representations, improving recognition robustness and accuracy. Chapter 7 investigates multimodal knowledge transference for egocentric action recognition. We demonstrate how multimodal knowledge distillation enables RGB-only models to mimic multimodal fusion-based capabilities, reducing computational requirements while maintaining performance. These contributions advance methodologies for spatial language understanding, medical text interpretation, knowledge graph enrichment, and action recognition, enhancing computational systems' ability to process complex, multimodal inputs across diverse applications."

    "abstract": "Rapid advancements in quantum computing and machine learning threaten the long-term security of classical blockchain systems, whose protection mechanisms largely rely on computational difficulties. In this study, we propose a quantum blockchain protocol whose protection mechanism is directly derived from quantum mechanical principles. The protocol combines high-dimensional Bell states, time-entanglement, entanglement switching, and high-dimensional superdense coding. Encoding classical block information into time-delimited qudit states allows block identity and data verification to be implemented through the causal sequencing of quantum measurements instead of cryptographic hash functions. High-dimensional coding increases the information capacity per quantum carrier and improves noise resistance. Time-entanglement provides distributed authentication, non-repudiation, and tamper detection across the blockchain. Each block derives its own public-private key pair directly from the observed quantum correlations by performing high-dimensional Bell state measurements in successive time steps. Because these keys are dependent on the time ordering of measurements, attempts to alter block data or disrupt the protocol's timing structure inevitably affect the reconstructed correlations and are revealed during validation. Recent advances in the creation and detection of high-dimensional time-slice entanglement demonstrate that the necessary quantum resources are compatible with emerging quantum communication platforms. Taken together, these considerations suggest that the proposed framework can be evaluated as a viable and scalable candidate for quantum-secure blockchain architectures in future quantum network environments."

SweRankMulti comprises a code embedding retriever and a listwise LLM reranker, and is trained using a carefully curated large-scale issue localization dataset spanning multiple popular programming languages. SweRankAgent adopts an agentic search loop that moves beyond single-shot localization with a memory buffer to reason and accumulate relevant localization candidates over multiple turns.

Current calibration methods require additional spacecraft maneuvers that disrupt science data continuity and inter-satellite links, compromising the coherence of gravitational wave signals. Here, we present a maneuver-free calibration scheme that directly estimates the CoM offset vector using only standard science-mode measurements from inertial sensors, interferometers, and differential wavefront sensors. By embedding the CoM offset induced coupling acceleration as an extended state in a model-based adaptive Kalman filter, we achieve estimation accuracy of 0.01-1.5 mm across all axes with a maximum error below 1%. This approach enables continuous, high-precision calibration during nominal observation runs, ensuring continuous and coherent gravitational wave data collection while maintaining the required precision, and also facilitating advanced DFACS functions such as performance evaluations and fault diagnosis. For LISA-like missions, where data continuity is paramount for detecting faint gravitational wave signals, this method will enhance scientific output and reliability."

    "abstract": "Surfaces and structures capable of multiple stable configurations have attracted growing interest for on-demand shape morphing. In this work, we consider an elastic compliant plate coupled to a two-dimensional foundation comprising an array of bistable elements, a system that can form and retain complex continuous morphologies without sustained actuation via creation of stable domain walls separating regions in different stable states. These domain walls exhibit three distinct behaviors: expansion, shrinking, and metastable pinning. These arise from two limits of foundation discreteness. In the continuum limit, where bistable units are strongly coupled, domain walls undergo global phase transitions analogous to first-order phase transitions. In the anti-continuum limit, discreteness introduces Peierls-Nabarro-type energy modulations that lead to metastable pinning. To quantify these behaviors and the transition between the two limits, we develop a reduced-order model that captures the total potential energy of configurations with domain walls and validate it using finite element analysis (FEA). For axisymmetric domain walls, the model yields phase diagrams identifying the regimes of expansion, shrinking, and pinning as functions of bistable-potential asymmetry, relative foundation discreteness, and domain-wall size. We then extend the analysis to non-axisymmetric geometries and establish local geometric criteria that predict the stability of convex and concave polygonal domain walls, confirmed by simulations. Together, these results clarify how discreteness enables stability through energy-landscape modulation, provide predictive design rules for multistable reconfigurable surfaces, and offer insights into domain-wall stability more generally in elastically coupled multistable metamaterials."

However, most existing methods overlook physical cues such as joint actuation forces that are fundamental in biomechanics. This gap motivates our study: if and when do physically inferred forces enhance motion understanding? By incorporating forces into established motion understanding pipelines, we systematically evaluate their impact across baseline models on 3 major tasks: gait recognition, action recognition, and fine-grained video captioning. Across 8 benchmarks, incorporating forces yields consistent performance gains; for example, on CASIA-B, Rank-1 gait recognition accuracy improved from 89.52% to 90.39% (+0.87), with larger gain observed under challenging conditions: +2.7% when wearing a coat and +3.0% at the side view. On Gait3D, performance also increases from 46.0% to 47.3% (+1.3). In action recognition, CTR-GCN achieved +2.00% on Penn Action, while high-exertion classes like punching/slapping improved by +6.96%. Even in video captioning, Qwen2.5-VL's ROUGE-L score rose from 0.310 to 0.339 (+0.029), indicating that physics-inferred forces enhance temporal grounding and semantic richness. These results demonstrate that force cues can substantially complement visual and kinematic features under dynamic, occluded, or appearance-varying conditions."

Degeneracy in this context is measured by the real parameters for $μ_a\\in [0,2)$ for $a\\in\\{K,EI\\}$, where $K(x)$ denotes shear stiffness and $EI(x)$ bending stiffness. We differentiate between weak degeneracy $μ_a\\in [0,1)$ and strong degeneracy $μ_a\\in [1,2)$, which may occur independently in shear and bending. Our study establishes observability inequalities for both weakly and strongly degenerate equations under Dirichlet, Robin, and Neumann boundary conditions. Using energy multiplier techniques and the Hilbert Uniqueness Method (HUM), we derive conditions for exact boundary controllability and show that appropriate boundary state and velocity feedback controls at the non-degenerate end can stabilize the system exponentially. Extending results previously obtained for the 1-dimensional wave equation in \\cite{AlabauCannarsaLeugering2017}, this study highlights new control strategies and stabilization effects specific to the degenerate Timoshenko beam system, addressing challenges pertinent to real-world structural damping and control applications."

We completely realize their approach to give another proof of this Watanabe--Yoshida conjecture. The main ingredient of the proof relies on a new explicit combinatorial formula for the coefficients of this shifted Ehrhart polynomial. In terms of the generating function of the shifted polynomial, this formula manifests itself as a Hadamard product of the exponential generating function of Euler numbers and an explicit algebraic function."

The lower bound is derived through the Rademacher complexity of neural networks. A probabilistic version of the upper bound is also provided by considering neural networks with randomly sampled weights and biases. Finally, it is shown that the assumption on the regularity of the activation function can be significantly weakened without worsening the approximation error, and the approximation upper bound is validated with numerical experiments."

    "abstract": "The rigorous description of Conical Intersections (CIs) remains the central challenge of non-adiabatic quantum chemistry. While the ``Yarkony Seam'' -- the $(3N-8)$-dimensional manifold of degeneracy -- is well-understood geometrically, its accurate characterization by high-level electronic structure methods is plagued by numerical instabilities. Specifically, standard Coupled Cluster (CC) theory suffers from root bifurcations near Ground State CIs, rendering the ``Gold Standard'' of chemistry inapplicable where it is needed most. Here, we present \\textbf{QuMorpheus}, an open-source computational package that resolves these singularities by implementing a topological framework based on Dissipative Mixed Hodge Modules (DMHM) [P. Saurabh, arXiv:2512.19487 (2025)]. By algorithmically mapping the CC polynomial equations to a spectral sheaf, we compute the exact Monodromy ($μ$) invariants of the intersection. We demonstrate that this automated algebraic geometry approach correctly identifies the physical ground state topology in the Köhn-Tajti model and resolves the intersection seams of realistic chemical systems, including Ethylene and the Chloronium ion ($\\mathrm{H_2Cl^+}$). Furthermore, we apply QuMorpheus to the photoisomerization of Previtamin D, proving that the experimentally observed Woodward-Hoffmann selection rules are a direct consequence of a topological ``Monodromy Wall'' ($μ=1, γ=π$) rather than purely energetic barriers. This establishes a general software solution to the ``Yarkony Problem,'' enabling the robust, automated mapping of global intersection seams in complex molecular systems. The topological stability of these intersections allows for the control protocols discussed in Ref.[P. Saurabh, Submitted to Phys. Rev. X (2025)]."

The main effect of this specific combination of deterministic dynamics is an induced metastability of anti-phase synchronized clusters of oscillators. Metastable switching is typical for neuronal networks and a characteristic of brain dynamics. We analyze the metatstability as a function of the system parameters, in particular of the size and the network connectivity. The mechanism behind sudden changes in the order parameters are individual oscillators which change their cluster affiliation from time to time, providing ``weak ties\" between clusters of synchronized oscillators. The time series have random features, but derive from deterministic dynamics."

While these systems provide numerous benefits, their misuse raises safety and security concerns, making effective detection mechanisms essential. Acoustic sensing offers a low-cost and non-intrusive alternative to vision or radar-based detection, as drone propellers generate distinctive sound patterns. This study introduces AUDRON (AUdio-based Drone Recognition Network), a hybrid deep learning framework for drone sound detection, employing a combination of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) spectrograms processed with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent layers for temporal modeling, and autoencoder-based representations. Feature-level fusion integrates complementary information before classification. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that AUDRON effectively differentiates drone acoustic signatures from background noise, achieving high accuracy while maintaining generalizability across varying conditions. AUDRON achieves 98.51 percent and 97.11 percent accuracy in binary and multiclass classification. The results highlight the advantage of combining multiple feature representations with deep learning for reliable acoustic drone detection, suggesting the framework's potential for deployment in security and surveillance applications where visual or radar sensing may be limited."

    "abstract": "Distilling knowledge from large proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4) to tiny deployable models (less than 1B parameters) faces a critical capacity-budget trap: the 1000x capacity gap between teachers and students prevents effective direct transfer, while API costs prohibit extensive data collection. We introduce BRIDGE (Budget-Aware Reasoning via Intermediate Distillation), a two-phase framework that resolves these constraints through strategic intermediation and budget asymmetry. In Phase 1, a mid-sized Teacher Assistant (TA; e.g., about 7B) learns from the black-box teacher on a strictly limited subset of data (e.g., 3-5%), selected via a zero-API-cost pipeline that balances entropic difficulty and semantic diversity using only local TA inference. In Phase 2, we exploit this asymmetry-teacher queries are expensive, whereas TA inference is free to amplify supervision: the refined TA generates synthetic rationales for the full dataset to train the tiny student. Crucially, we apply an instruction-tuning curriculum to establish behavioral alignment in the tiny student before transferring reasoning. Our theoretical analysis shows that BRIDGE yields tighter generalization bounds than direct distillation when data is abundant. Experiments across medical, legal, and financial benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements: BRIDGE delivers student performance gains of 28-41%, closing the capability gap with proprietary teachers by 12-16% while using 10x fewer teacher queries. Notably, BRIDGE defies the conventional cost-performance frontier, surpassing direct distillation baselines that use 100% of the budget while consuming only 5% of the resources."

Moreover, the possible integration with other OMNeT++ libraries allows highly detailed simulations. We measure iblock's performance against a state-of-the-art blockchain simulator, proving that it is more efficient at the same level of simulation detail. We also validate iblock by using it to simulate different scenarios such as the normal Bitcoin operation and the selfish mine attack, showing that simulation results are coherent with theoretical expectations."

    "abstract": "Building upon the recent discovery of history-dependent dynamical invariants in the Lorenz system, this work presents a systematic classification of a complete family of such conserved quantities. Analysis of all 24 permutations in the augmented phase space identifies eighteen distinct invariants ($K_1-K_{18}$) organized into three regularization classes: Class I (permutations $1abc$), Class II ($2abc$), and Class III ($3abc$). Six permutations ($4abc$) yield null results due to Schwarz integrability conditions. Each class is characterized by a distinct polynomial factor that removes singularities at nullcline crossings. The regularized variable $v_n = p\\, u_n$ evolves according to $dv_n/dt = Q_n(x,y,z)$, independent of $v_n$ itself; different conservation laws thereby impose distinct measures of trajectory history. Any three invariants from different classes provide independent constraints, defining a canonical Triad that characterizes orbit structure. Statistical analysis reveals class-dependent dynamical signatures: Class III invariants display higher intermittency (kurtosis ~15 versus ~8 for Class I) and stronger asymmetry (skewness ~2.7 versus ~1.6), correlating with lobe-switching events where the product $xy$ undergoes rapid sign reversal. This geometric sensitivity establishes Class III invariants as probes of topological transitions, while Class I invariants track continuous dynamics. The class-dependent divergence quantifies how different conservation principles impose incompatible demands on trajectory history. High-precision numerical validation confirms conservation of all identified quantities."

This letter considers antenna subset selection for a waveguide-fed pinching antenna array serving ground users under a time-division access scheme. The achievable rate depends on the coherent superposition of the effective complex channel gains and is therefore highly sensitive to the relative phase alignment of the activated antennas. To address the prohibitive complexity of exhaustive search, we propose a Viterbi state selection (VSS) algorithm that exploits the phase structure of the combined received signal. The trellis state is defined by a quantized representation of the phase of the accumulated complex gain, and a Viterbi-based survivor rule is used to prune dominated antenna subsets across stages. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the same antenna selection and rate as exhaustive search, while reducing the computational complexity from exponential to polynomial in the number of available antennas."

    "abstract": "We live in a world filled with anisotropy, a ubiquitous characteristic of both natural and engineered systems. In this study, we concentrate on space deformation and introduce anisotropic Green coordinates, which provide versatile effects for cage-based and variational deformations in both two and three dimensions. The anisotropic Green coordinates are derived from the anisotropic Laplacian equation $\\nabla\\cdot(\\mathbf{A}\\nabla u)=0$, where $\\mathbf{A}$ is a symmetric positive definite matrix. This equation belongs to the class of constant-coefficient second-order elliptic equations, exhibiting properties analogous to the Laplacian equation but incorporating the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ to characterize anisotropic behavior. Based on this equation, we establish the boundary integral formulation, which is subsequently discretized to derive anisotropic Green coordinates defined on the vertices and normals of oriented simplicial cages. The deformation satisfies basic properties such as linear reproduction and translation invariance, and has closed-form expressions for both 2D and 3D scenarios. We also offer intuitive geometric interpretations of this method. Furthermore, our approach computes the gradient and Hessian of the deformation coordinates and employs the local-global optimization framework to facilitate variational shape deformation, enabling flexible shape manipulation while achieving as-rigid-as-possible shape deformation. Experimental results demonstrate that anisotropic Green coordinates offer versatile and diverse deformation options, providing artists with enhanced flexibility and introducing a novel perspective on spatial deformation."

Building on earlier phenomenological proposals, we introduce a barotropic equation-of-state parameter with a sigmoid-like correction to guarantee a strictly positive dark energy density and to avoid early-time pathologies commonly present in previous models. Using this formulation, closed-form analytic expressions for the energy density can be obtained. This, in turn, enables a systematic classification of future singularities based on the signs and magnitudes of two key parameters of the model. We test these scenarios with state-of-the-art cosmological probes, including DESI DR2 BAO, cosmic chronometers, CMB compressed likelihoods, and the Pantheon+ supernovae sample. According to our Bayesian analysis, all rip scenarios yield best-fit parameters compatible with $Λ$CDM at the $1σ$ level, with Bayes factors weakly favoring $Λ$CDM. The mild, logarithmic evolution of the proposed dark energy density prevents current observations from distinguishing among the different future fates. We conclude that, for rip cosmologies to gain observational support over $Λ$CDM, they must display more accentuated late-time dynamical features -- such as perhaps rapid transitions or a phantom-divide crossing -- within the redshift range probed by present surveys."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate a movable antenna (MA) enabled anti-jamming optimization problem, where a legitimate uplink system is exposed to multiple jammers with unknown jamming channels. To enhance the anti-jamming capability of the considered system, an MA array is deployed at the receiver, and the antenna positions and the minimum-variance distortionless-response (MVDR) receive beamformer are jointly optimized to maximize the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The main challenge arises from the fact that the interference covariance matrix is unknown and nonlinearly dependent on the antenna positions. To overcome these issues, we propose a surrogate objective by replacing the unknown covariance with the sample covariance evaluated at the current antenna position anchor. Under a two-timescale framework, the surrogate objective is updated once per block (contains multiple snapshots) at the current anchor position, while the MVDR beamformer is adapted on a per-snapshot basis. We establish a local bound on the discrepancy between the surrogate and the true objective by leveraging matrix concentration inequalities, and further prove that a natural historical-averaging surrogate suffers from a non-vanishing geometric bias. Building on these insights, we develop a low-complexity projected trust-region (TR) surrogate optimization (PTRSO) algorithm that maintains the locality of each iteration via TR constraints and enforces feasibility through projection, which is guaranteed to converge to a stationary point near the anchor. Numerical results verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed PTRSO algorithm, which consistently achieves higher output SINR than existing baselines."

We report the first experimental demonstration of storing and retrieving optical skyrmions in a cold $^{87}$Rb vapor using a dual-path electromagnetically induced transparency memory. Crucially, we show that the skyrmion number remains invariant for storage times up to several microseconds, even when subjected to imbalanced loss between the two paths and substantial perturbations in control beam power.

Conversely, for samples with Tc>TFM, strong short-range spin correlations and phase boundaries within a multiphase coexistence regime near the triple point act as potent pair-breaking centers, leading to pronounced Hc2 suppression."

We also provide examples showing that this result is sharp, leading to a revised form of Campana's abelianity conjecture for smooth quasi-projective varieties. In addition, we prove a structure theorem for quasi-projective varieties with big and semisimple representations of the fundamental groups, thereby addressing a conjecture by Kollár in 1995. We also construct several examples of quasi-projective varieties that are special and $h$-special, highlighting certain atypical properties of the non-compact case in contrast with the projective setting."

Our framework enables configurable analysis parameters (1-6 seeds, temperature 0.0-2.0), supports custom prompt structures with variable substitution, and provides consensus theme extraction across any JSON format. As proof-of-concept, we evaluate three leading LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) on a psychedelic art therapy interview transcript, conducting six independent runs per model. Results demonstrate Gemini achieves highest reliability ($κ= 0.907$, cosine=95.3%), followed by GPT-4o ($κ= 0.853$, cosine=92.6%) and Claude ($κ= 0.842$, cosine=92.1%). All three models achieve a high agreement ($κ> 0.80$), validating the multi-run ensemble approach. The framework successfully extracts consensus themes across runs, with Gemini identifying 6 consensus themes (50-83% consistency), GPT-4o identifying 5 themes, and Claude 4 themes.

Using a controlled robotic platform, active Brownian particle simulations, and scaling theory, we identify a universal trade-off between noise-induced deviation and the finite cost of reorientation, yielding an optimal course correction frequency governed by only a few system parameters. Despite their differing levels of complexity, our experiment and theory collapse onto common quantitative signatures, including first-passage time distribution and non-Gaussian angular dispersion.

Previous research has predominantly examined how code context influences the generation of defective code, often overlooking the impact of defects within commented-out code (CO code). AI coding assistants' interpretation of CO code in prompts affects the code they generate. This study evaluates how AI coding assistants, GitHub Copilot and Cursor, are influenced by defective CO code. The experimental results show that defective CO code in the context causes AI coding assistants to generate more defective code, reaching up to 58.17 percent. Our findings further demonstrate that the tools do not simply copy the defective code from the context. Instead, they actively reason to complete incomplete defect patterns and continue to produce defective code despite distractions such as incorrect indentation or tags. Even with explicit instructions to ignore the defective CO code, the reduction in defects does not exceed 21.84 percent. These findings underscore the need for improved robustness and security measures in AI coding assistants."

    "abstract": "High-mobility wireless communication systems suffer from severe Doppler spread and multi-path delay, which degrade the reliability and spectral efficiency of conventional modulation schemes. Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation offers strong robustness in such environments by representing symbols in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, while faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling can further enhance spectral efficiency through intentional symbol packing. Meanwhile, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) provide a promising means to improve link quality via passive beamforming. Motivated by these advantages, we propose a novel RIS-empowered OTFS modulation with FTN signaling (RIS-OTFS-FTN) scheme. First, we establish a unified DD-domain input-output relationship that jointly accounts for RIS passive beamforming, FTN-induced inter-symbol interference, and DD-domain channel characteristics. Based on this model, we provide comprehensive analytical performance for the frame error rate, spectral efficiency, and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), etc. Furthermore, a practical RIS phase adjustment strategy with quantized phase selection is designed to maximize the effective channel gain. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations under a standardized extended vehicular A (EVA) channel model validate the theoretical results and provide key insights into the trade-offs among spectral efficiency, PAPR, input back-off (IBO), and error performance, with some interesting insights.The proposed RIS-OTFS-FTN scheme demonstrates notable performance gains in both reliability and spectral efficiency, offering a viable solution for future high-mobility and spectrum-constrained wireless systems."

    "abstract": "Exterior powers play important roles in persistent homology in computational geometry. In the present paper we study the problem of extracting the $K$ longest intervals of the exterior-power layers of a tame persistence module. We prove a structural decomposition theorem that organizes the exterior-power layers into monotone per-anchor streams with explicit multiplicities, enabling a best-first algorithm. We also show that the Top-$K$ length vector is $2$-Lipschitz under bottleneck perturbations of the input barcode, and prove a comparison-model lower bound. Our experiments confirm the theory, showing speedups over full enumeration in high overlap cases. By enabling efficient extraction of the most prominent features, our approach makes higher-order persistence feasible for large datasets and thus broadly applicable to machine learning, data science, and scientific computing."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) show impressive performance on many NLP benchmarks, yet their ability to reason in figurative, culturally grounded, and low-resource settings remains underexplored. We address this gap for Bangla by introducing BanglaRiddleEval, a benchmark of 1,244 traditional Bangla riddles instantiated across four tasks (4,976 riddle-task artifacts in total). Using an LLM-based pipeline, we generate Chain-of-Thought explanations, semantically coherent distractors, and fine-grained ambiguity annotations, and evaluate a diverse suite of open-source and closed-source models under different prompting strategies. Models achieve moderate semantic overlap on generative QA but low correctness, MCQ accuracy peaks at only about 56% versus an 83% human baseline, and ambiguity resolution ranges from roughly 26% to 68%, with high-quality explanations confined to the strongest models. These results show that current LLMs capture some cues needed for Bangla riddle reasoning but remain far from human-level performance, establishing BanglaRiddleEval as a challenging new benchmark for low-resource figurative reasoning.

    "abstract": "Wi-Fi/RF-based human sensing has achieved remarkable progress with deep learning, yet practical deployments increasingly require feature sharing for cloud analytics, collaborative training, or benchmark evaluation. Releasing intermediate representations such as CSI spectrograms can inadvertently expose sensitive information, including user identity, location, and membership, motivating formal privacy guarantees. In this paper, we study differentially private (DP) feature release for wireless sensing and propose an adaptive privacy budget allocation mechanism tailored to the highly non-uniform structure of CSI time-frequency representations. Our pipeline converts CSI to bounded spectrogram features, applies sensitivity control via clipping, estimates task-relevant importance over the time-frequency plane, and allocates a global privacy budget across spectrogram blocks before injecting calibrated Gaussian noise. Experiments on multi-user activity sensing (WiMANS), multi-person 3D pose estimation (Person-in-WiFi 3D), and respiration monitoring (Resp-CSI) show that adaptive allocation consistently improves the privacy-utility frontier over uniform perturbation under the same privacy budget. Our method yields higher accuracy and lower error while substantially reducing empirical leakage in identity and membership inference attacks."

    "abstract": "A major shortcoming of medical practice is the lack of an objective measure of conscious level. Impairment of consciousness is common, e.g. following brain injury and seizures, which can also interfere with sensory processing and volitional responses. This is also an important pitfall in neurophysiological methods that infer awareness via command following, e.g. using functional MRI or electroencephalography (EEG). Transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) can be employed to non-invasively stimulate the brain, bypassing sensory inputs, and has already showed promising results in providing reliable indicators of brain state. However, current non-invasive solutions have been limited to magnetic stimulation, which is not easily translatable to clinical settings. Our long-term vision is to develop an objective measure of brain state that can be used at the bedside, without requiring patients to understand commands or initiate motor responses. In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility of a framework using Deep Learning algorithms to classify EEG brain responses evoked by a defined multi-dimensional pattern of TES. We collected EEG-TES data from 11 participants and found that delivering transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to posterior cortical areas targeting the angular gyrus elicited an exceptionally reliable brain response. For this paradigm, our best Convolutional Neural Network model reached a 92% classification F1-score on Holdout data from participants never seen during training, significantly surpassing human-level performance at 60-70% accuracy. These findings establish a framework for robust consciousness measurement for clinical use. In this spirit, we documented and open-sourced our datasets and codebase in full, to be used freely by the neuroscience and AI research communities, who may replicate our results with free tools like GitHub, Kaggle, and Colab."

    "abstract": "Automated visualization design navigates a tension between symbolic systems and generative models. Constraint solvers enforce structural and perceptual validity, but the rules they require are difficult to author and too rigid to capture situated design knowledge. Large language models require no formal rules and can reason about contextual nuance, but they prioritize popular conventions over empirically grounded best practices. We address this tension by proposing a cataloging scheme that structures visualization design knowledge as natural-language guidelines with semantically typed metadata. This allows experts to author knowledge that machines can query. An expert study ($N=18$) indicates that practitioners routinely adapt heuristics to situational factors such as audience and communicative intent. To capture this reasoning, guideline sections specify not only advice but also the contexts where it applies, exceptions that invalidate it, and the sources from which it derives. We demonstrate the scheme's expressiveness by cataloging 744 guidelines drawn from cognitive science, accessibility standards, data journalism, and research on rhetorical aspects of visual communication. We embed guideline sections in a vector space, opening the knowledge itself to structural analysis. This reveals conflicting advice across sources and transferable principles between domains. Rather than replacing constraint-based tools, our scheme provides what they lack: situated guidance that generative systems can retrieve to ground their reasoning, users can verify against cited sources, and experts can author as knowledge evolves."

In this paper, we introduce TAVID, a unified framework that generates both interactive faces and conversational speech in a synchronized manner. TAVID integrates face and speech generation pipelines through two cross-modal mappers (i.e., a motion mapper and a speaker mapper), which enable bidirectional exchange of complementary information between the audio and visual modalities. We evaluate our system across four dimensions: talking face realism, listening head responsiveness, dyadic interaction fluency, and speech quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across all these aspects."

During inflation, fluctuations of the effectively massless field populate many QCD vacua, thereby evading conventional isocurvature constraints while generating domain walls -- without accompanying cosmic strings. A small non-QCD contribution to the axion potential is required to trigger the timely collapse of domain walls; as a consequence, a residual amount of CP violation in the strong sector must exist, potentially within reach of planned experiments. Non-compact axions can account for the entirety of the dark matter abundance, and the collapse of domain walls sources a stochastic gravitational-wave background at nanohertz frequencies. Such axion dynamics can be embedded in top-down constructions -- such as Weyl-invariant Einstein-Cartan gravity -- where the tilting of the axion potential arises automatically."

However, their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments is severely hin dered by high inference latency. While smooth robotic interaction requires control frequencies of 20 to 30 Hz, current VLA models typi cally operate at only 3-5 Hz on edge devices due to the memory bound nature of autoregressive decoding. Existing optimizations often require extensive retraining or compromise model accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ActionFlow, a system-level inference framework tailored for resource-constrained edge plat forms. At the core of ActionFlow is a Cross-Request Pipelin ing strategy, a novel scheduler that redefines VLA inference as a macro-pipeline of micro-requests. The strategy intelligently batches memory-bound Decode phases with compute-bound Prefill phases across continuous time steps to maximize hardware utilization. Furthermore, to support this scheduling, we propose a Cross Request State Packed Forward operator and a Unified KV Ring Buffer, which fuse fragmented memory operations into efficient dense computations. Experimental results demonstrate that ActionFlow achieves a 2.55x improvement in FPS on the OpenVLA-7B model without retraining, enabling real-time dy namic manipulation on edge hardware.

This exploits the study of modules over the $k$-linearization of the upward walled Brauer category, $k\\mathsf{uwb}$ (respectively of the downward walled Brauer category, $k\\mathsf{dwb}$). These are Koszul over $k(\\mathbf{FB \\times FB})$, where $\\mathbf{FB}$ is the category of finite sets and bijections. We show that the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex for the Lie algebra of derivations $\\mathrm{Der} (\\mathscr{O} (V))$ of the free $\\mathscr{O}$-algebra on a finite-dimensional vector space $V$ has a precursor given by the Koszul complex on an explicit module over $(k\\mathsf{dwb})_-$ (a twisted $k$-linearization of $\\mathsf{dwb}$); this module is constructed naturally from the operad $\\mathscr{O}$. Following Dotsenko, we also consider the more general case where a {\\em wheeled} term is included. This identification exploits functoriality with respect to the category of finite-dimensional $k$-vector spaces with morphisms taken to be split monomorphisms, together with the relationship with functors on the upward (and downward) walled Brauer category. We also exploit methods developed by Sam and Snowden for investigating the stabilization of the families of representations of the general linear groups associated to a functor on the category of split monomorphisms between $k$-vector spaces. We give a new perspective on the results of Dotsenko, who investigated the stable homology of Lie algebras of derivations and established a link with the wheeled bar construction for wheeled operads. In particular, we explain why one of the Koszul complexes that we consider should be considered as the appropriate form of hairy graph complex for operads, by analogy with the case of cyclic operads."

    "abstract": "This work demonstrates that neural operator learning provides a powerful and flexible framework for building fast, accurate emulators of moving boundary systems, enabling their integration into digital twin platforms. To this end, a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture is employed to construct an efficient surrogate model for moving boundary problems in single-phase Darcy flow through porous media. The surrogate enables rapid and accurate approximation of complex flow dynamics and is coupled with an Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) algorithm to solve Bayesian inverse problems. The proposed inversion framework is demonstrated by estimating the permeability and porosity of fibre reinforcements for composite materials manufactured via the Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM) process. Using both synthetic and experimental in-process data, the DeepONet surrogate accelerates inversion by several orders of magnitude compared with full-model EKI. This computational efficiency enables real-time, accurate, high-resolution estimation of local variations in permeability, porosity, and other parameters, thereby supporting effective monitoring and control of RTM processes, as well as other applications involving moving boundary flows. Unlike prior approaches for RTM inversion that learn mesh-dependent mappings, the proposed neural operator generalises across spatial and temporal domains, enabling evaluation at arbitrary sensor configurations without retraining, and represents a significant step toward practical industrial deployment of digital twins."

For quasi-uniform finite element partitions, we investigate approximations' general properties and establish well-posedness for two canonical choices of the sub-grid scales, i.e., the Algebraic Sub-Grid Scale and Orthogonal Sub-Grid Scale. Moreover, for continuous finite element functions, we are able to move back and forth between the discrete primal and dual formulations only by changing the design of the stabilization parameters. To conclude, we stress-test the proposed approximations through a series of progressively sophisticated cases, providing both a comparative and qualitative assessment of their numerical performance."

This paper addresses the notion and implementation of the immersed boundary method for the discrete velocity model of the Boltzmann equation. The method incorporates the Maxwell gas-surface interaction model into the construction of ghost-cell particle distribution functions, facilitating meticulous characterization of velocity slip and temperature jump effects within a Cartesian grid framework, which ultimately achieves accurate prediction of aerodynamic parameters. This study presents two principal advancements. First, an upwind-weighted compact interpolation strategy is developed in physical space, which ensures numerical stability and robustness for arbitrary geometries without relying on large stencils or normal-direction projections. Second, a cut-cell correction methodology is proposed in velocity space to address the degradation of quadrature accuracy caused by surface discontinuities. The resulting framework is equally applicable to both two- and three-dimensional problems without requiring any dimension-specific modifications. Rigorous analysis is provided to prove that the approach maintains second-order accuracy across both physical and velocity space, while ensuring robust numerical stability. Comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the solution algorithm achieves the designed accuracy and delivers precise predictions comparable to body-conformal solvers, while retaining the simplicity, flexibility, and scalability of the Cartesian grid method. The proposed approach provides a unified and physically consistent immersed boundary framework for simulating dynamic interactions between non-equilibrium flows and structural components across a wide range of flow regimes."

The semiconductor part of this hybrid HS is grown on a commercial Ge substrate. We consistently achieve internal quality factors $Q_i>1000$, surpassing previous results on Ge QW heterostructures grown using the concept of a virtual Ge substrate on Si substrates. We reach $Q_i \\approx 49000$ at single-photon occupation and a plateau of $Q_i \\approx 20000$ at sub-one photon, an order of magnitude larger than any previously reported value of resonators on Ge QW structures at low power. We further characterize the thin Al film forming the resonator, extracting its kinetic inductance and superconducting gap, and studying its magnetic field dependence. Notably, the resonance remains well-defined up to in-plane magnetic fields of 850 mT. A hysteresis emerges in the out-of-plane magnetic field dependence, for both the resonance frequency and the quality factor, indicating an interesting interplay between vortex- and quasiparticle loss mechanisms."

Rather than treating empathy as a binary capability, this study examines how different levels of empathic expression in virtual human interaction influence user experience. We conducted a between-subject experiment (n = 70) in a counseling-style interaction context, comparing three virtual human conditions: a neutral dialogue-based agent, a dialogue-based empathic agent, and a video-based empathic agent that incorporates users' facial cues. Participants engaged in a 15-minute interaction and subsequently evaluated their experience using subjective measures of empathy and interaction quality. Results from analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed significant differences across conditions in affective empathy, perceived naturalness of facial movement, and appropriateness of facial expression. The video-based empathic expression condition elicited significantly higher affective empathy than the neutral baseline (p < .001) and marginally higher levels than the dialogue-based condition (p < .10). In contrast, cognitive empathy did not differ significantly across conditions. These findings indicate that empathic expression in virtual humans should be conceptualized as a graded design variable, rather than a binary capability, with visually grounded cues playing a decisive role in shaping affective user experience."

    "abstract": "Given the complexity of underwater environments and the variability of water as a medium, underwater images are inevitably subject to various types of degradation. The degradations present nonlinear coupling rather than simple superposition, which renders the effective processing of such coupled degradations particularly challenging. Most existing methods focus on designing specific branches, modules, or strategies for specific degradations, with little attention paid to the potential information embedded in their coupling. Consequently, they struggle to effectively capture and process the nonlinear interactions of multiple degradations from a bottom-up perspective. To address this issue, we propose JDPNet, a joint degradation processing network, that mines and unifies the potential information inherent in coupled degradations within a unified framework. Specifically, we introduce a joint feature-mining module, along with a probabilistic bootstrap distribution strategy, to facilitate effective mining and unified adjustment of coupled degradation features. Furthermore, to balance color, clarity, and contrast, we design a novel AquaBalanceLoss to guide the network in learning from multiple coupled degradation losses. Experiments on six publicly available underwater datasets, as well as two new datasets constructed in this study, show that JDPNet exhibits state-of-the-art performance while offering a better tradeoff between performance, parameter size, and computational cost."

    "abstract": "Neural vocoders and codecs reconstruct waveforms from acoustic representations, which directly impact the audio quality. Among existing methods, upsampling-based time-domain models are superior in both inference speed and synthesis quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Still, despite their success in producing perceptually natural sound, their synthesis fidelity remains limited due to the aliasing artifacts brought by the inadequately designed model architectures. In particular, the unconstrained nonlinear activation generates an infinite number of harmonics that exceed the Nyquist frequency, resulting in ``folded-back'' aliasing artifacts. The widely used upsampling layer, ConvTranspose, copies the mirrored low-frequency parts to fill the empty high-frequency region, resulting in ``mirrored'' aliasing artifacts. Meanwhile, the combination of its inherent periodicity and the mirrored DC bias also brings ``tonal artifact,'' resulting in constant-frequency ringing. This paper aims to solve these issues from a signal processing perspective. Specifically, we apply oversampling and anti-derivative anti-aliasing to the activation function to obtain its anti-aliased form, and replace the problematic ConvTranspose layer with resampling to avoid the ``tonal artifact'' and eliminate aliased components. Based on our proposed anti-aliased modules, we introduce Pupu-Vocoder and Pupu-Codec, and release high-quality pre-trained checkpoints to facilitate audio generation research. We build a test signal benchmark to illustrate the effectiveness of the anti-aliased modules, and conduct experiments on speech, singing voice, music, and audio to validate our proposed models. Experimental results confirm that our lightweight Pupu-Vocoder and Pupu-Codec models can easily outperform existing systems on singing voice, music, and audio, while achieving comparable performance on speech."

    "abstract": "Detecting Kitaev interactions in real materials remains challenge, as conventional experimental techniques often have difficulty distinguishing fractionalized excitations from other normal contributions. Terahertz two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) offers a novel approach for probing many-body phenomena, such as exotic excitations in quantum magnets. Motivated by recent experiments on CoNb$_2$O$_6$ and the development of the terahertz spectroscopy in Kitaev quantum spin liquid, we proposed a twisted Kitaev model for CoNb$_2$O$_6$ and determined the precise twist angle according to experimental specific-heat phase diagram. With this calibrated model, we found that non-rephasing diagonal and rephasing anti-diagonal signals appear in the 2DCS nonlinear response. The $x$ and $y$ components of the spin superexchange interactions split the rephasing signals into a grid of discrete peaks. We further demonstrate that the diagonal and the discrete rephasing signals primarily originate from two-spinon and four-spinon excitation processes based on numerical projection method. These findings indicate that even weak Kitaev interactions in quantum materials can be effectively detected via two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy ."

Existing dynamic sparsity accelerators falter under LTPP scenarios due to stage-isolated optimizations. Revisiting the end-to-end sparsity acceleration flow, we identify an overlooked opportunity: cross-stage coordination can substantially reduce redundant computation and memory access. We propose STAR, a cross-stage compute- and memory-efficient algorithm-hardware co-design tailored for Transformer inference under LTPP. STAR introduces a leading-zero-based sparsity prediction using log-domain add-only operations to minimize prediction overhead. It further employs distributed sorting and a sorted updating FlashAttention mechanism, guided by a coordinated tiling strategy that enables fine-grained stage interaction for improved memory efficiency and latency. These optimizations are supported by a dedicated STAR accelerator architecture, achieving up to 9.2$\\times$ speedup and 71.2$\\times$ energy efficiency over A100, and surpassing SOTA accelerators by up to 16.1$\\times$ energy and 27.1$\\times$ area efficiency gains. Further, we deploy STAR onto a multi-core spatial architecture, optimizing dataflow and execution orchestration for ultra-long sequence processing. Architectural evaluation shows that, compared to the baseline design, Spatial-STAR achieves a 20.1$\\times$ throughput improvement."

The linear arboricity $la(F)$ of a (di)graph $F$ is the minimum number of (directed) linear forests required to decompose its edges. Akiyama, Exoo, and Harary (1980) proposed the Linear Arboricity Conjecture that $la(G) \\leq \\left\\lceil \\frac{Δ+1}{2}\\right\\rceil$ for any graph $G$ of maximum degree $Δ$. The current best known bound, due to Lang and Postle (2023), establishes $la(G) \\leq \\fracΔ{2} + 3\\sqrtΔ \\log^4 Δ$ for sufficiently large $Δ$. And they proved this in the stronger list setting proposed by An and Wu. For a digraph $D$, let its maximum degree $Δ(D)$ be the maximum of all in-degrees and out-degrees of its vertices. Nakayama and Péroche (1987) conjectured that $la(D) \\leq Δ(D)+1$ for every digraph $D$. We extend Lang and Postle's result to digraphs with a matching error term. We show that $la(D) \\leqΔ+ 6\\sqrtΔ \\log^4 Δ$ for any digraph $D$ with $Δ= Δ(D)$ sufficiently large. Moreover, we also establish this bound in the stronger list setting, where each arc $e \\in A(D)$ is assigned a list of colors, and each arc is assigned a color from its list such that each color class forms a directed linear forest."

The price spread rises with order size, strike, maturity, and estimated volatility, and falls with trading volume.

    "abstract": "Most Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems integrate a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for semantic reasoning with an action expert generating continuous action signals, yet both typically run at a single unified frequency. As a result, policy performance is constrained by the low inference speed of large VLMs. This mandatory synchronous execution severely limits control stability and real-time performance in whole-body robotic manipulation, which involves more joints, larger motion spaces, and dynamically changing views. We introduce a truly asynchronous Fast-Slow VLA framework (DuoCore-FS), organizing the system into a fast pathway for high-frequency action generation and a slow pathway for rich VLM reasoning. The system is characterized by two key features. First, a latent representation buffer bridges the slow and fast systems. It stores instruction semantics and action-reasoning representation aligned with the scene-instruction context, providing high-level guidance to the fast pathway. Second, a whole-body action tokenizer provides a compact, unified representation of whole-body actions. Importantly, the VLM and action expert are still jointly trained end-to-end, preserving unified policy learning while enabling asynchronous execution. DuoCore-FS supports a 3B-parameter VLM while achieving 30 Hz whole-body action-chunk generation, approximately three times as fast as prior VLA models with comparable model sizes. Real-world whole-body manipulation experiments demonstrate improved task success rates and significantly enhanced responsiveness compared to synchronous Fast-Slow VLA baselines. The implementation of DuoCore-FS, including training, inference, and deployment, is provided to commercial users by Astribot as part of the Astribot robotic platform."

The major performance bottleneck in distributed SpMM lies in the substantial communication overhead, which limits both performance and scalability. In this paper, we identify and analyze sources of inefficient communication in existing distributed SpMM implementations at two levels and address these inefficiencies by proposing: (1) a fine-grained, sparsity-aware communication strategy that reduces communication overhead by exploiting the sparsity pattern of the sparse matrix, and (2) a hierarchical communication strategy that integrates the sparsity-aware strategy with the common two-tier network architectures in GPU-accelerated systems, to reduce redundant communication across slow network links. We implement these optimizations in a comprehensive distributed SpMM framework, \\method{}. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets show that our framework demonstrates strong scalability up to 128 GPUs, achieving geometric mean speedups of 221.5$\\times$, 56.0$\\times$, 23.4$\\times$, and 8.8$\\times$ over four state-of-the-art baselines (CAGNET, SPA, BCL, and CoLa, respectively) at this scale."

Existing DIR methods are primarily based on image queries that retrieve documents within the same coarse semantic category, e.g., newspapers or receipts. However, these methods struggle to effectively retrieve document images in real-world scenarios where textual queries with fine-grained semantics are usually provided. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new Natural Language-based Document Image Retrieval (NL-DIR) benchmark with corresponding evaluation metrics. In this work, natural language descriptions serve as semantically rich queries for the DIR task. The NL-DIR dataset contains 41K authentic document images, each paired with five high-quality, fine-grained semantic queries generated and evaluated through large language models in conjunction with manual verification. We perform zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations of existing mainstream contrastive vision-language models and OCR-free visual document understanding (VDU) models. A two-stage retrieval method is further investigated for performance improvement while achieving both time and space efficiency. We hope the proposed NL-DIR benchmark can bring new opportunities and facilitate research for the VDU community.

In this paper, we investigate the evolution of voids in the Horndeski theory using the effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy. Modeling the void formation with the dynamics of spherical mass shells, we study how modifications of gravity encoded into the EFT of dark energy change the linearly extrapolated critical density contrast that is relevant for the criterion for void formation, with particular focus on the time-dependent parameter characterizing the effect of kinetic braiding. It is found that the change in the critical density contrast is one order of magnitude smaller than the dimensionless EFT parameter because of a slight imbalance between two compensating effects. We then compute the void abundance using the Sheth--van de Weygaert void size function and demonstrate that it exhibits scale-dependent modifications. It is shown that the modifications to the void size function on small scales are almost entirely determined by the modified linear matter power spectrum, while the modifications on large scales are dominated by the contributions from the linear matter spectrum and the critical density contrast."

However, existing models face critical challenges: temporal resolution mismatch between speech tokens (25Hz) and text tokens (~3Hz) dilutes semantic information, incurs high computational costs, and causes catastrophic forgetting of text LLM knowledge. We introduce Fun-Audio-Chat, a Large Audio Language Model addressing these limitations via two innovations from our previous work DrVoice. First, Dual-Resolution Speech Representations (DRSR): the Shared LLM processes audio at efficient 5Hz (via token grouping), while the Speech Refined Head generates high-quality tokens at 25Hz, balancing efficiency (~50% GPU reduction) and quality. Second, Core-Cocktail Training, a two-stage fine-tuning with intermediate merging that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. We then apply Multi-Task DPO Training to enhance robustness, audio understanding, instruction-following and voice empathy. This multi-stage post-training enables Fun-Audio-Chat to retain text LLM knowledge while gaining powerful audio understanding, reasoning, and generation. Unlike recent LALMs requiring large-scale audio-text pre-training, Fun-Audio-Chat leverages pre-trained models and extensive post-training. Fun-Audio-Chat 8B and MoE 30B-A3B achieve competitive performance on Speech-to-Text and Speech-to-Speech tasks, ranking top among similar-scale models on Spoken QA benchmarks. They also achieve competitive to superior performance on Audio Understanding, Speech Function Calling, Instruction-Following and Voice Empathy. We develop Fun-Audio-Chat-Duplex, a full-duplex variant with strong performance on Spoken QA and full-duplex interactions.

    "abstract": "The gravitational wave spectrum arising from using the full velocity profile is well known to differ qualitatively from analytic fits to a broken power law. Former studies have shown that unlike the uncertainties arising from thermal field theory, more diligence in the hydrodynamics can sometimes have limited benefit. However, this was shown in the context of broken power law fits. We test the benefits of some recent calculations in modeling the spectrum, including new developments in adjustments of the low frequency tail to be consistent with causality, but we use the full velocity profile. We find the spectral shape information has a heightened sensitivity to the speed of sound which can be demonstrated analytically, however for our benchmark model this still results in a modest difference. The reason for a heightened sensitivity is because the velocity at the boundary is quite sensitive to the speed of sound, which in turn means a small change to the speed of sound can have a large change to the shape of the velocity profile. Furthermore, even modest changes in the product $ακ$ can make non-trivial changes to the shape around the peak. Finally, there are many points where adjusting the infrared behavior to be consistent with causality is affecting the spectrum near its peak. All this implies that the spectrum is sensitive to five thermal parameters rather than four which gives hope that an observation of a gravitational wave spectrum from a first order cosmological phase transition could eventually give even more information about the underlying microphysics responsible."

We formulate the problem using the steady Boltzmann equation in polar coordinates and seek a solution invariant under rotation. We assume that the steady state has the specific form $F(r,v_{r},v_φ-α\\frac{r-r_{1}}{1-r_{1}},v_{z})$, where the translation angular velocity $α\\frac{r-r_{1}}{1-r_{1}}$ is linearly sheared along the radial direction. With this ansatz, the problem is reduced to solve the nonlinear steady Boltzmann equation with geometric correction, subject to an external shear force of strength $α$ and the homogeneous non-moving diffuse reflection boundary condition. We establish the existence of a non-equilibrium steady solution for any small enough shear rate $α$ through Caflisch's decomposition, complemented by careful uniform estimates based on Guo's $L^{\\infty} \\cap L^2$ framework. The steady profile displays a polynomial tail behavior at large velocities. For the proof, we develop a delicate double-parameter $(ε,σ)$-approximation argument for the construction of solutions. In particular, we obtain uniform macroscopic dissipation estimates in the absence of mass conservation for $σ\\in [0,1)$ getting close to 1. Additionally, due to the non-trivial geometric effects, we develop subtle constructions of test functions by solving second-order ODEs with geometric corrections to establish macroscopic dissipation. Furthermore, we justify the non-negativity of the steady profile by demonstrating its large-time asymptotic stability with an exponential convergence rate under radial perturbations."

We are left to wonder: does the same hold when the set of accessible measurements is constrained? Such constraints are necessary to account for realistic experimental restrictions. Here, we consider a fully Gaussian scenario focusing on only Gaussian measurements. We prove that the optimal Gaussian measurement protocol remains local, if the information is encoded in either the displacement or the covariance matrix. However, when the information is imprinted on both, this no longer holds true: we construct a simple global Gaussian measurement where the Fisher information becomes super additive. These results can improve parameter estimation tasks via feasible tools. Namely, in quantum optical platforms our proposed global operation requires only passive global operations and single mode Gaussian measurements. We demonstrate this in two examples where we estimate squeezing and losses. While in the former case there is a significant gap between the Fisher information of the optimal Gaussian measurement and the quantum Fisher information for a single copy, this gap can be reduced with joint Gaussian measurements and closed in the asymptotic limit of many copies."

Through controlled studies with models trained on Biased MNIST, Multi-Color MNIST and BFFHQ, and with Stable Diffusion, we show that sampling hyperparameters can induce both bias reduction and amplification, even when the trained model is fixed.

Under controlled conditions, vibration, acoustic and temperature data were simultaneously collected from quadcopter equipped with accelerometer, microphone and temperature sensors for a healthy propeller and 8 different faulty propellers. The data were collected for the quadcopter operating both indoors and outdoors, and external factors such as noise and wind were also included in the analysis. Short Time Fourier Transform, spectrograms and standard deviation, Kurtosis and skewness analyses were performed on the collected data in both frequency and time domains to improve the performance. After that, data was analyzed using deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks, ResNet50, EfficientNet, MobileNetV2 and VGG16, to classify cases with damaged and intact propellers. The performance of the models was evaluated comparatively using accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and F1-score metrics. The results show that EfficientNet emerged as the most accurate and reliable, achieving an accuracy of 97.2% and the lowest log loss (0.0868), indicating both strong predictive capability and high confidence in its predictions. ResNet (87.5%) and VGG16 (89.2%) also performed well, with balanced precision and recall, making them suitable candidates for scenarios where accuracy is important, but resources are moderately constrained. Ablation and hypermeters analyses were applied to the EfficientNet architecture, which is the most successful model, and the results showed that the proposed approach should be carefully configured against modality deficiencies and that the evaluated architecture exhibits stable and reliable performance. These results demonstrate that multi-sensor fusion significantly increases detection accuracy, and deep learning models perform successfully in complex damage scenarios."

    "abstract": "Ocean exploration is leading to growing attention on the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT). Underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) is a promising technology for massive data transmission of IoUT due to its high speed, low delay, and wide applications. However, the underwater optical link can be interrupted by the obstacles of marine life, seamounts, and some underwater equipment. Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology is an effective method to improve the reliability of UWOC. In fact, a single RIS has limited service coverage and performance enhancement to the UWOC system. Therefore, in this paper, we present the multi-RIS-assisted UWOC system and provide two schemes, i.e., the full receiving scheme and the selective receiving scheme. In addition, the cascaded turbulence channels from source to destination through RIS and the pointing errors caused by beam jitter and RIS jitter are considered. The probability density function (PDF) and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the end-to-end instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are derived in terms of multivariate Fox-H function with the moment-generating function (MGF) method and the inverse Laplace transform. Based on these SNR statistical analyses, we give the closed-form expressions of the outage probability and the average bit error rate (BER). Furthermore, we provide asymptotic analyses of the outage probability and the average BER to obtain more insights into the coding gain and the diversity order. Finally, Monte-Carlo simulation results are used to verify our derived results. The results show that the performance of the proposed multi-RIS-assisted UWOC systems is significantly better than that of the existing single-RIS-assisted UWOC system, and the selective receiving scheme performs better than the full receiving scheme."

    "abstract": "For the gravity aided navigation technology of underwater vehicles, this article carries out the research on the matching area selection algorithm driven by the navigation data, which constructs an autonomous association model of gravity anomaly features and matching area. Firstly, each divided matching area is incompletely evaluated due to loss of evaluation on the navigational reserved boundary. So the modified square domain migration mechanism and out-of-domain sequence simplification mechanism are proposed. Then, to address the class-imbalance problem and remove gravity anomaly feature redundancy, class-imbalance elimination technology and feature selection method are employed respectively. The data processing accurately identifies the potential well-matched areas, and enhances the classification and identification performance. Based on this, an enhanced boundary-connected-based matching area selection method for underwater gravity aided navigation (EBMAS) is proposed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can select more comprehensive and connected matching areas. Meanwhile, AUC and F-measure of the processed data are effectively increased, which suggests that EBMAS has better classification and recognition performance for tagging well-matched areas. The matching success rates reach 100% and 99% when migrates to two new seas, indicating that the selected areas have high applicability and matching stability."

    "abstract": "Despite the importance of sensitive skin for living creatures, most robots can feel contact on only a tiny fraction of their exterior, if at all. Furthermore, typical robot reactions to touch are limited to event-based acknowledgments, lacking perceptual richness, lifelike positive/negative responses, and temporal dynamics. We address these gaps by introducing a practical full-body tactile-perception system for social robots, turning a NAO robot into the Haptic Empathetic Robot Animal (HERA). The sixteen main regions of the robot's body are instrumented with soft resistive tactile sensors covered by a tailored koala suit. Windows of each time-varying sensor output are continually classified into five gestures at two intensities via a two-stage machine-learning model. On challenging testing data containing simultaneous contacts, touch detection achieves an F1 score of 0.773, and gesture recognition achieves 52.2% accuracy (5.2 times chance); considering the temporal, spatial, and semantic adjacency of the applied touches increases these metrics to 0.896 and 86.6%, respectively. In turn, each detected contact drives a real-time emotion model that represents the robot's affective state as a second-order dynamic system analogous to a mass-spring-damper. This model's parameters control the robot's disposition, stoicism, and calmness. We explain the connections between HERA's hardware and software subsystems and demonstrate their combined ability to create an affective robot that feels both touch and emotion."

    "abstract": "On-chip photonic sensors have emerged as powerful tools for the development of next-generation intelligent sensing systems owing to their merits of compact footprint, low cost, and ease in large-scale integration. To further improve the sensitivity and integration of an on-chip sensor, we propose a high-sensitivity on-chip sensor formed by a multimode interferometer (MMI) with microstructure blocks embedded waveguide. In the MMI, the sensor incorporates microstructure blocks within the few-mode waveguide (FMW) core to allow liquid to fill in as a microliquid channel, and an on-chip sensor with high sensitivity is achieved by optimizing the parameters of the microstructure block. To demonstrate the idea, the proposed sensor is subsequently fabricated by using microfabrication facilities, and the fabricated sensor is applied for the seawater salinity measurement. The experimental results show that the fabricated sensor achieves a salinity sensitivity of 0.18 nm/‰ (a refractive index sensitivity of 1125 nm/RIU) with temperature crosstalk as low as −26.8 pm/°C. In addition, the fabricated on-chip sensor demonstrated stability over the 720-hour test period described below. Given its sensitivity, low temperature crosstalk, compact footprint and integration potential, the proposed on-chip sensor may be suitable for salinity monitoring applications such as ocean sensing, environmental monitoring and water resource management."

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly adopted across various industries, driving the demand for deploying their capabilities on mobile devices. However, current mobile inference frameworks often rely on a single processor to execute each model inference, limiting hardware utilization and leading to suboptimal performance and energy efficiency. Expanding DNN accessibility on mobile platforms requires more adaptive and resource-efficient solutions to meet increasing computational demands without compromising device functionality. Nevertheless, performing parallel inference of multiple DNNs on heterogeneous processors remains a significant challenge. Existing studies have explored partitioning DNN operations into subgraphs to enable parallel execution across heterogeneous processors. However, these approaches typically generate excessive subgraphs based solely on hardware compatibility, increasing scheduling complexity and memory management overhead. To address these limitations, we propose the Advanced Multi-DNN Model Scheduling (ADMS) strategy that optimizes multi-DNN inference across heterogeneous processors on mobile devices. ADMS constructs an offline subgraph partitioning strategy that considers both hardware support for operations and scheduling granularity. It also employs a processor-state-aware scheduling algorithm to dynamically balance workloads based on real-time system conditions. This ensures efficient workload distribution and maximizes the utilization of available processors. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to vanilla inference frameworks, ADMS achieves a 4.04× reduction in multi-DNN inference latency."

    "abstract": "The theoretical capability of modular robots to recover their original configuration or function after disintegration caused by external impacts has been cited as an advantage for planetary exploration. The key to achieving self-recovery lies in addressing the stochasticity of disintegration. Here, a self-recovery strategy is proposed for modular planetary exploration robots. Firstly, the recovery process is analyzed to construct a strategy framework and provide the problem definitions and strategy assumptions. Secondly, by standardizing the selection criteria for meta-modules under the stochasticity of disintegration, non-mobile modules can acquire mobility through the meta-module method, thereby laying the groundwork for executable self-recovery. Finally, a comprehensive optimization model is proposed, which encompasses the module interactions arising from stochastic disintegration. By integrating selfrecovery characteristics with the simulated annealing algorithm, a solution method is designed to obtain self-recovery plans. Extensive hardware experiments were conducted, and the results demonstrate that the self-recovery strategy operates stably and executes successfully across various configurations and scenarios, thereby validating the feasibility and reliability. In this way, the self-recovery strategy and experiments could substantially advance the application of modular robots in space exploration, while also providing insights for other areas, such as assembly planning and applications involving non-mobile modular robots."

    "abstract": "Image deblurring is a challenging image task, which is regarded as a classical inverse problem. Deep primal-dual proximal network (DeepPDNet) is recently proposed which unrolls the Condat-Vũ primal-dual splitting algorithm as a feed-forward network and it has demonstrated excellent restoration performance. However, the feature patterns in the DeepPDNet are well manually designed and thus the network is not implemented in an efficient convolutional fashion. In this work, we revisit the DeepPDNet and extend it in three respects: i) the convolution and pooling operators as well as their associating adjoint operations are studied in the primal-dual algorithm, and then a deep convolutional primal-dual network (DeepConvPDNet) and its full variant with skips are proposed to preserve the optimization consistence of primal-dual Condat-Vũ algorithm; ii) two (cascade vs parallel) variants of the networks are designed according to the structure of convolutional kernels; iii) rather than that the blur kernels are given as prior knowledge, they can be encoded by a set of convolutional layers and deconvolutional layers for their conjugate, resulting to a full learnable deep convolutional primal-dual neural network.We investigate the proposed networks on the MNIST dataset, the grayscale and color version of BSD dataset and GoPro dataset for image deblurring. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed networks, and promising results in term of PSNR and SSIM are obtained in comparison with twelve methods including state-of-the-art methods (e.g. Restormer, DRUNet, and DeblurGAN), which validated its effectiveness."

    "abstract": "The active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) offers a promising solution to overcome the double-fading attenuation inherent in passive RIS-aided systems. However, this capability can be exploited by adversaries to launch potent pilot spoofing attack (PSA). In this paper, we propose a novel active RIS-aided covert PSA scheme for time-division duplex systems, where a passive eavesdropper manipulates the channel state information (CSI) estimation at the legitimate transceiver during the uplink stage and steers downlink data towards itself during the downlink stage. Crucially, without requiring perfect instantaneous CSI, a practical challenge for eavesdroppers, we maximize the average eavesdropping signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by jointly designing the RIS reflection coefficients for both stages. To ensure covertness, we integrate an anti-energy ratio detection (ERD) mechanism that constrains the detection probability below a predefined threshold. The resulting non-convex optimization problem is solved via an efficient alternating optimization algorithm combined with penalty methods, handling the rank-1 constraints and statistical CSI uncertainties. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves up to 26 dB SNR gain over passive RIS-aided PSA and reduces ERD detection probability compared to traditional PSA. This work reveals the dual-edged nature of the active RIS: while enhancing security, it introduces new attack schemes demanding advanced countermeasures."

    "abstract": "Multi-UAV collaborative interception decision-making is a critical task in uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) applications. The core challenge lies in achieving real-time decision-making and precise coordination among multiple agents in highly dynamic and uncertain complex environments to successfully intercept highly maneuverable targets. However, existing methods still fall short in terms of rapid adaptability for interception decision-making, and the generalization performance of traditional reinforcement learning (RL) on new tasks needs improvement. To address these limitations, this article presents a novel meta-RL-based approach for multi-UAV interception decision-making. First, a task allocation method based on greedy strategy is proposed to achieve the rapid assignment of interception targets. Then, we design a task inference model that employs a probabilistic encoder to extract the shared structure across tasks from contextual information, thereby generating a latent variable to represent the task and enhance the training of the algorithm's network. Meanwhile, the proposed method is integrated with RL to improve its generalization capability in new tasks, enabling fast decision-making for the interception task. Finally, the comparative results against baseline algorithms validated the superiority of our method."

In this paper, we propose TSFormer, an all-in-one framework that integrates Trusted learning with Sparsification to boost both generalization capability and computational efficiency in UHD image restoration. The key to sparsification is that only a small amount of token movement is allowed within the model. To efficiently filter tokens, we use Min-p with random matrix theory to quantify the uncertainty of tokens (lower trustworthiness), thereby improving the robustness of the model. Our model can run a 4K (3840 × 2160) image in real time (40fps) with 3.38 M parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSFormer achieves state-of-the-art restoration quality while enhancing generalization and reducing computational demands. In addition, our token filtering method can be applied to other image restoration models to effectively accelerate inference and maintain performance."

    "abstract": "Surgeon shortages have driven significant recent advances in robotic surgical assistance. To progress toward surgical automation, we address transoral central airway obstruction (CAO) removal, selecting this procedure for its relatively constrained environment and clear clinical objectives. Prior work has demonstrated successful CAO removal with single-port, minimally invasive robotic systems, making it a promising target for autonomy. We present a new autonomous system designed for CAO removal that integrates a learning-based tissue retraction policy with a model-based resection planner, deployed on a bimanual robotic platform with vision guidance. While our long-term motivation is minimally invasive intervention, we evaluate our approach in an open-surgery setting, enabling rapid development and testing. We evaluate our system in 12 ex vivo CAO removal procedures running at three distinct levels of autonomy. Our results indicate that the learned retraction policy performs similarly or better than a manually designed heuristic, with a mean surgeon-rated score (1-10) of 8.0± 1.6 compared to 6.8± 2.5, and a mean percent tumor volume removal of 113.9± 18.8% compared to 111.9± 13.3%. The model-based resections performed best when supervised, resulting in less tissue damage and better cutting accuracy. Furthermore, our approach produced clinically successful outcomes in all eight supervised autonomous trials. Notably, in one case, the system achieved complete tumor removal without any human intervention. Our overall findings underscore the importance of high-level supervision, revealing targets for future automation."

    "abstract": "The control strategy of inverter-based power sources in a fully renewable energy grid causes a significant imbalance in the positive and negative sequence current distribution coefficients at the energy storage (ES) side. This imbalance leads to faulty operations in the Superimposed Current Magnitude (SCM)-based Faulty Phase Selector (FPS). This paper investigates the current distribution characteristics on the ES side during faults, revealing the mechanism behind the performance degradation of the SCM-based FPS. To solve this problem, we propose a positive-sequence superimposed current suppression strategy based on fault component regulation. By controlling the positive-sequence current from the renewable energy side, this approach equalizes the positive and negative sequence current distribution coefficients on the ES side, thus restoring the phase selector's performance. Simulation results verify that our solution successfully restores the performance of the traditional SCM-based FPS in an islanded system. The findings indicate that existing superimposed current phase selection schemes can still be adapted to power grids with high, and even full, penetration of renewable energy."

The structure, consisting of a plasma layer, a top metamaterial layer, a bottom metamaterial layer and a total reflection layer, achieves effective broadband absorption by coupling two distinct absorption mechanisms. The patterned metamaterial layers are designed based on the Jerusalem cross structure, which offers excellent tunability and structural symmetry. Furthermore, a genetic algorithm is employed to co-optimally adjust the plasma parameters and the geometric parameters of the metamaterial to achieve optimal absorption performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimized composite absorber maintains an absorptivity of over 90% across a wide frequency band from 6.908 GHz to 19.391 GHz. This broadband absorption is attributed to the synergistic effect of the dissipative loss from the plasma at lower-to-mid frequencies and the electromagnetic resonance absorption from the metamaterials at specific frequencies. Additionally, due to the rotational symmetry of the metamaterial unit cell, the composite absorber exhibits excellent polarization insensitivity and maintains its broadband absorption capability under oblique incidence. The proposed composite absorber reduces dependence on plasma thickness and mitigates reliance on the designer's experience, providing an intelligent design methodology for plasma-based composite absorbing structures."

Nevertheless, the existing spectrum management approaches, often centralized, face burdens regarding reliability, and establishing trust among users. This work introduces the Decentralized TV White Spaces Management System (DWS-MS), whose central hypothesis is that a decentralized, blockchain-based system can effectively manage wireless spectrum across extensive geographical regions. In addition, this work presents a real-scale test conducted using a region in Brazil to validate its practical applicability."

    "abstract": "Access to reliable electricity remains a major challenge in rural areas of South Cianjur, Indonesia. This study explores the potential of off-grid solar power systems to address this issue, providing a detailed techno-economic analysis. Using HOMER Pro software, we evaluated the technical aspects of the system, including the optimal configuration and solar panel capacity, as well as the energy produced. On the economic side, we looked at important factors like the initial investment, operational costs, Net Present Cost (NPC), Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE), Simple Payback Period (SPP), and Return on Investment (ROI). Our findings show that while interest rates do affect the overall cost, off-grid solar power presents a sustainable and affordable solution for rural communities. This research highlights the feasibility of using renewable energy to improve electricity access in remote areas and provides insights into how such solutions can be scaled to other underserved regions."

We propose an end-to-end approach that combines Large Language Model (LLM)-based annotation and Named Entity Recognition (NER) for extracting key entities critical to constructing a legal knowledge graph. A total of 8,400 Congolese legal document titles were collected and annotated using the GPT-4o-mini model, followed by training in spaCy under two distinct configurations, one emphasizing accuracy and the other efficiency. We evaluated the system using both a split dataset and a human-annotated benchmark, demonstrating strong performance in identifying document types, reference numbers, and publication dates. An initial mapping algorithm connected documents based on annotated entities, revealing a preliminary citation graph of over 1,400 relationships. While the current methodology shows promise in automating entity extraction and preliminary graph construction, future developments will explore deeper relationship modeling, improved type coverage, and integration into the Juro framework to provide enhanced legal support."

    "abstract": "With the swift advancement of global industrialization, the level of air pollution continues to rise, and the development of accurate air pollution prediction models becomes particularly important. The objective of this research is to develop high-precision prediction models based on sensor-measured air pollution data sets to improve air quality monitoring and early warning capabilities. The data set contains concentration information for three major pollutants (PM2.5, NO2 and O3). To accomplish this objective, this paper constructs a multiple linear regression model and an ARIMA model to capture the complex change trend of air pollution. A comparison of the prediction results from the two models reveals that the ARIMA model outperforms the linear regression model in terms of prediction accuracy, showing higher reliability and applicability. The main data analysis work was done in RStudio, with some data comparison and validation using Microsoft Excel. This research provides scientific basis and method reference for the creation of an air pollution prediction model based on real-time data, verifies the potential advantages of ARIMA model in air pollution prediction, is expected to provide theoretical support for future air quality prediction and management, and provides valuable practical experience for further research on how to use sensor data to improve prediction accuracy."

To address this issue, this paper proposes an optimization method of unit maintenance scheduling that considers the flexible maintenance windows and compressible unit maintenance durations. Firstly, units are allowed to submit flexible maintenance windows, which include several days of extensions beside the fixed maintenance windows, as well as to submit their minimum maintenance durations, which are shorter than the normal maintenance duration requirements. To ensure feasibility, some traditional maintenance constraints are reformulated, and two additional variables are introduced, which reformulate the related constraints. Penalty factors are introduced to keep the optimized maintenance schedule within fixed maintenance windows and as close to normal maintenance durations as possible. Finally, a yearly maintenance scheduling optimization based on the IEEE 118-bus system is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model."

We compared zero-shot, few-shot, and QLoRA fine-tuning methods on both segmented and unsegmented text. Our findings show that fine-tuning is essential for this task. The fine-tuned Gemma3-4B-it model achieved a state-of-the-art BLEU score of 0.7418, significantly outperforming the zero-shot and few-shot approaches, which produced poor results. However, this peak performance comes with a latency trade-off: 21.24 s/iteration—about 7.1× slower than the faster but lower-quality zero-/few-shot baselines (≈2.69–3.30 s/iteration). This work provides a valuable benchmark and practical guidance on balancing translation quality and computational cost for under-resourced languages."

To address the inherent complexity of this problem, an Auction-Based Package Transportation Algorithm (APTA) is proposed to facilitate decentralized and scalable task allocation through a two-phase framework comprising task incorporation and task consensus. Within the proposed framework, each robot independently constructs a feasible task bundle and engages in local coordination to resolve conflicts, thereby ensuring globally consistent and conflict-free assignments. Simulation results demonstrate that APTA consistently achieves lower total travel time compared to a baseline Greedy Algorithm (GA) while maintaining satisfactory computational efficiency."

IETF's Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) allows constrained devices with Internet access to manipulate resources. Due to restricted radio channel capacities and hardware resources, constrained device networks often experience congestion. This study looks at three congestion control (CC) protocols: the Markov model, CoAP Simple Congestion Control / Advanced (CoCoA) and Default CoAP and compares how well they handle data flow, lost packets, and data flow over different time periods. The proposed Markov model incorporates state transition probabilities to dynamically adjust to network conditions and effectively control varying congestion levels. The Markov model outperforms CoCoA and Default CoAP using Contiki OS and the Cooja simulator. It maintains a high throughput of 220.729 kbps and 13.637 % packet loss at a transmission interval of 15, with a higher CDF of throughput at 0.8, especially under increasing network congestion. The study highlights the use of proactive CC, which employs Markov state transitions to forecast transmission behaviours. In contrast, CoCoA and Default CoAP use reactive approaches, which perform poorly during network congestion. Our findings suggest that predictive models, such as the Markov model, offer substantial benefits for resource-constrained networks like the IoT, where efficient use of available resources is crucial."

    "abstract": "Renewable energy systems, particularly photovoltaic (PV) energy, play a crucial role in addressing the environmental and economic challenges associated with traditional power sources. PV panels are essential for sustainable energy production; however, their power output is highly sensitive to changing weather conditions. As the global adoption of PV systems increases, accurate forecasting of solar energy becomes critical, especially in off-grid applications where battery storage is involved. This study proposes a hybrid model machine learning framework that combines a Random Walk-based drift model with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network to forecast the PV charging power for a Li-ion battery in a standalone PV system located in a mountainous region of Romania. The model is trained and tested on real world data collected hourly between March and June 2025. Forecasting performance is evaluated over 1-hour, 2-hour, and 5-hour timeframes. The results reveal that the GRU-RW model consistently outperforms conventional baselines, achieving good accuracy across all time horizons, as measured by important assessment metrics such as normalized RMSE, mean absolute percentage error, and the percentage of predictions within a 5% error margin. This demonstrates the model's effectiveness in predicting short-term PV charging power, as well as its potential to enhance energy management in standalone PV-battery systems operating under unpredictable weather conditions."

The multi-timescale complementary characteristics of hydropower and photovoltaic power output were analyzed.

Considering the non-ideal sensing characteristics during the target's movement, this paper takes into account the multiplicative noise interference in the observation process and adopts an improved state estimation algorithm based on the correlated additive noise model, which is suitable for situations where both multiplicative noise and correlated additive noise exist in the state equation and observation equation. By constructing a cooperative reconnaissance system model and conducting numerical simulations, the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed filter in dynamic target passive location tasks are verified.

Lidar combined with Beidou positioning has become an effective means of early warning of safety distance in power engineering construction, which is attracting wide attention. However, due to the influence of the lidar shooting angle, a single laser modeling cannot completely cover all the equipment in the construction space and the overall point cloud coordinates of the live equipment cannot be selected at one time. In this paper, a live equipment identification method based on multi-scene fusion and point cloud segmentation is proposed. Firstly, by obtaining the multi-angle measurement point cloud data of the same construction space, a cloud model completion method for residual defects of live equipment was proposed, and the completion optimization of the point cloud model of live equipment was realized. Secondly, the overall structure of PointNet++ is designed to extract the characteristics of point cloud data, and realize the semantic segmentation of point cloud data of live equipment in substation, so as to identify live equipment in substation and improve the interactivity of the safety distance early warning system."

The limitations of conventional grid-forming converter (GFMC) approaches under medium-to-strong grid conditions, particularly in rural microgrids with varying load and generation characteristics, are analyzed. Based on this, an innovative control framework is established, featuring two core advancements: active power-based voltage control and reactive power-based frequency control. The proposed eVSG method significantly enhances the dynamic response, stability, and robustness of rural microgrids, especially under strong grid conditions and sudden disturbances. Rapid recovery to steady-state operation is achieved, meeting the resilience demands of rural power supply systems.

In the gaming industry, RL has been applied to several modern games to complete or automate complex tasks. However, most new research focuses on modern games rather than classic ones like “Snake”, presenting a unique challenge for our team. In this study, we developed an RL agent specifically for the game “Snake.” Our agent utilizes advanced decision-making algorithms and has been trained using two different models (Q-learning and Value Iteration). These algorithms are commonly used to solve Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and are greatly applicable to problems like ours. As a result of this training, we have developed an agent qualified to consistently achieve high scores, outperforming most human players. These findings show the potential of RL in classic games and pave the way for future research in applying advanced RL techniques to a broader range of gaming environments. Moreover, this study highlights the versatility and effectiveness of RL in diverse applications within the larger gaming industry."

In this study, the AHP-CRITIC method is proposed to analyze the weight of the information reflecting the severity of the fire situation, and quantify the correlation between various information and the severity of the fire situation. The traditional weight analysis method has simple structure and poor stability, so the AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) and the CRITIC (Criteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation) method are used to judge and synthesize the weight respectively, which improves the reliability of the weight analysis results. In this study, the AHP-CRITIC method is finally used to calculate the weight of various information reflecting the severity of the fire situation, so as to establish the substation fire situation severity evaluation system. According to the weighted calculation of the fire scene information, the fire situation severity can be perceived and judged."

    "abstract": "Under the deep penetration of power electronics, heterogeneous frequency dynamics across system nodes, along with low inertia and weak frequency stability, have emerged as critical challenges for the secure operation of modern power systems. To improve the frequency response performance of converter-interfaced generation-dominated power systems, this paper proposes an optimization method for GFL-GFM capacity allocation and frequency control parameters, considering spatial heterogeneity in frequency response distribution. First, a system frequency response model reflecting spatial frequency characteristics is established by integrating the power-frequency dynamic equations of GFL and GFM converters based on frequency distribution theory. Second, an optimization model is formulated to minimize the installed capacity of each GFM while coordinating CIG allocation and frequency control parameters under spatial frequency constraints. Finally, simulations on a hybrid GFMGFL converter system validate the proposed strategy's effectiveness in enhancing nodal frequency stability."

    "abstract": "Power quality (PQ) is a major concern in power system. In industries, PQ issues can lead to malfunctions and results in substantial production downtime. To address these challenges, various custom power devices (CPD's) are deployed to improve power quality and maintain operational continuity. Unified power quality conditioner (UPQC) combines both series and shunt active power filters connected in back to back with a common DC-link. The series compensator is used to mitigate PQ issues in grid side like voltage sag, swell etc to ensuring a stable and reliable power supply. The shunt compensator is used for compensating PQ issues on load side like harmonics, unbalance etc. The presented system involves integrating a PV array with a UPQC and battery to enhance PQ in the grid using enhanced SOGI (ESOGI) control. Integration of doublestage PV system with UPQC, helps in providing active power support to the grid. The battery is used to store excess power from PV array. Additionally, the battery is controlled to regulate the DC link voltage during transient conditions and to reduce the settling time. Also this control scheme helps to compensate for asymmetrical voltage sag and swell in the grid. The system has been designed and simulated using Matlab/Simulink software, with the simulation results confirming the effectiveness of the PV-B-UPQC in enhancing PQ at the point of common coupling (PCC)."

A modular design approach is adopted for frame segmentation, aiming to achieve autonomous balance maintenance and execution of specific tasks. Static and modal analyses were conducted using ANSYS software under both stationary and operational conditions of the stabilization system. The results demonstrate that in the non-operational state, the frame exhibits relatively low levels of maximum deformation and stress values, with natural frequency distribution aligning with conventional vehicle characteristics. During operational conditions, the maximum deformation and stress values at critical frame locations show significant increases yet remain within safe thresholds. Both operational datasets meet the predefined performance criteria, validating the rationality and reliability of the structural design. This research provides theoretical support and quantitative references for the engineering development of unmanned self-balancing two-wheeled vehicles."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of distributed state estimation for nonlinear systems under non-Gaussian measurement noise. Traditional distributed Kalman filters often rely on Gaussian noise assumptions and are prone to performance degradation when faced with heavy-tailed, impulsive, or multimodal disturbances. To enhance robustness and estimation accuracy, we propose a novel distributed unscented Kalman filter based on Gaussian mixture modeling (UKFGMM). The key idea is to approximate the non-Gaussian measurement noise using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and assign each Gaussian component to a parallel unscented Kalman filter (UKF) sub-filter. These sub-estimates are then fused in a probabilistic manner, inspired by the interacting multiple model (IMM) framework. This mechanism enables the filter to adaptively track multiple noise modes while preserving distributed computation. Simulation results demonstrate that UKFGMM achieves superior performance compared to conventional UKF and maximum correntropy UKF, especially in scenarios with strong non-Gaussian characteristics."

    "abstract": "Abstract—Interoperability is increasingly recognised as a foundational principle for fostering innovation, competition, and user autonomy in the evolving digital ecosystem. Existing research on interoperability predominantly focuses either on technological interoperability itself or on the legal regulations concerning interoperability, with insufficient exploration of their interdisciplinary intersection. This paper compares the technological interoperability in Web 3.0 with the theoretical framework of legal interoperability established by the EU Data Act, analysing the areas of convergence and mismatch. The goal is to align technical interoperability with legal concepts of interoperability, thereby enhancing the practical implementation of systematic interoperability in the next generation of the Web. Through a comparative analysis of technological and legal interoperability, this study finds that, firstly, Web 3.0’s concept of interoperability spans data, systems, and applications, while the Data Act focuses solely on data. This narrow scope risks creating a fragmented ecosystem, where data exchange is possible, but full integration of systems and applications is hindered, leading to inefficiencies, and obstructing seamless data flow across platforms. Secondly, while Web 3.0 technically seeks to achieve interoperability through the integration of entire systems and decentralised applications, the compliance with Data Act might negatively limit such system and application interoperability through its data interoperability provisions. This paper suggests interdisciplinary recommendations to enhance the implementation and enforcement of interoperability. On one hand, the Data Act should broaden its concept of interoperability to encompass both the systems and applications layers. On the other hand, it is advisable to introduce provisions for standardised protocols through soft law mechanisms to address legal shortcomings and keep pace with technological advancements."

This paper proposes an innovative solution to convert real-world videos recorded from vehicles on the road into virtual scenarios. This approach allows us to introduce variations to create complex scenarios that mirror real-world encounters. The process involves performing semantic segmentation and object detection on the recorded videos, which are divided into individual frames, each associated with corresponding three-dimensional (3D) Global Positioning System (GPS) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data from the ego vehicle (EV). The world coordinates of objects across these frames are calculated using intrinsic camera parameters and depth maps, with EV coordinates specified in the Cartesian coordinate system by converting World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) global coordinates to Earth Centered Earth Fixed (ECEF) coordinates. The paper concludes by demonstrating the effective transformation of recorded video images into virtual scenarios."

In this paper, a joint resource allocation model considers DGs, remote-controlled switches (RCSs) and soft open points (SOPs) is established. The entire recovery process, from resist and response to restoration, is modelled considering their own recovery features and coupling relationships. Furthermore, the objective of allocation model includes a comprehensive consideration of two economic terms: deployment cost and resilience benefit.

The study extracts two typical topological structures-parallel coupling and series coupling sections-from actual grid features and analyzes their interactive mechanisms affecting static voltage stability limits. Research reveals that in parallel systems, power flow distribution significantly impacts the overall transmission limit, with optimal limits achieved when heavily loaded branches concentrate on low-impedance paths. In series systems, the contribution of proximal station power growth to total transmission capacity exhibits nonlinear variation (sensitivity decreases with increasing output). Validated through actual grid simulations, the sensitivity of key node power flow to section limits is quantified, demonstrating that uniform power verification may cause conservatism or security risks. The findings provide theoretical support for online assessment of multi-level transmission section limit and active power optimization control, enhancing utilization rates while ensuring security to promote renewable energy accommodation."

Traditional machine learning detection methods are effective for simple single type defect identification, but there are certain difficulties for the complexity of various irregular defects common in PCBS. Therefore, in large-scale automated inspection, the accuracy and efficiency of these traditional methods are often low. This study uses a comprehensive experimental design to integrate and compare traditional machine learning models with popular deep learning architectures. The results of practical experimental research show that although the deep learning model, YOLO model, has superior performance in defect detection, it requires more computing resources, and the model is prone to missing detection problems when dealing with complex defects. In contrast, Faster R-CNN, in particular, performs well in PCB panel defect detection scenarios with multiple defect types, and its detection accuracy can exceed 95%, with high accuracy and operational efficiency. The research ultimately provides a robust defect detection framework for the needs of the PCB manufacturing industry, reducing inspection errors and improving production efficiency. Future directions include expanding the diversity of datasets and integrating additional deep learning models to integrate the benefits of other deep learning models."

The system uses protocols such as DH, ECDH, DHE, ECDHE and EDEDH to generate a shared 256 -bit secret, which is then combined with a unique 128-bit PUF-generated key using XOR and SHA256 hashing to form the final session key. The framework enhances security by making the key device-specific and resistant to physical tampering.

Results show that all schemes generate highentropy, unpredictable keys, while also maintaining low latency suitable for constrained devices.

To address this challenge, this paper proposes a VPP-RRT* algorithm. By incorporating the sailboat’s Velocity Prediction Program (VPP), the cost function of the RRT* algorithm is modified. The cost function is divided into maneuvering cost and time cost, aiming to reduce the total turning angles and path length of the planned route.

In order to study this problem in depth, this paper simulates the fault injection of ESR in various cases via professional simulation software and selects the transient voltage signal generated when the load resistance changes suddenly as the key feature. With the help of the classification ability of SVM algorithm, whether the capacitor fails can be judged according to the change of transient voltage signal. Experiments show that the power supply fault diagnosis method based on SVM has better diagnostic accuracy."

To address this issue, we propose Super-Resolution 3DGS, which is an expansion of 3DGS designed with a two-stage coarse-to-fine training framework, utilizing pretrained low-resolution scene representation as an initialization for super-resolution optimization. Moreover, we introduce Multi-resolution Feature Gaussian Splatting (MFGS) to incorporates a latent feature field for flexible feature sampling and Gradient-guided Selective Splitting (GSS) for effective Gaussian upsampling. By integrating these strategies within the coarse-to-fine framework ensure both high fidelity and memory efficiency.

    "abstract": "To address the growing need for high-precision forecasting in renewable energy systems, particularly in multistep wind power forecasting (WFP), an LSTM-ASSA-Informer architecture is developed by tackling the challenges of shortterm pattern modeling and long-range dependency learning. First, the long short-term memory (LSTM) network is employed to effectively model short-term temporal patterns through its gated memory structure. Second, an adaptive sparse self-attention (ASSA) mechanism is introduced to dynamically highlight the most relevant features from highdimensional input data, helping the model focus on critical information. Finally, the Informer is integrated to efficiently capture long-range dependencies while reducing computational overhead, using a distillation-based attention mechanism tailored for WFP. Experiments on the GEFCom2014 dataset show that the proposed model consistently surpasses several widely used approaches across multiple forecasting horizons. It exhibits notable improvements in forecasting accuracy and robustness, underscoring its practical significance and strong potential for real-world deployment."

Guanabara Bay, located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is a highly impacted coastal ecosystem facing intense urban, industrial, and port pollution. In this kind of environment, the radar system enables high-resolution detection of tidal dynamics, supporting real-time environmental monitoring.

    "abstract": "Landslides are one of the most devastating natural disasters, leading to significant loss of life, property damage, and environmental destruction. The unpredictability of landslides makes it essential to develop reliable early warning systems that can help mitigate their impact. This paper presents a landslide detection system that integrates multiple sensing technologies, including soil moisture sensors, accelerometers, and tiltmeters, combined with the Internet of Things (IoT) for real-time monitoring and analysis. The system continuously measures soil moisture levels, which are critical for slope stability. Too much water in the soil reduces cohesion and makes slopes more vulnerable to landslides. NodeMCU, a microcontroller with IoT features, serves as the main processing unit. It collects and sends data wirelessly to a remote server. The system also uses accelerometers and tiltmeters to detect unusual ground movement and changes in slope angles. These sensors provide key information that can help predict potential landslides. By taking advantage of IoT and real-time data processing, the system allows authorities and communities to receive early warnings. This helps with timely evacuations and disaster prevention measures. Combining sensor networks with cloud-based data storage improves predictive analysis, leading to better disaster management overall. The system is also cost-effective and scalable, making it suitable for landslide-prone areas. This research focuses on the design and development of a scalable, low-power and modular landslide detection architecture. The three-tier warning mechanism is incorporated to ensure timely alerts. While large-scale field validation is part of future work, the proposed framework is structured to achieve high detection reliability and low alert latency in real deployments, contributing to proactive disaster risk reduction."

    "abstract": "Combining AI with traditional art methods has created new possibilities in digital creation, especially when it comes to improving hand-drawn sketches through intelligent modelling. This study presents a new neural rendering system that improves the look and structure of hand-drawn artworks by combining deep learning models with traditional sketch improvement methods. A convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone and a transformer-based focus mechanism are used in the suggested system to look at and improve sketch inputs. By using domain-specific priors like edge recognition, stroke density estimates, and artistic features, the system improves the image in several steps, such as by lowering noise, making lines clearer, and changing the shade. A generative adversarial network (GAN) learns accurate texture maps from labelled datasets to make the result even better. The framework lets the user lead customization through live inputs, which lets style and detail be changed on the fly. Using standard sketch files for experiments shows that this method performs better than current baseline methods in terms of perceptual quality, structural coherence, and staying true to the original artist's purpose. Quantitative measures like SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS show that the method works, and personal feedback from professional artists shows how useful the system is in design processes. Combining neural modelling with traditional sketches makes it possible to use this method in animation, product design, and digital art instruction. It bridges the gap between artificial intelligence and human creation. For more artistic expression, future updates could add real-time modelling and the ability to change the style to fit your needs."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "With the large-scale integration of variable renewable energy sources like wind and solar power, decreased system inertia leads to increased disturbances and larger frequency deviations, thus posing significant challenges to maintaining frequency within the prescribed range.. As conventional thermal power plants are progressively replaced by wind and solar generation, their capacity and regulation speed become insufficient to meet frequency regulation requirements. Furthermore, frequent regulation adjustments can lead to mechanical wear, thereby shortening their operational lifespan. Distributed energy resources, such as energy storage systems, electric vehicles, and flexible loads, serve as a critical supplement for enhancing system frequency regulation capacity due to their fast response and flexible dispatch characteristics. However, the distinct regulation characteristics of Virtual Power Plants compared to thermal power plants create coordination challenges. Consequently, it is imperative to develop control strategies that coordinate diverse frequency regulation resources to achieve optimal regulation outcomes while reducing regulation costs. To fully leverage the role of the VPP in system frequency regulation, a multi-resource coordinated secondary frequency regulation framework is designed, enabling the joint participation of Virtual Power Plants (VPPs), energy storage systems, and conventional generating units. Subsequently, a model characterizing the VPP regulation dynamics is formulated, and the transfer function relating the actual regulation power output to the regulation command signal is established. Building upon this, an optimization-based algorithm for decomposing coordinated regulation commands among diverse resources is proposed. This algorithm fully leverages the unique frequency regulation capabilities of each resource type while minimizing the associated regulation costs. Finally, the proposed method is validated on the IEEE 30-bus test system, demonstrating its superior frequency control performance compared to both thermal-only regulation and a conventional capacity-proportional command decomposition strategy. Case studies and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control architecture and optimization strategy effectively enhance system frequency stability and reduce frequency regulation costs.."

    "abstract": "Addressing reliability early in the product development cycle is essential to reduce costs and ensure long-term performance. Traditional methods-such as Highly Accelerated Life Test (HALT), Accelerated Life Test (ALT), and Highly Accelerated Stress Screen (HASS)-are effective but typically costly and time-consuming. Predictive tools, including Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), simulations, and failure rate analysis, help identify potential failure modes during early design stages. Quantitative metrics, such as failure rate and Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), are often modeled using the Weibull distribution to characterize distinct failure phases. This paper proposes a structured methodology for predictive reliability assessment of power electronic systems during the early design phase. The approach relies on component-level Failure In Time (FIT) data, adjusted to account for environmental and operational factors in accordance with IEC 61709. By integrating principles from MIL-HDBK-217F and the FIDES Guide, the methodology enables fast and cost-effective reliability estimations without requiring accelerated testing. A case study demonstrates the method's effectiveness in guiding design decisions and evaluating reliability trade-offs during the conceptual design stage."

Polysilicon, as a key raw material in the photovoltaic industry chain, exhibits typical characteristics such as high continuity in production, concentrated energy consumption, and complex coupling relationships among stages, thus demonstrating strong potential for load adjustability. This paper, based on the process characteristics of the polysilicon production process, establishes a full-process load production model framework using the State-Task Network method. It systematically describes the material transfer links and task execution logic among core tasks, and proposes a load adjustable capacity evaluation model that considers material balance, power balance, storage constraints, production output constraint, and task execution constraints. Simulation cases verify the effectiveness of the proposed model in characterizing the load regulation potential of polysilicon production, and reveal differences in regulation capabilities across production stages, thereby providing theoretical basis and decision support for polysilicon enterprises participating in power system ancillary services."

Additionally, the stability of the TF-ASMC is demonstrated by using Lyapunov and Rayleigh principles. Secondly, based on the concept of threshold-free adaptability, a threshold-free sliding mode observer (TF-ASMO) is designed for feedforward compensation of the TF-ASMC, thereby enhancing the robustness of the control system.

A test setup was developed using Rogowski-type electrodes immersed in the fluid and subjected to positive and negative standard lightning impulses, following IEC 60060-1 and 60247. The dielectric dissipation factor (tan δ) and partial discharge (PD) activity were measured before and after the impulses.

These findings confirm the technical feasibility of synthetic esters as reliable insulating fluids for HV equipment, supporting sustainable practices in the electrical energy sector."

To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel RRT*-based path planning algorithm tailored for off-road autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs). During the sampling process, plane fitting is employed to ensure continuous and stable contact between the vehicle and the underlying terrain. Instead of conventional position-based sampling, the algorithm samples velocity and angular velocity STATEs, leveraging a kinematic vehicle model to achieve valid STATE transitions and expand the search tree accordingly. Simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method across three types of challenging off-road terrains: valleys, potholes, and gravel roads. Experimental results show that compared to the traditional 3D RRT* algorithm, the proposed approach significantly reduces path length, number of nodes, turning angles, and planning time. Furthermore, the second set of experiments verifies that the algorithm can adaptively adjust roll and pitch angle thresholds at each node based on preset speed requirements, maintaining vehicle stability while keeping the actual speed close to the desired value."

However, their inherent structural characteristics and the resulting nonlinear effects lead to pronounced torque ripple, which has significantly hindered their adoption in industrial applications and electric vehicles. As a novel approach, this paper proposes a nested optimizationbased current shaping strategy for SRMs in order to mitigate torque ripple and copper losses. The proposal combines NSGA-II for optimizing firing angles with a Quadratic Programming (QP) algorithm that minimizes instantaneous torque tracking error under flux variation constraints. This hybrid approach balances efficiency and torque smoothness, especially at medium to high speeds, by compensating for negative torque generated due to tail currents. The optimal trade-off among Pareto-optimal solutions is selected based on the minimum Euclidean distance to the ideal point.

First, a landslide fault rate model considering terrain and precipitation effects is established to quantify the risk of line faults caused by secondary disasters. Second, a Bayesian network is introduced to simulate the spatial propagation and evolution of secondary faults, combined with Monte Carlo sampling techniques to generate a set of secondary faults. Finally, through simulation analysis of a regional power grid in a certain province, the effectiveness of the proposed method in generating typical secondary fault sets under prolonged and frequent fault conditions is validated. The research findings can provide decision-making support for post-disaster recovery strategy formulation and grid resilience enhancement."

    "abstract": "Flood events are increasing in frequency while their impacts are escalating. Multiple Flood Early Warning Systems (FEWSs) have been developed over the last years, yet many struggle with latency, opaque predictions, weak communication of uncertainty in flood forecasting results, and budget constraints. This paper presents ARMED, a proposed FEWS with a layered architecture that uses a hybrid approach combining IoT sensors, open meteorological data forecasts, hydrologic - hydraulic modelling produced scenarios, Machine Learning (ML) for near real time scenario selection and an Early-Warning engine to generate ranked alerts for upcoming flood events. The System includes a web application where data, scenarios and alerts are presented. ARMED proposed architecture emphasizes open-source components and supports adaptability, extensibility and modularity for reuse across basins. The System will be tested in the Agioi Anargyroi stream (Serres, Greece)."

    "abstract": "We propose DeepIPCv2, an end-to-end autonomous driving framework that integrates LiDAR-based environmental perception with command-specific control learning. Unlike prior camera-reliant models, DeepIPCv2 employs point cloud segmentation and multi-view projection (front and bird’s-eye views) to construct robust scene representations. These features are fused and decoded through a combination of gated recurrent units (GRU), command-specific multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), and PID controllers to estimate both waypoints and navigational control commands. This design enhances maneuverability and addresses action imbalance in driving datasets. To validate the model, we constructed a dataset covering diverse illumination conditions and conducted ablation studies and comparative tests against recent methods, including TransFuser. Results demonstrate that DeepIPCv2 achieves the lowest total metric error and the fewest driving interventions, highlighting both its robustness to illumination changes and its improved control accuracy. By releasing the codes at https://github.com/oskarnatan/DeepIPCv2 later, we aim to support reproducibility and future advancements in end-to-end autonomous driving research."

    "abstract": "cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) is a promising technology for uniform high spectral efficiency (SE), enabled by distributed access points (AP) jointly serving user equipments (UE) over wide areas. However, practical deployment faces two key challenges: AP–UE association under AP capacity limits and efficient pilot assignment with limited orthogonal pilots. We propose an iterative, preference-aware association algorithm (coverage-aware preference-based association (CAPA)) that balances AP loads while respecting both UE and AP preferences, ensuring reliable service for all UEs. In parallel, we design a pilot assignment scheme (conflict pilot assignment (LCPA)) that minimizes pilot reuse within each AP set, falling back on the least-used pilot only when necessary. Simulations show that our approach outperforms existing benchmarks, boosting the 95%-likely spectral efficiency by up to 46% and the sum SE by 2–8%. These results highlight the proposed framework’s ability to trade off coverage and throughput, making it well-suited for dense (CF-mMIMO) deployments"

    "abstract": "Dry-type capacitors, which have high operating voltage and energy storage density, have been widely used in VSC-HVDC, but the complex electrical and thermal environments pose significant challenges to the operational stability of capacitors. It is difficult to directly measure the temperature distribution inside capacitors, and existing computation models simulate capacitor components as equivalent series resistance, ignoring the temperature dependence and electric field dependence of capacitor models under complex electrothermal condition. This paper focuses on the biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) capacitors, considering its dielectric characteristics under superimposed AC-DC voltage and high ambient temperature, quantitatively describes the temperature dependence and electric field dependence of the BOPP's leakage current and dielectric losses. A finite element electrothermal coupling model considering the characteristics of dielectric materials is proposed, and the temperature distribution of capacitors under the superimposed AC-DC voltage is obtained, the influence of ambient temperature and dielectric properties on the thermoelectric coupling of capacitor is analyzed. This work provides a guidance for the material and structure design of capacitors."

It highlights how psychologists and computer scientists, including Paul Ekman, Terrence Sejnowski, Jeffery Cohn, and Takeo Kanade, collaborated to computerize the Facial Action Coding System, underscoring the importance of comprehensive, accessible datasets as a prerequisite for automating facial expression analysis. Based on grant proposals, research notes, and correspondence, I argue that the link between facial expressions and emotional states came to be seen as self-evident rather than subject to further inquiry, as researchers devoted themselves to collecting, labeling, and curating facial image datasets for training and testing computerized systems. By foregrounding the detailed process of data-making, this article contributes to the history of computing and the politics of algorithms, showing how these practices helped consolidate particular assumptions about the human face and emotion as technical facts."

    "abstract": "Upper limb wearable exoskeletons are devices used for assistive and augmentative applications in work environments. The shoulder mechanism of the upper limb exoskeleton is vital in fulfilling its objective by exhibiting its capability to move with the human shoulder in unity without any joint axis misalignment. Any misalignment can cause strain on the human shoulder complex due to unwanted interaction forces between the user and the exoskeleton. Most existing portable assistive or augmentation exoskeletons fail to exhibit the capability to self-align when there is a joint axis misalignment due to design-related issues. This paper presents the design, analysis, and experimental evaluation of a novel human-centric shoulder exoskeleton with a self-aligning shoulder mechanism for an average adult male. The novelty of the design is that it considers the human shoulder’s humeral head (HH) translation and incorporates a novel mechanism to reduce misalignment. The system’s design details, workspace analysis, and prototype testing and analysis are explained. The proposed exoskeleton is evaluated and validated using simulation and experimentation on a standardised test bench. The results are compared with the existing conventional exoskeleton and human-assisted motion, and it was found that the proposed exoskeleton is capable of reducing the interaction forces due to misalignment by 99%. Further, a simple assistive control architecture is proposed and implemented for the exoskeleton for efficient operation."

    "abstract": "Cultural artifacts are vital for heritage preservation but vulnerable to environmental damage that creates internal structural defects not visible on the surface. The drainage dragon heads of the Forbidden City exemplify this problem, suffering from structural detachment due to long-term erosion, which threatens both heritage preservation and public safety. Conventional non-destructive testing methods are inadequate in this context. Contact-based ultrasound risks surface damage, while X-ray devices are unsuitable for public heritage sites and both lack sufficient penetration capability. Muography offers a promising non-invasive solution using cosmic ray muons to image internal structures without artificial radiation. However, conventional muography algorithms lack the resolution needed for fracture detection in drainage structures. We propose a highprecision scattering-based muography algorithm using Bayesian inference with prior knowledge. This approach incorporates the object’s geometric outline and constructs a likelihood function combining theoretical scattering models with muon momentum. Using PyMC for probabilistic sampling, we reconstruct slice density to reveal internal structures. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in imaging complex fractures in drainage structures. This method provides a practical solution for cultural heritage preservation and can extend to structural assessment in civil engineering applications."

    "abstract": "Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite communications provide uninterrupted coverage and seamless services, which are becoming a crucial element in the Sixth-Generation of wireless communications. However, LEO communications are subject to high path loss and Doppler frequency shift, which presents significant challenges for such large-distance and time-changeable satellite-terrestrial transmission links. Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) has been widely adopted as a robust modulation technique in LEO satellite systems. Traditional DSSS signal detection methods, which rely on 2D searching, fail to effectively acquire the weak uplink signals due to the extremely low signal-to-noise ratio and pronounced channel dynamics. In light of these considerations, this study proposes an algorithm designated as time synchronization-aided signal detection, with the objective of enhancing the signal detection probability in low signal-to-noise ratio and high-mobility communication scenarios. Furthermore, we develop a novel transmission system based on time synchronization, with the objective of reducing the signal detection threshold by minimizing the impact of the Doppler frequency shift and time delay searching ranges. We theoretically analyze performance at varying time synchronization precision, numerical simulations and hardware experiments under diverse conditions demonstrate that, in comparison to the conventional algorithm, time synchronization can enhance the probability of signal detection."

    "abstract": "Hybrid precoding, as a compromise between low power yet less flexible analog precoding and power hungry but fully flexible digital precoding solutions, has attracted huge attention from industry and academia in recent years for milimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The adoption of uniform circular arrays (UCA) can provide advantages of a wide angle scanning range and flat array gain, hence considered for massive MIMO hybrid precoding. However, the phase shifters used in hybrid precoder architectures are typically narrowband, which do not support the ultra- wideband bandwidth required in mmWave systems. This limitation can significantly degrade the performance of UCA in ultra- wideband communications, leading to well-known beam defocus effect. In this paper, we first reveal the beam defocus effects in ultra- wideband mmWave UCA precoding systems, where the beamforming gain severely degrades as the frequency deviates from the center. We then propose a novel frequency-invariant precoder to mitigate beam defocus effect in the hybrid precoding architectures, which approximately achieve the same high beamforming gain for the whole wide bandwidth without extra hardware cost. Finally, numerical simulation and outdoors experimental validations with same parameter settings are performed. Both simulation and measurement results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed frequency-invariant precoding algorithm."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the anti-jamming channel access problem in complex and unknown jamming environments, where the jammer could dynamically adjust its strategies to target different channels. Traditional channel hopping anti-jamming approaches using fixed patterns are ineffective against such dynamic jamming attacks. Although the emerging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based dynamic channel access approach could achieve the Nash equilibrium (NE) under fast-changing jamming attacks, it requires extensive training episodes. To address this issue, we propose a fast adaptive anti-jamming channel access approach guided by the intuition of “learning faster than the jammer”, where a synchronously updated coarse-grained spectrum prediction serves as an auxiliary task for the deep Q network (DQN) based anti-jamming model. This helps the model identify a superior Q-function compared to standard DRL while significantly reducing the number of training episodes. Numerical results indicate that the proposed approach significantly accelerates the rate of convergence in model training, reducing the required training episodes by up to 70% compared to standard DRL. Additionally, it also achieves a 10% improvement in throughput over NE strategies, owing to the effective use of coarse-grained spectrum prediction."

In response to this situation, in this paper, a beamforming optimization method of covert communications for multi-position warden is proposed. Firstly, we formulate a general optimization problem and optimize it to maximize the covert communication rate of the user based on Dinkelbach’s transform. Subsequently, according to the optimized general optimization problem, we propose three schemes for three scenes corresponding to different fixed warden positions, using appropriate technologies for assistance in each scheme. Specifically, the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is used in Scene 1 and the integrated communication and jamming (ICAJ) is used in Scenes 2 and 3, and these technologies can assist the covert communication. Moreover, we propose an alternate optimization (AO) algorithm to solve the optimization problem of Scene 1 for its optimal covert communication performance. Additionally, we also propose an AO algorithm to solve the optimization problems of Scenes 2 and 3 to optimize the active beamforming. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of all three proposed schemes, that outperform their respective benchmark schemes."

    "abstract": "This study presents a model for two motion tasks: optical flow and rectified stereo-matching from images. Instead of proposing two specialized architectures for two different tasks, we solve the two tasks by comparing feature similarities using a single model. We achieve discriminative features by developing our feature extraction methods. Unlike previous feature extractors, which concatenate all the convolutional, residual, and pyramid pooling outputs, we take only the final residual layer output and pyramid pooling outputs. Our extractor has two advantages. First, when our feature extractor outputs are combined with the Transformer, the quality of the extracted features is remarkably improved. As a result, our model does not need additional task-specific refinement. Second, our feature extractor reduces computational overhead by focusing on discriminative outputs only (e.g., final residual and pyramid pooling), resulting in ~50% fewer parameters than UniMatch (2.46M vs. 5.1M) and enabling training on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU. Similar to the other unified models, our model also allows cross-task transfer. We can share parameters across tasks without changing them. On the challenging Sintel and KITTI datasets, our model achieves comparable or superior performance to prior works, with particular gains in efficiency (e.g., 50% fewer parameters than UniMatch and single-GPU training) and architectural simplicity."

    "abstract": "Occupational burnout has emerged as a pressing issue in the years following the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in Malaysia, which ranks as the nation with the second-poorest work-life balance. This pervasive issue adversely impacts both organizational productivity and employee well-being. Despite the growing use of ML and DL in healthcare industry to predict occupational burnout, there is little study on non-healthcare and non-educational worker burnout. Since traditional approaches of task management are ineffective in today complicated and ever-changing workplaces, many companies are clueless to the problem of occupational burnout. Therefore, the main purpose of this research using ML methods, such as Logistic Regression, the XGBoost model, and the Random Forest Classifier, to create a trustworthy framework for predicting occupational burnout. The dataset for this project will be constructed from publicly accessible information regarding employee demographics, job satisfaction, job turnover, work environment, and various other social factors."

    "abstract": "Women's informal saving groups (ISGs) in Tanzania play a vital role in financial inclusion particularly to the low-income earners. However, limited financial management skills for effective financial decision-making hinder their profitabiliy and sustainability. Traditional training and operaional practice methods often fail to meet their needs due to costs, social, and mobility constraints. This study employed design science research and design thinking methodologies to co-create WanawakeApp, a mobile prototype aimed at supporting financial management and decisionmaking. The findings indicate that the app's enhanced financial record-keeping, loan planning, and fund management are for informed financial decision-making. Women's ISGs expressed satisfaction with the App intuitive interface and context-specific content. The study also revealed that device compatibility, sociocultural factors, and user demographics influenced skill development and app's adoption. Conversely, challenges such as connectivity, digital illiteracy, and high costs posed barriers to effective use. WanawakeApp presents a promising model for strengthening community well-being by mitigating negative impacts of financial mismanagement and created a new pathway for research and innovation using design science research (DSR) in Infomation and communication technology for develpmeng (ICT4D) to empower ISGs and informal workers."

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on determining the optimal tilt and orientation of solar panels using a dome configuration multi-panel observation device to obtain maximum and stable energy production. Although Indonesia, located on the equator, has high solar energy potential year-round, the performance of solar panels is highly dependent on their position relative to the sun’s path. Unstable and suboptimal energy output can result in inefficient system performance. The proposed dome system utilizes 16 mini solar panels arranged with various tilt (altitude) and direction (azimuth) angles to analyze their energy contributions. After 7 days of testing, the panel at altitude 30° and azimuth -30° produced the highest energy (31.38 Wh), while the lowest was 22.04 Wh at azimuth +30°. This confirms orientation significantly affects energy efficiency. The configuration also achieved stable performance, as seen in standard deviation analysis. This method provides a low-cost alternative to motorized tracking systems that demand reliable and cost-efficient solar energy."

To this end, this study proposes a net load forecasting method based on the Double-layer Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU), considering the uncertainty of new energy generation and load demand. By deepening the model hierarchy, its processing capability for complex time series data can be effectively enhanced, thereby improving the net load forecasting accuracy and model robustness. The article elaborates on this method's basic principles, implementation process, and training details and compares it with various machine learning and deep learning methods. The simulation results show that the proposed approach demonstrates excellent predictive performance across all evaluation metrics."

However, both adjacency matrix multiplication and the Warshall algorithm have certain limitations in computational speed. Therefore, this paper proposes an ultra high speed computation method for the reachability matrix of undirected graphs based on vertex sets, targeting the large number of undirected graphs topology analysis tasks in business applications. This paper applies the reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity of undirected graphs to the steps of the Warshall algorithm, and introduces the concepts of “vertex sets” and “vertex sets vector” through theoretical derivation. On this basis, “AND” and “OR” operations on vertex set vectors are used to replace the judgment and execution steps in the Warshall's algorithm, significantly improving the computation speed of the reachability matrix of the undirected graph. In the algorithm design, the concept of “effective rows” is further introduced to improve the performance of the algorithm. The examples in the paper verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "A globally prominent economic crop, sugarcane is an indispensable raw material for over 80% of sugar production worldwide. In Thailand, the sugarcane and sugar industry holds a top position in export markets. The loss of sugarcane crops due to diseases is a devastating problem that can never be overstated. Not only does it affect the economy, but it is also the primary source of income for many farmers in the provinces. To prevent a wide spread of any disease, farmers have long been heavily relying on visual inspections and their expertise to detect any signs of disease as early as possible. To assist farmers, this work applied computer vision and machine learning technology to help classifying sugarcane diseases from its leaves. Deployed on mobile devices, our application allows farmers to easily send to our chat-bot a photo of their suspected sugarcane leaves, and get a real-time response specifying the name of the disease or none if it is deemed healthy. Trained and fine-tuned on public data sets, our classifier, which is a vision transformer model, outperformed previous works. Tested on a newly collected local data set, ours achieved a high accuracy 79.64%."

However, In a calcium-based system, the low thermal conductivity(TC) of the heat storage material restricts the overall heat transfer efficiency. so many studies are devoted to enhancing the TC of calcium-based TCES materials to facilitate their real-world utilization. The central objective of this review is to examine the research status of TC enhancement of calcium-based TCES, including material modification and device design optimization. Finally, recommendations for further investigation and technological improvement of calcium-based TCES are provided."

We validate our prototype through scenario-based evaluations at two real-world facilities: the Iroribi Tech node and the Daiwa Ubiquitous Computing Research Building at the University of Tokyo. Scenarios included typical operational tasks such as querying HVAC set-points, executing single-device control, and performing group equipment operations. Across these tests, our system consistently achieved a 100 % task success rate, although the observed latency of approximately <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$20-30$</tex> seconds highlights opportunities for performance optimization.

Typically, RAG technologies use vector databases. In this paper, we compare two competing vector databases for RAG, one \"native\" vector database management system and one relational database management system with a vector extension. We concentrate on measuring their performance and relevance in vector similarity search. Our data set consists of 6.1 million Wikipedia abstracts, queried using over 100 000 questions from the MS MARCO data. For each query, we retrieved the abstract that - according to the DBMS's algorithm - most closely matched the query.For the performance evaluation, we executed the queries sequentially on a high-end consumer grade PC. Our tests indicated that the native vector database management system was faster than the vector extension. However, we found that the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) indexing and retrieval method used by the vector extension provided better performance than the earlier inverted file method.To evaluate the relevance of the retrieved results, we used a simplistic method of letting OpenAI's GTP-3.5-turbo model assess the quality of each query - answer pair. This test indicated that the native vector database and the HNSW method provided the best results."

The lightning transient response of the circuits are simulated, and their performance is evaluated based on the error compared to reference values and the number of poles used in the fittings. The results show that, by applying the rational fitting independently to each admittance element of the circuit, it is possible to reduce the size of the matrices in the calculations without loss of accuracy, demonstrating the efficiency of the model in representing the transient response of grounding electrodes."

However, traditional detection methods, including manual identification and computer vision (CV), face limitations when dealing with low-quality videos. Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology provide a promising alternative, but still encounter challenges such as high false alarm rates and susceptibility to environmental interference. This paper proposes a brain-computer fusion approach that integrates CV with BCI through a novel video stimulation paradigm. Additionally, an adaptive collaborative framework is introduced, employing a dual-stream fusion architecture with a dynamic adjustment mechanism guided by CV. This method combines the strengths of CV in image processing and target localization with the cognitive advantages of BCI to improve detection performance. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that the proposed fusion approach achieved higher F1-scores and accuracy by substantially reducing false alarm rates. This work not only introduces novel technical insights into the field of video target detection but also highlight the potential of human-machine collaboration to address challenges in automated detection."

To address this challenge, this paper proposes a joint UAV deployment and GU clustering optimization method, as well as designing a collaborative group-buying mechanism to support GUs with different service types. The joint optimization problem is modeled as a multi-period hierarchical game, where the outer layer is modeled as a UAV deployment game, and the inner layer is modeled as a coalition formation game. Furthermore, a joint optimization algorithm for UAV deployment and GU clustering under energy constraints is designed to obtain the stable solution. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm reduces UAV energy consumption and increases the total utility of the air-ground network."

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of video content, there is a growing need for smart ways to pick out the most useful frames for image processing tasks. This paper introduces a simple yet effective method for automatically extracting and grading frames from a video. The process starts by capturing frames at a low frame rate, either 1 frame per second (fps) or 0.5 fps, based on the user's choice. Each frame is then evaluated in two ways: First, we check how sharp or clear the image is using the Variance of Laplacian (VoL) method. Second, we use MediaPipe Face Mesh to see how well any faces in the frame are visible. These two scores—image clarity and face visibility—are combined using a custom ranking algorithm. Frames that are sharper and show clearer faces are ranked higher. Finally, the frames are saved in a specific folder, sorted from highest to lowest rank, giving you a clean and organized set of frames ready for further image processing work."

The model combines a retriever for document search and a generator to produce responses. The dataset used includes internal academic documents such as course schedules and campus information. The system was evaluated using two metrics: Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation Assessment Score (RAGAS). The average RAGAS score, calculated from four main metrics (faithfulness, answer relevancy, context precision, and context recall), is 84%. For MRR-based evaluation, the average score from MRR, semantic similarity, answer relevancy, and faithfulness is 82%.

High-resolution position sensors, such as encoders and resolvers, are typically required to implement high-performance control techniques. However, these sensors significantly increase the system cost. Hall sensors, while offering a cost-effective alternative, generally provide low resolution and are not directly suitable for high-performance control. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a method based on average velocity to enhance resolution when using Hall sensors, without incurring additional cost. The proposed system was constructed and tested in MATLAB Simulink to estimate the rotor position of a Brushless DC motor. Simulation results demonstrate that the method achieves satisfactory accuracy at medium and high rotational speeds."

    "abstract": "Solar energy is a major renewable resource in Indonesia, with great potential due to its widespread availability. To support this, the Indonesian government, through the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources Regulation No. 26 of 2021, has increased the export limit of electricity for PLN customers using rooftop solar power systems from 65% to 100%. This policy change significantly affects both the technical and economic aspects of rooftop solar systems. This study explores the technical performance of rooftop solar systems, including configuration, system size, load demand, energy exports, solar energy fraction, and overall energy production. It also investigates the economic side, looking at initial investment, component costs, operating and maintenance expenses, cash flow, energy costs, ROI, and profitability. The research compares the impact of different export-import kWh percentages on technical parameters such as PV capacity, inverter quantity, excess energy, renewable energy share, and energy metrics, as well as on economic indicators like capital costs, operating expenses, Net Present Cost (NPC), Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE), simple payback, and return on investment (ROI). The results show that changing the export-import kWh percentage from 65% to 100% doesn’t impact technical factors like PV capacity, energy surplus, or renewable energy share. However, it does affect economic variables, leading to an operating cost of IDR 4.42 million per year, an NPC of IDR 107 million, an LCOE of IDR 1,084.99/kWh, a payback period of 9.7 years, and a 5.3% ROI. As rooftop solar systems reduce electricity costs, the government’s policy change makes the payback period shorter."

Analogous to the optimization algorithm of bulk dielectric constant, an iterative optimization algorithm considering the change of conductivity with temperature is developed, with the uniformity of surface electric field under thermal gradient as the optimization goal. The variation of surface conductivity distribution throughout the iterative process is investigated. The impact of various conductivity-temperature parameters on surface charge and electric field distribution is explored.

    "abstract": "LiDAR and camera sensors are essential for environment perception, object detection, and classification in autonomous vehicles, forming the foundation for safe driving decisions. However, these sensors are susceptible to spoofing attacks, which can severely compromise perception modules and lead to unsafe behaviors in autonomous systems. This research investigates the development of a robust and intelligent spoof detection framework by leveraging cross-sensor validation between LiDAR and camera data, enhanced with encryption techniques to protect sensor integrity. The simulations were conducted in the CARLA simulator to acquire synchronized LiDAR and camera data under both normal and spoofed conditions. Spoofing was emulated by injecting manipulated data in real-time. An Isolation Forestbased anomaly detection model served as a baseline to identify suspicious deviations in sensor input. The research was further extended by integrating a ResNet-50 deep learning model for spoof detection, significantly improving detection precision by exploiting rich feature representations from both modalities. A cross-sensor validation mechanism was designed to correlate discrepancies between LiDAR point clouds and camera imagery, thereby increasing the system's robustness across diverse attack vectors. Empirical evaluations show that the proposed system achieved a spoof detection accuracy of 86 %, with precision and recall values of approximately 0.84 and 0.88 respectively. Additionally, the system maintained real-time performance in CARLA, running at over 100 FPS under light sensor loads. The autonomous driving agent completed 95 % of benchmark routes successfully, with minimal infractions. Compared to similar spoof detection frameworks, our method provides a balanced trade-off between detection accuracy and system efficiency, confirming its applicability to real-world autonomous systems."

Centralized servers create single points of failure and are susceptible to adversarial attacks such as model poisoning. Additionally, they lack auditability and do not provide cryptographic privacy during model aggregation. This paper proposes a serverless FL framework that integrates blockchain technology with CKKS homomorphic encryption to address these challenges. The framework utilizes a decentralized consensus mechanism based on Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), eliminating the need for a central coordinator and ensuring robustness against Byzantine faults. It incorporates CKKS encryption to enable secure aggregation through computation on encrypted gradients, preserving data privacy throughout the training process. Furthermore, it introduces an auditable trust management system using smart contracts for immutable logging and decentralized reputation tracking. Experimental results on the MNIST dataset, with $20 \\%$ malicious clients, demonstrate that the framework achieves a final global accuracy of $98.68 \\%$ and attains $100 \\%$ precision in rejecting malicious updates without false positives. The computational overhead remains practical, with encryption and consensus times of 0.814 sec and 1.695 $ms$ per round, respectively.

Therefore, the authors have been making a motion generation service using OpenPose nad MocapNET as the first stage of the human motion analysis. Although OpenPose and MocapNET are ones of the most recognizing 2D and 3D pose estimation tools, users need to prepare high performance computer including high performance GPU and install many program codes including many dependent libraries.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this work is to evaluate how electromagnetic effects in field measurements affect the apparent soil electrical properties at frequencies ranging from a few hundred kHz to several MHz. The influence of several factors on the measurement results was investigated numerically. The following factors were considered: different electrode arrangements of the perpendicular dipole-dipole array, wire height, location of the current source and the voltage probe, and length of the rods. The simulation results have shown that all of the above factors can affect the apparent properties to varying degrees. It was suggested that the forward model could also include the measurement setup (in addition to the soil itself) to improve the accuracy of the apparent properties in the simulations. A simple correction was proposed to reduce the high-frequency effects in the apparent properties."

    "abstract": "This study systematically investigates the thermal conductivity, dielectric properties, and temperature distribution of high-thermal-conductivity glass fiber reinforced composites (HTC-GFRP) used in dry-type air-core reactors through a combination of experimental measurements and multiphysics simulations. Results demonstrate that enhancing the thermal conductivity of the epoxy matrix—particularly by increasing alumina particle content—significantly improves the overall thermal performance of HTC-GFRP. When the alumina content exceeds 50 wt%, particles begin to form continuous thermally conductive pathways, further facilitating heat transfer. However, this thermal enhancement is accompanied by a degradation in electrical performance, notably in reduced flashover voltage and breakdown electric field strength. The dielectric constant of HTC-GFRP exhibits a strong positive correlation with thermal conductivity, while the dielectric loss tangent initially increases but subsequently declines at excessively high thermal conductivities. Moreover, improved thermal conductivity leads to a more uniform temperature distribution within the reactor, lowers peak temperatures, enhances cooling efficiency, and ultimately extends the service life and reliability of the equipment."

The proposed method enhances aggregation efficiency, reduces emissions, and supports economic VPP operation."

Many non-technical users are prevented from obtaining the given solutions by poor interface design and limited usability. This paper presents a user-centric dashboard and mobile interface for real-time wastewater monitoring, designed in line with the Chiang Rai Municipal IoT Wastewater Treatment Facility in Thailand. Working together to gather, process, and display water quality data, the system comprises a Home Assistant-based server, ESP32 microcontrollers, industrial-grade dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, water temperature sensors and WiFi-5G network. Incorporating multilingual compatibility, mobile accessibility, color-coded alerts, and a simple design to improve user comprehension, the user interface follows human-computer interaction (HCI) concepts. While generating low latency performance and obtaining high satisfaction ratings from both municipal personnel and public stakeholders, the system achieved 95% uptime during field deployment. By means of user-centric interfaces that can be made both technically strong and socially accessible, the project demonstrates a practical way for designing user-centric interface IoT systems, therefore uniting technical strength with social accessibility to enable smart city development."

A key challenge in building these data marketplaces is providing transparent access to data assets that undergo continuous changes by multiple actors throughout their lifecycle. This resulting provenance, lineage, and versioning information offers insights into a data asset's history and quality, but often goes untracked. To address these challenges, we developed Provenance, Lineage, and Versioning System (PLVS), a W3C PROV-compliant system that captures standardized provenance and lineage metadata (who performed which operations and when) and detects precise differences between dataset versions. PLVS provides an interactive graphical interface for provenance and lineage exploration and version comparison; RESTful APIs for provenance and lineage metadata and dataset version comparison data; and semantic graph-based storage to store this provenance and lineage metadata using the W3C PROV Data Model (W3C PROV-DM). We validated PLVS with Smart Cities use cases in the PISTIS Horizon Europe project, demonstrating its effectiveness in improved data transparency and trustworthiness, data quality assessments, error detection and correction, and auditability in federated dataspaces."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a human-centered Q-learning framework for transmission-level load restoration that jointly maximizes recovered load and enforces history-aware equity across load buses. At each step, the agent reconnects a damaged line; a DC optimal power flow recomputes a feasible re-dispatch subject to power-balance, generator, and line-flow limits. The state encodes the current topology, remaining outages, and cumulative per-bus satisfaction/dissatisfaction histories, where satisfaction equals the fraction of each bus’s load that is restored and dissatisfaction is its complement. Equity is promoted through a pairwise cosine-similarity fairness index computed over the satisfaction/dissatisfaction vectors of all buses; the reward increases with incremental load recovery and gains in this index, discouraging polarized outcomes in which one bus is fully served while another is hardly served. Verification on the IEEE 14-bus and 30-bus systems under scenarios with ten disconnected lines compares the proposed agent against a standard Q-learning baseline without fairness, using total restored energy and the fairness index as metrics. Results show consistently higher fairness throughout the restoration trajectory with negligible change in total restored energy, demonstrating a tunable efficiency–equity trade-off."

To cast the tracking problem into a standard MPC scheme, the spatial reference trajectory is lifted to the full state according to the robot kinematics, which facilitates the subsequent controller design. Considering that safety must be guaranteed in a cluttered, confined workspace, a discrete-time control barrier function (CBF) is introduced to define a controlled safe set with respect to internal components and obstacles, and the resulting CBF inequality is embedded in the MPC optimization. Simulation studies on two scenarios demonstrate precise tracking, consistent positive clearance, and automatic return to the nominal path after avoidance, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed CBF-MPC method."

Purely economic schedules can treat the grid stability, while isolated dynamic real-time control fails to influence planning stage decisions. This paper develops a unified, closed-loop optimization framework that couples static planning indicators with dynamic performance metrics via a digital twin simulation process. Three cases are compared to illustrate the necessity of static-dynamic coupled indicators and the closed-loop optimization. Results show that static coupling reduces grid-impact by 82 % and at a 2.3 % cost premium, while closed-loop coupling further reduces impact by 2 % and reduces frequency recovery time, all with neutral or reduced cost. The proposed methodology delivers Pareto-optimal schedules that balance economic efficiency and real-time stability under realistically simulated operating conditions."

These approaches are evaluated to estimate key lightning-related metrics such as overvoltages, critical current, backflashover rate, and surge arrester energy. Time-domain simulations under representative soil conditions show that the EHEM based on propagation constant equivalent best balances accuracy and computational efficiency."

    "abstract": "Industrial Control Systems (ICS) increasingly face sophisticated cyber attacks that individual facilities cannot detect in isolation. While collaborative anomaly detection could significantly improve threat identification, it requires sharing sensitive operational data between potentially competing organizations, raising privacy concerns. Moreover, ICS operate under strict real-time constraints where traditional privacy-preserving mechanisms introduce unacceptable latency. This paper presents an adaptive aggregation framework that dynamically balances privacy and detection latency based on operational context and threat levels. Our key insight is that privacy-performance trade-offs need not be static; by adapting parameters to current conditions, we achieve both strong privacy during normal operations and rapid detection during critical threats. Our work shows that adaptive mechanisms can transcend traditional privacy-performance trade-offs, enabling secure collaboration among industrial competitors while maintaining operational confidentiality and real-time requirements essential for critical infrastructure protection. The work presented here represents a crucial step toward practical, privacy-preserving collaborative security for critical infrastructure, demonstrating that the traditional trade-off between privacy and performance can be effectively managed through intelligent, context-aware adaptation."

By constructing a delay-energy joint optimisation model with a fusion topology structure, the problem is formalised as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, and an efficient decomposition algorithm is designed for solution.

Subsequently, by equivalently transforming the control structure of the active power loop and incorporating a proportional feedforward term, a control effect analogous to differential feedforward is achieved. This method enhances the system stability margin and mitigates active power oscillations under various grid strength conditions. Finally, experimental results validate the correctness of the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Distributed control has been widely applied in fields such as energy and aviation sector, and with its advantage of aggregating resources to form autonomous regions, it has evolved into a critical control technology. However, its open communication architecture exposes the distributed control system to false data injection attacks (FDIA) through multiple paths, including communication links, sensors, and controllers, leading to potential system oscillations. Therefore, there is an urgent need to detect cyber-attacks from multiple paths. To address this issue, this paper first establishes a distributed control framework for energy system, with modeling of three types of attack paths. Consequently, a reconstruction-based method is presented to identify FDIA through time-frequency masking autoencoders (TFMAE) technology. Finally, the effectiveness of detection is validated by the case studies in a simulated distributed control system, demonstrating that the detector can detect dynamic FDIA events across multiple attack paths and achieve over 95.2% precision."

However, degraded observation quality makes the ambiguity resolution become more time-consuming, which is particularly problematic for the unmanned platforms with limited computational resources. To address this problem, we design a network RTD positioning algorithm based on the virtual reference station (VRS) technology. Specifically, the pseudorange measurements from multiple base stations are employed to generate observations to a VRS located near the rover. These virtual measurements are then transmitted to rover for RTD positioning. Static data and kinematic data are used to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm. The static test shows that positioning accuracy of the Network RTD is slightly superior to that of the normal RTD, but marginally inferior to that of the RTK float solutions. However, the average consumption time for per Network RTD solution ( about 2.6 milliseconds) is about 57.4% lower than that of the RTK solution (about 6.1 milliseconds). The kinematic test demonstrates that the proposed Network RTD achieves decimeter-level accuracy in dynamic environments."

This paper develops mathematical models for the three devices and analyzes their performance in inertia response, fault ride-through, and sub-synchronous oscillation suppression. Simulation results show that both GFM SVG and STATCOM can effectively suppress sub-synchronous oscillations. However, GFM SVG, constrained by limited DC-side energy storage, have limited inertia response, while synchronous condensers with supercapacitors provide better low-latency inertia response and instantaneous voltage support."

    "abstract": "The proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced unprecedented challenges in discerning synthetic visual content from authentic imagery, raising critical concerns in domains such as education, digital journalism, and media forensics. This study proposes M-GenCheck, a web-based, real-time image authenticity detection system employing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify portrait images as either AI-generated or camera-captured. The model was trained on a balanced and diverse dataset comprising 2,000 images sourced from state-of-the-art generative models (e.g., MidJourney, Stable Diffusion) and publicly available real-image datasets, including PIQ2023 and student-contributed M-Stock photographs. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted using both algorithmic benchmarks and a human perception study involving 177 participants. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms human evaluators in accuracy, achieving 90.0% on the training set and 80.0% on unseen images. Moreover, the system was deployed via a Streamlit-based web interface to facilitate real-time public usage. Analysis of misclassified samples reveals the inherent challenges in detecting high-fidelity synthetic content, underscoring the necessity for continual refinement. The findings affirm the system’s efficacy and highlight the growing disparity between human perception and machine-based forensic capability in AI-era media contexts."

    "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of medical images is crucial for quantitative analysis and treatment planning. Although U-Net and its attention-enhanced variants have achieved strong results, they often do not fully exploit multi-scale contextual information and still rely on static convolutional kernels, which limits adaptability to complex and deformable anatomy. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Scale Dynamic Attention U-Net (MSDA-UNet). At critical skip connections, we insert Multi-Scale Dynamic Attention (MSDA) modules, each comprising: (i) a dynamic convolution branch that generates multiple sets of kernels and adaptively fuses them based on global feature statistics; and (ii) a lightweight channel attention branch jointly with a spatially adaptive dynamic convolution branch, providing channel-spatial feature recalibration of the fused features. Injecting MSDA modules at both shallow and deep encoder stages enables MSDA-UNet to capture local details and global semantics across scales, thereby improving feature discriminability and boundary precision. On the Synapse multi-organ benchmark, MSDA-UNet improves Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) by 8.60% and reduces Hausdorff Distance (HD) by 4.86mm over the baseline U-Net while maintaining comparable complexity, validating the effectiveness and practical utility of the proposed method."

This review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest techniques employed in spacecraft pose estimation, highlighting both cooperative and non-cooperative scenarios. We discuss a range of algorithmic approaches and sensor technologies, focusing on electro-optic sensors that meet the power and size limitations of modern satellites. The paper further explores the integration of Deep Learning (DL) methodologies, which are gaining traction due to their potential to enhance pose estimation precision. However, significant hurdles remain, including high computational demands and the challenges of transferring learning from synthetic datasets to real-world applications. The paper also emphasizes significant obstacles in determining spacecraft orientation, including variable illumination conditions, computational limitations, and restricted available data. Through an evaluation of current methodologies and the identification of areas necessitating further investigation, this survey aims to advance the development of more robust, efficient, and reliable autonomous navigation systems for future space missions. This research supports SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) by advancing autonomous navigation technologies for safer and more efficient space operations. Enhanced spacecraft pose estimation facilitates responsible space sustainability (SDG 12) through enabling satellite life extension and debris mitigation, and contributes to SDG 13 (Climate Action) by improving precision in satellite-based Earth observation and environmental monitoring."

    "abstract": "Dual-stator axial flux permanent magnet (DS-AFPM) machines with fractional-slot concentrated windings (FSCW) have attracted considerable attention owing to their high power density. Nevertheless, the abundant harmonic content of the stator magnetomotive force (MMF) leads to severe rotor eddy current losses. To address this issue, this study analyzes the stator MMF under various pole-slot combinations and employs an equivalent current-sheet model to identify the harmonics that dominate rotor losses. A selective space harmonics suppression method is then proposed by introducing mechanical angular offsets between the two stators. The optimal offset angle, determined by the pole-slot combinations, effectively suppresses the dominant loss-inducing harmonics while preserving the working harmonic. Furthermore, the overall performance of a 24-slot/20-pole DS-AFPM machine with and without stator offset is compared, including back electromotive force (EMF), torque, and rotor eddy current losses. Finally, temperature field analysis and prototype experiments confirm that the proposed method substantially reduces rotor eddy current losses without degrading electromagnetic performance."

This review aims to summarize recent developments in perceptive legged robot locomotion and identify potential future research directions. Specifically, we restrict our scope to studies employing learning-based techniques. We examine two primary topics: 1) the applications and capabilities afforded by perceptive locomotion and 2) the methodologies for integrating perception into locomotion systems. We survey the characteristics, progress, and challenges associated with each application and methodology as well as the decisions involved. Finally, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current challenges and potential future research perspectives in perceptive legged robot locomotion."

    "abstract": "The design of asphalt mixtures for pavements requires careful selection and evaluation of the stone aggregates that make up most of the mixture. The properties of the aggregates, such as particle size distribution, angularity, particle shape, wear resistance and cleanliness, significantly influence the performance and durability of the asphalt layer. This research focused on evaluating and comparing the granulometric requirements of stone aggregates in the Marshall and Superpave methods for the design of asphalt mixtures, using coarse and fine aggregates from the Howard quarry, located in Panama, evaluating their properties. The specifications and granulometric control criteria established in each method were analyzed, according to the current regulations of the Ministry of Public Works, with the objective of identifying the differences in the granulometry requirements for the aggregates between both methods. The results showed that the fine aggregates satisfactorily met the requirements of both methods. However, the percentage of flat and elongated particles in the coarse aggregates did not meet the stricter requirement of a maximum of 10 % for the Superpave method, although it did meet the maximum 25 % for the Marshall method. This suggests that the Marshall method could be more viable for designing asphalt mixtures with these materials, since it evaluates the combination of aggregates in a more general way. However, the final selection of the method should consider other factors such as expected traffic, climatic conditions and local regulations"

The tool enables exploration of artists, genres, and influences through linked visual components. It supports tracing collaborations, stylistic evolution, and the genre’s cultural diffusion over time. We found that Sailor Shift is rarely co-performing, but inspired many other artists with her songs and albums to create their own music. The genre of Oceanus Folk rose rather intermittent than gradually while influencing different genres like Desert Rock, Dream Pop and Indie Folk and artists like Min He and Xia Cui as well as taking inspirations from Alternative Rock, Desert Rock and Dream Pop. We visualized the careers of Filippo Pelli, Kimberly Snyders and Zacharie Martins and predicted Beatrice Albright, Daniel O’Connell, and Genevieve Bell to be the next rising stars based on our prediction tool."

    "abstract": "We consider a distributed multiple-input multiple-output (D-MIMO) testbed in which, to enable coherent-phase transmission without over-the-air synchronization, the remote radio heads (RRHs) are connected to a central unit (CU) via a 1-bit radio-over-fiber fronthaul. Specifically, 1-bit samples of the radio frequency (RF) signal are exchanged over the fronthaul. We investigate via both measurements and simulations based on an accurate model of the testbed hardware, the capability of the proposed architecture to provide uniform quality of services over the coverage area—one of the promises of D-MIMO. Our results are encouraging: for the case in which two user equipments (UEs) communicate over the same 75-MHz signal bandwidth, the measured error-vector magnitude (EVM) meets the 3GPP New Radio specification of 12.5% for 16 QAM across all tested D-MIMO scenarios. We also determine that uplink transmission is a potential bottleneck, due to the limited dynamic range of the automatic gain controller, which prevents the 1-bit quantizer to benefit from dithering. We show that this issue can be mitigated via UE power control."

    "abstract": "Judicious resource allocation can effectively enhance federated learning (FL) training performance in wireless networks by addressing both system and statistical heterogeneity. However, existing strategies typically rely on block fading assumptions, which overlook rapid channel fluctuations within each round of FL gradient uploading, leading to a degradation in FL training performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a small-scale-fading-aware resource allocation strategy using a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. Specifically, we establish a one-step convergence bound of the FL algorithm and formulate the resource allocation problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP), which is subsequently solved using the QMIX algorithm. In our framework, each client serves as an agent that dynamically determines spectrum and power allocations within each coherence time slot, based on local observations and a reward derived from the convergence analysis. The MARL setting reduces the dimensionality of the action space and facilitates decentralized decision-making, enhancing the scalability and practicality of the solution. Experimental results demonstrate that our QMIX-based resource allocation strategy significantly outperforms baseline methods across various degrees of statistical heterogeneity. Additionally, ablation studies validate the critical importance of incorporating small-scale fading dynamics, highlighting its role in optimizing FL performance."

    "abstract": "The increasing penetration of renewable generation in power systems poses a significant challenge due to its strong uncertainty. Satisfying security under any realization of the uncertainty may be cost prohibitive. Accordingly, we propose a chance-constrained approach to AC security-constrained optimal power flow (AC-SCOPF) under uncertainty. This chance constrained optimization (CCOPT) problem aims to simultaneously satisfy the operation constraints for all N-1 contingencies with a user-defined confidence level (e.g. 95%). The large-scale nonlinear CCOPT problem is solved by the recently developed inner-outer approximation algorithm which iterates between the solution of two nonlinear programming (NLP) problems, the inner and the outer approximations of the original problem. The algorithm guarantees tractability for solving nonlinear CCOPT problems under non-Gaussian distributed uncertainties. A 5- bus power system and the 60- bus Nordic system with uncertain wind power penetration are used to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach."

The work presented in this paper was aimed at studying the effect of long-term exposure of high-levels of ambient humidity on the triboelectric charging of DBD treated granular plastics. The experiments were carried out on four types of polymers, ABS, PP, PE and PS, with an average particle size between 4 mm and 6 mm. To study the effects of relative humidity of ambient air, the granules were stored for 72 h in a climatic chamber, disposing of simultaneous humidity and temperature control. The relative humidity was regulated at 82% ± 4%, for a temperature of 19°C ± 1°C. The water content of “humid” granules was measured with a thermal-balance and compared with that of “normal” granules, kept at ambient humidity (46% to 52%), at a temperature of 18°C ± 1°C. The “humid” and “normal” granules were successively exposed to a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) for 60 s in a custom-designed reactor then charged by triboelectric effect in a multi-cylinder triboelectric device. As expected, the DBD treatment modified the triboelectric behavior of each polymer. The experiments showed that the charge/mass effect of this treatment is different on “humid” and “normal” particles. The study points out the importance of providing appropriate storage conditions (i.e., humidity levels lower than 70%) for the plastic wastes processed by tribo-electrostatic techniques."

    "abstract": "Consumer-grade agricultural UAV systems are increasingly adopted for crop monitoring, yet their perception systems remain highly vulnerable to AI-enabled attacks and short-term environmental disturbances. To address this, we propose MTCF-TaGN, an adversarial defense framework that leverages a short-term multi-modal temporal dataset synchronized across RGB, multi-spectral, and thermal infrared sequences. The proposed MTCF-Net captures temporal dependencies and adaptively fuses multi-modal features to mitigate the effects of wind, illumination, and occlusion. To evaluate robustness, the TaGN module generates digital, physical, and cross-modal adversarial samples, while the PANDA module employs reinforcement learning for both real-time adversarial detection and filtering. Experiments demonstrate that MTCF-TaGN improves detection robustness by achieving 12.4% higher mAP and 15.7% lower false positives under strong adversarial conditions, with inference latency below 80 ms, which makes it suitable for real-time UAV deployment. This work highlights a practical solution to enhance both accuracy and security resilience in agricultural UAVs, and more broadly, provide insights into securing multi-modal consumer devices against adversarial threats."

HAARs have the abilities of aerial flight, hydrofoil planing, and underwater travel. However, the complex hydrodynamic characteristics and time-varying environmental disturbances during hydrofoil planing result in significant model uncertainties and external disturbances in the system. In this article, an error-oriented active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) approach is proposed. This method takes the real-time error as the state variable to estimate and compensate for both internal and external disturbances of the system. Considering that the past data of the control system can characterize the time-varying model of the closed-loop system, a time-series compensation mechanism is added to the error-oriented ADRC to further enhance the disturbance suppression ability of the controller and improve the performance of the system. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through comparative simulation and experimental results."

This paper proposes a joint resource allocation framework that integrates time-slot allocation and relay assignment to serve semantic- and delay-sensitive users simultaneously. The formulated problem is hard to solve optimally. We develop a Joint Matching, Time Slot, and Relay Allocation Algorithm (JMTRA) that combines stable matching, knapsack-based scheduling, and linear-programming-based relay selection to find a suboptimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach improves semantic performance while meeting delay constraints."

    "abstract": "Load modeling plays a crucial role in the safety and stability analysis of power systems as well as accurate simulation calculations. Grid-forming energy storage, as an important active and reactive power source in distribution networks, has not been considered in the load models of traditional systems due to the large number of grid-forming energy storage units. As a result, these traditional load models can no longer accurately represent the dynamic characteristics of load areas with clusters of grid-forming energy storage. This paper investigates the working mechanism and interaction mechanism of grid-forming energy storage clusters on the load side, and proposes a generalized load integration equivalent modeling method that accounts for grid-forming energy storage. This method adds a grid-forming energy storage model to the comprehensive load model of the distribution network and introduces a dynamic equivalent method that considers grid-forming energy storage, achieving precise simulation of the external characteristics of load-supplying areas for grid-forming energy storage. This provides strong technical support for accurate simulation calculations, analysis, and decision-making in new power systems."

    "abstract": "Subtitles play a critical role in improving information accessibility for individuals with hearing impairments. However, conventional Thai subtitles are often ineffective for Thai Sign Language (TSL) users due to the absence of explicit word boundaries in Thai text and significant grammatical differences between Thai and TSL. To address this issue, this study proposes a real-time Thai subtitle generation system that integrates automatic speech recognition (ASR) with natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The system processes audio input using a pre-trained Whisper-based model optimized with the Mozilla Common Voice dataset, achieving a practical word error rate (WER) of approximately 10 – 15%. Transcribed text is segmented using PyThaiNLP with a custom dictionary, and further transformed through syntactic reordering and lexical simplification guided by TSL instructional materials. Interactive rendering features, including word-level highlighting, image-based visual aids, and a history log, were implemented in a Flutter-based frontend to enhance comprehension and word retention. The system was evaluated with 28 deaf participants affiliated with Ratchasuda College, of whom 26 completed the post-use evaluation. Quantitative results showed consistently high ratings across all five evaluation items (mean scores between 4.27 and 4.73), with \"convenience of use\" rated the highest and \"subtitle speed\" receiving the lowest but still high scores. Qualitative feedback highlighted six themes: the benefits of highlighting and visual aids, the necessity of word segmentation, the demand for real-world deployment, the educational value of grammar learning, challenges with complex vocabulary, and overall positive impressions. These findings confirm that the proposed system is both practical and educational, with strong potential to reduce communication barriers and promote inclusive, real-time communication for deaf individuals in the Thai language context."

We propose a hybrid method that combines sparse covariance estimation with MUSIC (Multiple Signal Classification) on Uniform Circular (UCA) and Uniform Semi-Circular Arrays (USemiCA), enabling reliable azimuth estimation with limited data. Sparse covariance regularization and grid-less spectrum recovery is injected before the classical subspace decomposition step, enabling reliable estimation with as few snapshots and low SNR. The proposed method that combines CS-MUSIC with USemiCA offers significant advantages over traditional DOA estimation methods, including improved resolution, robustness to noise, reduced snapshot requirements, and cost-effectiveness. These findings recommend USemiCA for constrained field of view platforms such as façade-mounted 5G cells, bow-mounted ship radars and border-surveillance nodes. The proposed methods performance is improved across Monte-Carlo sweeps showing that USemiCA + CS-MUSIC attains RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) improvements, reduction in number of snapshots and a low SNR regime."

This paper proposes a visual information enhanced SLAM system based on image repair algorithms, aiming to effectively restore the missing information in the images acquired by the visual sensors of autonomous vehicles, thereby enhancing the robustness of the system. By using algorithms based on image tensor decomposition and repair, this system can accurately restore missing image information in the presence of a high proportion of pixel defects, ensuring the clarity and integrity of the image. The system integrates image repair algorithms into the front end of the visual SLAM system, significantly enhancing the robustness of feature point extraction and matching. Optimizing the loop detection mechanism improves the success rate and accuracy of historical image processing, effectively suppresses position drift, and ensures the long-term robustness of the system. Experimental results show that the Visual Information Enhancement Robust SLAM System (VIE-ROSLAM) system can maintain excellent positioning accuracy and robustness when dealing with pixel defect coverage of different gradients, which is significantly better than other existing visual SLAM systems. The VIE-ROSLAM provides an effective solution to the problem of missing image information encountered in practical applications."

However, existing optimization methods typically rely on day-ahead data and scheduling to address operational uncertainties, which limits their responsiveness to real-time system dynamics and individual-level decisions. This paper proposes a machine learning-based framework trained on historical optimal scheduling decisions under various scenarios to approximate co-optimized outcomes in real time. Specifically, the model predicts whether an EV owner’s submitted offer for discharging back to the grid—defined by energy quantity and price—will be accepted based on current system conditions such as demand, generation availability, and market prices. If the offer is accepted, the model also estimates the financial benefit to the EV owner. The framework employs algorithms including random forest, logistic regression, and linear regression, and is benchmarked against a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model. Results demonstrate high predictive accuracy, showing that the proposed method effectively supports real-time decision-making for both grid operators and EV owners, enabling scalable and economically attractive V2G participation."

The fading model represents a wide range of propagation scenarios while capturing the inherent spatial correlation of RIS. With the statistical characteristics of the corresponding distributions and the properties of the 2-D Laplace transform, we obtain the mean value and variance of the composite channel distribution. Building upon these results, we obtain a closed form expression for the outage probability and an integral expression for the ergodic capacity using a moment-matching approach. The integral form expression for the ergodic capacity is subsequently transformed into a closed form expression via the Gaussian Chebyshev quadrature (GCQ) method. Simulation results validate the theoretical analysis and illustrate the performance degradation due to channel correlation. The study highlights the importance of accounting for spatial correlation when designing RIS-assisted communication systems."

This paper proposes a lightning suppression arrester incorporating a repetitive damping mechanism. By integrating the nonlinear behavior of MOVs with hybrid damping mechanisms—including inductive damping and thyristor-based damping—the arrester effectively suppresses both the steepness and magnitude of lightning impulse currents, thereby significantly mitigating the risk of lightning-induced damage to transmission lines. Experimental validation demonstrates the arrester's response characteristics under various lightning strike conditions.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we compare interpolation approaches to predict the peaks of an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal that is widely employed in modern telecommunication systems. Unfortunately, OFDM systems suffer from a high dynamic range of the radio signal, resulting in a low efficiency of the high-power amplifier (HPA). Thus, to minimize the range, signal peaks can either be reduced in the baseband using digital processing or in the radio frequency using analog circuitry. The digital one is much cheaper, but some peaks may be missed and still appear on the HPA input. To find all peaks, one needs to increase the sampling rate for the baseband processing, which increases the cost of the peak cancellation. Since for peak reduction we only need the peaks instead of the entire digital signal, one can replace the upsampling by an interpolation to calculate peak positions and amplitudes, resulting in cost savings. We demonstrate that the parabolic interpolation with double thresholding is the best choice among the tested methods."

Balimall.id, a local e-commerce platform that supports the digitalization of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), has been considered. However, since its launch, no systematic evaluation has been conducted to measure the platform's level of conformity to user expectations and determine service aspects that require improvement. This study adopted a quantitative approach using the Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) and Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) methods. These methods aim to measure overall user satisfaction and map service attributes that require priority improvement. The primary motivation of this study is to optimize Balimall.id based on real-life user experiences and field needs. This study's contribution lies in providing a data-driven evaluation framework capable of identifying the platform's strengths and weaknesses. Based on questionnaire responses from 390 users, the CSI score indicated a satisfaction level of 85.3%, indicating a high level of satisfaction. However, the IPA results indicated significant performance gaps in attributes such as ease of use (Q1), search speed (Q5), system stability (Q17–Q18), and data accessibility (Q21) that require immediate improvement. Meanwhile, the key strengths identified in Quadrant II include an attractive interface (Q3), accurate information (Q6), and ease of access (Q16). These findings can be used as a basis for planning sustainable system development tailored to future user needs. The evaluation results can also be further developed through the integration of machine learning-based predictive models and the development of a real-time monitoring service dashboard to support adaptive and continuous system improvements."

It highlights the critical role of governance structures that involve not only IT, but also senior management, to protect both the organization and its digital value chain. The review uses the Automatic Literature Mapping Selection method, supported by machine-learning-based decision trees and complementary metrics such as the Scientific Significance Score (SSS) and the Time-Adjusted Publication Score (TAPS), which prioritize journal quality, scientific impact, and recency. The results expose persistent gaps. A key issue is the weak integration between corporate strategy and cybersecurity initiatives, which undermines the implementation of effective security measures. Another problem is the lack of clear, standardized metrics to assess cybersecurity effectiveness, as many organizations still rely on superficial indicators, often limited to the number of reported incidents. The review also finds a scarcity of empirical studies evaluating the return on cybersecurity investments and the real effectiveness of adopted tools. Finally, the rapid evolution of technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) creates new security challenges that demand more adaptive governance frameworks; however, the literature still offers few practical approaches capable of addressing the specific risks introduced by these innovations."

    "abstract": "In recent years, system power shortage due to extreme weather has gradually increased in high percentage of new energy power systems, and it is imperative to strengthen the power system resilience. The concept and calculation method of main grid flexibility are proposed based on the concept of flexibility in distribution networks. The demandside and supply-side flexibility quantitative models are constructed, and the flexibility regulation capability of pumped storage is modeled. The enhancement assessment model of pumped storage for power system resilience is established. The model was validated and analyzed based on an example analysis system. The results demonstrate that pumped storage has a certain enhancement effect on system resilience, and to a certain extent, it can reduce the load shortage level of the system under extreme weather."

By employing smart sensors connected through a network, it is possible to continuously monitor these devices and perform predictive maintenance based on their condition, thereby minimizing the risk of equipment breakdown. This paper presents the development of an IoT-based system designed for a hydroelectric power plant, composed of two main components: a smart sensor for detecting mechanical faults in a motor through vibration analysis, and a smart sensor for estimating the water level in a reservoir. A vibrometer and an ultrasonic level sensor are employed for these tasks. The acquired data are transmitted via LoRa to the control unit. The system was successfully implemented, and the data are transmitted through LoRaWAN to the platform The Things Network."

    "abstract": "In the field of music information retrieval (MIR), automatically identifying musical instruments in complex, multi-instrumental tracks has become an important job. This makes it possible for advanced uses like automated music labelling, audio indexing, and smart recommendation systems. But standard methods often have trouble with background noise, overlapped tones, and changes in how loud an instrument is playing within multiple audio signals. This research suggests a deep convolutional audio classifier (DCAC) system that can correctly identify multiple instruments from raw audio sources at the same time. A lot of tests were done on standard datasets like IRMAS and MedleyDB, showing that the suggested model is better than traditional machine learning baselines and previous deep learning architectures. Average accuracy, memory, and F1scores all got a lot better with the DCAC framework, especially in difficult multiple situations. Also, ablation tests proved that spectrum enhancement and depth-wise convolutional layers work well at improving generalisation across a wide range of audio styles and recording conditions. The results show that deep neural models could help improve automatic instrument recognition and make it easier to connect them to real-time music apps and smart audio recording tools in the future. This study adds a scalable and reliable answer to a hard MIR problem. It gives audio engineers, musicologists, and people who are making the next generation of music technology systems useful information."

    "abstract": "The integration of microgrids into the main electric grid requires precise synchronization to guarantee system stability and safety. This work proposes a hierarchical distributed control strategy based on multi-agent systems to achieve seamless synchronization of an islanded microgrid with the main grid. A synchronization agent (SA), located at the Point of Common Coupling (PCC), performs real-time voltage measurements of both the microgrid and the main grid, transmitting this data via a communication link to the master inverter. Based on the information received, the master inverter adjusts its voltage reference and sends updated droop parameters to a follower inverter. The proposed method was validated through PSIM simulations, which confirmed accurate alignment of voltage magnitude, frequency, and phase under ideal conditions, as well as under communication delays, significant load disturbances, and a loss of communication event. The results demonstrate a smooth and secure transition, compliant with established grid interconnection requirements."

These tests provide valuable insights into the dielectric behavior of transformers under high-voltage stress conditions. This study focuses on the comparative analysis of impulse test records obtained from different power and instrument transformers, specifically examining variations in voltage and current waveforms using time and frequency-domain methodologies. The study employs advanced signal processing techniques—like Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), wavelet decomposition, and coherence analysis—to detect potential discrepancies. A detailed analysis of case studies is presented, applying numerical metrics to quantify significant and non-significant differences in test results, enhancing diagnostic precision and minimizing subjectivity in waveform evaluation. Furthermore, the software output results are compared with visual observations, demonstrating that it is possible to achieve the same decision-making outcomes based on visual inspections as the international standards currently demand. The findings emphasize the need for objective, quantifiable assessment criteria in test approval procedures, reducing the reliance on subjective expert evaluations and promoting a more standardized methodology for transformer diagnostics. Additionally, numerical methods, metrics, and statistical parameters are foundational for future advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence applications, enabling more sophisticated and automated diagnostic solutions."

Data sets for the sugarcane crop are also not available publicly. For this, a new approach is applied in this article to increase the dataset of dense and sparse vegetation of the Napane region. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of the Napane region was used using Sentinel-2 maps with ground truth data to identify dense and sparse vegetation in the spectral bands. The proposed Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with batch normalization generated 10000 more images for dense and sparse, respectively, by stabilizing the training process and reducing gradient vanishing. After applying the CNN model to the generated images, a 95.63 % accuracy rate is achieved. The categorization of dense and sparse vegetation helps farmers monitor the growth of sugarcane crops that leads to sustainable agriculture."

Manual methods of combating pests have shown limited success, prompting the need for more modern, innovative approaches. This paper presents the use of AI and IoT for pest control. The developed prototype employs AI to analyse images captured by a camera. The analysis focuses on detecting and identifying pests, which then triggers the irrigation process for the specific pesticide required. The prototype has been developed using the Design Science Research Methodology. The prototype was implemented on a Raspberry Pi with a camera and a water pump. The camera continuously captures images, which are processed by a Machine Learning model tasked with detecting and identifying pests. Once a pest is identified, the water pump is then activated to spray the appropriate pesticide based on the identified pest. The study's results demonstrate the potential for controlling pests using AI and IoT, as the prototype was able to efficiently identify pests and trigger the spraying of the pesticide. Future work will examine the full implementation of a prototype in a crop field, with additional functionality such as weather monitoring and predicting future pest infestations based on historical data."

    "abstract": "The goal of Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Object Detection (UDAOD) is to achieve strong detection performance on an unlabeled target domain by training solely on a labeled source domain. UDAOD plays a vital role in maritime unmanned autonomous driving systems by improving the model's ability to generalize under varying environmental conditions and operational scenarios. Relatively few studies have investigated domain adaptation within transformer-based object detection architectures. In this work, we build upon Deformable DETR and propose a Differentiated Spatial-Channel Collaborative Alignment Module (DSCAM) in the encoder. Specifically, two cross-attention layers are parallelized after each multi-scale attention layer in the encoder, where a set of diversified spatial queries and a set of diversified channel queries are used to capture and aggregate domain features at both spatial and channel levels, enabling the encoder to generate more domain-invariant features. Notably, we apply contrastive learning losses on each group of diversified queries to encourage them to focus on different domain specific features. In addition, we propose the Weighted Class Aggregation Module (WCAM) in the decoder. Based on the class predictions from the classification head, all object queries belonging to the same class are aggregated through a weighted summation to form class-specific aggregated tokens. By applying domain discrimination loss on these aggregated tokens, our method enables class-aware instance-level feature alignment, further narrowing the domain gap. Extensive experiments are conducted across three cross domain settings on public datasets including Cityscapes, Foggy Cityscapes, Sim10k, and BDD100k daytime. Both quantitative results and qualitative visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach."

This study examines vegetation spatial clustering and its relationship with Land Surface Temperature (LST) in southern Delhi, India, using Landsat 8 (30 m resolution) satellite data for spring, summer and post-monsoon seasons in 2022. Spatial patterns are analysed using two Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA): Moran’s I for LST spatial autocorrelation Getis-Ord Gi* for vegetation clustering. The results reveal significantly High Moran’s I values for LST (0.96-0.98) indicating strong spatial dependance, across all seasons. The Spatial autoregression using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) corrected for this autocorrelation, resulted in more dispersed residuals. Pearson’s correlation between LST and NDVI-based Gi* scores reveal a moderate negative relationship in March (r = -0.4) and October (r = -0.3), and a weaker one in May (r = -0.12). The findings suggest that clustered vegetation can help mitigate urban heat, while ensuring an even distribution to enhance cooling effects, particularly during summer."

To address this issue, this paper proposes a fast algorithm for internal fault detection in transformers based on the Tellegen Quasi-power theorem. First, a fast calculation method for the virtual power of the transformer fault branch is derived. The magnitude of this virtual power reflects the severity of internal transformer faults. Based on this, a fast fault detection method for transformer internal faults is proposed. Next, a 3D finite element simulation model consistent with the actual transformer is established. By varying the number of shorted turns, the gradual degradation process of inter-turn faults is simulated, and the variation pattern of virtual power is studied. Additionally, the impact of external faults, load fluctuations, and non-fault phases on the calculation results is analyzed, demonstrating the superiority of this method. This approach can detect the transformer winding status within half a cycle, is unaffected by external faults, and can identify the faulted phase, showcasing its broad application potential."

    "abstract": "One of the most damaging effects of lightning strikes is when they involve fuel tanks. There are several ways in which lightning can damage a fuel tank: through direct discharges to the tanks and through indirect effects due to discharges close to the tanks. Direct discharges to fuel tanks can be very dangerous: they can cause perforation of plates; the generation of hot spots inside the plate; the occurrence of arcing due to voltage or current density at dangerous points in the tank. Indirect effects due to discharges close to tanks are equally dangerous, since they can cause dangerous arcing due to potential transfer; due to unconnected upward leaders; due to intense electric fields; due to magnetic fields; in sensors and metal pipes that enter the tanks; due to induced current in the plates; and due to the passage of discharges in a classified environment, which occurs close to the outlets of valves, vents and overflows. This work focuses on the generation of hot spots on the inside of plates used in fuel tanks, both due to the direct impact of a lightning and due to the sparks generated by this discharge reaching a Lightning Protection System (LPS) installed on the tank, and these sparks (incandescent and molten material) reaching plates considered thin (for example, aluminum plates used in geodesic domes) and transmitting heat to the inside of these plates. Carbon steel plates with a nominal thickness of 4,76 mm (3/16\"), 3,18 mm (1/8\") and aluminum plates used in geodesic domes with a nominal thickness of 1.2 mm (5/100\") were studied. Laboratory tests were carried out using direct current pulses to simulate the components of continuing currents (important components of lightning that are responsible for the greatest thermal effects), applying these pulses directly to the plates; directly to the tip of mini rods installed on the plates and also to conductors installed one meter above the plates (simulating an air-termination system), and generating many incandescent sparks that reach the plates, which can generate internal hot spots. The applications were recorded by high-capacity oscillographs (currents, arc voltages etc) and filmed with common cameras and with very high-speed cameras (the tests were filmed at 4200 frames per second) and using a thermal imager to capture the temperatures on the underside of the plates to check for hot spots. This study shows the results of these tests and analyzes the hot spots."

It deeply analyzes the chemical composition of firefighting mixtures and cooling water and their environmental impacts, proposing targeted collection and disposal plans. The research results of this paper not only provide a reference basis for relevant enterprises to formulate wastewater treatment measures within their premises, enhancing their fire emergency response capabilities, but also offer scientific evidence for achieving their low-carbon environmental protection development goals."

    "abstract": "In paralleled silicon carbide (SiC) power semiconductor devices, packaging layout and current sharing have a direct impact on thermal stress distribution and device reliability. This paper proposes a lifetime evaluation method based on packaging layout optimization and the rainflow algorithm for paralleled SiC power modules under realistic operating conditions. A three-phase inverter-permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) coupled simulation model with paralleled chip bridge arms was developed in PLECS, driven by real-world speed-torque profiles to extract junction temperature-time data of each chip. The junction temperature waveforms were then processed in MATLAB using rainflow counting to obtain thermal cycle distributions, and the equivalent lifetime was estimated by combining Miner's cumulative damage theory with a thermal fatigue model. Results show that optimizing the busbar connection and packaging layout, such that the source current path is perpendicular to the parallel direction, effectively reduces transient current imbalance and suppresses junction temperature fluctuations. Under both urban and uphill operating conditions, the optimized module achieved approximately 13% and 12% reduction in cumulative damage, respectively, resulting in a significant extension of the equivalent lifetime. These findings provide theoretical and methodological support for advanced power module packaging design and reliability enhancement."

By using COMSOL Multiphysics software, the output voltages of PVEHs with and without the U-DM are obtained through frequency scanning in the frequency domain, and the dimensional parameters of the U-DM are optimized.

    "abstract": "The efficacy of deep learning (DL) diagnostic systems in medical imaging largely depends on the availability of large-scale high-quality annotated datasets. However, in realworld clinical settings, such datasets are often limited due to factors such as data privacy regulations, the high cost of expert annotation, and the rarity of certain pathological conditions. These issues lead to limited and unbalanced data distributions. To address these challenges, propose a hybrid model that synthesizes medical images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and denoises them with a Gaussian filter. This model operates within a binary classification framework, distinguishing between normal and pneumonia cases, using a curated subset of the Chest X-ray14 dataset. The GAN generates disease-specific synthetic images, which are then filtered using a Gaussian blur to minimize visual artifacts. This process improves the balance and variety of the training dataset, ultimately improving the accuracy and robustness of the classification model. Further, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on the augmented dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed data synthesis pipeline. Key performance indicators, including classification accuracy and reduction in validation loss, demonstrate the robustness of the proposed model, especially in data-scarce and class-imbalanced conditions. Having a classification accuracy of 97 %, the model effectively distinguishes between pneumonia and normal cases. The results confirm the strong sensitivity and specificity of the model, as it accurately identifies true pneumonia cases while minimizing false positives."

The pixel consists of a partially pinned photodiode structure combined with butterfly and dog-bone pixel transistors. The p+ layer from the ‘pinning’ implant, in combination with the shallow trench isolation (STI) structure that is recessed from the photodiode region, prevents the photodiode to collect dark current contributions from TID-induced traps at the Si/SiO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> interface and shields the photodiode from TID-induced positive charges in the SiO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>. The column ADC employs dual sample and hold stages, dual comparators, and dual 10-bit counters, and utilizes only a single-slope conversion cycle. Each comparator performs double sampling to eliminate comparator offset, which is expected to worsen with TID-induced voltage shift and mismatch. Then, digital double sampling (DDS) is performed to obtain the signal subtracted from the reset level of the photodiode. The pixel has a 5µm pitch and the column readout fits in a 10µm pitch, designed in 180nm technology. Preliminary results confirm good performance both in pre-rad condition and after TID above 1MGy and high temperature annealing (HTA)"

Several implementations of the matrix multiplication algorithm have been tested to show how the variability of fault sensitivity is affected. The versions exposed to radiation were those presenting the highest dissimilarities in terms of the following static and dynamic software metrics: initialized and uninitialized required data memory and code, L1 and L2 data cache impact, and execution time. Static and dynamic measures from the generated binary executable were collected and correlated with radiation-induced effects. Results show that cache optimization has a positive impact on fault tolerance, regardless of the selected language, compiler, or runtime. Particularly, Rust implementation emerged as the top-performing version under radiation, surpassing the C versions. Rust exhibited the highest Mean Work To Failure (MWTF) without negatively affecting the cross section. These results suggest Rust as a promising option for implementing fault-tolerant applications."

    "abstract": "To enhance the obstacle avoidance capability of quadrotor UAVs for high-speed dynamic obstacles, this paper proposes a Dynamic Velocity Obstacle-aware Model Predictive Control (DVO-MPC) method. The proposed method integrates trajectory prediction of dynamic obstacles with a velocity obstacle discrimination mechanism to identify potential collision risks in a multi-step prediction horizon in real time, generating the shortest-time avoidance trajectories oriented toward the target velocity direction. A model predictive control strategy is employed to locally optimize both the avoidance and original mission trajectories, while a differential flatness-based controller ensures rapid attitude tracking. This design enhances the overall responsiveness and robustness of the system, enabling agile and reliable obstacle avoidance in complex, dynamic environments. The effectiveness of the proposed DVO-MPC is validated through high-fidelity software-in-the-loop simulations, which demonstrate superior performance in both hovering and flighting scenarios, as well as agile control under high-speed flight conditions. Comparative results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms conventional algorithms.Potential application scenarios include urban search and rescue, low-altitude dynamic traffic, and evasion in special mission environments."

To accomplish the collaborative monitoring tasks, multi-USV systems are required to preserve relative position offsets to the monitoring center while maintaining their geometric centroid at the predefined monitoring center. Meanwhile, each USV system seeks its desired monitoring position, determined by the current operational status and local environmental factors. In this context, an optimal deployment problem is formulated through synthesizing collective monitoring objectives with individual requirements. To address this issue, a novel fully distributed optimization algorithm applicable to digraphs is proposed, which incorporates several key techniques including adaptive gain designs, variable substitution and leader-following gradient estimation. It is rigorously demonstrated that the developed algorithm asymptotically converges to the optimal solution under mild assumptions through Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

    "abstract": "Integrating physical temperature sensors into existing motor designs can be challenging due to structural constraints and the complexity involved in wiring and real-time data acquisition systems. As a result, sensorless thermal estimation techniques offer a more feasible, cost-effective, and scalable alternative for thermal monitoring in electric machines. However, most available LPTN-based methods are highly complex, featuring many thermal nodes, which increases the computational burden and limits their practicality for real-time, embedded implementation. Moreover, existing research often shows significant discrepancies, which frequently exceed 2°C, between estimated and experimentally measured temperatures, that could pose a risk of thermal damage if such models are relied upon for online control. This paper presents the development and validation of a transient low-order lumped parameter thermal network (LPTN) model for sensorless temperature estimation in a squirrel cage induction motor (SCIM) where an equivalent electrical circuit of the motor is utilised to construct a reduced-order thermal model that captures the dominant heat transfer paths within the motor components, including the stator windings, stator core, and rotor. Experimental investigations were performed under no-load and variable-load operating conditions to observe the behaviour of temperature rise over time. These results were then compared against the LPTN simulation outputs. The proposed model demonstrated high accuracy, with the maximum deviation between the estimated and measured temperatures remaining within 1.3°C. The findings confirm that the proposed sensorless LPTN model provides reliable real-time temperature estimation, which is essential for enhancing thermal protection and extending the operational lifespan of induction motors in industrial and automotive applications."

In order to improve the global search ability, planning quality and convergence speed of path planning, this paper proposes a multi-strategy intelligent path planning algorithm (MAGP) combining ant colony optimization (ACO), genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). The algorithm constructs three kinds of sub-ant colony structures with complementary functions, adjusts the ant colony size proportion adaptively by combining the difference of path distribution and fitness variance, and improves the robustness of the algorithm and the diversity of solutions through the phased fusion optimization strategy. A typical 3D mountain disaster environment simulation scene is designed and compared with the traditional ACO, GA and PSO algorithms. The results show that MAGP is superior to traditional methods in path quality, search efficiency and algorithm stability, and can deal with the path planning problem under complex rescue tasks more effectively."

These harmonics are distortions formed due to the switching of MOSFETs, IGBTs or any other power electronic switches in the process of converting DC voltage into AC. Compared to two level inverter MLI produce output voltage which is more closer to sine wave. Good quality output voltage waveforms and high power ratings can be achieved with MLI with less electromagnetic interference, leading to improved efficiency. This paper aims to reduce harmonics by utilizing a multilevel inverter for DC/AC conversion with variable frequency. Voltage control is provided via Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) technique. Diode clamped and Cascaded H-Bridge (CHB) MLI are selected for five level output voltage generation. Also the scope of a Modified Cascaded H-Bridge (MCHB) MLI topology for a IM is studied. Variable Frequency Drives are required to provide variable speed control with increased efficiency and reliability.

While more advanced macroscopic synthesis methods such as auxiliary field and power conformal methods approach unitary reflection efficiency at arbitrary angles, nonlinear optimization of the impedance distribution and curved metasurface profile are required, accordingly.

Ethernet advanced physical layer (Ethernet-APL), a form of Single Pair Ethernet (SPE), enhances data transmission in Ethernet networks, enabling up to 10 Mbit/s over 1000 meters and supporting power delivery over the same two wires. The protection of Ethernet-APL applications sets special signal transmission requirements for SPDs. This paper describes the requirements regarding signal transmission characteristics deriving from Ethernet-APL and relevant tests to evaluate the transmission behaviour are shown. Further the focus is set on a newly developed solution of a failure current-triggered disconnect unit for GDTs mounted on a printed circuit board (PCB) and test procedures to show the performance are discussed. The results presented, provide practical information for the design and qualification-testing of SPDs fulfilling the safety-relevant requirements of the new IEC 61643-21 Ed 2 [1] and further requirements beyond, arising from an incorrect selection or connection of the SPD or even power cross failures."

Unlike most secure state estimation (SSE) studies that focus primarily on improving algorithm execution efficiency, we aim to enhance the resilience of CPS by incorporating proportion side information into the SSE framework. Through a non-singular linear transformation, it demonstrates that the original system, when augmented with proportion side information, can be transformed into an equivalent system characterized by sparse and side information coupling. Building upon this, the reinforced non-convex optimization problem and its convex relaxation optimization problem are formulated for solution, and the sufficient conditions for their equivalence are rigorously derived. Finally, numerical simulations on a diffusion process model validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving the resistance of the system against sparse attacks."

    "abstract": "Multi-link operation in Wi-Fi 7 presents new opportunities as well as challenges, particularly concerning energy efficiency for battery-powered devices. While MLO can boost throughput by utilizing multiple links, it also increases energy consumption. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework to optimize the energy efficiency of the heterogeneous Wi-Fi network, where Multi-Link Devices (MLDs) coexist with legacy single-link devices and use the simultaneous transmit and receive mode with synchronized transmission. We formulate the channel access problem as a multi-agent combinatorial multiarmed bandit problem and design a decentralized learning algorithm based on the combinatorial upper-confidence-bound strategy. Using this framework, we further take a closer look at the performance difference between two MLO modes: diversity and multiplexing. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our framework enables MLDs to autonomously learn energy-efficient transmission strategies that adapt to varying network conditions and in most cases, multiplexing outperforms diversity."

    "abstract": "With the speedy progress of smart passenger vehicle technological, people have higher and higher requirements for the emergency braking performance of intelligent passenger vehicles, and the speed of the booster motor cannot break the limit of rated speed during emergency braking, which may cause problems such as the driver's foot feeling heavy, and thus weaken the braking performance. To this end, we propose an active disturbance rejection controller (ADRC)-based boost motor control strategy to enhance the driving performance and reliability of braking in passenger vehicles. Firstly, the overrun corner weak magnetization control is proposed to expand the rotation velocity range of the booster motor, which helps to enhance the driver's foot comfort during emergency braking. Then, an ADRC controller is then introduced into the velocity loop to provide a faster motor speed reaction and improve the immunity of the booster motor. Finally, the control strategy proposed in this paper was simulated and verified by Matlab/Simulink, and experimentally verified by electric power assisted braking stand, and the results demonstrate that the control strategy of the proposed boost motor can mitigate the problem of heavy driver's foot feeling effectively, and at the same time improve the response speed and anti-interference ability of the motor."

Using the ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III (GEPIII) dataset, we conduct a detailed assessment of the performance of Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Long ShortTerm Memory (LSTM) with Attention, Tabular Transformer and Transformer for Time Series based models. An important achievement is the weighted ensemble model that combines predictions from these different types of architectures. Our end-to-end approach covers everything from data preprocessing, and feature engineering to training strategy optimization. The ensemble model is shown to outperform the individual models and common machine learning methods with a maximum <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{R}^{2}$</tex> score of 0.8927. The enhanced performance is due to the ensemble's capacity to model complex non-linear interactions between various factors, while also reducing the impact of weaknesses in individual models. These findings highlight the importance of all the advanced deep learning to enhance the predictive skill of the energy-related patterns and are expected to bring significant improvements in energy management to better allocate our precious resources, mitigate the operational expense and to reach the global carbon neutrality target."

A total of 5,000 iterations were performed for horizons of 1 to 30 years, allowing the extraction of robust metrics such as MTTF, accumulated downtime, and failure frequency. The results indicated strings and the inverter highlighted as the main sources of unavailability. Soiling presented a typical saturation behavior, reinforcing the importance of periodic cleanings. Finally, the study proposes a preventive maintenance schedule aligned with the stochastic behavior of the components, contributing to prolonging system lifetime and reducing failure-related costs. Future work includes local calibration of the rates and integration of predictive maintenance with learning algorithms."

Traditional detection techniques—such as machine learning and sandboxing—often suffer from high false-positive rates, frequent retraining needs, and limited resilience against evolving threats. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a three-layer adaptive ransomware detection and containment system. The first layer performs real-time file monitoring and extension filtering to optimize resource usage. The second layer integrates SVM-based analysis with an adaptive sandbox that uses randomized user activity, resource mimicry, and human interaction simulation to deceive and trigger ransomware behavior. The third layer incorporates the RTrap framework, leveraging decoy files to trap ransomware that bypasses earlier defenses. Extensive experiments demonstrate a 98.4% detection accuracy with faster response times compared to benchmark systems. This multi-layered architecture provides a scalable, robust, and adaptive defense, effectively mitigating both known and emerging ransomware threats in dynamic environments."

We have identified three properties for faithfully representing Reeb graphs in a visualization: they should be constrained to the boundary, compact, and aligned with the function gradient. Existing algorithms for drawing Reeb graphs are agnostic to or violate these properties. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm to generate Reeb graph visualizations, called GASP, that is cognizant of these properties, thereby producing visualizations that are more representative of the underlying data. To demonstrate the improvements, the resulting Reeb graphs are evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively against the geometric barycenter algorithm, using its implementation available in the Topology ToolKit (TTK), a widely adopted tool for calculating and visualizing Reeb graphs."

Using a pivot translation approach (Indonesian → English → Mandarin and vice versa), the system demonstrated promising results with an average linguistic accuracy of 4.7 out of 5 based on evaluations by two expert validators in the fields of Mandarin language and AI technology. The evaluation also noted fast response times of approximately 0.8 to 1.2 seconds per sentence, as well as the model's ability to run offline and efficiently with a lightweight model size (±150 MB). However, this study has limitations as pedagogical validation has not yet involved students as end-users, so there is no empirical confirmation of the system's impact on learning motivation, student engagement, or improved subject matter understanding. Preliminary analysis of translation errors identified several categories of linguistic errors, such as phonetic, semantic, and syntactic errors, which need to be addressed in further system development. This study provides an important foundation for future research involving direct testing with students to confirm the system's pedagogical validity comprehensively."

Doppler based localization is attracting increasing interest; however, its performance is constrained by a limited frequency resolution, which introduces noise and reduces positioning accuracy. This paper presents a novel Doppler extraction framework that integrates matched filtering, frequency agile filter, and a phase locked loop to mitigate these limitations. The estimated Doppler profile is used to localize a terrestrial network device based on the unique fingerprint captured by multiple satellites. We show that matched filtering and frequency agile filter enhances the frequency resolution, while the phase locked loop refines extracted frequencies by tracking phase deviation over time. The proposed approach is evaluated in a simulated satellite based localization scenario, demonstrating a significant improvement in localization accuracy compared to the Fast Fourier Transform based method. Monte Carlo simulations results show that employing four localization iterations and six satellites can achieve a reliable localization of network devices."

    "abstract": "In recent years, the number of bullying cases has been increasing annually, with the number of \"serious cases\" reaching a record high in fiscal year 2023. One contributing factor to this severity is that bullies often conceal their actions, making it difficult for teachers and others around them to grasp the situation. Against this backdrop, this study proposes a deception detection method that uses speech audio from students suspected of bullying to determine the truthfulness of their statements, with the aim of facilitating early detection of issues and supporting appropriate responses. This method is intended to be used as an auxiliary tool when counseling students who have been identified by the school as showing signs of problems. Its non-contact and non-invasive characteristics minimize the psychological burden on students. In the first stage of this research, we will compare the acoustic features of false and truthful speech to extract effective features and construct a discrimination method. Specifically, we will use an acoustic analysis tool to extract features such as MFCC (0-14th order), logMelFreqBand (0-7th order), and LspFreq (0-7th order) from the audio data and calculate their statistical values (maximum, minimum, etc.). We then perform machine learning using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) on these features to classify the audio as truthful or false. The experimental results showed that RF demonstrated higher classification performance than SVM, suggesting the effectiveness of this method."

Nevertheless, the disjointed measurement frameworks for communication and sensing functionalities pose a critical challenge for evaluating and optimizing ISAC system’s performance. Although the proposal of integrated metrics grounded in mutual information (MI) by related studies, a profound understanding and thorough investigation of entropy remains underexplored in these works. Based on the fundamental principles of Shannon’s information theory, we formulate a theoretical model of sensing performance metric under general channel state scenarios, and explore the relationships between sensing MI and existing sensing metrics in this paper. Specially, we derive a closed-form expression for sensing MI, and propose a numerical method to obtain the sensing entropy. The simulation results show that a distinct one-to-one correspondence is discernible between posterior Cramér-Rao lower bound (PCRLB) and the sensing MI. In addition, we show that the MI is upper bounded by the logarithm of the maximum number of resolvable categories, and the upper bound can be achieved in high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions."

These are less sensitive to the inaccuracy of failure probability, making them more efficient for detecting equipment potential incorrect priority and evaluating their failure risk criticality. The methods include parameters indicating the importance of failure probability uncertainty and the critical failure probability. The methods can be useful in cases where the exact failure probability is unknown, allowing to evaluate its sensitivity to failure risk. In addition, it indicates the threshold in failure probability resulting in critical failure risk. This can be useful to estimate the sensitivity of failure probability inaccuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is illustrated by a numerical case study. The results of the study indicated the method’s capability of detecting the incorrect priority of equipment and can be used for corrective re-ranking. They also pointed out that a relatively small error in failure probability can lead to significant over- or underestimation of failure risk. The proposed methods could be useful tools for utilities and network owners for reducing risk in the power system and avoiding incorrect asset management decisions."

Thus, for the safe and reliable design of an electrically insulated LPS, knowledge on the impulse surface dielectric behavior of insulating stand-offs is of great importance. The present study reports on an experimental investigation of the surface dielectric strength of insulating stand-offs subjected to standard lightning impulse voltages of both polarities. The surface dielectric strength is evaluated in terms of the 50% flashover voltage and flashover voltage-time characteristics. Contrary to that observed for 50% flashover voltage, for overvoltages the surface dielectric strength of the insulating stand-offs is lower under negative than positive impulses. Empirical expressions describing flashover gradienttime characteristics are derived. Also, flashover characteristics are well predicted by the integration method."

    "abstract": "Antagonistic pneumatic muscle (PM)-actuated wrist robots have great potential in rehabilitation and industrial applications. The antagonistic connection of PMs, which mimics the agonist-antagonist muscle pairs in human joints, provides substantial advantages such as improved joint stability and a better balance of torque disturbances. However, PM-actuated robots exhibit complex nonlinearities, such as hysteresis, creep, input delay, and time-varying parameters, while also confronting challenges such as external disturbances and coupling effects. In this paper, a switching non-singular terminal sliding mode control (NTSMC) method with a double-loop fuzzy neural network (DLFNN) is developed. This method enables the antagonistic PM-actuated wrist robots to achieve fast and precise tracking performance. Specifically, the lumped disturbances are estimated online using the DLFNN, which can adaptively adjust the weight of the inner and outer layers, achieving accurate approximation and robustness. Based on the estimated value of disturbances, a switching NTSMC is implemented to ensure that tracking errors converge to the origin within the fixed time. Switching functions guarantee fast convergence when the sliding surface errors are large. Meanwhile, switching functions ensure non-singularity as the sliding surface errors converge to the origin. Furthermore, joint angles and angular velocities are limited within the specific ranges by designing exponential constraint terms as time-varying proportional-differential gains, rather than traditional barrier functions that may induce excessive control inputs. Both detailed stability analysis and experimental validation demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel privacy mask framework for securing network communication processes, specifically applied to consensus tracking. First, an innovative output mask map is presented to achieve time-selective privacy protection for dynamic network location data. The designed mask map overcomes key limitations of existing approaches, such as the inability to assign zero values to masked locations, the restriction of protection only to initial data, and the lack of rapid mask termination mechanisms. Second, the proposed framework is applied to multi-agent adaptive consensus tracking control to ensure the security of agents’ information and the boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop system. To counteract potential tracking performance degradation due to the computational complexity introduced by the privacy mask, prescribed-performance control theory is incorporated. Third, the dynamic surface control technique is used to avoid the derivation of the received encrypted position information, so as to handle the uncertainty originating from the unknown mask map. Ultimately, simulations comparing our framework with existing mask mechanisms highlight its advantages."

    "abstract": "Mid-band frequencies have recently attracted attention as promising sixth-generation (6G) candidates due to their potential to mitigate the instability of sub-terahertz (sub-THz) and millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands. While ongoing studies investigate channel models for this spectrum, they largely focus on individual frequencies across diverse environments. For mobile network operators (MNOs), measurement-based comparative studies that directly evaluate the advantages and limitations of candidate bands under identical deployment scenarios are essential. Obtaining high-resolution channel impulse responses (CIRs) in the mid-band, however, is constrained by limited spectrum availability, and existing approaches often rely on costly, synchronization-dependent equipment, thereby restricting portability and versatility. This paper proposes an asynchronous and portable software-defined radio (SDR)-based channel sounder that employs a Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence to enable direct comparison between frequency range 1 (FR1, 4.55 GHz and 6.55 GHz) and FR3 (7.15 GHz) under identical transceiver conditions. The SDR system was validated through back-to-back calibration, and the verified platform was subsequently used to conduct channel measurement campaigns in both indoor hotspot (InH) and urban microcell (UMi) environments. The measured data were analyzed in terms of path loss and large-scale characteristics, and parameter comparisons with the third generation partnership projects (3GPP) standard were performed to ensure validity. The results of this channel analysis are expected to provide practical insights into frequency band selection for future 6G services."

    "abstract": "With the increasing diversity and complexity of mobile applications, an application typically needs to execute multiple dependent tasks to achieve its functionality. Computation offloading in multi-access edge computing aims to improve user experience, such as reducing makespan and terminal energy consumption, by offloading some tasks to the designated edge server. Task dependencies impose constraints on the execution order of the tasks, which complicates the offloading decisions. Besides, transmission rates exhibit fluctuations in real-world scenarios due to the mobility of users, and they pose new challenges to the problem of dependent task offloading. To minimize the terminal energy consumption under the given deadline, a joint optimization problem of dependent task offloading and local computing resource allocation with time-varying transmission rates is investigated. Since the proposed problem is NP-hard, we decompose it into two subproblems to reduce the complexity and deal with the coupling of decision variables. Specifically, we first solve the subproblem of dependent task offloading by generating special task sets to implement divide and conquer with a fixed local processing speed. Then, we employ Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) method to solve the subproblem of local resource allocation with the offloading solution derived from the first subproblem while ensuring that the makespan constraint is met. The proposed scheme makes dynamic decisions on dependent task offloading and resource allocation according to the fluctuations of transmission rates, and dynamically adjusts the solution accordingly to achieve better performance. Experimental results show that our solution outperforms baseline methods, reducing makespan by 27–31%, terminal energy consumption by 70–77%, while achieving 25–65% higher service success ratio on average."

    "abstract": "Indoor localization in challenging non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environments often leads to poor accuracy with traditional approaches. Deep learning (DL) has been applied to tackle these challenges; however, many DL approaches overlook computational complexity, especially for floating-point operations (FLOPs), making them unsuitable for resource-limited devices. Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) tasks, motivating their use in wireless applications. However, their use in indoor localization remains nascent, and directly applying Transformers for indoor localization can be both computationally intensive and exhibit limitations in accuracy. To address these challenges, in this work, we introduce a novel tokenization approach, referred to as Sensor Snapshot Tokenization (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SST</i>), which preserves variable-specific representations of power delay profile (PDP) and enhances attention mechanisms by effectively capturing multi-variate correlation. Complementing this, we propose a lightweight Swish-Gated Linear Unit-based Transformer (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L-SwiGLU-T</i>) model, designed to reduce computational complexity without compromising localization accuracy. Together, these contributions mitigate the computational burden and dependency on large datasets, making Transformer models more efficient and suitable for resource-constrained scenarios. Experimental results on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SST</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L-SwiGLU-T</i> achieve substantial accuracy and efficiency gains, outperforming larger Transformer and CNN baselines by over 40% while using significantly fewer FLOPs and training samples."

    "abstract": "The frequency-sweeping approach is an important and well-known tool for stability analysis of timedelay systems with commensurate delays. However, when it is used to detect critical imaginary roots (CIRs), the accuracy is regarded to be highly related to the numerical grid for sweeping the frequency axis. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the characterization of CIRs for most reported approaches has not reached a completely algebraic level. In this paper, we introduce a polynomial algebraic tool, the characteristic set, acting as a new perspective for characterizing CIRs. Based on the characteristic set algorithm, we decompose the zeros of the frequency-sweeping conditions that a CIR appears into a finite number of real quasicomponents of triangular sets. The obtained triangular sets are an explicit algebraic expression of CIRs, which can be determined directly without any numerical criteria and conservatism. The proposed method not only overcomes the drawbacks of the frequency-sweeping approach but also provides a procedure for detecting CIRs in a completely algebraic way."

    "abstract": "Overfitting, an issue that constrains the validity and generalizability of machine learning in neuroimaging-based diagnostic-classification, is in part due to small sample sizes in relation to what is required for generalization. Even with data aggregation (such as in Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange or ABIDE), the relatively smaller sample sizes are a result of the fact that it is difficult/expensive to acquire data from clinical populations. With healthy controls, we have comparatively larger samples available. Therefore, we propose to address overfitting by using larger healthy samples (from Human Connectome Project or HCP) to learn the diversity of neural signatures of healthy controls, with the aim of transferring that learning into the context of discriminating autism from healthy controls in ABIDE. Methods: We developed a complete variational autoencoder based transfer learning framework including data oversampling, model pre-training, classifier training and testing, and model explanation. Then, the performance of transfer learning was estimated and visualized. Results: The transfer learning classification model achieved about 7% more accuracy on site-mismatched data than obtained without transfer leaning. Discussion: Overall, we demonstrated the applicability of transfer learning within a deep learning framework for utilizing larger samples of available healthy control data to improve generalizability and accuracy of diagnostic classification in ASD, as well as reduce the harmful effects of inter-site variability on classification. We believe the proposed framework is potentially applicable to other disorders as well."

Accurately predicting 2OM sites is crucial for understanding RNA's biological functions and related pathologies. Traditional detection methods pose challenges such as resource intensiveness, potential RNA sample damage, and high costs. However, recent advancements in machine learning, particularly deep learning techniques, offer rapid and cost-effective prediction solutions. In this study, we introduce DeepR2OM, a novel method integrating feature selection and deep learning for 2OM sites prediction. DeepR2OM encodes sequences using eight RNA descriptors, employs feature selection algorithms to reduce dimensions, and then utilizes a deep learning network for training. After evaluating various deep learning architectures, we selected Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Multi-Head Self-Attention mechanism, and Deep Neural Network (DNN) as our final prediction models. Experimental results demonstrate DeepR2OM's effectiveness, achieving 87.1% accuracy (ACC), 85.5% recall rate (Recall), 87.9% precision (PRE), and a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 75.7% on an independent test set. This tool serves as a valuable resource for exploring the functional and bioinformatic aspects of 2OM sites. To enhance accessibility, we have developed a web server for the prediction of RNA 2'-O-Methylation"

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel cooperative relay-based resource and learning optimization (CRRLO) scheme that extends device connectivity, balances learning contributions, and coordinates communication resources to mitigate the negative impact of intermittent participation on FL performance caused by unreliable communication in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments. After local training, a cooperative aggregation stage is proposed, where fully connected device-to-device (D2D) relaying enables devices with failed device-to-server (D2S) transmissions to still contribute to the global model, while avoiding the transmission burden and relay selection issues associated with single-relay strategies. To further ensure unbiased aggregation, we produce reliability-driven aggregation weights to calibrate each device’s contribution to the global update. We then formulate a joint optimization problem aimed at improving FL convergence rate under communication and resource constraints by co-optimizing blocklength, transmission power, and aggregation weights. An iterative algorithm is designed to determine blocklength bounds, a low-complexity method is developed for power optimization, and a convex relaxation approach is adopted for weight adjustment. These subproblems are alternately solved using a block coordinate descent (BCD) method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CRRLO scheme significantly accelerates convergence and improves test accuracy by up to 24.33% compared to baseline schemes under high transmission error probability."

The antenna element integrates two p-i-n diodes to enable frequency reconfiguration for half-duplex operation: RX mode covers 10.7–12.7 GHz with horizontal polarization (H-pol), and TX mode operates at 13.85–14 GHz with vertical polarization (V-pol). Parasitic patches are incorporated in the RX mode to achieve wideband coverage with a flat gain response. In both modes, the antenna maintains a stable realized gain of approximately 5-6 dBi. Circular polarization is achieved by arranging four linearly polarized elements in a rotational sequence. A 4 × 4 element array prototype was fabricated and tested in an anechoic chamber, demonstrating peak realized gains of 15.8 dBic (RX) and 13.2 dBic (TX), with cross polarization isolation exceeding 20dB. These results indicate the proposed antenna is a promising candidate for compact, reconfigurable user terminals in half duplex satellite communication systems."

In this article, we present a self-tracking far-field WPT system, featuring an innovative time-diversity tracking and charging scheme enabled by a programmable metasurface. During each duty cycle, the metasurface antenna array is first configured to tracking mode to detect the direction of the beacon signal emitted by the IoT target. Next, the metasurface is reconfigured to charging mode, and the WPT power is directionally beamed to the target. By continuously repeating this duty cycle, the programmable metasurface enables effective WPT tracking and charging for both stationary and moving IoT targets. We have successfully implemented the system, and its WPT performance has been evaluated and validated through experiments. This novel WPT scheme offers a promising solution for powering the massive devices in future IoT systems."

    "abstract": "In the open world, visual representations of remote sensing images vary significantly and diversely. A model can correctly recognize and process unknown data in changing and open-ended scenarios only by learning invariant visual representations from the data. Causal diagram models, which describe the data generation process, can employ interventions and counterfactual operations to obtain invariant visual representations in such open environments, i.e., generic causal representations. However, these generic causal diagram models often overlook the multi-feature, multi-confounding, and multi-change characteristics of remote sensing images, as well as the causal differences these factors introduce into the imaging process. This limitation makes it difficult for the learned representations to be widely transferable in open scenes. Specifically, we argue that different objects are influenced by different environments, and the styles they exhibit in remote sensing images consequently vary. Therefore, the causal diagrams corresponding to these objects also differ. Intervening at the object-level causal diagram is crucial for obtaining object-specific causal representations and mitigating the problem of feature confusion.Based on this assumption, we derive the general form of the object-level causal diagram from the generic causal diagram, taking into account the characteristics of remote sensing images with multiple features and multiple confounders. We propose a remote sensing representation learning method, PCIR, which is based on a causal partition intervention strategy. The method consists of two main components: the Causal Partition Intervention (CPI) module and the Causal Representation Separation (CRS) module. 1) CPI module: To simulate the style differences caused by environmental influences on different objects, we propose remote sensing offset data augmentation. We then use target detection labels to identify independent object regions in the image and apply feature-specific data augmentation. 2) CRS module: For the same class, the content remains consistent across different styles; therefore, we propose a symmetric causal regularity learning strategy to bidirectionally constrain and obtain invariant causal representations. We validate our method on four datasets across two tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that PCIR achieves outstanding performance in open-scenario tasks. Compared with seven baseline methods, our method improves overall accuracy (OA) by an average of 1.79% in the scene classification task and increases mean accuracy (mAcc) by up to 3.55% in the semantic segmentation task. Moreover, visualizations of the learned representations show that PCIR enhances the model’s ability to recognize invariant causal representations in complex scenes and improves its robustness."

Real-time ENSO prediction with physics-driven dynamical models suffers from large biases and uncertainties, while deep learning fails to consider time-varying spatial interactions across scales, causing difficulties in addressing the inherent complexity of teleconnections. Despite decades of efforts, predicting ENSO with lead times of more than one year remains challenging. In this study, we propose ENSOFarseer, an innovative deep learning framework that simulates cross-scale spatiotemporal teleconnections underlying ENSO dynamics and enhances long-lead predictability. ENSOFarseer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, providing predictions at lead times of up to 24 months while mitigating the spring predictability barrier. ENSOFarseer accurately reproduces teleconnections by simulating interactions of local-scale feedback and global-scale teleconnections, offering insights into the contributions of various modes to predictions. The intrinsic improvement in long-lead prediction skill stems from the unified fusion of spatial multi-scale collaborative perception and temporal cross-scale dynamical evolution that tackles the inherent multiscale and multiphysics challenges and provides reliable probabilistic predictions by incorporating Bayesian uncertainty quantification. These findings highlight substantial improvements in cross-scale spatiotemporal deep learning in advancing ENSO prediction and deepening our understanding of its dynamics."

Using the results obtained in this work, it is also possible to efficiently construct quasi-cyclic subfield subcodes of elliptic codes. These codes enable a significant reduction in public key size for the McEliece cryptosystem and, consequently, represent promising candidates for integration into post-quantum codebased schemes."

    "abstract": "As integrated electricity-gas systems (IEGSs) become increasingly coupled, dynamic state estimation (DSE) faces challenges due to heterogeneous and temporally misaligned measurements. An interval DSE framework is developed to effectively fuse multi-source data with asynchronous time references. The system dynamics are captured using the Lax-Wendroff difference scheme in conjunction with Holt's exponential smoothing algorithm. Since SCADA measurements lack precise sampling time stamps owing to inherent delays, their actual acquisition times are inferred by calibrating against turbine flowmeter data through Pearson correlation analysis. This process enables the construction of a temporally accurate measurement dataset. Then, the uncertainty introduced by non-simultaneity among measurements is quantified using interval mathematics. To address the challenge of interval overestimation, an improved interval Kalman filter is designed to efficiently solve the interval DSE problem. Case studies demonstrate the method's effectiveness in managing asynchronous multi-source data while maintaining accurate estimation performance."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an adaptive model predictive control (MPC)-based trajectory tracking method for autonomous vehicles (AVs). Unlike the traditional MPC approaches, the prediction horizon of the proposed MPC method is firstly designed to be adaptive to the curvature of the reference trajectory. Based on the fuzzy rules, the control horizon is further set as a combined results of vehicle speed, lateral tracking error and the trajectory curvature. By doing so, both the predictive and control horizons of the proposed MPC are dynamically adjusted to the tracking scenarios resulting in both computational efficiency and enhanced tracking accuracy. To verify the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed control strategy, both MATLAB/Simulink and QCar experiment were conducted to track an S-shape trajectory. The comparative results with typical MPC have shown that the proposed adaptive MPC method can achieve a higher tracking accuracy, especially for lateral tracking. Moreover, the time required for solving at each step is obviously shorter showing the improved real-time performance of the proposed adaptive MPC method."

In this paper, we propose a secure transmission scheme for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided IoV systems with multi-agent reinforcement learning to realize the dual demands of transmission efficiency and security, which adaptively optimizes the working mode and key length of the encryption strategy during the communication process. Specifically, we design a risk-aware dual-network learning architecture that dynamically revises Q-values using long-term risk assessments, balancing rewards and risks to avoid high-risk actions. Furthermore, a short-term risk warning mechanism monitors real-time violations of performance thresholds (e.g., latency, protection level, and attack success rate) to ensure safe policy exploration. Experimental results show that our scheme significantly reduces both latency and attack success rate compared to benchmarks, while simultaneously improving the security level and achieving the global optimization of transmission efficiency and security."

    "abstract": "Cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) is expected to be one of the key technologies in sixth-generation (6G) and beyond wireless communications, offering enhanced spectral efficiency for cell-edge user equipments by employing joint transmission and reception with a large number of antennas distributed throughout the region. However, high-resolution RF chains associated with these antennas significantly increase power consumption. To address this issue, the use of low-resolution analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters (ADCs/DACs) has emerged as a promising approach to balance power efficiency and performance in massive MIMO networks. In this work, we propose a novel quantized precoding algorithm tailored for cell-free massive MIMO systems, where the proposed method dynamically deactivates unnecessary antennas based on the structure of each symbol vector, thereby enhancing energy efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing methods such as squared-infinity norm Douglas-Rachford splitting (SQUID) and regularized zero forcing (RZF), achieving superior performance while effectively reducing power consumption."

This paper proposes a neural network (NN)-based aggregated modeling (NNB-AM ) method for the time-domain simulation of multiple SGs with heterogeneous parameters connected through diverse collector lines to the point of common coupling (PCC). The general NN modeling rule considers the PCC three-phase voltages as inputs, and the SGs’ equivalent three-phase injected currents and the equivalent rotor angle as outputs. The long short-term memory (LSTM) structure is adopted to implement and train the NN model using the dynamic responses generated from offline EMT simulations, which employ the non-aggregated classical full-order qd model of SGs. It is demonstrated that for a multi-SG-infinite-bus system, the proposed NNB-AM accurately captures the equivalent dynamic behavior of SGs while offering greater computational efficiency compared to the non-aggregated model counterpart."

    "abstract": "H. 323 and SIP protocols are session layer protocols needed in the establishment of communication between two entities in Internet Telephony. Most Internet Telephony networks are faced with technical challenges such as delay, jitter, and signal quality, and these are affected by the choice of protocols when building a network. The choice between SIP and H. 323 remains a challenge for network designers and service providers, especially in environments with stringent QoS requirements, such as enterprise communications, teleconferencing, and real-time video/audio services. H. 323 and SIP normally operate in conjunction with other protocols at Transport and Network layers. This paper investigates the performance evaluation of H. 323 and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) used in internet Telephony. The performance of these protocols is evaluated in terms of delay, jitter, MOS with voice and video being the information source between the communication entities. To evaluate the performance of these protocols OPNET simulation tool was used. Results show that the SIP outperforms H. 323 when trafficking voice in terms of MOS By 37% and jitter by 20%. For video trafficking, H. 323 outperforms SIP in terms of traffic received by 60 % and end-to-end delay by 30 %. With these results, SIP is best for voice trafficking while H. 323 is best suited for video transmission within the context of internet traffic."

This paper presents a simulation-based smart beamforming framework using Deep Q-Learning (DQN) tailored for a two-user MIMO B5G environment. Unlike conventional approaches relying on static datasets or single-user optimization, the proposed method learns optimal beam direction selection from a synthetic dataset generated based on varying user positions within a fixed channel condition. The DQN agent receives normalized user positions and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as inputs and selects one of 36 discrete beam angles to maximize beam-user alignment. The training process employs an angular-alignment reward function, experience replay, and an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy. Over 100 episodes, the agent's average reward began at 4.777 in the initial exploration phase, exhibited fluctuations due to exploration-exploitation trade-offs, and achieved peaks above 6.7 during later episodes, reflecting measurable learning progress. These results demonstrate the viability of reinforcement learning for adaptive beam management in B5G MIMO systems and underscore the potential of AI-driven decision-making for next-generation base station design."

While previous methods primarily offer offline, full-body evaluations, this paper presents a novel framework for online human motion modelling and accuracy assessment. Our approach uses covariance matrices to capture full-body motion, with the capability to focus on individual body segments. These matrices are computed continuously during a correct exercising movement and used to create an exemplar Wishart model to characterize dynamic motion of the correct movements. For a query sample performing the same exercise, a second set of Wishart models is generated using online density estimation. We then compare these distributions to the exemplar’s in real-time, using a dissimilarity metric to quantify deviations. This allows the framework to identify incorrect movements and pinpoint specific body segments contributing to poor performance. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves an average AUC-ROC score of 95.2% for full-body quality assessment. It effectively detects real-time movement errors and distinguishes varying levels of deviation for each body segment."

    "abstract": "Power systems are entering the era of high proportions of new energy and power electronic equipment. The interaction between grid background harmonics and grid-connected inverters (GCIs) leads to frequency coupling effect which results in additional frequency components injecting into the power networks. Besides, to prevent direct transmission through the GCIs' bridge arms, the dead time needs to be applied, which introduces irrepressible dead-time low-order harmonics. However, there is limited research on the modeling of harmonic sources based on the frequency coupling effects. Hence, this paper first analyzes the mechanism of asymmetric frequency coupling effects and dead-time effects. Then the transmission process of background harmonic components and dead-time low-order harmonics in sampling delay progress, outer loop, inner loop, phase-locked loop, signal modulation module, and filter of the inverter is deduced. Voltage-controlled coupled harmonic current source models are established considering the frequency coupling effect, suitable for the superposition calculation of background harmonics and dead-time low-order native harmonics, and the harmonic power flow studies of public supply networks. The proposed models are verified by hardware-in-the-loop simulations."

Existing research primarily focuses on traffic scheduling or passive redundant path configuration, which suffers from complex solution spaces and low resource utilization. The proposed method searches for the global optimum load configuration by PageRank algorithm instead of local optimum by some other heuristic algorithm, followed by the next steps: 1) using the average PageRank results of the two endpoints to represent the importance degree of a logical edge; 2) giving the priority to the logical edge with lower importance degree to select its physical path.; and 3) allocating the shortest physical path to the logical edge in its turn to select the path. It is demonstrated that the proposed method improves the survivability and redundancy of the logical network from a given physical network."

Results indicate that more needles increase flashover voltage due to enhanced space charge shielding, while fewer needles generate more intense corona activity. Larger spike clusters resulted in decreased emission. Captured flashover sequences reveal streamer branching and precursor activity, challenging traditional design assumptions. Optimizing spike geometry for lower flashover voltage may enhance lightning strike attraction efficiency, with implications for modern lightning protection systems."

    "abstract": "Recent years, there has been a substantial increase in the utilization of wireless devices, ranging from smartphones to smart home systems, all leveraging the electromagnetic spectrum for diverse purposes. In this context, the 2.45 GHz frequency stands out as one of the most widely employed frequencies with extensive applications. The pervasive presence of 2.45 GHz electromagnetic radiation (EMR), commonly emitted by Wi-Fi devices, raises concerns about its potential impact on skin-resident bacteria, particularly Staphylococcus epidermidis. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of 2.45 GHz EMR exposure on the growth dynamics and antimicrobial resistance profile of S. epidermidis. Culture of S. epidermidis were exposed to 2.45 GHz EMR at different dose of radiation for varying durations 2, 4, 6, and 8 hrs under controlled laboratory conditions, ensuring minimal thermal influence. Post-exposure, bacterial growth was monitored by measuring optical density at 600 nm at regular intervals to assess any deviations in proliferation rates. Additionally, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for a panel of commonly used antibiotics, including amoxicillin, penicillin G, cefuroxime, bacitracin, polymyxin B, neomycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, ofloxacin, and co-trimoxazole were determined by broth microdilution and disc diffusion method to detect any shifts in antimicrobial susceptibility. Results indicated that EMR exposure led to reduction in the growth rate of S. epidermidis, most notably after 2 hours of exposure. Furthermore, a statistically significant increase in MIC values for amoxicillin, penicillin G, cefuroxime, bacitracin, tetracycline, ofloxacin, and co-trimoxazole was observed in EMR-exposed cultures compared to unexposed controls and Sham exposed groups suggesting an induced modulation of resistance mechanisms. These findings underscore the necessity for further in-depth investigations into the non-thermal effects of 2.45 GHz EMR on bacterial physiology and resistance patterns, given the potential implications for skin health and the efficacy of antimicrobial treatments in environments with high EMR exposure."

    "abstract": "A unified “bracket-tool” concept optimizes the installation of HY5CX-13/40 surge arresters by concurrently addressing mechanical reliability and on-site operability. The newly designed connecting bracket features a bolt-fastened architecture, guided by anti-loosening theory to achieve optimal preload. Finite element analysis conducted in ANSYS Workbench confirms that von Mises stresses remain below 60% of the material yield limit under the combined effects of wind, vibration, and short-circuit loads. To complement the bracket, a multifunctional installation tool integrates suspension assistance, guided alignment, and self-adaptive span adjustment. This enables the arrester to be clamped, positioned, released, and subsequently connected to the down-lead clamp in a seamless operation. Two automated derivatives extend this concept: the first electrifies the original linkage, while the second incorporates a servo-gear drive for direct motion conversion, both designed to further alleviate operator workload.SolidWorks models of the tool frame undergo topology optimization to eliminate non-load-bearing material, resulting in a 28 % reduction in mass. A subsequent size-parameter refinement, targeting maximum stress while constraining weight and deformation, restores a safety factor greater than 1.8 without compromising stiffness. Prototypes manufactured according to the optimized design have been validated on a full-scale tower, achieving reliable mounting of the arrester and clamp within 90 seconds—more than twice as fast as conventional methods—while significantly reducing physical strain and high-altitude exposure. Therefore, this integrated approach enhances efficiency, safety, and costeffectiveness in the maintenance of surge arresters."

The operation mode points were plotted in selected two- or three-dimensional spaces to analyze their overall characteristics. Then, the rationality of applying empirical rules to traditional power systems and their limitations when applied to new-type power systems were analyzed. Finally, by conducting stability analysis of operation modes under two different renewable energy generation rates in recent actual power systems, the trend of deteriorating representativeness of traditional typical operation modes is reflected; finally, technical approaches for future research on operation mode selection are discussed."

However, building and maintaining dedicated models for every city is unrealistic due to data limitations and resource constraints. To overcome this challenge, this work proposes a transferable modeling framework that integrates a Domain-Adversarial Neural Network with machine learning regressors. The goal is to extract domain-invariant features from a source city and apply them to structurally similar target cities without extensive retraining. This framework is evaluated using realworld sensor data from Paris, Madrid, Berlin and Helsinki, focusing on three key pollutants: <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{NO}_{2}, \\text{PM}_{2.5}$</tex> and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{PM}_{10}$</tex>. Model performance is assessed across various source-target city combinations to evaluate adaptability. Results show that the proposed approach transfers well among modest-similar cities even if using limited data."

Existing attribute-based access control (ABAC) solutions, particularly those using Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE), are largely designed for static or batch data and fall short in handling high-throughput, streaming environments. We propose a scalable, multi-stage encryption framework for secure Healthcare IoT data processing by integrating Apache Kafka and Apache Spark. At the data source, differentially private noise is injected using pseudorandom functions (PRFs), and data is encrypted with AES and authenticated via MAC. The AES key is encapsulated using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) under Spark’s public key. Kafka ensures high-throughput delivery, while Spark Structured Streaming performs real-time MAC verification, ECC decryption, and secure aggregation. The aggregated data is re-encrypted using a fresh symmetric key, which is then wrapped with CP-ABE to enforce fine-grained access control. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed approach achieves comparable performance in encrypting and decrypting large-scale data, while notably surpassing the baseline fog computing model in terms of data aggregation efficiency for IoT streaming encrypted data."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a distributed cooperative guidance law based on time-to-go estimates for the simultaneous attack problem of loitering munition swarm in three-dimensional scenarios. Building upon the three-dimensional decoupling, three-stage and two-stage distributed cooperative guidance laws are designed respectively for the lateral and longitudinal planes, respectively. The lateral guidance utilizes a biased proportional guidance (BPNG) law, incorporating a lead angle restriction mechanism to reduce time-to-go estimation errors. The longitudinal guidance is decomposed into flight and dive segments, employing the total energy control system (TECS) and the integral-proportional guidance (IPG) law. A flight-to-dive switching rule is designed to reduce impact time errors. To address input constraints from the attitude autopilot, attitude angle commands are derived as control inputs. By using the proposed guidance law, loitering munitions can attack the target simultaneously in both tiered and non-tiered attack modes. Simulation scenarios of various swarm scales with different communication topologies have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed time cooperative guidance law."

However, the flight is subject to significant uncertainties, particularly in propulsion system performance and atmospheric conditions, which lead to large apogee dispersions. This paper addresses this challenge by presenting the design and comparative analysis of two adaptive control strategies for an aerodynamic air brake system developed to actively regulate the apogee. The methodology encompasses the development of a high-fidelity nonlinear model of the rocket dynamics, validated against experimental data. Two control architectures were designed and compared: a classical cascade controller (P+PI) and a modern Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) servomechanism. Both systems utilize a Kalman Filter for real-time state estimation. To ensure robust performance, a Gain Scheduling adaptive layer was applied to both strategies. Simulation results demonstrate that both final controllers are capable of maintaining the apogee error below 2 % over a wide operational envelope, validating the proposed methodologies and offering a detailed analysis of the trade-offs between classical and modern control approaches for this application."

In this paper, a novel probabilistic forecasting approach is proposed by combining statistical method with deep learning model, named ARIMA-Assisted-Neural-Network (AANN). In AANN, the autoregressive integrated moving average model is seamlessly integrated with a lightweight deep learning architecture. The hybrid framework employs a two-stage temporal encoding mechanism, utilizing continuous sampling for short-term pattern capture and interval sampling for long-term dependency extraction, thereby achieving complementary integration of statistical principles and deep learning capabilities. The proposed method addresses two key limitations in probabilistic wind power forecasting: a) By incorporating statistical modeling, it enhances conventional deep learning frameworks through improved prediction interval reliability and robustness; b) A post-processing technique resolves quantile crossing issues in quantile regression by enforcing monotonic constraints, ensuring mathematically consistent quantile relationships without distorting distributional properties. Experimental evaluations on real-world wind farm datasets demonstrate AANN's superior performance over state-of-the-art models (Autoformer, Mamba), particularly when processing extended input sequences. The results substantiate that hybrid statistical-deep learning approaches offer advantages in renewable energy forecasting accuracy, providing methodological insights for handling stochastic power generation in modern electrical grids."

Sufficient conditions for ensuring stable formation are established through the application of mathematical tools including Lyapunov functionals and impulsive comparison theory. Compared with existing methods, the proposed approach incorporates a multi-agent reinforcement learning mechanism, in which multiple learning agents are used to adaptively adjust the impulsive control instants and continuous control gains under the guidance of a well-designed reward function, thereby optimizing the control strategy and improving overall performance. The simulation results indicate that the proposed approach achieves better performance than traditional methods, particularly with respect to control consumption and state error, thus validating its feasibility and superiority in enhancing control effectiveness and system stability."

By leveraging power system analysis data reflecting static constraints such as overloads and voltage limits under N-1 contingencies, the model predicts feasible GI locations that minimize the need for additional system reinforcements. Case studies on a modified IEEE 39-bus system for renewable energy sources (RES) demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.

    "abstract": "Axial Flux Machines (AFMs) are gaining attention in modern electric vehicle applications due to their high power density, compactness, and material efficiency. The performance of AFMs can be analyzed using either high-fidelity (HF) three-dimensional (3D) Finite Element Method (FEM) or low-fidelity (LF) quasi-3D FEM, depending on the specific research requirements. This paper presents comparative numerical studies to assess the gap between different HF and LF simulation models. Then, a comprehensive dataset is generated with hybrid HF and LF FEM simulations for surrogate modelling. This dataset enables the training, validation, and testing of surrogate models with minimal computational time and resources, thereby accelerating the performance evaluation process for AFMs. The numerical results of a baseline with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model demonstrate that it accurately captures the relationship between design variables and key performance indicators (KPIs), which can be integrated into functional procedures to speed the analysis processing bypass the invoking of FEM solver."

Moisture control in concrete structures is essential for ensuring long-term durability, safety, and operational reliability, particularly in transformer substations, foundation blocks, cable chambers, tunnels, and protective facilities. The proposed approach involves the integration of a digital hygrostat into the concrete matrix, enabling real-time measurement and regulation of humidity levels. Laboratory experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the sensor under different conditions of moisture and temperature. The obtained results confirm that the use of digital humidity monitoring devices supports the early detection of risks related to corrosion, degradation of electrical insulation, and structural damage, making them a suitable component of intelligent management and maintenance systems in the energy sector."

The non-invasive technique of structural simulation provides optimized results for the ionic conductivity improvement. The simulation challenge is to reproduce the structure and the mutual interactions occurring in the real system, in a dynamic manner for operating of the device. The molecular dynamic technique was applied in the case of two types of gel supercapacitors, using the Ansys HFSS program. The electric field distribution in gel, the ESR values, the current crowding or skin effect (at higher frequencies) have been analyzed. The frequency analysis was performed for the parameters like electric permittivity or conductivity. Conclusion is that the ionic conductivity of the gel supercapacitors can be improved up to 20% when the electrode - electrolytes system is controlled. The Nyquist plots and the Bode plots have been interpreted and offer us the necessary information for structure optimization. Thus, the improved structures are available for manufacturing without preliminary material consumption."

Five commercial titles—The Game of Life, Azul, Stone Age, Tucano, and Catan—were evaluated in both physical (tabletop) and digital (online) formats. The weights of the aggregate criteria were obtained from a three-member family and computed separately by format. Each participant played all five games in both formats (≥ 30 sessions). Using family-level weights, Tucano achieved the highest closeness coefficient in both conditions. Crucially, these rankings are illustrative of the procedure in a single-family case study and are not intended to provide generalizable findings. The contribution is methodological: a transparent, reproducible TOPSIS pipeline—criteria definition, normalization, weighting, ideal-solution identification (PIS/NIS), and ranking—that supports evidence-informed choices and helps balance entertainment and educational value. To our knowledge, this work is among the first to compare physical and digital board games with TOPSIS using family-based aggregated weights, offering a practical framework for four stakeholder groups: parents, educators/researchers, students, and designers/developers."

    "abstract": "Extended Reality (XR) is emerging as a key class of immersive applications for next-generation networks. Reflecting it’s importance, ITU-R IMT-2030 vision identifies XR as a key service class for 6 G, and 3 GPP has recognized XR as a critical use case. However, conventional schedulers such as Proportional Fair (PF), and MAX-CQI etc often fail to meet XR’s ultra-low latency, high throughput, and high reliability demands. Existing frame-level integrated transmission strategies improve XR support by prioritizing frame completion but still focus on network-level Quality of Service (QoS), overlooking user-perceived Quality of Experience (QoE). Since not all XR data equally contribute to perceptual quality, semantic communication offers a promising solution by prioritizing semantically important content. In this paper, we propose a novel semantic-aware MAC scheduling framework for XR over 6 G networks that integrates semantic relevance extracted using a 3D convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) for frame prediction with traditional network metrics to optimize resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate significant QoE improvements and achieving higher gain compared to PF (upto $\\mathbf{1 0 0 \\%}$), MAX-CQI (upto 88%), and frame-level integrated schedulers (upto $87 \\%$)."

    "abstract": "Subsistence farming plays a vital role in the South African economy. However, food insecurity remains a critical issue, worsened by the country's unpredictable climate conditions and limited agricultural resources. To address this, we previously built an Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT)enabled hydroponic grow tent that implements a Random Forest Classification (RFC) model to monitor and control the growth conditions in the grow tent. However, our research, personal experience, and previous findings revealed that pest control is a pressing concern in hydroponic systems. Building on this, the current study introduces a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to improve pest detection, using a Raspberry Pi for local model inference and an ESP32 camera for live image capturing. The system operates off-grid via local WiFi without relying on internet connectivity, catering for the connectivity challenges that rural areas face. The model was trained using a custom CNN architecture, transfer learning with VGG16, and a publicly available dataset focused on the most common pests, such as Spider Mites and Aphids. Qualitative and quantitative data analysis was conducted to evaluate the model's effectiveness and the system's practicality for rural African farmers. Despite a limited dataset size, integrating transfer learning significantly improved the model's performance. Deploying the CNN model on the Raspberry Pi proved the feasibility of automating pest detection in resource-constrained settings. This research emphasizes the potential of the system to improve food security and reduce the need for daily manual crop inspections, providing rural farmers with a sustainable solution for pest management."

    "abstract": "Thailand is one of the world's most popular travel destinations. In the digital age, online reviews written by previous travelers have become a highly influential information source for decision-making. Unfortunately in many cases, users do not assign ratings, or the platforms do not require them. As a result, these systems are unable to process sentiment effectively from the textual reviews. Moreover, most existing recommendation systems lack the ability to group destinations with similar characteristics or categories. This paper proposes a tourism recommendation system that integrates sentiment analysis with tag clustering. The system is capable of processing both user sentiment and destination-related content, enabling it to generate personalized recommendations that align with users' preferences and emotional context. The experimental results show that the SVM model achieved an average sentiment classification accuracy of 94%. In contrast, tag clustering using DBSCAN presented a limitation in the form of high noise levels-over 30% of tags were classified as noise (represented by cluster -1), indicating that a significant number of tags could not be assigned to any meaningful cluster. This reflects a limitation in tag coverage and suggests that further refinement is needed to improve grouping performance in real-world datasets with diverse and contextually ambiguous descriptions."

Subsequently, adopting this IACG as the baseline, a multi-missile impact time consensus protocol is devised by incorporating inter-vehicle information exchange. A cooperative compensation term is derived via fixed-time convergent relative error dynamics (FxT-RED) to enforce bounded-time consensus error stabilization.

    "abstract": "The causes of commutation failure (CF) in the line-committed converter-based high voltage direct current (LCC-HVDC) transmission systems are diverse, which increasingly complicates its detection. To address this issue, a CF detection method based on the asymmetry of DC components in valve-side currents is proposed. For CF caused by different types of faults, firstly, the Fourier transform is introduced to extract the DC components of valve-side currents as new key characteristic indicators, and their asymmetry is analyzed. Secondly, a CF detection criterion is established by determining whether the DC components of the three-phase currents exhibit a situation where the DC component of one phase drops sharply to zero while the DC components of the other two phases surge. Finally, the method is verified using a double-circuit model built on the basis of the CIGRE model in the simulation platform. Simulation results show that this method breaks through the limitations of CF detection under AC system faults. It can not only quickly identify CF caused by AC system faults but also accurately detect CF induced by factors such as DC line faults and trigger loss, significantly improving the robustness and universality of detection."

In this work, we present an interview study with analysts from a wide range of domains and with varied expertise and experience, inquiring about the role of contextual knowledge. We provide insights into how data is insufficient in analysts' workflows and how they incorporate other sources of knowledge into their analysis.

Systematic indoor experiments were conducted on a 440 W c-Si half-cut module, providing current-voltage data under controlled shading. The data were used to calibrate a detailed LTspice circuit model. Further, an analytical loss function was developed to predict power losses as a function of shaded substring fraction and configuration. This analytical loss function was then refined through empirical fitting to the experimentally validated LTspice model, and it closely matches both the designed simulation conditions used for data fitting and independent representative shading scenarios. This framework offers a reliable and efficient tool for predicting shading losses in series-connected half-cut PV modules, facilitating more accurate system design and performance assessment."

It can achieve the same multibeam performance as the fully connected system without the complex crossover connection network. Different from traditional superheterodyne systems, multiple data streams are allocated to different intermediate frequency (IF) bands, and the LO is a multitone signal instead of a single-tone signal. The multitone LO phase shifting is used to realize flexible multibeam forming. To validate the feasibility of the proposed scheme, an eight-element, four-stream U6G FD-multi-input multi-output (MIMO) transmitter is designed with a 400-MHz signal bandwidth. In circuit implementations, the FD-MIMO framework is perfectly integrated with the traditional fully connected scheme to further improve the communication capacity. Finally, during indoor measurements, the MIMO system achieves a 9.6-Gb/s data rate with 64-QAM modulation."

Based on the exact channel statistics, this paper employs a Bernoulli-VG prior and extends the standard approximate message passing algorithm to learn the Gamma-distributed channel variance within an expectation-maximization framework. Additionally, this paper introduces a novel approach to enforce consistency in device activity status across all base station antennas by transforming the activity detection task into the estimation of a dedicated active probability for each device. Extensive simulations validate the proposed VG channel model and demonstrate significant improvement due to imposing consistent activity probability across multiple antennas."

    "abstract": "Accurate dynamic models of inverter-based resources (IBRs) are of critical importance for power system stability analysis. However, IBRs often behave as black boxes to system operators due to the diversity and proprietary nature of their control strategies. Existing black-box modeling methods fall short in several aspects, including their discrete-time natures, limited order of expressiveness, susceptibility to noises, and inability to handle multiple control modes. This paper addresses fully black-box modeling of IBRs with multiple unknown control modes through noisy measurement data. The method first learns to cluster noisy, unlabeled measurement data series to automatically discover multiple control modes of a black-box IBR system, then performs end-to-end learning of the dynamic model behind each discovered control mode via a deep neural Kalman filter with three neural networks - the encoder network, the state transition network, and the output network. The outcomes are continuous-time IBR models that can be readily integrated with existing power system model libraries and can be adopted by various numerical integration methods as well as step sizes. The proposed method is validated on IBRs with both grid-following and grid-forming controls in IEEE standard transmission and distribution test systems, demonstrating its advantages over state-of-the-art data-driven IBR modeling methods."

Accurate current control plays a critical role in achieving high performance, and a wide speed operation range is often required in electrified drivetrains. While numerous current control methods have been proposed in the literature, their applicability across different speed regions has not been systematically clarified. This article presents a comprehensive review and classification of current control strategies for SRMs, organized according to their applicable speed regions. The speed-dependent characteristics and corresponding control challenges are first discussed to establish the basis for classification. Existing methods are then categorized into two major groups: those applicable to low and intermediate speeds and those tailored for high-speed operation. Each category is analyzed in terms of dynamic performance, robustness, and computational complexity. Representative current control methods are evaluated through both simulation and experimental validation to assess their performance across varying speed conditions. Finally, existing challenges and future research trends are discussed."

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has gained significant attention as a distributed machine learning approach in recent years. However, in the context of the Internet of Things, terminal devices exhibit considerable heterogeneity in data distribution, communication, and computational resources. This heterogeneity can introduce bias, hindering model accuracy through iterative training. Moreover, disparities in communication and computational capabilities limit FL to resource-constrained devices, slowing convergence. To address these challenges, we propose FedDG, an FL framework that integrates model compression and dynamic fusion. Specifically, for nonindependently and identically distributed data, we adaptively adjust the client compression rate based on model training errors, reducing transmission costs while improving both convergence speed and accuracy. Furthermore, clients are dynamically selected for aggregation in each round based on training time and model performance, alleviating the impact of low-resource clients and reducing communication overhead. Experimental results show that FedDG significantly lowers communication bandwidth and data transmission size, and accelerates model convergence under data heterogeneity compared to benchmark schemes, such as FedAvg, FedNova, STC, DF_FL, DAdaQuant, and adaptive quantization in device selection strategy (AQUILA)."

    "abstract": "Multi-robot coordination is crucial for autonomous systems, yet real-world deployments often encounter various failures. These include both temporary and permanent disruptions in sensing and communication, which can significantly degrade system robustness and performance if not explicitly modeled. Despite its practical importance, failure-aware coordination remains underexplored in the literature. To bridge the gap between idealized conditions and the complexities of real-world environments, we propose a unified failure-aware coordination framework designed to enable resilient and adaptive multi-robot target tracking under both temporary and permanent failure conditions. Our approach systematically distinguishes between two classes of failures: (1) probabilistic and temporary disruptions, where robots recover from intermittent sensing or communication losses by dynamically adapting paths and avoiding inferred danger zones, and (2) permanent failures, where robots lose sensing or communication capabilities irreversibly, requiring sustained, decentralized behavioral adaptation. To handle these scenarios, the robot team is partitioned into subgroups. Robots that remain connected form a communication group and collaboratively plan using partially centralized nonlinear optimization. Robots experiencing permanent disconnection or failure continue to operate independently through decentralized or individual optimization, allowing them to contribute to the task within their local context. We extensively evaluate our method across a range of benchmark variations and conduct a comprehensive assessment under diverse real-world failure scenarios. Results show that our framework consistently achieves robust performance in realistic environments with unknown danger zones, offering a practical and generalizable solution for the multi-robot systems community."

    "abstract": "Vertical federated learning (VFL) enables a paradigm for vertically partitioned data across clients to collaboratively train machine learning models. Feature selection (FS) plays a crucial role in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) due to the unique nature that data are distributed across multiple clients. In VFL, different clients possess distinct subsets of features for overlapping data samples, making the process of identifying and selecting the most relevant features a complex yet essential task. Previous FS efforts have primarily revolved around intra-client feature selection, overlooking vital feature interaction across clients, leading to subpar model outcomes. We introduce ICAFS, a novel multi-stage ensemble approach for effective FS in VFL by considering inter-client interactions. By employing conditional feature synthesis alongside multiple learnable feature selectors, ICAFS facilitates ensemble FS over these selectors using synthetic embeddings. This method bypasses the limitations of private gradient sharing and allows for model training using real data with refined embeddings. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that ICAFS surpasses current state-of-the art methods in prediction accuracy."

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection in multivariate time series is critical for Condition-Based Maintenance Plus applications, as early identification of abnormal equipment behavior can prevent unexpected operational disruptions. However, distributional shifts arising from temporal shifts and cross-device variability often degrade model performance, leading to excessive false alarms. In this paper, we address these challenges by integrating Reversible Instance Normalization (RevIN) into Time Series Anomaly Detection using Generative Adversarial Networks (TadGAN), forming a fully unsupervised framework designed to enhance out-of-distribution robustness. We collected real-world radio frequency (RF) signals from two radar units over three acquisition periods and quantified distributional discrepancies using Jensen-Shannon divergence, revealing substantial temporal and cross-device variability. Due to the scarcity of labeled anomalies, we synthetically generated both point and collective anomalies by perturbing the latent representations of normal sequences in TadGAN. Experimental results demonstrate that the RevIN-TadGAN model consistently reduces reconstruction errors and achieves superior anomaly detection performance under various distributional shift scenarios, while maintaining robust performance on in-distribution data. Importantly, our study confirms that significant out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts occur even in advanced combat systems, and demonstrates a practical approach to addressing these challenges through robust unsupervised anomaly detection. This work offers valuable insights for deploying OOD-aware monitoring frameworks in real-world defense applications."

Then, the original nonlinear attitude system is reformulated in a high-dimensional linear attitude model. Second, a linear secondary regulator (LQR) control scheme is designed to ensures the stability of the attitude system. Finally, a physical platform of quadrotor attitude control is set up, experimental results validate the accurate prediction of the proposed modeling and control approach.

Unlike traditional sensor-based or purely data-driven models, the approach integrates dense optical flow extracted from coastal surveillance footage with a convolutional neural network (CNN) enhanced by spatial attention. The network focuses on key motion regions associated with wave dynamics, such as crests and troughs. At the same time, a physicsbased loss function ensures compliance with fluid flow constraints, particularly the incompressibility condition. A ResNet18 backbone processes five-channel input tensors (RGB + flow), guided by a divergence-based penalty term to promote physical realism. Experiments using coastal video datasets demonstrate stable training convergence, accurate prediction of flow fields, interpretable attention maps and the metrics of RMSE: 0.0625 and an MAE: 0.0467. The results confirm the model's ability to learn physically consistent wave behavior from monocular video, offering a scalable, real-time solution for environmental monitoring and disaster preparedness. This research takes a foundational step toward developing robust, interpretable, and deployable coastal modeling systems that leverage modern AI and physics-informed design."

This paper proposes a joint carrier recovery and iterative decoding algorithm based on weighted and normalized syndrome satisfaction probability (WNSSP). Our architecture implements parallel phase compensation through a multi-layer factor graph model. Within this framework, WNSSP dynamically weights and fuses belief provided by the soft low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes decoder to construct a maximum likelihood estimation function that simultaneously achieves carrier recovery and information reconstruction. To address the single-metric evaluation limitation, code-modified mean square error (CM-MSE) is established according to the residual phase error threshold, which enables concurrent assessment of synchronization accuracy and demodulation reliability. Simulations demonstrate that while effectively eliminating redundancy caused by pilot sequence, the proposed algorithm achieves 0.5–0.8 dB phase estimation gains and 0.15–0.5 dB bit error rate (BER) improvements compared with existing methods."

Traditional numerical weather models are computationally intensive and typically designed for long-term forecasting. In contrast, machine learning models enable faster predictions, but require training on large datasets.The use of Machine Learning (ML) methods for lightning forecasting has shown promising results. They can be used for a shorter predictive horizon, in the range of 15 to 60 minutes, but also present some limitations as they require large amounts of historical data for training. Additionally, they can be difficult to interpret, making it challenging to understand the underlying mechanisms driving the predictions. This paper presents a new approach to lightning forecasting that addresses such limitations. The proposed approach identifies key lightning activity patterns through the use of Clustering and Support Vector Machines, bypassing the need for training on historical data. The proposed model was applied to satellite-based lightning data, and its performance was found to be comparable to that of machine learning models, while being computationally more efficient."

The goal of this have a look at is to investigate how GANs may be utilized in stylized animation frame interpolation and smoothing to make lively scenes look greater fluid and attractive. The toughest part of animation is ensuring that the transitions among frames are smooth so that the motion seems natural and the style remains the identical from body to border. When the usage of old interpolation techniques, they don't usually keep the style's aesthetics, which could purpose visible artifacts or motion that doesn't look proper. We gift a new GAN-primarily based device that blends the fine functions of deep getting to know and inventive images to create frames in among current key frames. The way our version works makes use of both content switch and fashion transfer methods to ensure that interpolated frames hold the movement drift and suit the animation's model. Some of animation datasets are used to check the framework. The interpolation and smoothing are judged on how nicely they keep visible cohesion, temporal continuity, and artistic accuracy. The test results show that our GAN model does a much better job of keeping the quality and flow of animation than other interpolation methods. This method looks like it could work well for many things, like making animated movies, video game images, and virtual worlds. It provides a flexible way to make high-quality, stylized animation."

The model employs the SMOTE technique to balance the distribution of the data, and various explanatory techniques are added to improve the transparency of the model and the interpretability of the results. The study also used data visualization techniques to demonstrate the distribution of results predicted by the model and the relationship between features, providing a scientific basis for the application of the model in clinical settings.

When a detected person and a detected weapon overlapped within the same frame, the individual was classified as “armed”. Through the present work, the trade-offs between detection performance and deployment feasibility on resource-constrained edge platforms are highlighted for models selection in real-time security applications. Moreover, an architecture for an edge-based armed threat detection system using the Jeston Nano and YOLOv11n is proposed. The comparative findings suggested that the YOLOv8n performed better. Overall, the YOLOv8n has an mAP of 80.2 % with regards to the YOLOv11n's 79.0 %. It is worth noting that the YOLOv11n was built using fewer parameters as compared to YOLOv8n, thus forming the basis for the decision to use the YOLOv11n in the proposed edge architecture, keeping in mind the use of constrained hardware such as the Jetson Nano."

    "abstract": "The scheduling problem of agile earth observation satellite (AEOS) problem presents complex constraints and high real-time requirements, inherently falling under the category of NP-hard problem. Traditional algorithms generally suffer from low efficiency. To address this, this paper propose a Q-learning-based adaptive large neighborhood search (Q-ALNS) method. This strategy leverages the destroy-and-repair process of the Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) algorithm and incorporates a reinforcement learning framework to dynamically select appropriate operators based on the current solution state and historical experience, thereby optimizing scheduling solutions and enhancing solution diversity as well as global search capability. Extensive experiments conducted under both global and regional distribution scenarios demonstrate that Q-ALNS significantly outperforms two state-of-the-art ALNS algorithms and the genetic algorithm in solving AEOS scheduling problem, achieving notable efficiency improvements."

The aim behind developing such strategies is to improve both the PV power generation self-consumption rate and the economic gain, in comparison with rule-based (RB) control strategies. Inasmuch as DHW and power demand profiles are needed, data were collected from a panel of users, allowing the development of profiles based on a quantile regression (QR) approach. The simulation results (over 6 days) highlight that the MPC/LMPC strategies outperform the RB strategies, while guaranteeing users’ comfort (i.e., the availability of DHW). The MPC/LMPC strategies allow for a significant increase in both the PV power generation self-consumption rate and the economic gain. In addition, these results clearly demonstrate the benefits of using EWHs to store the PV power generation surplus, in the context of producing DHW in residential buildings."

Each robot estimates the formation trajectory using only local neighbor data under an event-triggered communication rule, which avoids redundant transmissions. A time-varying output masking strategy is applied to transmitted data to conceal the true state without affecting convergence. In contrast to noise-based or cryptographic techniques, which typically introduce higher complexity or compromise accuracy, the proposed method ensures exact convergence with low computational and communication costs. Theoretical proofs and simulations confirm that the robot team achieves accurate formation control while maintaining privacy and communication efficiency."

The original fifth-order dynamic model of the converter is systematically reduced to a second-order model using the dominant pole-zero approximation method, ensuring control system tractability without significant loss of system dynamics. The converter's steady-state behavior is analyzed using the volt-second balance for inductors and the charge balance (current-second) principle for capacitors. Based on this analysis, a small-signal transfer function is derived to facilitate input voltage regulation. Extensive MATLAB simulations are conducted to validate the theoretical design parameters in open-loop operation. For closed-loop implementation, a state-space small-signal model is developed to enable precise output voltage regulation through duty cycle modulation. A compensator, along with a PI controller, is designed to ensure stability and dynamic response of the converter under line and load transients. Simulation results confirm the robustness and effectiveness of the control strategy."

The future power system presents strong nonlinear and multi-time scale characteristics, which makes it complicated for power system solution, analysis and prediction. Real-time digital simulation acts as an effective means for system analysis and control device hardware test in the loop. With the demand of characteristic simulation of nonlinear, wide frequency domain, fast response, flexible control and other characteristics of the power electronic system becoming more and more prominent, it requires the real-time simulation system to be more precise, faster and more flexible. At present, the simulation time-step of the mainstream electromagnetic simulator is size of tens microseconds limited by technology, which is difficult to meet the requirements of precise simulation of power electronic system. Aiming at the current problems such as real-time model construction, high-speed stable solution in small-step and large-scale hardware collaboration, a high speed solution method for large scale power electronic system in small-step and multi-level heterogeneous parallel real-time simulation system construction technology are presented. A real-time simulation device for power electronic system is developed, which is better than the traditional technology in solving accuracy, speed and flexibility and is more suitable for simulation of power electronic system, supporting the fine simulation and fast response debugging of the control and protection device."

To handle modeling uncertainties and external disturbances, fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are suitably incorporated into the fixed-time NTSMC method for the QUAV under input saturation constraints. Furthermore, a Lyapunov-based analysis is conducted to establish the fixed-time stability of the closed-loop control system. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control scheme."

This study explores the optimal deployment strategy of buoys within a cross-domain tracking framework, leveraging the cooperative capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), where UAVs are employed for buoy deployment to enhance underwater tracking accuracy. A time of arrival (TOA)-based observation model is developed, supported by the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and Cramér–Rao lower bound (CRLB) to assess localization accuracy. Target dynamics are modeled using an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process, and particle simulations generate spatial reachability distributions. Deployment uncertainty is modeled with buoy positions treated as Gaussian random variables, and a posterior FIM via the Schur complement isolates informative contributions to target localization. A multi-objective optimization function integrates A-, D-, and E-optimality criteria with Gaussian repulsion to optimize tracking accuracy and coverage area. Discrete optimization is resolved using relaxation and sparse regularization, while continuous optimization adopts a hybrid approach combining CMA-ES and L-BFGS-B. Simulation validates the method’s superiority in achieving localization accuracy and efficient deployment."

Firstly, a large number of fault scenarios are generated through Monte Carlo simulation, an optimal topology is solved by establishing a load transfer model, and the power flow tracing matrix is calculated. Taking the 2-norm of the matrix difference as the distance index, K-means clustering is used to generate a typical fault scenario set. Based on this scenario set, a pre-disaster prevention model for resilient distribution networks is constructed with line reinforcement and emergency power supply placement as decision variables. Case studies verify that compared with traditional scenario generation methods, the proposed method can further reduce the load shedding rate and improve the utilization efficiency of pre-disaster prevention resources."

Farmers now control resources and crops using digital technology including robotics, IoT, and artificial intelligence. Particularly in terms of lowering synthetic pesticide use, the European Union Green Deal stresses sustainable farming methods. The EU is progressively restricting traditional synthetic pesticides, which causes pest resistance to develop from the frequent use of few active components. Besides, even if they are safer, biopesticides need exact application techniques to work. This calls for creative, smart solutions for agricultural protection. This article presents a Residual Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) based decision assistance system for Agriculture 5.0. Whereas CNN is used for accurate classification, residual learning improves feature extraction. Technology uses artificial intelligence to maximize pesticide spraying and combines data from Internet of Things devices. Applications efficiency and pest detection accuracy of the RCNN-based system showed notable gains.

    "abstract": "Automatic Micro-Expression Recognition (MER) discloses the inner emotions and intentions of individuals from spontaneous and unconscious facial expressions through computer-aided techniques. It holds significant potential for applications such as lie detection and mental health monitoring. Unfortunately, MER is critically challenged by limited training samples because of the expensive annotation cost. One potential solution is to aggregate micro-expression samples distributed across different agents/entities. However, such data exchange might cause privacy concerns and ownership dispute issues, making centralized MER training impractical. To address the challenges, this paper proposes FMER that integrates decentralized MER training into the federated learning framework, addressing privacy concerns in the regulated data-sharing MER application. Specifically, FMER employs the Muscle Motion-guided Network as the base model, introducing a multi-client collaborative training mechanism: clients update model parameters based on local data, while the server aggregates global models using the FedProx algorithm. Differential privacy technology with Gaussian noise injection protects gradient privacy, and proximal term constraints mitigate data heterogeneity. Experiments show that the proposed FMER achieves recognition accuracies of 81.89% and 79.19% on the CASMEII and SAMM datasets, respectively, verifying the effectiveness of the privacy-preserving micro-expression recognition model."

    "abstract": "The integration of photovoltaic (PV) generation with energy storage systems (ESSs) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance renewable energy utilization and ensure the stability of power supply in grid-connected scenarios. However, the variability of solar irradiance and the complexity of multi-source coordination pose challenges to both capacity planning and real-time operation. To address these issues, this paper proposes a bi-level optimization scheduling model for grid-connected PV-ESS systems. The upper-level model aims to minimize the annualized net cost by optimizing the installed capacity and rated power of PV and ESS units, taking into account investment, operation and maintenance, and electricity purchase costs. The lower-level model focuses on minimizing daily operating costs through optimal energy dispatch under time-of-use electricity prices, ensuring system safety, power balance, and storage operation constraints. A coordinated iterative solution method combining NSGA-II and CPLEX solvers is developed to realize closedloop optimization between the two layers. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy effectively improves economic performance, enhances the local consumption of PV energy, and supports the flexible operation of distributed energy systems."

By constructing an aggregation model of renewable energy generation hydrogen storage flexible load, a decisionmaking mechanism is designed that includes current spot electricity market quotations and real-time demand response. The DDPG algorithm is used to dynamically optimize the electricity sales bidding curve, and the hydrogen storage system is used to stabilize the fluctuations of renewable energy generation and enhance market arbitrage ability. A hydrogenbased fuel-cell vehicle scheduling model is established to achieve the conversion and reuse of hydrogen energy with limited electricity consumption, forming a source grid load storage collaborative optimization loop. The simulation results show that the strategy proposed in this article can increase the revenue of virtual power plants in the spot market by 23.7 %, improve the utilization rate of renewable power to 98.2 %, and maintain load satisfaction above 92 % through hydrogen cascade utilization, effectively solving the dual dilemma of power rationing losses and market risks in traditional renewable power stations."

    "abstract": "To address the problems of low positioning accuracy, poor real-time performance, and insufficient robustness of traditional visual SLAM systems in dynamic environments, this paper proposes a novel algorithm that integrates the YOLO11 instance segmentation model with ORB-SLAM3. Based on the original three threads of ORB-SLAM3, an additional parallel object detection thread is designed to identify dynamic objects in real time. First, YOLO11 is employed to detect dynamic objects in the scene. Then, the YOLO11 instance segmentation model is introduced to generate semantic masks as high-quality prior information. Finally, the semantic masks are integrated into the ORB-SLAM3 framework to enable real-time removal of dynamic feature points. By introducing YOLO11 instance segmentation, the improved ORB-SLAM3 effectively reduces the impact of dynamic objects on positioning accuracy and enhances the system's localization and mapping capabilities in dynamic environments. The algorithms are validated on KITTI dataset and TUM dataset respectively, and the results show that the algorithm in this paper achieves better state estimation with higher localization accuracy and stronger robustness on several typical dataset sequences."

This paper proposes an alternative approach based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to address these challenges. The ANN is trained to replicate the optimal control actions of an MPC controller using a comprehensive dataset generated under diverse operating conditions, including variations in filter inductance. The proposed architecture, named Adaptive Model Predictive Control (AMPC), leverages a temporal horizon of past data to achieve dynamic and adaptive control. Hardware in the loop results demonstrate that the proposed ANN-based controller achieves stable and accurate performance under a large range of inductance values, outperforming conventional MPC, which suffers from accuracy deterioration when the plant model deviates from the nominal. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is further validated through Controller-Hardware-in-the-Loop (CHIL) experiments, demonstrating its potential as a robust and computationally efficient solution for a grid-connected inverter."

    "abstract": "In order to broaden the transmission space of the transmission network, the power system uses DTR (dynamic thermal rating) to dynamically expansion the capacity of the transmission line during scheduling. However, the uncertainty of meteorological factors causes the prediction errors of DTR. If the inaccurate DTR prediction value is used to expansion the capacity of the transmission line, the transmission line will have the risk of breaking the thermal stability limit. It may cause the transmission line congestion. In this paper, by mining the information of DTR historical prediction data, the capacity expansion risk is quantified, and the quantified risk is utilized to the two-stage scheduling strategy to complete the generation scheduling of power system. Firstly, the risk quantification model of DTR capacity expansion is established, and the quantitative model is simplified by piecewise linear transformation to facilitate calculation. At the same time, the coefficients of the risk quantification model are obtained by driving the historical data of DTR. Finally, the capacity expansion risk is introduced into the scheduling target in the form of risk cost, and the two-stage scheduling model is constructed which meets the electricity market and contains flexible demand response. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed scheduling method are verified by the IEEE-39 node transmission network containing Chinese actual power grid data."

    "abstract": "In Mexico, fraudulent claims in private healthcare insurance-particularly involving elective nasal aesthetic surgeries like rhinoplasty disguised as medically necessary procedures—remain a persistent challenge. This paper presents an integrated smart healthcare framework that combines deep learning, digital twins, and blockchain technology to prevent such fraud. A digital twin of the patient's nose is generated using high-resolution pre-, intra-, and post-operative photographs. These models capture precise morphometric features and surgical changes over time. The data is secured via blockchain, ensuring tamper-proof storage of facial geometry, biometric identifiers, and medical metadata. By leveraging LSTM neural networks, the system learns healing patterns and predicts expected anatomical transformations, allowing insurance providers to distinguish legitimate functional interventions from unauthorized aesthetic procedures. Biometric landmarks and image metadata are cryptographically hashed and stored to preserve data integrity and identity authentication. This method enables forensic-level auditing of health claims, increases transparency, and reduces administrative overhead. Aligned with the principles of resilient and sustainable smart communities, this framework contributes to ethical health reimbursement, data sovereignty, and trust restoration in Latin America's healthcare systems."

    "abstract": "The rapid development of renewable energy has increased the difficulty of active power regulation in power systems due to the intermittency and volatility of wind/solar power as well as the relative decline in rotational inertia. Under the same disturbance, system frequency now changes faster with larger deviations. Therefore, studying online inertia assessment and security analysis methods for power systems with high renewable penetration is of significant importance. This study first analyzes the inertia mechanisms and manifestations of generation-load-storage systems under high renewable penetration. Based on this analysis, a frequency dynamic equation incorporating virtual inertia from renewable sources and energy storage is derived. To characterize grid rate-of-change-of-frequency (RoCoF) features, an identification method for system inertia and load inertia is proposed. For preventing excessive RoCoF and frequency deviations, an analytical calculation method for determining the system's minimum required inertia is developed, which can also be used to compute the maximum disturbance the grid can currently withstand. Finally, building upon these methods, an online inertia assessment and security analysis scheme is designed and applied to real-time inertia monitoring in practical power grids."

Specifically, a dynamic ambiguity set is constructed based on predicted means and time-varying covariance matrices to more precisely define the probability distribution range of uncertain PV output. The proposed two-stage DRO model incorporates affine decision rules and applies strong duality theory, successfully transforming the problem into a deterministic mixed-integer second-order cone programming problem, thereby ensuring computational feasibility and solution efficiency. Case study results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in balancing operational economy and robustness, particularly in distribution networks with high penetration and strong correlation of PV integration, showcasing enhanced risk-aversion capabilities and economic benefits."

    "abstract": "In recent years, single-domain recommendation methods have seen rapid development and significant success. However, they encounter problems that hinder their performance, such as sparse ratings in user-item rating matrix and cold start for new users. Cross-domain recommendation alleviates these issues by leveraging rating information from a well-established source domain and conveying it to a target domain. Such techniques usually rely on the existence of shared users or items in the two domains. However, such overlap is seldom found in real-world scenarios, which complicates the application of these methods. Therefore, our research proposes a cross-domain collaborative filtering recommendation method that does not rely on overlapping users or items. Instead, it matches items across domains based solely on their English text descriptions, such as movie overviews from the Movie domain and book descriptions from the Book domain. We evaluated a few different combinations of word embeddings (Word2Vec, Doc2Vec, and GloVe) and semantic similarity methods (cosine similarity and soft cosine similarity) for cross-domain item matching. The results indicate that soft cosine similarity, enhanced by Word2Vec word embeddings, was the best combination to capture complex semantic relationships in textual data. Moreover, sparsity reduction was found to be critical for improving the accuracy of recommendations."

    "abstract": "Recognizing human emotions through the use of EEG signals has wide-ranging applications in the fields of interaction with computers, mental healthcare, and adaptive education technologies. Most traditional methods have relied on handcrafted features or simpler machine learning paradigms that do not attend to the highly complex non-stationary EEG data. Here, we describe a new approach for EEG emotion recognition based on a hybrid deep learning model that integrates convolutional neural networks, bidirectional gated recurrent units, and an attention mechanism. The first step is preprocessing raw EEG signals into more informative representations through wavelet decomposition and entropy analysis. These features are provided to a hybrid deep learning framework based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRUs). The multi-scale CNN layers extract spatial and local temporal information, and pattern class discovery is enabled at the lower layers, whereas the BiGRU layers attend to long-range temporal dependencies of the EEG signals in both directions. To further enhance classification accuracy, an attention mechanism is added to the model to steer the EEG signals mathematically to extract the most relevant features useful for emotion recognition analysis. We examine the performance of our model on the “EEG Brainwave Dataset: Feeling Emotions”, which encodes emotions into positive, negative, and neutral categories. The experiments conducted using the proposed Hybrid CNN-BiGRU with Attention, along with wavelet entropy feature extraction, demonstrate superior performance over traditional machine learning methods and basic deep learning models. These results highlight the success of advanced signal processing integrated with deep learning, which produces robust and accurate emotion recognition."

    "abstract": "Tics are characterized by involuntary or semi-voluntary repetitive actions without purposeful intent, categorized as either 'motor tics' or 'vocal tics.' Motor tics manifest as involuntary movements affecting one or more body parts, whereas vocal tics involve the involuntary production of words or sounds through the nose or mouth. Current understanding suggests tic onset correlates with overloaded brain circuits, particularly in the basal ganglia, alongside abnormalities in neurotransmitter systems such as dopamine and serotonin, though definitive treatment remains elusive. Coprolalia, the involuntary utterance of obscene or sexually explicit language, represents a notable vocal tic symptom that significantly impacts patients' psychological well-being. Additional vocal tic manifestations include echolalia (repetitive speech), palilalia (repeating one's own words), and phonological tics (guttural sounds), which collectively impede comprehension, confuse listeners, and disrupt conversations. This study ultimately aims to develop a tic removal tool utilizing large language models (LLMs). As a preliminary investigation, we evaluated the tic removal capabilities of two advanced LLMs—GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. Identical sentences containing both prompts and tic elements were processed by both models, with removal efficacy assessed via questionnaire. Results indicated comparable performance between the models, with both demonstrating limitations in removing tics that maintained grammatical coherence within sentences."

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a biologically inspired alternative to conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), offering the potential for event-driven and low-power inference on neuromorphic hardware platforms. Unlike ANNs which rely on continuous activation functions, SNNs communicate through discrete spikes, making them closer to biological information processing. However, they remain challenging to train and often lag behind ANNs in accuracy. In this work, we present a simple yet systematic benchmark on the MNIST dataset using the SpikingJelly framework. We implement a fully connected ANN baseline and its SNN counterpart with Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons trained using surrogate gradients. To examine temporal dynamics, SNNs were evaluated across four simulation timesteps: T = 1,2,4,8. The ANN baseline achieves a peak test accuracy of 98.0%, while SNNs reach comparable performance in the range of 97.2–98.0%. Layerwise analysis reveals structured sparsity – low firing in early layers (4–9%), moderate firing in intermediate layers (12–18%), and dense firing in the deeper layers (∼50%). When efficiency is measured using sparsity-aware synaptic operations (SynOps), SNNs at T = 1–2 require only 24–52% of ANN operations while maintaining similar accuracy, whereas T =8 nearly doubles the cost without further gains. Our findings highlight two key insights: (1) moderate timesteps (T = 2–4) provide the best balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, and (2) SNNs offer a promising path toward energy-efficient AI on neuromorphic platforms such as Intel Loihi and SpiNNaker. This benchmark establishes a reproducible reference for the ANN-to-SNN comparison and sets the stage for future studies on larger datasets, advanced architectures, and direct hardware energy measurements."

    "abstract": "Older adults are more likely to experience social isolation. Smart Cities solutions offer promising opportunities to connect older adults with their communities and enhance their quality of life. Key to these solutions is the effective use of technology; however, the generational digital divide may hinder older adults' engagement with and adoption of technology-driven innovations. Community efforts to include older adults can help bridge this divide and foster social connectedness among older adults. This work presents our efforts toward investigating the external social factors that influence the learning and adoption of technology by older adults in a bicultural population. Our findings suggest a significant social influence on whether older adults use technology, the type of technology they use, and their intention to continue using it in the future. Based on these insights, we offer recommendations for the development of Smart Cities solutions and other efforts that foster older adults' learning and adoption of technology to connect with their community. These recommendations can support aging-friendly cities that enhance older adults' active participation, therefore increasing their social connectedness and improving their overall well-being."

To address these issues, this work proposes a two-stage underwater crack detection framework that integrates a checkerboard-guided diffusion-based enhancement (CDE) method with an improved U<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>-Net segmentation network (SE-U<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2-</sup>Net). The CDE method introduces high-contrast structural priors into the diffusion process, effectively enhancing crack edge visibility and structural contrast. The SE-U<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>Net further incorporates cross-channel attention and a local soft-thresholding mechanism to improve boundary sensitivity and suppress noise. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world underwater datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Our method achieves superior Recall (0.790) and Average Precision (0.763) among all compared models, with only 4.09M parameters for the segmentation model. Compared with mainstream methods including DeepLabV3+, Mask R-CNN, U-Net, and SegNet, the proposed framework exhibits superior robustness and segmentation completeness under complex underwater conditions, showing strong potential for practical engineering applications and deployment."

This paper constructs an experimental platform for DC series arc faults and systematically investigates the effects of different electrode materials, circuit currents, and electrode gap distances on arc characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that stainless steel electrodes generate higher high-frequency pulse amplitudes in fault currents and voltages compared to copper, brass, and aluminum electrodes. Under low-current conditions, arc voltages and currents exhibit stronger high-frequency components, while increased arc stability at high currents elevates detection difficulty. Larger gap distances correlate with higher amplitude high-frequency components in both arc voltage and current. By enhancing the Nottingham model through the integration of gap distance parameters, this study establishes a volt-ampere characteristic model for DC series discharge in brass electrodes. These findings provide critical support for developing multi-feature fusion arc fault detection algorithms in PV systems. The proposed model enables effective simulation of DC arc faults in photovoltaic applications, offering substantial engineering value for enhancing the safety of renewable energy power systems."

However, when participating in multiple electricity markets, improper scheduling of reserve may lead to violation of reservoir volume constraints when it is deployed in real time because of the inherent reservoir capacity limitations, finally rendering non-dispatchability. This paper proposes an optimal scheduling strategy of PSHP with variable speed (VS) turbine-pump units to bid in multiple electricity markets to maximum expected total revenues, considering the uncertainties of price forecasting. Further, several models with diverse volume constraints are proposed to fit different risk preferences of the operator.

To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-strategy grey wolf optimization (MSGWO) algorithm, which improves upon the conventional grey wolf optimization (GWO) by incorporating chaotic initialization, dynamic parameter adjustment, an elite solution pool, and hybrid mutation operators. Experimental results in 3D multi-UAV path planning scenarios—considering constraints such as flight distance, turning radius, and collision avoidance—demonstrate that MSGWO outperforms GWO, improved multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm (MOIPSO), and improved sine cosine algorithm (ISCA), exhibiting faster convergence, safer trajectories, and enhanced cost efficiency. These findings confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "In many IoT applications, numerous sensors are deployed across monitoring areas to perform various environmental or target monitoring tasks. However, due to power consumption limit, these sensors often possess limited long-range communication capabilities, rendering them incapable of meeting wide-area networking requirements. Consequently, traditional wireless sensor network technologies become inadequate for comprehensive data collection tasks. Due to high mobility and flexibility, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted wireless sensor network has emerged as an effective paradigm for data acquisition. In this paper, we focused on energy efficient UAV-assisted data collection problem. Firstly, the total energy consumption minimization problem was formulated, which is shown to be a multiple traveling salesman problem (mTSP). Secondly, A spatial partitioning scheme based on genetic algorithm (GA) was then proposed to decompose the mTSP into multiple single traveling salesman problems (TSPs) to minimize both the number of UAVs and the total energy consumption. Simulation results are presented to show that, the proposed multi-UAV assisted data collection scheme can achieve a reasonable tradeoff between the required number of UAVs and the energy consumption, which makes it suitable for the energy efficient large-scale data collection task in many UAV assisted applications."

    "abstract": "Direct data-driven control has emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional state-space model-based methods by directly learning control policies from data. Nevertheless, ensuring that control actions adhere to specific physical and safety constraints, a challenge often overlooked in existing direct data-driven approaches focused primarily on stability and robustness, is crucial for real-world deployment. This paper addresses this gap by designing a robust data-driven state feedback control law that enforces safety-critical state constraints. Utilizing robust control techniques, we transform pointwise-in-time state constraints into reachable set constraints and formulate a semi-definite program (SDP) based on noisy input-state measurements. Additionally, recognizing that various system variations and environmental disturbances can be modeled as process noise, we propose to maximize the noise tolerance of the system through a data-driven SDP, thereby enhancing resilience against operational uncertainties. To further ensure operational safety, we develop a state estimator-based fault detector that leverages noisy closed-loop state data to trigger alarms during abnormal system operation. Finally, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed safe data-driven control approach."

    "abstract": "The growing computational demands of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have motivated the use of spectral-domain inference as an alternative to costly spatial-domain convolutions. In this work, we propose a resistive RAM (RRAM)-based spectral-domain convolutional layer that exploits in-memory computing (IMC) for low energy consumption and high parallelism. Both the 2-D Fourier transform and the elementwise multiplications are directly executed on RRAM crossbar arrays, while Hermitian symmetry is leveraged to further enhance the energy efficiency of the transform and subsequent spectral processing. To ensure robustness, the measured RRAM device data are incorporated into system-level simulations to evaluate inference accuracy under the impact of device variability. Furthermore, we introduce a layer-wise mapping framework that adaptively selects between spatial- and spectral-domain execution based on the tradeoff between energy efficiency and accuracy. Simulation results show that the proposed design achieves up to a <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$2.18\\times $</tex-math> </inline-formula> improvement in energy efficiency across various convolutional layer configurations compared with the spatial-domain design. For VGG-8 on CIFAR-100, the proposed architecture with the layer-wise mapping scheme reduces the energy-delay product (EDP) by 45% while incurring negligible accuracy loss. This work presents the first complete RRAM-based spectral-domain convolutional layer that accounts for device variability, providing a promising solution for edge CNN inference."

This article describes a robotic system designed to assist in surgical procedures by implementing a virtual drill guide. The system integrates virtual-fixture functionality using a novel virtual-mechanism controller with additional visual feedback. The controller constrains the tool to the desired axis, while allowing axial motion to remain under the surgeon’s control. Compared to prior virtual-fixture approaches—which primarily perform pure energy-shaping and damping injection with linear springs and dampers–our controller uses a virtual prismatic joint to which the robot is constrained by nonlinear springs, allowing us to easily shape the dynamics of the system. We detail the calibration procedures required to achieve sufficient precision and describe the implementation of the controller. We apply this system to a veterinary procedure: drilling for transcondylar screw placement in dogs. The results of the trials on 3D-printed bone models demonstrate sufficient precision to perform the procedure and suggest improved angular accuracy and reduced exit translation errors compared to patient-specific guides (PSGs). Discussion and future improvements follow."

    "abstract": "In resource-constrained edge computing, the execution efficiency of workflow applications is significantly affected by bandwidth contention, especially during data transmissions between dependent tasks. However, existing workflow scheduling studies often struggle to optimize transmission delay effectively, whereas bandwidth slicing offers promising potential by leveraging the dynamic nature of bandwidth resources. To address this issue, we propose Workflow Scheduling with Dynamic Bandwidth Slicing (WSDBS), a novel scheduling algorithm that integrates bandwidth slicing into the workflow execution process. By introducing a dual-prediction strategy, WSDBS estimates the availability of both computational and bandwidth resources on servers, facilitating efficient task scheduling decisions under transmission uncertainty. Moreover, a novel transmission urgency metric is developed, which is derived from both link load and transmission criticality. This metric guides bandwidth slicing for the dynamic allocation of server-side bandwidth resources, ultimately alleviating contention among concurrent transmissions. Extensive experiments based on real-world Alibaba cluster traces show that WSDBS consistently improves scheduling efficiency, reducing the average makespan by 10.87%-14.44% over state-of-the-art baselines. These results validate its effectiveness in alleviating bandwidth contention and improving scheduling performance in edge computing environments."

Destruction of the coil during the mMGF production makes the measurement a single-shot measurement. Reproducibility of the magnetic field waveform on the microsecond time scale is the key technology that ensures the high reliability of the experimental results.

    "abstract": "Knowledge graph-based recommendation systems excel at capturing semantic relationships but struggle to model temporal dynamics in evolving user preferences, which is a critical limitation for real-world applications where user behaviors and item popularity change continuously over time. The core challenge lies in existing approaches that treat knowledge graphs as static structures and fail to capture the temporal evolution, sequential dependencies, and scalability demands of dynamic systems. We propose a Dynamic Knowledge Graph attention network (DynaKG) that addresses these limitations through three key innovations: 1) learnable temporal decay mechanisms with context-specific parameters that adapt to different node and edge types, 2) hybrid Fourier-positional temporal encoding that captures both periodic and aperiodic patterns, and 3) time-aware contrastive learning with incremental updates that reduces computational overhead by 34% while maintaining quality. We provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of the temporal attention mechanism and empirically demonstrate that DynaKG substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across three datasets: 8.0% improvement in Recall@20 on Yelp, 9.0% on Amazon-Book, and 7.0% on MovieLens-10M, while achieving 3.6 times parameter efficiency and providing interpretable temporal explanations."

This paper studies the UBS deployment problem in a cache-enabled UBS-assisted cellular network. The UBS deployment problem is first formulated as a joint optimization problem with an objective to minimize the average content delivery delay of all users in a service area. We decompose the problem into three sub-problems: content caching deployment, position deployment, and BS association, and propose a multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO)-based UBS deployment algorithm to solve the sub-problems. Specifically, the proposed algorithm uses edge agents on UBSs and a two-layer MAPPO algorithm including a cache layer and a position layer to solve the content caching deployment sub-problem and the UBS position deployment sub-problem. Meanwhile, it uses a central agent in a core network and a proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm to solve the BS association sub-problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed UBS deployment algorithm can significantly improve the network performance in terms of the average content delivery delay and the cache hit ratio of all users in the network."

    "abstract": "Generalizing to unseen scenes presents a significant challenge to semantic segmentation models, as it aims to replicate the human adaptability. Existing deep learning models still suffer from performance degradation on unseen scenarios due to the domain shift problem, which arises from differences in data statistical distribution between the training and unseen testing domains. In this work, we introduce DiffuSaL (Diffusion-based Scene and Label Space Extension for Domain Generalization), a framework designed to improve the generalization capability of semantic segmentation models learned solely from synthetic data without access to real target-domain samples. DiffuSaL synthesizes a set of pseudo-target samples termed CD-Driss (Controlled Diffusion–based Driving Scene Segmentation). Unlike existing data synthesis approaches, our method not only produces realistic scene images but also begins by generating semantic label maps using text prompts. These label maps are then employed alongside text prompts in controllable stable diffusion to guide the scene generation process. Thanks to this label generation strategy, we can ensure that the resulting masks exhibit balanced class presence, preserving a more uniform label distribution. To further enrich diversity, CD-Driss leverages a text-prompting strategy that explicitly controls variations in weather, lighting, and traffic conditions. Integrating the CD-Driss dataset into a meta-learning–based domain generalization framework enhances robustness to domain shifts and improves performance on unseen target domains. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art performance by 8.78% mIoU for GTA → (Cityscapes, BDD, and Mapillary) and 9.23% mIoU for SYNTHIA → (Cityscapes, BDD, and Mapillary), underscoring the effectiveness of diffusion-based synthetic data and controlled label-space expansion for domain generalization."

    "abstract": "In the era of computational social systems (CSS), where AI is increasingly embedded in critical domains such as public services, healthcare, and social governance, concerns about system vulnerabilities have become paramount. Federated learning (FL) offers a promising solution by enabling privacy-preserving and secure AI model training in real-world applications. However, traditional FL approaches often assume that client data is either imbalanced or non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID), whereas in practice, these issues frequently coexist. In such complex scenarios, minority classes may appear only on a small subset of clients, significantly degrading global model performance and convergence. In this article, we propose a novel FL framework designed to tackle the intertwined challenges of data imbalance and non-IID data by a principled, decoupled approach. Unlike existing methods that address these issues in isolation, our approach introduces three synergistic innovations, each operating at a different level of the FL system. At the data level, a global rebalancing mechanism employs a privacy-preserving modified Z-score to rectify class imbalance. At the client level, a distribution-aware clustering strategy groups participants based on data subspace similarity. At the feature level, a novel contrastive loss function, leveraging the effective number of samples, simultaneously mitigates local imbalance and model drift. This cohesive framework ensures that interventions at each level reinforce each other, leading to robust performance. Extensive experiments show that FedScFc outperforms state-of-the-art baselines."

However, beam prediction (BP) in millimeter-wave massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is challenging in high mobility scenarios, especially in non-stationary time-varying hybrid-field channels. In this case, the number of multi paths, time delay, angle of departure (AoD), Doppler offset, and the propagation distance vary simultaneously at different time instants. In this paper, we introduce a BP framework leveraging generative large language models (LLM), specifically GPT-2. The proposed BP-GPT approach utilizes historical channel state information (CSI) to predict optimal beamforming vectors that maximize spectral efficiency in these non-stationary time-varying hybrid-field conditions. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superior performance and robustness of BP-GPT over conventional neural network-based methods."

    "abstract": "The weak Pareto boundary (WPB) refers to a boundary in the objective space of a multi-objective optimization problem, characterized by weak Pareto optimality rather than Pareto optimality. The WPB brings severe challenges to multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), as it may mislead the algorithms into finding dominance-resistant solutions (DRSs), i.e., solutions that excel on some objectives but severely underperform on the others, thereby missing Pareto-optimal solutions. Although the severe impact of the WPB on MOEAs has been recognized, a systematic and detailed analysis remains lacking. To fill this gap, this paper studies the attributes of the WPB. In particular, the category of a WPB, as an attribute derived from its weakly Pareto-optimal property, is theoretically analyzed. The analysis reveals that the dominance resistance degrees of DRSs induced by different categories of WPBs exhibit distinct asymptotic growth rates as the DRSs in the objective space approach the WPBs, where a steeper asymptotic growth rate indicates a greater hindrance to MOEAs. Beyond that, experimental studies are conducted on various new test problems to investigate the impact of WPB’s attributes. The experimental results demonstrate consistency with our theoretical findings. Experiments on other attributes show that the performance of an MOEA is highly sensitive to some attributes. Overall, no existing MOEAs can comprehensively address challenges brought by these attributes."

    "abstract": "With the increasing demands of urban digitalization and the rise of low-altitude economy applications, building façade models are expected to evolve from basic geometric representations to detailed structures enriched with fine-grained semantic and structural information. This study proposes a fine-grained workflow for 3D modeling of urban building façades, integrating three key components: window detection and reconstruction, floor segmentation, and texture optimization. Specifically, (1) we develop a Bidirectional Adaptive Feature Fusion Network (BiFusion-Net) that robustly detects window positions and geometries by enhancing multi-scale feature fusion and semantic representation, effectively handling façade complexity and small target variations; (2) we reconstruct missing windows based on alignment patterns and design a rule-driven algorithm that leverages the vertical distribution of the completed window set to achieve automated and consistent floor segmentation; and (3) we implement a texture optimization module that enhances visual realism by correcting distortions and harmonizing façade colors through segmentation and inpainting techniques. The proposed approach was validated on a large-scale real-world 3D modeling project in Dangshan County. It enables the rapid generation of semantically enriched and visually realistic façade models at city scale, supporting applications such as drone-based logistics, emergency planning, and smart city operations. Experimental results show that the workflow achieves up to 97.38% F1-score in window detection, delivering superior performance compared with mainstream detectors. The optimized façades demonstrate improved visual consistency, as over 90% of wall regions exhibit clearer and more uniform color distributions. In the real-world project, the final reconstructed models achieve horizontal accuracy better than 0.3 m and vertical accuracy better than 0.2 m, fully meeting the standards for fine-grained urban 3D modeling."

A novel multimode DoS attack model is introduced, incorporating time-varying sojourn probabilities to provide a more accurate and computationally efficient representation of the stochastic nature of these attacks. This model overcomes the limitations of traditional Markov-based models by capturing dynamic attack behaviors. Deception attacks are modeled as unbounded nonlinear functions, and adaptive neural networks (NNs) are employed to approximate their complex behaviors, significantly reducing their detrimental impact on system stability. A fuzzy sliding surface is designed based on the switching rule for sojourn probabilities, and an observer-based SMC law is proposed to ensure the mean square estimation upper bound of the fuzzy nonlinear systems, guaranteeing stability despite the presence of cyberattacks. Finally, the validity and superiority of the proposed control strategy are demonstrated through a tunnel diode circuit model."

Compared to conventional Doppler radar or self-injection-locked (SIL) radar sensors, the proposed SRO design leverages periodic quench signals to trigger transient oscillation cycles, enabling substantial gain during the build-up phase for superior motion sensitivity. The sensor integrates a substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW) monopole antenna and analog envelope detection circuitry, achieving low power consumption and reduced system complexity. Through comprehensive experiments, the proposed sensor demonstrates robust vital sign detection—including respiration and heartbeat—at distances up to 1.4 m. Parametric analyses reveal that square-wave quench signals, low quench frequencies, and moderate duty cycles (e.g., 50%) yield optimal performance. Compared to its SIL counterpart implemented in the identical GaAs pHEMT technology, the SRO radar achieves >26-dB improvement. These results validate the multimode SRO-based radar architecture as a promising solution for miniaturized, high-sensitivity, noncontact biomedical sensing in indoor and clinical environments."

This paper proposes a relational approach to AI literacy that supports the continuity and adaptive evolution of intangible cultural heritage in the digital age. Drawing on the Balinese framework of Tri Hita Karana, we introduce a hybrid methodology that situates machine learning within cultural ritual, integrating participatory action research with generative dialogue and machine teaching. Rather than treating intangible cultural heritage as static content to be preserved, we frame it as a dynamic pedagogy enabling value negotiation between human and machine learning systems across intergenerational baselines. Our implementation prototypes include a mobile machine teaching hub, a knowledge repository, and an intelligent interface co-developed with temple-based learning communities in Bali. Together, these components form a socio-technical infrastructure for epistemic co-creation, positioning human–AI interfaces as vital sites for the transmission—and transformation—of cultural memory. This approach presents a replicable model integrating culturally grounded pedagogy with AI development, offering new directions for inclusive, place-based, and pluralistic approaches to intelligent system design."

    "abstract": "University students increasingly face psychological challenges driven by academic, social, and lifestyle pressures—issues that have intensified in the post-pandemic landscape. This study proposes a machine learning-based approach to early identification of mental health risks among undergraduates, utilising non-clinical behavioural data collected through structured surveys at a Thai university. The dataset, comprising 266 entries, was enhanced using SMOTE to balance class distribution and improve model robustness. Three classification algorithms—Random Forest, XGBoost, and Deep Learning—were trained and assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. XGBoost delivered the highest performance, achieving an F1-score of 83.90% and accuracy of 90.60%. Beyond classification, correlation analysis identified key behavioural and psychological predictors of mental health, while K-means clustering uncovered distinct subgroups among at-risk students. The findings underscore the potential of interpretable, data-driven methods to support proactive mental health strategies in educational environments."

    "abstract": "We present an evaluation of the performance of Meteosat Lightning Imager (MTG-LI) in detecting lightning flashes. To achieve this, we applied a Bayesian relative detection efficiency (RDE) analysis using the European ground-based lightning detection network (ALDIS/BLIDS) as reference. The analysis involved pairing each ALDIS/BLIDS stroke/pulse with corresponding MTG-LI level-2 groups. Between July 2024 and January 2025, MTG-LI detected 50 to 54% of groups and 62 to 63% of flashes relative to ALDIS/BLIDS in datasets covering nationwide data (Switzerland and Austria) and dominated by downward cloud-to-ground and intracloud flashes. For context, the International Space Station Lightning Imaging Sensor, assessed with identical matching criteria, reaches only 36.5% group-level and 48.4% flash-level RDE. In regions near tall structures such as the Säntis (2502 m) and Gaisberg (1287 m) towers, where upward flashes dominate, MTG-LI demonstrated significantly higher performance, detecting 68 to 70% of groups and 70 to 73% of flashes relative to ALDIS/BLIDS."

    "abstract": "Driven by the energy internet and digital transformation, new power systems face increasingly complex cybersecurity threats. Their networked and intelligent characteristics pose significant challenges to traditional defense systems. This paper systematically analyzes the evolution of cybersecurity threats in new power systems, reveals the inherent limitations of traditional boundary protection, static rule databases, and single-point defense models, and proposes a cybersecurity protection framework centered on the “predict-defend-respond-recover” full-cycle resilience concept. By integrating active immune mechanisms, dynamic heterogeneous redundant architectures, and collaborative response technologies, a multi-layered protection system covering threat perception and prediction, dynamic defense, and resilient recovery is constructed. The critical supporting roles of cross-domain technologies such as privacy-preserving computation, neuro-symbolic systems, quantum encryption, and blockchain in enhancing resilience are elaborated. The study further outlines future directions from theoretical innovation, technological breakthroughs, and ecosystem collaboration, proposing strategic pathways including the establishment of quantitative resilience evaluation models, the promotion of human-machine collaborative intelligent operation paradigms, and the creation of cross-industry security standard ecosystems. These efforts provide systematic solutions for achieving the resilience goals of “defending against unknown threats and rapidly recovering from known attacks” in new power systems."

Leveraging the advanced capabilities of InSAR techniques and SNAP software, this study provides a new approach to landslide detection by using interferometric techniques, enhancing accuracy and efficiency in monitoring natural hazards. The main objective of this study is to boost the development of an automated landslide prediction system. By processing SAR data using interferometric techniques of the SNAP plugin, we generate displacement data, so that the model can be trained more effectively. Later can be integrated with the prediction software. The analysis revealed landslide parameter benchmarks including displacement and slope. Also, areas with ground displacement above respective benchmarks are prone to landslides. Second, areas with slopes greater than 25% can also potentially cause landslides. Findings suggest that the landslide-prone areas under this study should be given special preference, making it a no-development zone and proceeding with rehabilitation if needed, also authorities should take necessary steps to initiate more studies on this."

    "abstract": "As air transportation expands and present civil aviation communications systems reach their capacity limits in high-density locations, the requirement for new aeronautical communications technology becomes becoming increasingly important. Aviation broadband communication system (ABCS), as a key infrastructure for building the next generation air traffic control system, possess advantages such as low latency, high reliability, and large bandwidth to meet the growing demands of air transportation. However, these systems lack effective information security measures which pose security risks to ground-to-air data transmission. This paper proposes a secure transmission technology for ABCS based on the SM series cipher. The proposed approach utilizes SM4 for data encryption, SM3 for data integrity protection, and Timed Efficient Stream Loss-tolerant Authentication (TESLA) for message source authentication. The experimental results show that this scheme has faster encryption and decryption speeds, lower security overheads, and it can effectively resist the tampering attack, which meets the security requirements of ABCS."

    "abstract": "The 6G era calls for deep convergence between wireless networks and artificial intelligence (AI), transforming the wireless network from a mere data pipe into an intelligent service platform. Data forms the bedrock of this convergence, yet today’s architectures suffer from data silos and interfaces that were not designed for AI workloads, limiting AI deployment. To address these gaps, we propose a data-driven AI-native wireless network (DAIWN) architecture that makes data a central part and positions it as the bridge between network and intelligence functions. Building on this architecture, we define a full-lifecycle data-management framework encompassing data preparation, utilization, exposure and security. We validate this framework in a radio-map-estimation scenario. Compared with a traditional dataset, the proposed data-curation pipeline lowers the mean absolute error from 15.1 dB to 7.7 dB—a 49 % reduction. These findings demonstrate that treating data as a native resource yields tangible gains for AI workloads and offers a practical blueprint for scalable, privacy-aware 6G networks."

    "abstract": "With the surge in new energy installation capacity, the coordination challenges between power generation, grid, and load, along with the risks of generationload imbalance, are becoming increasingly prominent. To address this challenge, both the installation scale and individual capacity of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are growing rapidly. Compared to traditional architectures, high-voltage transformer-less BESS offers advantages including larger single-unit capacity, fewer parallel devices, simplified control strategies, and faster dynamic response, making it particularly suitable for constructing hundred-megawatt-scale large storage systems. However, in highvoltage transformer-less systems, issues such as heterogeneity of massive battery clusters, temperature control, operational diversity, and control time-effectiveness pose higher requirements for cross-industry collaboration and researchers' information integration capabilities. In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), has brought new opportunities to solve these problems. LLMs have made significant progress in natural language processing and demonstrated strong potential for industry applications. In light of this, this paper proposes the development of a “Grid-level Large-capacity High-voltage Transformer-less Battery Energy Storage Large Model” for energy storage system scenarios. This model uses LLMs as its core engine, integrating key capabilities such as battery cluster topology modeling, operational state estimation, health monitoring, and control strategy optimization. It adopts a hybrid architecture design, combining the advantages of local vector retrieval and cloud-based large language models, providing examples for the application of large models in gridlevel large-capacity high-voltage transformer-less battery energy storage systems."

    "abstract": "Energy management in residential homes has become increasingly critical due to rising energy consumption and the integration of smart grid technologies. Accurate forecasting of household energy usage is essential for optimizing energy consumption, reducing costs, and enhancing grid stability. This paper proposes a novel Adaptive Learning Rate eXtreme Gradient Boosting (ALR-XGBoost) model for home energy forecasting, which dynamically adjusts learning rates to improve convergence. Unlike conventional XGBoost, which relies on a fixed learning rate, our approach modifies the learning rate for each sample based on the gradient (first-order derivative) and boosting iteration to accelerate convergence and prevent overfitting. The model is evaluated on real-world home energy datasets, incorporating solar generation data, enhancing prediction accuracy, and making it particularly useful for smart home energy management and demand response strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that ALR-XGBoost outperforms traditional methods, achieving lower error in Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) while improving the Coefficient of Determination (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>) and enhancing generalization in forecasting dynamic energy patterns. By integrating sample-wise adaptive learning rates, our method improves the robustness of energy consumption forecasting, making it particularly valuable for smart home applications, demand response optimization, and sustainable energy management. This research advances energy analytics by enhancing the adaptability of machine learning models for forecasting fluctuating energy patterns in solar-integrated homes."

Electrodes made of different materials were compared in the field conditions. It has been shown that the use of copper and copper-copper sulfate electrodes results in sufficiently low galvanic voltages. Copper electrodes are slightly more convenient for field measurements of soil properties, while copper-copper sulfate electrodes result in lower galvanic voltages. In addition, measurements with larger currents have demonstrated that the use of an additional amplifier is also an acceptable solution to reduce the noise impact."

During the tracking process, only the sampled data output feedback can be used. The slow-sampling rate, output delay and disturbances received by the visual sensor also need to be considered. The limitation of the camera sampling frequency, on the one hand, leads to a decrease in the rate of data transmission, and on the other hand, it generates discrete outputs with time delay. A method with prediction function for the sampling system is needed because the theory of continuous systems is not applicable to this situation. In addition, the disturbance caused by the unknown platform movement and wind disturbance is also inevitable. To alleviate these problems, a time-delay extended state alternating predictive observer (TDESAPO) is developed, which can actively predict the current state and disturbance, and effectively restore the information between sampling points, thereby improving the data transmission rate, that is, the observation rate and the control rate. Using these predictions, a fast-updating controller including disturbance feedforward compensation is designed, thereby enhancing the system’s robustness to disturbance. Through simulation comparison, the effectiveness and practicability of the algorithm are verified."

    "abstract": "Improving images still presents a major challenge in low-light photography as the images are noisy, poor contrast, and unclear. In those instances, conventional photo enhancement techniques may also locate it challenging to preserve exquisite characteristics even as simplifying their visibility. This paper examines Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) as a means of improving the clarity of low-mild photos. We advocate a novel framework using GANs' innovative powers that seeks to increase low-mild photograph best and readability simultaneously. The graph of the proposed model has 2 key components: a generator that enhances image first-rate and a discriminator ensuring the generated picture stays alive and free of artefacts. The model is educated on a massive series of low-mild pix matched with excessive-decision opposite numbers of the identical snap shots. This approves it to apprehend the elaborate relationships among photo characteristics and occasional-mild situations. The goal is to beautify low-light images while retaining the original patterns, sharpness, and noise reduction. In each visible best and numerical criteria as PSNR and SSIM, our GAN-primarily based model outperforms conventional strategies. The system also effectively addresses typical issues such colour distortion and pixelation brought on by conventional enhancement techniques. Low-light photographs in a broad spectrum of context monitoring, medical imaging, and night shooting are made better by this work. The findings imply that in challenging imaging environments, GANs could be a helpful tool to enhance super-resolution picture quality."

    "abstract": "The transformation and upgrading of the automobile industry has spurred the growth of automotive electronic technology. As the industry steps into the high - quality development phase, the safety, comfort, and reliability of vehicles are being steadily enhanced. Automotive electric power steering (EPS), a power-steering system relies on a booster motor to provide auxiliary torque, has emerged as a crucial indicator of the current automotive development and electrification levels. However, under emergency steering conditions, how to effectively control the power steering motor to ensure the reliability and safety of the automobile has become one of the hotspots in research. Hence, an approach called the three-vector model predictive current control (TV-MPCC) is presented to tackle the problems of slow response and insufficient tracking accuracy in the steering assist motor when performing emergency maneuvers at high speeds. Firstly, a dual closed-loop control system for permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) is established, which consists of a velocity loop and a current loop. Secondly, the conventional PID controller of the current loop is substituted with the model predictive current control of the motor, which is deduced to improve the response speed and tracking performance of the system. Ultimately, a control system model is constructed in MATLAB/Simulink to simulate and verify the control strategy, and it is experimentally verified on an electric power steering test bench. The study’s findings suggest that the devised control strategy is capable of remarkably improving the tracking accuracy of the power-assisted motor. Moreover, it can uphold the robustness of the electric power steering (EPS) system during emergency steering scenarios. This not only enhances the driver’s driving experience but also improves driving safety."

    "abstract": "Urban transportation planning faces increasing complexity as cities seek to optimize mobility systems without extensive historical data. This paper presents CI-SGNN (City-Invariant Spatial Graph Neural Network), a novel framework for cross-city bike-sharing demand prediction that leverages Point of Interest (POI) distributions and spatial attention mechanisms. Our approach addresses the critical challenge of predicting categorical mobility demand in new urban environments by learning transferable relationships between urban amenities and travel patterns from source cities. The framework integrates OpenStreetMap POI features with GNNs, enabling zero-shot transfer learning across diverse metropolitan areas. We formulate demand prediction as a multi-class classification problem, categorizing origin-destination pairs into five demand levels. Experimental validation using real CitiBike data from Manhattan and Washington DC demonstrates superior performance, achieving 72.4% accuracy, which overperforms state-of-the-art base-lines. The attention-based spatial aggregation mechanism effectively captures inter-zone dependencies. Our results demonstrate successful zero-shot adaptation capabilities, enabling practical deployment for bike-sharing infrastructure planning in cities lacking historical mobility data using only publicly available urban features."

    "abstract": "Voice cloning and speaking style transfer have attracted much interest in the field of music production. These tasks are greatly aided by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This paper investigates how GAN-based models may be used to replicate sounds and alter the way individuals sing, hence enabling the production of high-quality counterfeit voices. Using data from a person's speech or singing, voice cloning is the technique of creating a mechanical voice that sounds precisely like their own. A profound awareness of the nuances of sound, tone, modulation, and speech patterns is required. Conversely, style transfer is the technique of transforming one voice's tone into another. This allows musicians to fit many kinds of creative forms or music. The major objective of this work is to develop a GAN-based architecture with a generator and a discriminator both enhanced by training them against one another. While the generator produces synthesized singing with the preferred style or voice, the discriminator verifies if the produced output is genuine. Training the proposed model makes use of several voice snippets and song performances. Techniques include spectrum analysis, pitch shifting, and feature extraction are used. The model performed rather well in both voice cloning and style transfer activities, indicating that it can produce phony songs sounding quite similar to the target voice and singing style. This work might enhance music creation, provide artists greater flexibility in their creative processes, and support the development of more individualized voice synthesis technology."

This paper proposes a EV charging load forecasting method based on EV user satisfaction. Firstly, considering the complex structure of urban traffic networks with multiple intersections, a dynamic transportation network model is established that incorporates both link impedance and node impedance. Secondly, the OD matrix method and a four-step transportation demand model are employed to determine the origin and destination points of three types of EVs-private vehicles, taxis, and public service vehicles-and the Dijkstra algorithm is used to plan their travel routes. Thirdly, by considering charging time, on-the-way costs, and electricity prices, a user satisfaction-based charging station selection model is proposed. A corresponding EV charging load forecasting framework is then constructed. Finally, Monte Carlo simulation is used to model the travel and charging behaviors of the three types of EVs. Simulations are conducted on a regional transportation network and distribution system to validate the effectiveness of the proposed user satisfaction-based charging load forecasting method."

Earlier studies rarely considered the multiple constraints aspect in trajectory planning. This paper proposes an adaptive pseudo-spectral to achieve the desired trajectory planning for the variable configuration unmanned aerial vehicle. Based on the gaussian rule, the trajectory planning (i.e. optimal problem) is first transformed into a nonlinear programming problem (NLP). To more accurately solve the differential constraints, the aerodynamic parameters are calculated in different stages for the variable configuration UAV. Combined with flight environments and an objective function, we proposed sequential quadratic programming (SQP) to tackle transformed NLP. The numerical simulation results demonstrate that the planned cruise trajectory can satisfy the optimal requirements and constraint conditions, and it can enable the UAV to reach the target in various cruise altitude cases."

    "abstract": "Phishing continues to pose a serious risk to cybersecurity. Imitated emails, websites, and messages are used to get out the sensitive information including usernames, passwords, banking information and other personally identifiable information. Phishing is particularly damaging because traditional detection techniques tend to ignore advanced or zero-day phishing attempts, causing financial damage and leakage of sensitive information. To combat this emerging issue, we present a novel phishing detection system that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze emails and URLs avatars in real-time. This applies NLP approaches to identify phishing emails based on known linguistic and behavioral phishing patterns. These features detect patterns of suspicious words, syntactic structures, and contextual clues. The system adapts detection models on a regular basis to keep up with emerging phishing tactics like socially engineered or zero-day attacks. The suggested system provides comprehensive detection and notification, warning users before the phishing threats reach their inbox or any engagement. It also integrates seamlessly with current cybersecurity frameworks, so it can be deployed easily without having to replace existing systems. Additionally, the system encourages user awareness by providing safety advice and phishing identification guidelines. It indicate that the NLP-based phishing detection system has a high accuracy of 92%, performing better than most conventional models. These values prove the effectiveness of the system in both correctly identifying phishing attacks and reducing false positives."

A model is developed in Aspen HYSYS for the Claus process. Acid gas decomposition is a desirable method for producing hydrogen since the feedstock is affordable. Hydrogen production can be achieved in Waste Heat Exchanger (WHE) connected after the reaction furnace and followed by Claus catalytic reactors. While the H2S decomposition was defined by the thermodynamic in the furnace. Preheating the acid gas i.e., mainly H2S and CO2 before entering into the furnace would increase the percentage of hydrogen production. The composition of acid gas entering into the SRU plays an important role in sulphur and hydrogen yield. Three different feed compositions of acid gas were studied with the developed model in which the optimum is found. The optimum feed composition has a greater percentage of hydrogen yield. This notable increase in hydrogen yield can significantly enhance hydrogen production for SRUs."

    "abstract": "Tracking reference signals (TRS) are essential in the 5G New Radio (NR) physical layer (PHY) for enabling user equipment (UE) to maintain synchronization and accurately estimate channel state information (CSI), especially under high mobility or at higher frequencies. TRS are transmitted periodically by the base station (BS), but this periodicity introduces an energy trade-off. Frequent TRS transmissions improve synchronization and reduce bit error rate (BER), particularly for fast-moving UEs. However, they also increase BS transmission energy and prevent UEs from entering low-power sleep modes, thereby increasing UE energy consumption due to constant TRS processing. On the other hand, less frequent TRS transmissions reduce BS energy overhead and allow UEs to conserve energy by remaining idle longer. However, this can lead to clock drift and reduced synchronization accuracy at the UE, resulting in higher BER and increased data retransmissions, which also consume energy. This paper investigates how TRS periodicity affects energy consumption at both the BS and UE ends using MATLAB’s 5G Toolbox. Simulations are conducted under various UE mobility scenarios, with TRS periodicities ranging from 10 ms to 80 ms. Results show that while lower periodicities ensure better synchronization and reliability, they burden the BS and disrupt UE sleep cycles. Conversely, higher periodicities benefit the BS but increase energy costs at the UE due to synchronization loss. The study highlights the critical trade-off between network energy efficiency and communication robustness, guiding selecting TRS configurations in energy-aware 5G deployments for optimized communication."

    "abstract": "As autonomous driving technology advances, the ability to accurately perceive risks and execute efficient behavioral strategies in real-world traffic scenarios has become critical for performance evaluation. Decision-making algorithms are central to ensuring safety and effectiveness. Addressing the shortcomings of existing systems in comprehensively accounting for risk factors in complex traffic environments, this paper proposes a visual risk perception-based autonomous driving decision model. By integrating visual risk quantification with deep reinforcement learning, the framework evaluates diverse environmental risks to make safer, more rational decisions across varying risk conditions. First, BEVD4D object detection model processes image inputs to achieve vision-based speed estimation. Second, to overcome traditional risk assessment limitations in capturing traffic complexity, a driving risk field model is introduced, considering lane lines, static and dynamic obstacles, and employing a \"pseudo-distance\" metric to better represent real-world complexity. This model underpins the design of subsequent decision strategies. Finally, the risk field model is embedded into a deep reinforcement learning framework by expanding the state space and reward function of the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, enhancing risk-aware decision-making. Experiments on the CARLA simulation platform demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the method in urban streets and complex intersections, resulting in safer, more adaptive, and interpretable autonomous driving decisions."

This paper proposes a semantic communication system that combines pre-trained language models for semantic coding and decoding with fully connected layers for channel processing. To enable end-to-end training with QAM modulation, we employ the Gumbelsoftmax trick as a differentiable approximation of hard symbol sampling. This approach allows semantic embeddings to be mapped onto constellation points while preserving gradient flow. The system is evaluated under fading channels using BLEU and BERTScore as performance metrics. Results show that Gumbel-softmax-based QAM modulation demonstrates competitive performance across different SNR levels, highlighting its robustness in noisy conditions. These findings confirm the effectiveness of combining semantic coding with differentiable modulation for future communication systems."

    "abstract": "Maritime transportation is the backbone of global trade, but increased ship traffic density also increases safety risks. Accurate ship route prediction is key to improving situational awareness and preventing incidents. This study aims to improve the accuracy of ship route prediction by comparing the performance of the standard BiGRU model and the BiGRU model optimized through HDBSCAN-based clustering. This analysis uses vessel movement data obtained from the Automatic Identification System (AIS), which provides real-time navigation information. The proposed approach includes trace compression using the Ramer–Douglas–Peucker algorithm, similarity measurement using the Hausdorff distance, dimension reduction using Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), and adaptive density-based clustering using HDBSCAN. Prediction models are built using BiGRU networks on each cluster. Experimental results on three test sub-trajectories show that integrating HDBSCAN with BiGRU generally results in lower prediction error rates. The average reduction in MAE reached approximately 18%, MAPE approximately 20%, MSE approximately 44%, and RMSE approximately 20%, compared to the BiGRU model without clustering. The model demonstrated high prediction accuracy in some clusters, particularly those with uniform movement patterns, indicating the effectiveness of the clustering approach for complex trajectory data. These findings suggest that applying clustering before modeling can improve prediction accuracy, especially for complex and heterogeneous ship track data. This research contributes to the development of more adaptive and reliable intelligent maritime navigation systems."

Conventional cardiovascular sensors, such electrocardiography machines and cuffed sphygmomanometers, are heavy and challenging for people to use on a regular basis. The proposed anxiety management method suggests using wearable sensor to measure a person's biomarkers with photoplethysmography. It supplies a filtered electric signal that yields the useable AC component required for additional analysis. Several algorithms are applied to the collected data in order to determine and display the stress level. If the individual is deemed to be overly anxious, they are redirected to an iconvobot, a conversational chatbot. It serves as an assistive device to help the user during mental stress."

    "abstract": "Combining model predictive control (MPC) with control barrier functions (CBFs) is a promising solution for addressing safety-critical control problems in robot navigation scenarios. The primary limitation of existing methods lies in their inability to simultaneously reduce computational complexity for nonlinear systems and ensure the feasibility of MPC-CBF frameworks. We propose a shield sequential quadratic programming model predictive control scheme as a method of combining MPC and CBFs for general nonlinear system to address this challenge. Using CBFs as a dual-layer filter, we translate the hard constraints of MPC-CBF to the combination of soft constraints and a control shield. The effectiveness of our proposed method is illustrated in the simulation of 2-D robot navigation environment."

We used the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD) and compared six algorithms: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Random Forest (RF), AdaBoost (AB), Ensemble Extra Trees (EET), and Histogram-based Gradient Boosting Classification Tree (HGB). Monte Carlo Cross-Validation (MCCV) with 1000 repetitions was employed to evaluate average F 1 -score and standard deviation. The results indicated that the Ensemble Extra Trees (EET) achieved the best performance, with an average F 1 -score of 95.26% and a standard deviation of 1.11%, highlighting its high precision and stability. HGB and AB also showed good F1-score but with higher variability, while LDA, QDA, and RF performed worse. In conclusion, EET proved to be the most promising algorithm for automated breast cancer diagnosis based on the WBCD."

The study is based on experimentally recorded instantaneous values of voltage and current, covering different periods of the day - day and night load mode. The main consumers in the electrical network are personal computers and LED lighting systems, which draw nonsinusoidal currents and lead to voltage distortion. By calculating power quality indicators, a quantitative assessment of the impact of these loads on the quality of the power supply is derived. The results highlight the need for monitoring and implementing corrective measures to improve the electromagnetic compatibility and efficiency of the electrical distribution network in buildings with predominantly nonlinear loads."

This paper proposes a causal intervention for efficient local explanations with cross-instance knowledge sharing, which quantifies the causal effect of input features on model decisions through causal intervention operations. Our approach employs genetic algorithms to search for the most explanatory feature subsets in high-dimensional feature spaces and introduces a global experience matrix to enable cross-instance causal knowledge sharing. Through comparative analysis conducted on the ImageNet validation dataset employing VGG-16 and ResNet-50, our proposed methodology demonstrates superior results when evaluated using the ADCC comprehensive assessment framework.

To address this issue, we propose a post-hoc explainability framework that enhances the interpretability of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) in traffic congestion forecasting. The framework leverages the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to extract key subgraphs from the prediction graph and transforms the interpretation of regional traffic forecasts into human-understandable natural language descriptions. We validate the framework using 16 weeks of minute-level traffic flow data on a 6×7 grid road network in Shanghai simulated on SUMO. Results show that when predictions are made using explanatory subgraphs rather than their complements, the explainer model’s MAE drops from 0.836 to 0.225—a 73.1% reduction in relative error. Moreover, the average sparsity of the extracted subgraphs exceeds 96%."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a theoretical and numerical analysis of space charge generation on metallic objects of varying geometries exposed to electric fields associated with lightning. The study focuses on the stepped leader and return stroke phases of cloud-to-ground lightning, where local electric fields near grounded metallic protrusions may reach values sufficient to initiate streamer discharges. Using a previously proposed field enhancement model, electric field intensities at the tip of hemispherical conductors with diameters ranging from 0.1 mm to 16 mm are computed for needle heights of 10 mm and 1000 mm. The results are analyzed under ambient electric field conditions of 1 MV/m to 200 kV/m, characteristic of natural lightning fields. It is shown that for slender conductors with tip diameters below 0.5 mm and heights exceeding 1 m, the local field may surpass the critical threshold of ~100 MV/m required for space charge generation, even in ambient fields as low as 50 kV/m. This helps explain field-induced ionization observed well before return stroke onset. The analysis incorporates Fowler–Nordheim tunnelling and Peek’s criterion to differentiate corona emission, cold field emission, and streamer inception thresholds. Implications for lightning protection, high-voltage insulation design, and electromagnetic compatibility are discussed, particularly in the context of tall installations and complex geometries."

We propose an end-to-end framework that enhances visual perception through causal intervention and guides behavior decision-making using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). First, a causality-aware object detection module is introduced to reduce contextual bias by learning interventional representations. Then, visual and historical state information is encoded into structured prompts, enabling MLLMs to perform natural language-based reasoning and generate interpretable driving commands. Experimental results on multiple complex scenarios show that our method improves generalization, robustness, and decision consistency compared to conventional baselines."

Traditional detection technology has limitations such as insufficient penetration, complex operation and low efficiency. In contrast, microwave non-destructive testing technology has great potential due to its advantages of non-contact, high penetration and high resolution. Aiming at the demand for rapid and accurate detection of basin insulator defects, based on the Novelda X4 chip, a low-power, portable pulse ultra-wideband MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) radar array system is designed in this paper. Ultra-wideband pulse technology and MIMO radar array technology are employed to significantly improves spatial resolution of microwave imaging. To find defects of a 252 kV ventilated basin insulator, such as surface metal particles, internal bubbles and surface cracks, an experimental platform is built, and the imaging algorithms of DAS (Delay and Sum) and DMAS (Delay Multiply and Sum) are used to process echo data. The experimental results show that the pulse ultra-wideband MIMO radar method can effectively identify the above defects, verifying the feasibility of applying microwave non-destructive testing to basin insulator defect diagnosis, but the defect location accuracy and size quantification accuracy still need to be further improved."

Experiments were conducted on 500 kV cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) insulated AC cables, and results demonstrate that the PCMs coating effectively improves both the steady-state current carrying capacity and dynamic overload capability of the cable. This technology requires no external energy supply, offers easy installation, and presents strong practical value for engineering applications."

The proposed approach combines state-of-the-art environmental sensing technology with real-time data acquisition and rule-based analysis to support early detection of critical conditions affecting crop development. What is novel in this contribution is the unified architecture that allows flexible deployment across different agricultural contexts and the implementation of a threshold-based risk detection mechanism tailored to specific crop requirements. Our system continuously monitors key environmental parameters such as soil moisture, air temperature, humidity, and solar radiation. Data is transmitted through low-power wireless protocols and processed on a central platform, where predefined thresholds trigger alerts when conditions become unfavorable for plant growth. This enables timely intervention, preventing potential damage and supporting optimal crop health. The proposed method has been tested in two ongoing research projects: OENOTRACE, which focuses on monitoring vineyard conditions, and SIOTIN, which targets climate control and disease prevention in greenhouse environments. The results highlight the system's flexibility and effectiveness in different cultivation settings, offering a scalable and cost-efficient solution for precision agriculture. By integrating sensing, realtime monitoring, and automated alerts, the system contributes to reducing risks and optimizing decision-making in agricultural management."

    "abstract": "The demand for wind power systems is increasing in response to the global challenge of climate change. On the other hand, the critical wind turbine damage caused by lightning strikes continues unabated. In order to ensure the protection of wind turbines from lightning strikes, it is important to detect damage caused by such strikes and to take appropriate action. However, the development of a system capable of remotely and automatically detecting lightning damage to wind turbines has not yet been achieved. The wind turbine that was struck by lightning cannot be restarted until the absence of damage has been confirmed in Japan, thus leading to decreased availability, which is regarded as a problem. This study considers a method capable of remotely and automatically detecting lightning damage to wind turbines. The approach involves conducting an anomaly detection of the blade, based on monitoring data observed by the Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition system. An anomaly detection model utilizing an autoencoder was constructed and applied to analyze data obtained from wind turbines affected by lightning damage. The findings indicate a strong likelihood of identifying blade anomalies resulting from lightning events."

This transition amplifies power and electricity balance risks due to the inherent volatility of high-penetration renewables and load fluctuations. Consequently, developing accurate assessment methodologies for power and electricity balance in renewable power systems is critical. This paper proposes a power and electricity balance assessment method based on time-series production simulation with source-load uncertainty. First, day-ahead uncertainty for load demand and wind/solar generation is modeled using multi-scenario technology, while intra-day uncertainty is characterized through fuzzy mathematics theory. Subsequently, a comprehensive source-grid-load-storage model is established for high-penetration renewable power systems, incorporating a two-stage day-ahead-intra-day optimization model. Finally, a time-series operational simulation minimizing both operating costs and risk costs under uncertainty generates quantitative power and electricity balance assessment indicators. Practical case studies validate the proposed method's effectiveness in addressing power balance risks and renewable energy accommodation challenges."

    "abstract": "The embedded subscriber identity module (eSIM) technology has the potential to revolutionize mobile subscribers’ applications, transforming mobile network operators (MNOs) design and price their service offerings. As eSIM adoption accelerates, competition among MNOs, especially in prepaid markets, is intensifying. Traditional prepaid plans, based on fixed data and time allotments, often misalign with actual user consumption, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper presents OPTeSIM, a data-driven model for designing a finite set of optimal prepaid plans to maximize provider revenue. We model a user’s consumption as an average usage rate (data/time) and posits that a user selects the plan with the closest matching plan usage rate. We formulate the design problem as the minimization of total customer loss, the monetized value of unused data or time, which is dependent on the probability density function (PDF) of customer usage rates. The necessary condition for optimality requires that each plan rate equalizes the probability mass of the user distribution it captures on its left and right boundaries. We propose a numerical algorithm that approximates this solution using historical usage data. The model’s efficacy is demonstrated using two MNO datasets. For a real-world dataset of 0.5 million users, OPTeSIM plans captured $78 \\%$ of the subscribers when offered alongside the MNO’s 21 existing plans, resulting in a 3.6 fold increase in total profit. A second evaluation on a statistical dataset of one million users further confirmed that our model leads to improved profitability and higher user adoption compared to existing plans. The advantage grows with catalog size and approaches the performance of personalized pricing as the number of plans increases."

    "abstract": "A simulation driven approach was employed to investigate the effect of the structural design parameters on reflectivity and low side lobe levels (SLL) of a uniform fiber Bragg grating sensor (FBG). Although FBG sensor offers many advantages over conventional electronic sensors, its design is crucial to get desired spectral performance. High reflectivity and low SLL are essential to obtain high detection sensitivity in medical sensing applications. The uniform FBG is simple to fabricate and inexpensive which can provide the desired level of reflectivity. However, its performance is limited mainly due to higher SLL which degrades the signal quality in medical sensing applications. The apodization techniques can reduce SLL improving detection sensitivity but they also increase design and fabrication complexity. The reflectivity and SLL of FBG sensor depends on structural parameters such as grating length, grating period and modulation index. The careful selection of these parameters and optimization can improve the spectral response of uniform FBG sensor. The effect of structural parameters is investigated to determine optimal reflectivity and SLL. This can provide less complex and low-cost sensing solutions in medical applications where high reflectivity and moderate SLLs are acceptable."

Based on this, a fully functional prototype was developed, with a smart mirror interface, that detects basic emotions to trigger the construction of motivational stories for San youth. The system was evaluated through feedback sessions with youth and elders, focusing on emotional resonance, cultural appropriateness, and contextual understanding. Results showed that participants responded positively to stories grounded in their lived experiences and traditional wisdom, confirming the importance of contextual knowledge bases.

However, traditional state feedback designs do not explicitly address passivity characteristics, potentially leading to non-passivity. To address this issue, this paper proposes a port admittance passivation method that integrates proportional state feedback with loop delay compensation. This approach mitigates the impact of delay-induced phase shifts and subsequently utilizes pole placement based on the delay compensation effect, thereby enhancing system passivity. Compared to existing methods, it achieves favorable reference tracking and load disturbance rejection capabilities while avoiding the complex pole-zero calculations typically involved in passivity design, significantly reducing the computational burden. And in both strong (SCR = 11) and weak (SCR=7) grid conditions, it can ensure the stability of the Grid-following inverter and the safe operation of the grid. Finally, experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed design."

Originally published in the mid-1990s, MIL-HDBK-217 Rev F, Notice 2 does not adequately reflect the performance characteristics or failure mechanisms of contemporary components such as high-efficiency dc-dc converters. There is an issue with the existing revision <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{F}$</tex> (released in 1995). It has not been revised for some decades and is therefore outdated. Currently, the quality of parts being produced today is generally higher. The validity of revising MIL-HDBK-217 relies on leveraging work that has been performed by other organizations in the area of reliability prediction. Revision G (released 2008) will likely include updated MIL-HDBK-217 <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\pi$</tex> - stress factors determined by the VMEbus International Trade Association (VITA) industry working group in reliability, also named ANSI-VITA 51.1).

Traditional VM scheduling methods often result in inefficient migrations, higher energy consumption, and frequent SLA violations due to unpredictable resource usage patterns. In the proposed methodology, a modified catkin optimization (MCO) algorithm is used for analyzing historical VM resource trends and applies a deep gradient-free local learning model for forecasting future usage. Stock market data, specifically the Shanghai Composite Index (000001) with 5951 trading days collected from Yahoo Finance (1997-2022), is used to model time-series behavior applicable to VM load trends. These predictions are used to optimize VM-to-host migration decisions, reducing unnecessary movements and improving overall efficiency. The results demonstrate that the model significantly reduces SLA violations, lowers energy consumption, and minimizes the number of VM migrations. The proposed framework showed up to 75 % fewer migrations, a 60 % drop in SLA violations, and up to 16 % energy savings compared to conventional methods."

Yet in visualization research, framing has been examined mostly through its rhetorical and perceptual effects on audiences, leaving its role in the design process underexplored. This study addresses that gap by analyzing publicly available podcasts and book chapters in which over 80 professional visualization designers reflect on their work. We find that framing is a pervasive, iterative activity, evident in scoping problems, interpreting data, aligning with stakeholder goals, and shaping narrative direction. Our analysis identifies the conditions that trigger reframing and the strategies practitioners use to navigate uncertainty and guide design. These findings position framing as a core dimension of visualization practice and underscore the need for research and education to support the interpretive and strategic judgment that practitioners exercise throughout the design process."

The Z-matrix used in the optimization process is derived from numerical simulations of stacked layers composed of metallic strip dipoles over a finite ground plane.

    "abstract": "The theoretical capability of modular robots to recover their original configuration or function after disintegration caused by external impacts has been cited as an advantage for planetary exploration. The key to achieving self-recovery lies in addressing the stochasticity of disintegration. Here, a self-recovery strategy is proposed for modular planetary exploration robots. Firstly, the recovery process is analyzed to construct a strategy framework and provide the problem definitions and strategy assumptions. Secondly, by standardizing the selection criteria for meta-modules under the stochasticity of disintegration, non-mobile modules can acquire mobility through the meta-module method, thereby laying the groundwork for executable self-recovery. Finally, a comprehensive optimization model is proposed, which encompasses the module interactions arising from stochastic disintegration. By integrating selfrecovery characteristics with the simulated annealing algorithm, a solution method is designed to obtain self-recovery plans. Extensive hardware experiments were conducted, and the results demonstrate that the self-recovery strategy operates stably and executes successfully across various configurations and scenarios, thereby validating the feasibility and reliability. In this way, the self-recovery strategy and experiments could substantially advance the application of modular robots in space exploration, while also providing insights for other areas, such as assembly planning and applications involving non-mobile modular robots."

    "abstract": "In this work, we study the joint scheduling and power allocation problem of vision-based remote control systems, where multiple devices upload their image states to a central controller and receive control actions. Due to the high dimensionality of the image states and to manage the lack of radio resources, we propose a novel self-supervised learning approach to predict the devices’ joint control and wireless dynamics in latent space, enabling wireless resource optimization without compromising the control objectives of the remote control system. Our method leverages two coupled joint-embedding predictive architectures (JEPAs): a control JEPA models the control transition dynamics and guides the predictions of a wireless JEPA, which captures the dynamics of the device’s channel state information (CSI) through cross-modal conditioning. We then train a deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to derive a control policy from latent control dynamics and a power predictor to estimate scheduling slots with favorable channel conditions based on latent CSI representations. To enhance control reliability, we employ an efficient ensemble technique to estimate the uncertainty of JEPA predictions. The two JEPAs are used by the remote controller to forecast future latent trajectories of the devices’ control and wireless states, allowing the controller to proactively plan its scheduling policy using model predictive control (MPC). Simulation results, conducted in a customized image-based control environment with ray tracing, demonstrate that our proposed approach converges three times faster and reduces transmit power by over 50% while maintaining control performance comparable to baseline methods that do not account for wireless resource optimization."

However, existing studies often overlook the impact of constrained and heterogeneous edge resources, leading to synchronization bottlenecks and limited deployment efficiency. To address these challenges, this paper proposes EI-Cooper, an Edge Intelligence (EI)-enhanced cooperative framework for adaptive and efficient CP in heterogeneous vehicular networks. The novelty of EI-Cooper is fourfold. First, we leverage key EI techniques including selective cooperation, model pruning and bandwidth allocation to jointly coordinate the perception, computation, communication within the CP pipeline. To the best of our knowledge, EI-Cooper represents the first attempt to extend CP with EI capabilities. Secondly, we formulate a <underline xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">S</u>ynchronization-<underline xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">E</u>fficient <underline xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">C</u>ooperative <underline xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">P</u>erception (SECP) problem, which jointly determines edge selection, pruning ratios and bandwidths to balance end-to-end synchronization efficiency and perception accuracy.

By establishing a 3D tensor dictionary that jointly discretizes the angular and non-circular phase domains, we formulate the multiparameter estimation as a constrained tensor recovery task. The proposed block TSR framework introduces a block diagonalized tensor decomposition scheme that enables parallel subproblem optimization while preserving parameter coupling, then the estimates of DOA are obtained by Lasso's algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed method can still achieve higher angle estimation accuracy with lower signal-to-noise ratio compared with the classical sparse representation and state of the art block sparse representation methods."

    "abstract": "Medical imaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of various diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular conditions, and respiratory disorders such as asthma, pneumonia, and even COVID-19. Nowadays, Deep Learning (DL) has demonstrated remarkable accuracy in disease detection and diagnosis using medical imaging such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs. However, DL models mostly require access to sensitive patient data not only to capture the images but also to store them in the data cloud, which raises major privacy concerns. To solve this problem, several techniques such as Differential Privacy (DP) and Federated Learning (FL), have been developed. These methods allow models to learn useful patterns without exposing personal details. Building on these developments, the key gap this review targets is the lack of a recent, side-by-side analysis that connects medical tasks, DL architectures, FL designs, and DP budgets with real-world performance and resilience against privacy attacks. Motivated by this gap, we conducted a systematic review of the literature (SLR) of studies published between 2023 and 2025 that used DL principles with privacy-preserving methods for medical diagnosis. Utilizing the PRISMA framework, we reviewed 23 peer-reviewed articles and grouped them into four categories: included COVID-19, skin lesions, Alzheimer’s disease, and other conditions such as diabetic retinopathy, kidney disease, and heart problems. We sort results by modality, model family, FL topology, DP mechanism, and reported threat model. Furthermore, the review significantly represents that CNN-based models with DP and FL methods are the most common choices, and developed pipelines with these models often achieve accuracy above 90%. At the same time, the review found gaps such as limited real-world testing, a lack of diverse datasets, and underuse of advanced DP approaches. Based on these results, we recommend building larger and more varied datasets, improving privacy-utility trade-offs, and testing models in clinical environments."

    "abstract": "To address key production challenges such as unstable ore output caused by the wide distribution and strong fluctuation of ore grades in underground metal mines, a multi-metal and multi-objective blending optimization model was established with four object ives: maximizing profit, minimizing dynamic grade fluctuation, minimizing production deviation, and minimizing ore type blending ratio. To effectively address uncertainty, the Uncertainty-Aware Feasibility Boundary Tracking Constrained Archival Evolution Algorithm (U-FDT-C-TAEA) is proposed by integrating uncertainty perception and feasibility boundary tracking into the classical Constrained Archival Evolution Algorithm (C-TAEA). First, the uncertainty-weighted congestion distance (U-WCD) mechanism is introduced to enhance the distribution robustness of the solution set by evaluating the stability of target response under multi-disturbance scenarios. Second, a feasibility drift tracker (FDT) mechanism is designed to improve the efficiency of screening and retaining potential feasible solutions by dynamically tracking the evolution trends of infeasible solutions near the constraint boundaries. This approach is further combined with Monte Carlo simulations to account for random variations in key parameters. A monthly production case study from an underground metal mine demonstrates that, under the same production plan, the optimized scheme reduces total ore output by 4.42%, increases the expected profit to 5.85×1011 CNY, controls production deviation within 27.80%, and maintains ore type blending ratios below 41.2%. Overall, the proposed approach outperforms the original and benchmark algorithms, significantly improving the mine’s economic efficiency."

Classical centrality measures such as degree centrality (DC), betweenness centrality (BC), and K-shell (KS) are increasingly being supplemented or replaced by more effective gravity-based alternatives such as gravity centrality (GC), KS based on GC (KSGC), and GGC. However, existing gravity-based methods further enhance node quality based on single attributes, often neglecting the crucial role of edges as communication channels for information dissemination in unweighted networks. A neighborhood potential-edge-weight gravity centrality (NPGC) considering both the degree of node and the information interaction capability of its neighbors for identifying key nodes is proposed. The potential edge weights, which represent the strength of information interaction between nodes, are defined to capture neighborhood information. The simulation of SIR model is employed on nine real-world unweighted and undirected datasets to assess the efficiency of NPGC. Experimental results show that, compared with eight existing methods, the proposed method has high accuracy and good differentiation."

To address this, the paper investigates the dual-motor coupled-drive EMT, revealing the impact mechanisms of vibration energy coupling effects on dynamic behaviors under asymmetric loads. Based on the discovery of this effect, an EMT input-output decoupling control framework is proposed. By employing dynamic compensation for asymmetric disturbances and incorporating considerations of the dynamic response-elastic oscillation trade-off into the control framework, an EMT dynamic coordination-decoupling control strategy for torsional vibration suppression and power stability is ultimately developed. Simulation and experiments validate that this strategy is capable of addressing the dynamic response-elastic oscillation trade-off under asymmetric load conditions, significantly reducing system torsional vibrations while maintaining output power stability."

    "abstract": "This article presents a novel Moiré-effect-inspired reconfigurable electromagnetic wavefront modulation method based on cascaded metasurface, achieving dynamic conical beam generation with a variable tensor angle. The phase distribution is transformed from Cartesian coordinate to polar coordinates to meet the requirements of the Moiré effect. By rotating the cascaded metasurface, the Moiré effect is excited, achieving changes in the equivalent total phase, thereby realizing the reconfigurable tensor angle of the conical beam, which is a challenging yet important issue that is difficult to achieve in traditional conical beamforming. Furthermore, a low-loss transmission unit is designed for constructing the proposed Moiré-effect-inspired electromagnetic modulator and experimental verification, which is designed to overcome the high loss introduced by the cascaded metasurface structure. Simulation and measurement results indicate that the proposed device can generate conical beams with different and discrete tensor angles by rotating the cascaded metasurfaces. The proposed modulator achieves reconfigurable conical beamforming while avoiding the complex reconfigurable feeding networks and substantial loading of active components in traditional reconfigurable methods. Owing to its passive structure, the system offers a compact and cost-effective solution for reconfigurable conical beamforming in 6G communications."

    "abstract": "In next-generation (xG) wireless communication networks, developing generalizable learning models that inherently adapt to diverse conditions is crucial. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for subchannel (SC) allocation in low Earth orbit satellite (LEOS)-assisted integrated access and backhauling (IAB) networks. We consider an integrated terrestrial-satellite network, where a LEOS provides backhaul services to cellular base stations (BSs) in remote areas while forwarding data from mobile user equipments (UEs) to the core network. The objective is to maximize the achievable rate for UEs while satisfying demand requirements and backhaul constraints. To ensure generalizable and efficient SC allocation across environments, we formulate the resource management problem as an invariant policy learning framework, which is decomposed into two subproblems: state representation learning and policy optimization. Our approach learns state representations that remain invariant across diverse environments. Additionally, the invariant policy, obtained from the hypergraph output layer, captures the fundamental causes of successful actions, enabling robust decision-making. By embedding problem constraints into both the model architecture and the training objective, the framework enhances the transparency of the invariant policy optimization process. Furthermore, we derive a data-dependent generalization bound that characterizes the policy’s performance in unseen environments. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed policy consistently outperforms traditional methods across multiple environments."

    "abstract": "Distributed fiber optic sensing (DFOS) holds significant promise for providing real-time monitoring and surveillance capabilities in deployed metro networks. By leveraging dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) technology, sensing channels can be integrated alongside communication channels, thereby enabling simultaneous high-capacity data transmission and fiber sensing application. However, because of the shared propagation path, fiber nonlinearities can induce significant crosstalk between the communication and sensing channels, particularly in metro pointtopoint (P2P) links longer than 80 km. In this paper, we investigate the in-band WDM coexistence case of distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) and communication channels over metro link, considering both co-propagating and counter-propagating configurations. Penalties in communication channels, due to fiber nonlinearities caused by DAS pulse, are comprehensively analyzed through numerical simulations and experimental demonstrations across the full C-band, with a 40<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\lambda \\times$</tex-math></inline-formula> 800Gb/s = 32Tb/s line-rate coherent transmission over a 90km fiber span. As less reported, the adverse effects on communication channels of stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) and nonlinear polarization rotation are investigated when the coexistence system utilizes conventional pulse-based DAS setup. In coexistence system, we observe that nonlinear polarization rotation can present a greater challenge to the receiver digital signal processing (DSP) of communication receiver than the commonly believed cross-phase modulation (XPM) induced phase noise. Furthermore, by comparing pulse-based DAS with pulse-compression DAS, our findings indicate that pulse-compression DAS imposes negligible performance penalties on legacy coherent receivers, highlighting its significant potential for adoption in future integrated sensing and communication coexistence systems."

    "abstract": "Multiplicative Gamma noise poses a major challenge in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging, severely degrading image quality and complicating downstream interpretation tasks. Although deep learning techniques have demonstrated remarkable denoising capabilities, their performance often deteriorates on real-world data due to deviations from idealized noise models and various environmental interferences. To address these limitations, we propose a novel speckle noise removal model, named AAP-NDE, based on a non-divergence diffusion equation guided by adversarial attack priors. By incorporating prior knowledge of potential adversarial perturbations, the model adaptively adjusts diffusion coefficients: larger coefficients are applied in homogeneous or heavily corrupted regions to suppress noise effectively, while smaller coefficients are employed near edges and fine structures to preserve critical image details.We theoretically establish the existence and uniqueness of the model solution, ensuring mathematical soundness. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real SAR images demonstrate that AAP-NDE achieves strong robustness against adversarial attacks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both noise suppression and structure preservation. These results highlight the potential of AAP-NDE for reliable and practical SAR image processing in challenging scenarios."

    "abstract": "Indonesia, with its strategic location on the equator, boasts an abundance of solar energy, making rooftop solar power systems (RSPS) a promising solution for sustainable electricity generation. However, the financial viability of these systems is significantly influenced by fluctuating interest rates. This study aims to assess how changes in interest rates impact the techno-economic performance of RSPS in Indonesia. Using HOMER Pro software, the research simulates different interest rate scenarios—low, medium, and high—to examine how they affect key technical factors, such as the optimal PV configuration and energy output, as well as economic metrics like capital costs, operating expenses, and return on investment (ROI). The findings reveal that while interest rates do not directly alter the technical aspects of the systems, they have a notable effect on the economic side. Higher interest rates lead to increased operating costs and a rise in the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), making the systems less financially attractive. These results underscore the importance of considering economic variables like interest rates when planning solar energy projects and suggest that future policies should account for financial fluctuations to ensure optimal investment strategies."

In a hybrid microgrid, power flow control is essential to preserve stability, maximize resource use and incorporate renewable energy sources. Effective control strategies guarantee that power generation matches demand with a variety of resources including solar PV, wind and storage, preventing voltage and frequency instabilities. The power flow of hybrid microgrids can be controlled using converters and flexible AC transmission systems (FACTs) devices. Droop control method and unified interphase power controller (UIPC) will be discussed here. UIPC offers a potential solution by coordinating series and shunt converters to manage both real and reactive power flow dynamically."

The randomness of the data generated after postprocessing was statistically analyzed using the NIST Statistical Test Suite, specifically the NIST SP 800-22 Test. Autocorrelation and Hamming Distance were also performed to analyze the randomness. Hardware resource analysis was performed, comparing the power dissipated, the number of logic elements (LEs) used, and the block RAM used across all five architectures. Upon analysis, it was concluded that a PDL-based TRNG with a parallel LFSR as a post-processing technique generated highly random data, as it passed all 16 NIST tests while dissipating optimal power, consuming 3 % of the total LEs and 53.6% of the overall block RAM to produce 2 million true random bits."

First, the output characteristics of three typical grid-connected control modes (PQ type, PV type, and PI type) of DPV are analyzed. Next, corresponding pseudo-measurement physical quantities are designed for each mode's core control objective, and a state estimation model is developed. Finally, simulation results verify that the proposed model meets the requirements of state estimation accuracy, thereby confirming the validity of the proposed pseudo-measurement physical quantity modeling method and the state estimation model."

This study investigates unsupervised approaches for land cover identification using Sentinel-2 imagery collected from the Kantarawichai District in Thailand. A dataset comprising 211 manually delineated regions was extracted, with each region represented by a normalized 10-dimensional spectral vector. Five unsupervised methods were evaluated: k-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN, Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), and Autoencoder-based Clustering. Experimental results show that Autoencoder-based Clustering achieved superior performance, yielding the highest Silhouette Score (0.62), the lowest Davies-Bouldin Index (0.62), and the best Adjusted Rand Index (0.71), indicating its effectiveness in capturing non-linear spectral relationships and enhancing cluster separability. SOM also delivered strong results, while traditional methods and DBSCAN exhibited moderate to lower performance due to their limitations in handling high-dimensional spectral data. Overall, the findings highlight that unsupervised techniques, especially those involving representation learning, offer a promising solution for land cover mapping in data-scarce environments without relying on external labeled datasets.

Traditional financial forecasting models often fail to capture the nonlinearities and sudden shifts in time series data, particularly under conditions of high volatility and uncertainty. This research addresses these limitations by proposing a cloud-enabled hybrid deep learning model that integrates long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) for real-time financial forecasting. The main objective of this study is to enhance the predictive accuracy of capital inflow and outflow trends while improving the robustness and scalability of the forecasting process using cloud infrastructure.

Experimental evaluations were performed on the financial dataset provided by the Alibaba cloud “Capital Flow Input/ Output Prediction” competition. The proposed CNN-LSTM model achieved an accuracy of 94.38 % and RMSE as low as 0.2024, outperforming ARIMA and other benchmark models. Additionally, RKO-based optimization improved CPU utilization to 80.1 % and reduced resource cost to $0.225/hour while maintaining high resource availability at 99.853 %.

The power quality issues of charging facilities have also become increasingly important. Traditionally, it was believed that the performance of charging piles based on PWM rectification technology was excellent, with no harmonic components in the AC current waveform and the current phase fully tracking the corresponding phase voltage. As a result, it was thought that there were no power quality problems. However, the charging piles and stations that have actually been put into operation have exhibited characteristics such as current waveform distortion and the current phase leading the voltage. At present, there is no clear research conclusion on whether these problems are isolated phenomena or common issues. This paper selects several typical DC charging piles and large-scale charging stations for field measurements. Through extensive data analysis, it has been clarified harmonic current and capacitive reactive power are common phenomena in charging piles and stations. A method using the APF device is proposed to solve the harmonic and reactive power problems of charging piles and stations, and the correctness and feasibility of the proposed method has been verified by the simulation results."

The objective is not monitoring directly the PQ regulation in the Point of Common Coupling, but estimate the voltages at the ends of the wind turbine circuits during short-circuit events. The integration of distributed generation into power systems poses significant challenges to PQ, both in monitoring and in managing the voltage profile, mainly due to the absence of measurement devices along feeder branches. In this context, this study proposes an alternative approach to estimate the RMS voltage magnitudes at wind turbine terminals, based on ANNs. The Power Systems Computer Aided Design (PSCAD) software is employed to model the studied power system, which is based on a real wind farm, as well as to generate the training and validation datasets for the aforementioned ANNs. The study results highlight the potential of the proposed approach, since 80.5% to 98.9% of the monitored RMS voltages were correctly calculated by the ANNs under single-line-to-ground fault conditions."

    "abstract": "The Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT), operating in the 50-1450 MHz range, has undergone a major upgrade to enhance its sensitivity and bandwidth. In this work, we present a focused improvement to the GMRT 550-850 MHz system, achieving a measured sensitivity enhancement of approximately 1.6 dB through targeted reductions in receiver system temperature. Given the relatively low sky temperature in this frequency range, even modest reductions in receiver noise translate into significant gains in overall system sensitivity. Two key approaches were implemented. First, the frontend electronics were restructured by relocating the receiver system directly behind the feed, thereby minimizing pre-LNA losses from 0.5 dB to 0.1 dB. This architectural optimization yielded a sensitivity improvement of approximately 0.8 dB. Second, a new low-noise amplifier (LNA) was designed, offering enhanced performance with a noise temperature of 25 K, a gain of 35 dB, and improved dynamic range compared to the existing LNA. This design not only reduces the receiver noise temperature but also ensures linear operation under high signal conditions, thus improving the dynamic range of the entire receiver chain and the sensitivity by around 1 dB. The combined effect of these modifications leads to a substantial enhancement in GMRT antenna sensitivity, making it more effective for low-frequency astronomical observations."

However, integrating multiple high-power devices, 5G smart poles often operate at full load without energy optimization, resulting in high power consumption and low energy efficiency. To address this issue, this paper proposes a coordinated optimization strategy for smart pole-based multi-energy system. Firstly, modeling of components in the system is constructed, including PV, charging piles, energy storage, lighting equipment, and 5G base stations. Secondly, following the introduction of a sleep mechanism for 5G base stations, a spatial migration scheduling model is formulated to optimize inter-station communication load redistribution, so as to reduce load consumption. Thirdly, aiming to minimize energy operation cost and maximize lighting safety, a coordinated scheduling strategy for multi-energy system is established. Finally, simulation experiments based on three typical areas validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving energy efficiency and coordination."

Traditional ground-based pose estimation methods for lunar satellites encounter significant challenges, including ground control delays, restricted visibility of the lunar far side, and the lack of fixed monitoring stations. Therefore, achieving autonomous lunar navigation is essential. By leveraging the Moon's atmosphere-free environment and abundant craters, we integrate the monocular Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm into lunar satellite positioning. By capturing lunar surface images, extracting Two-Dimensional (2D) crater feature points, and matching them with Three-Dimensional (3D) point cloud coordinates, the PnP algorithm calculates the satellite camera’s orientation and position. We theoretically elaborate on this method and validate its effectiveness through simulations. Experimental results demonstrate sub-millimeter localization accuracy, high computational efficiency, and robust stability across complex environments, providing a solid theoretical foundation for lunar pose estimation tasks."

We conducted a systematic literature review to explore this potential but identified only 17 relevant papers, suggesting that this intersection is underexplored in academic research. Our findings reveal inconsistencies in terminology across disciplines, limited cross-disciplinary integration, and a stronger emphasis on user experience within Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) than on visualization.

However, the overall regulation capacity of EV Aggregator (EVA) is susceptible to the randomness of EVs' behaviors and the prices in the frequency regulation market, increasing the complexity and risk of the frequency control in the power system. To address the problem, in terms of the frequency regulation market mechanism, two-layer stochastic optimal frequency control model with EVA is developed in this paper. The first layer takes the frequency regulation cost as the optimization objective and the frequency deviation as the probability constraint to optimize the dispatch power of different frequency regulation players, such as EVAs and thermal power plants. The second layer adopts a multivariate Gaussian Copula function to formulate an optimal decomposition of EVA's dispatch instructions considering the EVs' risk preferences and the randomness of the electricity prices. Incorporating an EVA with 15000 EVs into regional grid frequency regulation, the IEEE39 node model is implemented by using a real-time simulation platform to validate the proposed model. The obtained results can provide technical support for the risky decision-making of frequency regulation of the power system with EVAs."

In this paper, we propose an effective and real-time drowsiness detection framework to track and analyze the important facial indicators with the help of state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms. It uses the OpenCV and the Dlib libraries for fast reliable facial landmark detections and tracking, allowing to monitor three relevant physical drowsiness markers, namely, eye closure, yawning, and head position. Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) is calculated to recognize the blink period of eye, whereas Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR) is employed to recognize yawn by detecting elongated mouth openings. Head pose estimation is also used to track attentiveness and detect nodding or head tilting as signs of sleepiness. The system runs in real-time and can accommodate changes in illumination, face poses, and driver appearance. Experimental studies show that its accuracy and reliability are quite high under different conditions, which indicates that it is a feasible and cost-effective non-invasive method for an ITS. The proposed design can shed light on the design of Advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) to bring down fatigue related crashes and thus to improve road safety."

Using stochastic geometry, we derive a computable lower bound on coverage probability, explicitly capturing altitude, basestation density, and path-loss regimes typical of low-density urban settings. We expose how altitude dynamically trades LoS gains against aggregate out-of-cell leakage, yielding altitude bands that maximize coverage. Monte Carlo experiments corroborate the analysis and map performance across practical flight envelopes. The results guide interference-aware flight planning and robust UAV-IoT deployment in existing cellular networks."

The proposed algorithm enhances tracking performance by addressing the strong correlation between the cost in the association matrix and the measurements of node-induced clutter, thereby effectively mitigating its impact on multi-target tracking.

    "abstract": "Capturing target objects using the quadrotor has gained increasing popularity in recent years, but most studies focus on capturing lightweight objects. The instantaneous contact force generated when capturing objects of a certain mass, along with the payload uncertainty after attachment, will pose significant challenges to the quadrotor control. This paper proposes a novel control architecture, named Dual-Channel Adaptive Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (DCA-NMPC), which cascades a nonlinear model predictive control with two lower-level model reference adaptive controllers and can resist drastic impact and adapt to uncertain inertial parameters. Numerical simulation experiments are performed for validation."

    "abstract": "Space Situational Awareness (SSA) is a critical conceptual framework for monitoring, tracking, and analyzing the space environment—particularly for detecting and tracking small, high-velocity space objects that pose potential risks to satellites and assets both in space and on Earth. A major challenge in SSA is developing models that accurately detect such objects under the constraints of real-world operational systems. This paper focuses on developing a lightweight yet high-accuracy object detection model by exploring and selecting models within the YOLO (You Only Look Once) series, which are widely recognized for their efficiency and strong performance in object detection tasks. To enhance model effectiveness, the study incorporates the Knowledge Distillation (KD) technique, wherein knowledge is transferred from a larger, more complex Teacher Model to a smaller Student Model. We propose a novel model named GISTDA’s Space Object Detection using Knowledge Distillation (GSOD-KD), which is distinguished by its processing speed and detection accuracy. The model is evaluated using real observational data obtained from the Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (GISTDA), captured through ground-based telescope systems for space object monitoring. The GSOD-KD model achieves a mAP@50 of 0.951, which is equivalent to that of the Teacher Model. However, GSOD-KD requires only 1,971,174 parameters, compared to the 2,503,334 parameters of the Teacher Model—a 21.25% reduction in parameter size. This result demonstrates that GSOD-KD can maintain detection accuracy comparable to the Teacher Model while utilizing significantly fewer parameters, highlighting its potential for deployment in real-time SSA systems with limited computational resources."

Surface temperature shall not exceed this temperature during specified impulse current application. In addition, it is feasible for thermal protection to operate stably with a mechanism that interrupts short-circuit current through thermal linkage.Thermal stability of the MOV modules with relatively high varistor voltage is confirmed to pass the test in accordance with SPD standards.

The methodology integrates three main components: (i) grid search hyperparameter tuning to identify the best Vanilla LSTM configuration, (ii) feature selection based on Spearman rank correlation to determine the most relevant predictors, and (iii) forecasting strategy evaluation by varying lookback windows and forecasting horizons. The accuracy of the model has been assessed with standard evaluation metrics, including Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency, Mean Absolute Error, and Root Mean Square Error. The results indicate that optimized feature subsets significantly enhance model stability compared to univariate approaches, particularly in long-term forecasting. Moreover, analysis of forecasting strategies reveals that univariate Vanilla LSTM model requires longer lookback window for stable performance. In contrast, feature-selected Vanilla LSTM model achieves robustness with fewer inputs but is sensitive to excessive historical dependencies. The findings provide practical guidelines for balancing model complexity, input selection, and temporal design in LSTM-based hydrological forecasting."

It adopts a mode of energy transmission at low switching frequency combined with energy control at high switching frequency. For different device combinations of the HMMC, a hybrid modulation strategy involving fundamental frequency modulation combined with high-frequency modulation compensation is designed. While reducing the switching frequency, this strategy precisely controls the output inverter voltage waveform and realizes functions such as adjustable amplitude and frequency of grid voltage, and three-phase unbalance of grid voltage. Finally, grid fault simulation of the grid simulator is completed through simulations, verifying the feasibility of the proposed design scheme."

This paper describes a new way to use script-to-scene translation to handle AI-based movie pre-visualization (Pre-Viz). Traditional pre-viz methods involve a lot of human work, like complicated storyboarding and pricey CGI simulations that take a lot of time and resources. To solve this problem, we suggest an AI-powered system that can turn written texts into visual models. This would make the early steps of film creation much more efficient. Using natural language processing (NLP) methods, we pull out important parts of the story, like scenes, actions, and conversation. Then, we use computer vision models to make realistic images of the scenes. These drawings show how the space is set up, the camera views, the lighting, and how the characters move in a way that fits with the story format in the script. Deep learning models, such as transformers for reading text and generative adversarial networks (GANs) for creating scenes, are used by the system to improve visual accuracy and stay creatively true to the director's vision. Utilising real-life cases, we show that this method works by showing a substantial decrease in the time needed for Pre-Viz creation. The method also makes it easier for directors to work together by giving them a graphic guide that matches the written plot."

In order to detect implicit mentions, semantic expansion was carried out using the Skip-gram Word2Vec model to find terms that were closely related to predefined aspect keywords. Semantic embeddings with TF-IDF weights were combined to create hybrid feature vectors in three different configurations: 100% Word2Vec, 75% Word2Vec + 25% TF-IDF, and 50% Word2Vec + 50% TF-IDF. The 75/25 hybrid scheme improved the identification of implicit expressions and had the best alignment with expert-annotated aspect categories, according to k-means clustering experiments. Five models were tested for sentiment classification: SVM, CNN, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and LSTM. Deep learning models outperformed conventional techniques. Under the 75/25 hybrid scheme, LSTM in particular achieved the highest F1-score, showcasing a strong ability to capture nuanced sentiment cues and sequential context. These results demonstrate how well semantic and statistical features can be combined for sentiment analysis and aspect detection, providing a promising framework for more reliable user-generated content interpretation in the hospitality domain."

By linking urban morphology and climate data with energy simulation and feedback–driven optimization, the approach enables targeted, scalable solutions for decarbonizing urban areas. Three representative case studies, Ioannina (Greece), Prague (Czech Republic), and Ankara (Turkey), were modeled using a detailed digital twin that simulates solar energy generation, building energy demand, and carbon offset potential. While physics-based methods were used for smaller areas, Ankara employed machine learning-driven Urban Building Energy Modeling for large-scale evaluation. A feedback-enabled framework allows the refinement of design interventions based on simulation results. Findings revealed significant variation in PV yield, energy savings, and selfsufficiency across LCZs, confirming the importance of local context. The study demonstrates how digital twins can serve as dynamic planning tools for urban decarbonization, offering a replicable and scalable approach to climate-sensitive urban design."

The streamer discharge from three, two and isolated water drop during lightning inception is simulated using a plasma chemical 1.5D model including 19 charged species and 38 chemical reactions among them. Streamer discharges from both isolated and two water drops are modeled at 70%, 90%, and 110% relative humidities to analyze the effect of humidity on streamer behavior inside a thundercloud. The results indicate that in the configuration with three aligned water drops, two positive streamers initiate and propagate simultaneously within the two air gaps, while a negative streamer originates in each air gap from the bottom drop. In the two drop configuration, a single positive streamer forms in the air gap, and a negative streamer develops from the lower drop. In single drop configuration, only a positive streamer is observed. Humidity plays a minor role in streamer inception and propagation inside a thundercloud for single and two drop configurations. In conclusion, the positioning and quantity of water drops within the thundercloud affect the streamer’s behavior, and therefore significantly impact the conditions necessary for lightning initiation."

Due to the alteration in the relationship between the polarization current and the working current before and after the fault, which reflects the change in the equivalent parameters of the line, the protection principle remains unaffected by the fault characteristics of different types of power. Moreover, this alteration has considerable benefits in terms of adaptability, sensitivity, and rapidity, providing effective assurance for the safe and stable functioning of the new power system."

A generation and transmission expansion planning (GTEP) model is used to simulate the power system of China operation in 2035 and 2050. The results reveal that coordinated charging can reduce the required renewable capacity installation by up to 40 % and cut curtailment by over 30%. Furthermore, with partial participation of EVs in V2G (40 % participation rate, 20% capacity depth), the effective grid-side energy storage reaches 3 TWh in 2050, equivalent to 7.5 % of the daily electricity demand, enhancing system flexibility and reducing overall system cost. These findings highlight the pivotal role of EVs as decentralized, mobile, low-cost flexibility resources in future carbon-neutral power systems."

However, there is a lack of work to address the security issues involved. In order to reduce the problem of complex convergence of malicious nodes to normal nodes by tampering with the communication content, we propose a novel algorithm named GCN-MSR to ensure the robustness of distributed control. In short, the gradient manipulation by malicious nodes is suppressed by removing a portion of the extremes passed to normal nodes through the idea of mean subsequence reduced. In addition, since the node states in our task are expressed through vectors, we achieve quantification of the extreme values by transforming the vector values into scalars using the Mahalanobis distance. The final distributed multi-agent control strategy is obtained by comparing the strategy learned from the network with the strategy from the expert template through imitation learning."

A key challenge is how to accurately and promptly assess the support capability of dynamic reactive power devices for STVS. However, existing online evaluation methods are mostly based on a voltage perspective, which makes it difficult to provide clear guidance for reactive power control. To address this problem, this paper designs a dynamic reactive power reserve (DRPR) index suitable for online computation and proposes a graph convolutional network (GCN)-based online assessment method. By taking the steady-state reactive power injection space as the analytical perspective, the proposed method enables both the assessment of STVS. and the provision of explicit and direct control guidance for preventive strategies. The effectiveness of the proposed index and assessment model is validated through simulations on the CSEE-VS test system."

    "abstract": "Although digital hearing aids dominate the current market, analog solutions remain relevant due to their power efficiency, inherent capability for real-time signal processing, and the necessity of signal conditioning for dynamic range adjustment before performing analog to digital conversion. This paper proposes a low-power analog front end architecture intended for low power hearing aids. The circuits are built with MOSFETs biased in the subthreshold region. This minimizes energy consumption while enabling real-time, frequency-selective signal processing. The design includes a bank of nine second-order GmC bandpass filters for spectral decomposition and programmable gain amplifiers that allow an audio signal equalization based on individual hearing loss profiles. Each filter in the bank features adjustable gain and a variable quality factor to control inter channel leakage and audio band equalization. A programmable gain amplifier adjusts the final output level for volume control, without altering the bank frequency response. Transistor level circuit simulations confirm that the system can accurately reproduce audiometric characteristics and equalize the channel amplitudes to achieve the desired frequency response. This validates the efficiency for low-complexity, power-efficient frontend designs intended for hearing aid applications."

    "abstract": "Robust data augmentation is essential for training histopathology classifiers that generalize across scanners, centers and staining protocols. We evaluated three augmentation pipelines on 204 colon-tissue tiles from the LC25000 collection, benchmarking realism with Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and colour fidelity with mean lightness drift (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\Delta L^{*}$</tex>). A stain-only strategy, Macenko normalization plus direct stain transfer, produced the poorest match to the original distribution (FID <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\approx 37.4$</tex>, <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\left.\\Delta L^{*} \\approx 5.10\\right)$</tex>, indicating that color manipulations alone can severely distort global image statistics. Adding purely geometric and mild morphological transforms (flips, small rotations, elastic shifts) sharply reduced both metrics (FID <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\approx 13.8, \\Delta L^{*} \\approx 1.27$</tex>) while preserving diagnostic appearance. Building on this baseline with an AugMix-light branch yielded only a modest rise in FID <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(\\approx 16.4)$</tex> and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\Delta L^{*}(\\approx 1.45)$</tex> yet injected richer local contrast and color variation-attributes that improve robustness to scanner and slide-ageing artifacts. Qualitative inspection confirmed that nuclei, gland borders and stromal textures remained intact across all augmented sets. These findings advocate a tiered augmentation curriculum: prioritize shape-preserving operations to anchor photometric realism, then layer in blended low-severity transforms for diversity, while monitoring both distributional and color metrics to avoid overshooting. The proposed recipe balances realism with variability, offering a practical path toward more generalizable and trustworthy computational pathology models."

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, its implementation in financial institutions has raised concerns regarding new risk management policies, particularly for rural credit banks. This research proposes the development of a predictive system for operational risks in rural credit banks based on two deep learning techniques namely (1) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and (2) Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM). While CNN identifies and captures video footage to analyze risky commands issued by internal staff, LSTM processes real-time server logs to detect patterns that could lead to system failures. This research aims to enhance the prediction of risks associated with internal operations, including staff errors, equipment/system failures, and environmental risks. The results demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the effectiveness of risk management in rural credit cooperatives and offers valuable insights into other institutional risk management strategies."

    "abstract": "Two important challenges in multi-label classification are dataset imbalance and overlapping features shared among two or more class labels. This study addresses both challenges as a problem of classifying multi-labels in academic publications by proposing an integration of three main techniques: Robustly Optimized BERT Approach (RoBERTa), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm. In a nutshell, a fine-tuned RoBERTa captures domain-specific semantic features of academic papers; SVM performs initial multi-label classification; and DE optimizes the label-specific threshold combination for each label improving the accuracy of classification decisions. This integration jointly addresses dataset imbalance, overlapping features, and threshold selection issues, which are rarely considered together in prior studies. The experiments were performed on academic papers, collected from arXiv repository with five core subfields of Computer Science. Experimental results showed that the Macro-F1 score of the proposed approach that integrates the fine-tuned RoBERTa model, SVM classifier and DE achieved 0.8018 while the best performance of benchmark methods achieved 0.7218. The significant performance improvement highlights the effectiveness of integrating semantic feature extraction, robust classification, and adaptive threshold optimization to overcome the challenges of dataset imbalance and feature overlap in multi-label classification of academic publications."

Therefore, the use of artificial intelligence technology for intelligent inspection and environmental monitoring has become an inevitable trend. This research aims to develop an AI-based virtual inspection and environment monitoring system, which uses deep learning algorithms to conduct real-time monitoring of personnel identity, and improves the automation level of the system through the analysis of environmental data and anomaly detection. The proposed system will be combined with face recognition technology for identity verification, and environmental data monitoring and analysis based on the uploaded data set, in order to achieve intelligent integration of security inspection and environmental monitoring."

It integrates point cloud optimization and dynamic target enhancement. Elevation artifacts are suppressed using an enhanced Shapiro-Wilk joint test with spatial entropy preservation, coupled with a cross-domain multimodal cascade optimization filter for progressive verify-cation and filtering. For dynamic targets, a dual-enhancement strategy generates directional perturbation noise along motion trajectories and applies curvature-adaptive gain modulation to improve geometric consistency. Experiments on the View-of-Delft (VoD) dataset exhibit a 65.07% anomaly reduction with intact spatial structure, increased GT box point densities, enhanced shape matching and refined trajectories precision. This process framework establishes an effective approach for sparse point cloud processing in UGS perception."

The system then extracts the query graph from the CTI data using a method that automatically identifies Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and attack behaviors. To mitigate the high computational and memory overhead associated with matching large graphs, ThreatsMaps employs the HistoSketch optimization technique. Furthermore, the system reformulates the graph matching problem into a clustering task using the k-medoids evolutionary algorithm, which is particularly suitable for streaming systems. We evaluated ThreatsMaps using the DARPA dataset, where it demonstrated high accuracy in identifying attacks, achieving a detection score of 97%."

A new EV charge scheduling strategy is proposed based on Federated Meta-Dueling Double Deep Q-Network with Prioritized Experience Replay (FM-D3QN-PER) to maximize the number of fully charged EVs, reduce energy costs, balance transformer load, and adapt to stochastic factors such as random EV arrivals and dynamic electricity pricing. In this framework, the system is divided into multiple local agents, referred to as clients, where each client represents a group of EVs with similar behavior. Each client learns locally while preserving data privacy by keeping raw EV data on-site and only sharing model parameters. This framework is evaluated using real-world data from a designated parking lot in Chattanooga. By using meta-learning, the FM-D3QN-PER approach enables rapid adaptation to new or changing EV behaviors and uncertain conditions, making it well-suited for dynamic and heterogeneous environments such as real-time EV charging networks."

The Secretary Bird Optimization (SBO) algorithm is employed to identify optimal system configurations that minimize the Annualized Cost of System (ACS) and Cost of Energy (COE) while improving system reliability and extending battery life. Four cases are examined, combining different energy sources in varied proportions. Among these, Case 4, integrating 5 kW PV, 15 kW wind, 5 kWh battery, and a 15 units of hydrogen system, achieves the best reliability with a very low Loss of Power Supply Probability (LPSP) of 0.226%, moderate battery life of 6 years, and optimized energy availability. Although it incurs the highest ACS (₹128,171.51) and COE (₹7.241/kWh), it offers the most balanced and robust solution, ideal for applications requiring continuous, high-reliability power. Comparative analysis shows that single or dual-source systems like Case 1 and Case 3 are more cost-effective but suffer from higher LPSP or reduced functionality. The study concludes that a comprehensive hybrid design, particularly with wind energy, significantly enhances microgrid reliability and long-term sustainability."

However, the inherent characteristics of micro-expressions such as brief duration and low motion intensity make automatic recognition highly challenging. To address the challenges, this paper proposes a novel Graph-Transformer Architecture (GTA) that integrates Vision Transformers and static graph modeling for effective micro-expression recognition. Particularly, the proposed method firstly extracts magnified shape features and motion information from onset and apex frames to capture fine-grained facial dynamics leveraging offline MagNet and TV-L1, respectively. To exploit relative movement between facial action units, we propose a facial graph that encodes semantic similarities between facial patches in terms of facial landmarks. Built on the graph, a stacked Graph-Transformer that alternates GCN and Transformer layers with learnable graph weights is therefore introduced to further enhance dynamic modeling for discriminative micro-expression feature learning. Extensive experiments are conducted on two benchmark datasets, i.e., CASME II and SAMM, and the results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both accuracy and F1 score metrics, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness."

However, in rapidly time-varying channels, inter-symbol and inter-carrier interference (ISCI) can severely degrade ISAC performance. Conventional waveforms are often designed to treat ISCI as pure interference or completely ignore it, which overlooks its potential to carry valuable sensing information. In this work, we revisit this conventional assumption and present an analytical framework to discuss the impact of ISCI in time-frequency domain signaling systems. Specifically, we introduce two perspectives: an interference-dominant viewpoint treating ISCI as useless noise, and an information-bearing viewpoint that exploits ISCI as a source of sensing information. Furthermore, we derive the Fisher information matrix and conduct a comprehensive Cramér–Rao lower bound analysis to quantify the fundamental limits of sensing accuracy under ISCI influence. We also include analysis for position error bound and velocity error bound, showing that ISCI-aware processing can improve sensing precision. Extensive simulations are conducted under different SNRs and mobility conditions to validate our theoretical results."

However, existing FL frameworks suffer from vulnerabilities such as model poisoning attacks, privacy leakage, and a lack of model interpretability, which is critical for IIoT environments. This paper introduces a novel framework, Federated Learning with Explainable Anomaly Signals (FL-EAS), designed to overcome these limitations. FLEAS fundamentally alters the federated learning process by exchanging compact, 21-dimensional feature vector derived from the reconstruction errors of local, explainable models, rather than raw model parameters. The framework incorporates a server-side supervised classifier to detect and reject malicious contributions, thereby ensuring attack resilience. By propagating explainability from the client edge to the global model, FL-EAS provides transparent, human-interpretable results. The efficacy of this approach is contextualized for evaluation using the physical process data from the BATADAL 2.0 dataset, demonstrating a state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9511 on concealed attacks, and demonstrating its potential for secure, efficient, and trustworthy anomaly detection in real-world Cyber-Physical Systems."

    "abstract": "The efficient scheduling of multi-task jobs across multiprocessor systems has become increasingly critical with the rapid expansion of computational systems. This challenge, known as <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Multiprocessor Multitask Scheduling (MPMS)</i>, is essential for optimizing the performance and scalability of applications in fields such as cloud computing and deep learning. In this paper, we study the MPMS problem under both deterministic and stochastic models, where each job is composed of multiple tasks and can only be completed when all its tasks are finished. We introduce NP-SRPT, a non-preemptive variant of the Shortest Remaining Processing Time (SRPT) algorithm, designed to accommodate scenarios with non-preemptive tasks. Our algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of ln α + β + 1 for minimizing response time, where α represents the ratio of the largest to the smallest job workload, and β captures the ratio of the largest non-preemptive task workload to the smallest job workload. We further establish that this competitive ratio is order-optimal when the number of processors is fixed. For stochastic systems modeled as M/G/N queues, where job arrivals follow a Poisson process and task workloads are drawn from a general distribution, we prove that NP-SRPT achieves asymptotically optimal mean response time as the traffic intensity ρ approaches 1, assuming the task size distribution has finite support. Moreover, the asymptotic optimality extends to cases with infinite task size distributions under mild probabilistic assumptions, including the standard M/M/N model. Finally, we extend the analysis to the practical setting of unknown job sizes, proving that non-preemptive adaptations of the M-Gittins and M-SERPT policies achieve asymptotic optimality and near-optimality, respectively, for a broad class of job size distributions. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of NP-SRPT, demonstrating its asymptotic optimality in both theoretical and practical settings."

First, a reflection phase retrieval approach based on the 2-D extension of the generalized Snell’s law and the least-square method is introduced to achieve complex target illusions. On this basis, a genetic algorithm (GA) optimizes an equivalent circuit model (ECM) to generate multilayer configurations designed for broadband reflection phase dispersion. Subsequently, deep learning is utilized to perform the inverse design of the unit cells with two-layer structures based on the target phases over the frequency range of 4.0–7.4 GHz. Finally, a pair of two-layer metasurface arrays, each consisting of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$21\\times 21$</tex-math> </inline-formula> unit cells with a thickness of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$0.11\\lambda _{L}$</tex-math> </inline-formula> and a periodicity of 10.0mm, is designed and simulated for sloped surface and ellipsoidal cap target illusions. For further validation, two prototypes were fabricated and measured. The results demonstrate a broadband EM illusion spanning 4.0–7.4 GHz (59.6%) under dual linear polarization (LP). The scattered far-field patterns closely replicate those of the actual target structures, indicating the validity of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "We address the problem of machine unlearning in neural information retrieval (IR), introducing a novel task termed neural machine unranking (NuMuR). This problem is motivated by growing demands for data privacy compliance and selective information removal in neural IR systems. Existing task-agnostic or model-agnostic unlearning approaches, primarily designed for classification tasks, are suboptimal for NuMuR due to two core challenges: 1) neural rankers output unnormalised relevance scores rather than probability distributions, limiting the effectiveness of traditional teacher–student distillation frameworks and 2) entangled data scenarios, where queries and documents appear simultaneously across both forget and retain sets, may degrade retention performance in existing methods. To address these issues, we propose contrastive and consistent loss (CoCoL), a dual-objective framework. CoCoL comprises 1) a contrastive loss that reduces relevance scores on forget sets while maintaining performance on entangled samples and 2) a consistent loss that preserves accuracy on the retain set. Extensive experiments on two datasets, across four neural IR models, demonstrate that CoCoL achieves substantial forgetting with minimal retention and generalization performance loss. CoCoL facilitates more effective and controllable data removal than existing techniques."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Accurate channel prediction is essential in massive multiple-input multiple-output (m-MIMO) systems to improve precoding effectiveness and reduce the overhead of channel state information (CSI) feedback. However, existing methods often suffer from accumulated prediction errors and poor generalization to dynamic wireless environments, making it challenging to maintain high prediction accuracy. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable modeling and generalization capabilities in tasks such as time series prediction, making them a promising solution. Nevertheless, a significant modality gap exists between the linguistic knowledge embedded in pretrained LLMs and the intrinsic characteristics of CSI, posing substantial challenges for their direct application to channel prediction. Moreover, the large parameter size of LLMs hinders their practical deployment in real-world communication systems with stringent latency constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel channel prediction framework based on semantically aligned large models, referred to as CSI-ALM, which bridges the modality gap between natural language and channel information. Specifically, we design a cross-modal fusion module that aligns CSI representations with the language feature space using a pretrained corpus. Additionally, we maximize the cosine similarity between word embeddings and CSI embeddings to construct semantic cues, effectively leveraging the latent knowledge in LLMs. To reduce complexity and enable practical implementation, we further introduce a lightweight version of the proposed approach, called CSI-ALM-Light. This variant is derived via a knowledge distillation strategy based on attention matrices, which extracts essential features from the teacher model, CSI-ALM, and transfers them to a compact, efficient student model, CSI-ALM-Light. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CSI-ALM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning methods across various communication scenarios, achieving substantial performance gains. Moreover, under limited training data conditions—where all models are trained using only 10% of the original training dataset—CSI-ALM-Light, with only 0.34M parameters, attains performance comparable to CSI-ALM and significantly outperforms conventional deep learning approaches. These validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for accurate and efficient channel prediction in m-MIMO systems."

Safety in unknown environments is ensured by an RGPR-based control barrier function, which are constructed non-parametrically from the posterior mean of RGPR. Simultaneously, an exploration function inspired by a control Lyapunov function is presented. This function utilizes the posterior variance of RGPR to achieve efficient exploration. Moreover, the use of RGPR mitigates the cubic growth in computational cost inherent to conventional Gaussian process regression, thereby enabling online learning. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, an experiment using differential-drive robots equipped with a LiDAR sensor is conducted."

    "abstract": "The rapid development of the low-altitude economy (LAE) has accelerated the deployment of cargo unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for intelligent logistics and delivery services. However, large-scale UAV operations still face multiple practical challenges, including unstable communication connectivity, limited onboard battery energy, and strict customer time-window constraints. To address these issues, this paper investigates the trajectory and task scheduling optimization problem for multi-UAV cooperative cargo pick-up under joint communication, energy, and time-window constraints. We develop a collision-aware cooperative multi-UAV optimization algorithm (CACMO) that integrates a Dueling Deep Q-Network (D3QN) for communication-aware trajectory learning with a simulated annealing (SA) based global task-sequence planner and an explicit inter-UAV conflict-resolution mechanism. The D3QN module enables adaptive trajectory generation in unknown and time-varying radio environments without requiring an a priori radio map, maintaining stable connectivity while reducing flight cost, whereas the SA module determines efficient task orders and enforces safe coordination among multiple UAVs through collision-aware refinement. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CACMO algorithm framework achieves an optimal balance between task completion time (1,719 seconds) and user satisfaction (score of 0.9969) under typical operating conditions, delivering a 70–75% reduction in total weighted cost compared to representative baseline methods. Crucially, this substantial improvement is achieved while explicitly enforcing multi-UAV collision avoidance-a critical constraint absent in most baseline methods. The framework maintains zero communication outage and guarantees safe inter-UAV separation throughout the mission while satisfying all energy and time window constraints in realistic urban environments, confirming its robustness and scalability for cooperative multi-UAV logistics operations within the LAE."

    "abstract": "Voltage taps remain the standard and reliable diagnostic tool for detecting quenches in superconducting magnets. However, they identify a quench only at the time of voltage rise and do not provide information on earlier physical precursors. In this work, we investigate whether acoustic emission data can reveal precursor activity that occurs before conventional voltage detection using machine learning techniques. We introduce an event selection method and a weakly supervised machine learning procedure to learn data-driven criteria for identifying potential acoustic precursors to quenches. Two Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures are trained: one on acoustic sensor events from our selection procedure and one on the Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) of these events. Both networks are trained iteratively using confidence-weighted loss functions to associate certain subsets of training data with a precursor label. We evaluate the performance of these models by examining the time distribution of events classified as potential precursors relative to the quench onset. Results indicate that the proposed approach can possibly distinguish acoustic emission events occurring closer to the quench from earlier acoustic activity during ramping, suggesting the potential for flagging quench precursors in acoustic data."

First, the function of voltage distribution along the line is established with respect to voltage level, transmission distance, capacity of renewable energy plant and line impedance, based on which the voltage overrun condition is proposed. Then, renewable energy transmission models with different voltage levels are established in PSCAD to verify the validity of the analysis of voltage along the line, and different distribution characteristics of the voltage along the line under different voltage levels are analyzed. Finally, transmission capacity calculation method of overhead line is proposed. According to the method, the transmission capacity of power frequency and low frequency are compared and analyzed under different voltage levels. Based on the proposed voltage calculation method, this paper analyzes in detail FLFAC advantageous intervals as well as the fundamental principle of FLFAC to enhance the transmission capacity."

This paper presents such measurements, and after analysis it is concluded that Tesla cars have lower consumption than their competitors. The energy consumption of Tesla Models 3 and $\\mathbf{Y}$ is similar and, in some cases, lower than that of smaller hatchbacks despite their greater mass, power, frontal area, as well as tires with a larger diameter and width. This is mainly due to the low drag coefficient of 0,23 and the optimization of the electrical drive and the electric vehicle in general."

However, conventional robot-centric approaches face scalability and security limitations, especially when (i) multiple robots must share the same facility and (ii) guest or newly deployed robots must be onboarded instantly. We propose a Delegated Control framework that shifts high-level logic to the building side. A centralized agent server orchestrates elevators and other facilities, publishes commands via MQTT-based publish-subscribe communication protocol, and issues session-scoped capability tokens that grant each robot only the minimum required privileges. The framework has three features: (1) Infrastructure-centric asynchronous orchestration that coordinates many robots and facilities; (2) Fine-grained, time-bounded security realized by static ACLs and dynamically generated MQTT topics; and (3) Hardwareagnostic interfaces that remove the need for additional special devices on the robot. We implemented the system in a fivestory research building and evaluated it using two delivery robots operating with a shared elevator. The evaluation achieved 100% coordination success with MQTT latency below 2 ms, demonstrating that policy-aware MQTT orchestration combined with delegated control enables scalable and secure robot-building cooperation."

Addressing the limitations of current methods for predicting non-stationary signals and identifying factors influencing line loss rates, this paper introduces a novel prediction approach for line loss in low-voltage distribution networks. It leverages a successive variational mode decomposition optimized by gray wolf optimizer (GWO-SVMD) and employs a long- and short-term time-series network (LSTNet), taking into account local climatic characteristics and other relevant influencing factors within the station area. By integrating the precise separation of non-stationary line loss data provided by GWO-SVMD with LSTNet's comprehensive exploration of temporal and spatial characteristics, this method enhances prediction accuracy while reducing computational complexity. Verified against specific station district line loss data, the approach was able to predict the line loss rate over extended periods with an average prediction error of less than 0.55%. GWO-SVMD-LSTNet is superior to traditional time series forecasting models, achieving effective fusion of long-term and short-term patterns in complex time series forecasting tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing complex time patterns in time series data. The proposed method offers a promising new strategy for minimizing power grid losses and enhancing efficiency."

    "abstract": "In today's fast-evolving financial landscape, modern financial institutions face increasing challenges in managing vast volumes of dynamic and heterogeneous financial data. Sustainable financial forecasting has become crucial for ensuring accurate budget planning, risk mitigation, and informed decision-making. However, traditional financial prediction systems often lack the ability to efficiently handle temporal dependencies, leads to inaccurate forecasts and suboptimal decisions which fail to adapt to rapid market shifts and evolving economic patterns. To address these challenges, this study introduces a deep learning-driven sustainable data architecture used for financial forecasting and decision support in financial institutions. The proposed model uses the Swin transform attention network (SAttNet) to process timeseries financial data and extract contextual dependencies across multiple temporal layers. The deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is used to adapt forecasting strategies in response to fluctuating financial conditions, thereby enhancing prediction robustness and model adaptability. The proposed STAttNet+DRL architecture is validated using a real-world hospital cost prediction dataset, demonstrates capability to model institutional-level financial dynamics. Experimental findings confirm that the proposed model outperforms traditional methods in terms of prediction accuracy and execution efficiency. The proposed deep learning architecture offers intelligent forecasting solution, empowering financial institutions to make accurate and strategic financial decisions."

    "abstract": "AC microgrids are typically small current grounding systems and use a high proportion of power electronics-based renewable energy sources, resulting in unclear fault current characteristics in the microgrid. Secondly, the fault transient time in microgrids is short, and fault characteristics are easily influenced by factors such as harmonics and phase shifts, making fault localization challenging. To address these issues, this paper proposes a local protection method for single-phase ground faults in AC microgrids based on single-ended instantaneous voltage and current components. This method is similar to traditional differential equation-based distance measurement algorithms, with the key feature being the full utilization of local information. enabling fault distance estimation in AC microgrids without relying on communication methods. The algorithm employs a weighted recursive least squares algorithm for parameter estimation and integrates a sliding window average value filtering algorithm to compensate and correct the estimated values, thereby achieving precise fault distance estimation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed protection method was thoroughly validated under a typical AC microgrid model based on PSCAD/EMTDC. The results demonstrate that the method exhibits high fault location accuracy, response speed, and noise robustness."

    "abstract": "Accurate electricity consumption monitoring at the individual appliance level is pivotal for enhancing energy efficiency and enabling sophisticated demand-side management. Traditional Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) methods, leveraging deep learning, frequently encounter challenges such as data scarcity and inadequate generalization. A novel Non-Intrusive Load Disaggregation (NILD) model integrating the TimesNet architecture with transfer learning is proposed. The TimesNet model excels in decomposing time-series data into multiple periods, thereby capturing intricate temporal relationships. To address the limitations of deep learning in NILD, a transfer learning approach based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) Loss for domain adaptation is introduced. Additionally, a two-stage dynamic training strategy is devised to enhance model performance. Experimental validations on the UK Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity (UK-DALE) dataset and simulated data demonstrate that the method significantly improves the accuracy of electricity load disaggregation, outperforming conventional approaches in scenarios with limited data and diverse domain distributions."

However, evaluating these innovations often lacks integrated frameworks considering both technological and social aspects. This paper proposes a multidimensional evaluation framework designed to assess the maturity and scalability of innovations developed within ULLs, incorporating four complementary perspectives: Technological Readiness Level (TRL), Societal Readiness Level (SRL), Organizational Readiness Level (ORL), and Scaling Readiness (ScR). The framework is applied to a pilot project carried out in the urban garden of the ULL in Fenicia, Bogota, where an IoTbased soil monitoring sensor was implemented and iteratively codeveloped with community members, a tech startup, government actors, and academic researchers. The analysis shows how each dimension offers critical insights into the innovation's development, adoption potential, and capacity for replication beyond the local context. This approach provides a replicable tool for guiding decision-making and increasing the impact of experimental interventions in ULLs, especially in complex urban environments of the Global South."

A topology is proposed to optimize the hybridization of two renewable energy sources, which can be utilized in the electric vehicle sector. Energy from solar and fuel cells is shared using a load-sharing topology. The input from the sources is applied to a Zeta Converter, which is used to boost the input voltage to a constant and desired output voltage. A converter is mathematically modeled, and a PID controller is designed for the linearized model, which helps to maintain a constant output voltage despite variations in input irradiance and temperature conditions."

Although several approaches have been proposed for arc fault detection, few studies have experimentally investigated the influence of the current measurement point on detection performance and the feasibility of self-test implementation in PV inverters. This work addresses this gap by evaluating four measurement points in a commercial inverter with an input Boost DC-DC converter: on the faulty string, on the non-faulty string (reference), after string parallelization, and at the input capacitor. The acquired signals were analyzed using spectrograms, frequency response, and spectral metrics in the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$10-50 \\text{kHz}$</tex> range, which is typically associated with arc fault signatures. The results indicate that the choice of measurement location directly impacts spectral sensitivity, the feasibility of performing self-tests through Boost converter PWM excitation, and the ability to identify the faulty string. The comparative analysis provides practical insights for the integration of sensors into embedded Arc Fault Protection Equipment (AFPE) in PV inverters, in compliance with regulatory requirements."

Secondly, The SPLIT slice structure is added to the backbone network of the YOLOv5 model, which enhances the shallow feature extraction ability of the model and improves the expression ability of the defective features of small targets. The improvement avoids feature information being lost during processing and provides reference ideas for the optimization of other models. Lastly, AiSpBc-YOLOv5n model training and validation is accomplished through the small target defect dataset of a product package, which includes the defects on box packaging surface and on the roll packaging surface of a product, and the results show that the improved model has significant effect on the detection of small target defects, and it provides a reference for the detection of small target defects of the same kind of packaging surface."

To understand the behavior patterns and operational characteristics of multi-type HVDC feed-in power systems with high proportions of renewable energy and power electronic equipment, the accuracy and scale of simulation models need to be significantly improved. The simulation models should cover the 220 kV and above power grid structures of the AC system simulation area, including multi-type of HVDC models, and power electronic equipment models such as photovoltaic and wind turbines. This paper proposes modeling methods for electromagnetic transient precise models of power electronic equipment including renewable energy units and multiple types of DC, and builds a simulation model of high-proportion renewable energy power systems with multi-type HVDC feed-in based on the HYPERSIM simulation platform. Based on this simulation model, a series of AC and DC faults are studied, and the steady-state operation and fault response characteristics are investigated. This model can be used for subsequent simulation research on the stability characteristics and control strategies of high-proportion renewable energy power systems with multi-type HVDC feed-in, providing decision-making support for planning and design, as well as operation and dispatch."

However, the coexistence of terrestrial and aerial platforms create substantial interference challenges due to overlapping coverage and the use of shared or harmonized spectrum. Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) has proven effective in overcoming interference in terrestrial networks through careful coordination of the different BSs, it has not been fully exploited in ITNTNs. This paper proposes a centralized CoMP architecture that employs static clustering scheme where the ITNTN cluster is composed of one LAP and three macrocell BSs, and coordinated beamforming framework to minimize interference and boost the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) for users within the ITNTN coverage. The framework employs Semi-Orthogonal User Selection (SUS) and Regularized ZeroForcing (RZF) beamforming to jointly schedule users and design beamforming vectors, with the objective of maximizing the minimum user SINR. Through comprehensive simulations, we aim to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method and analyze its performance against non-CoMP baselines and other precoding techniques like Zero-Forcing (ZF) and Maximum Ratio Transmission (MRT). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances SINR."

To present this data to a broader audience, however, many research projects rely on custom-built, one-off presentation sites that are difficult to maintain, adapt, or reuse. This paper introduces the concept of reusable and configurable presentation site templates as a means to promote sustainability, accessibility, and interpretability in digital humanities interfaces. We present OpenAtlas Discovery, a web-based visualization frontend designed to support exploratory interaction with semantically enriched data across a variety of domains. Drawing on six core design requirements, we describe how the system enables spatio-temporal and relational exploration through maps, networks, and detail views. Case studies and a recent workshop illustrate the platform’s adaptability, usability, and potential to serve as a lightweight alternative to custom-built sites. We argue that reusable presentation site templates can lower development barriers for projects with limited technical resources and play a key role in supporting inclusive, long-term digital scholarship."

    "abstract": "In this paper, a hybrid model combining Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Transformer architectures is proposed for wind speed forecasting. In this model, the CNN is employed to extract sequential patterns and trends from the input data while also reducing its dimensionality, serving as a preprocessing step for the Transformer. The Transformer then generates forecast results, leveraging its strong data modeling capabilities. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, wind speed data from the Hong Phong 1 power plant in Binh Thuan, Vietnam, were collected and applied. The dataset was first cleaned by handling missing values and outliers, after which it was passed through the CNN and Transformer components to produce the final forecasting. The performance of the CNN-Transformer model was compared with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), standalone CNN and CNN-LSTM through by using RMSE, NRMSE, MAPE and R2 as the main performance indicators. The results show that the CNN-Transformer hybrid model achieved low forecasting errors, with a MAPE of 1.93% for single-step forecasting, 1.52% for 4-step forecasting, and 4.02% for 16-step forecasting. These error rates are the lowest among the compared models, including LSTM, CNN, and CNN-LSTM, confirming the strong performance of the proposed approach. Overall, the findings highlight the effectiveness of the CNN-Transformer model for wind speed forecasting, as it consistently produced accurate forecasts with minimal errors."

A transmission of less than 1 dB loss is achieved from 6 GHz to 7.7 GHz under Y polarization, with two transmission zeros at 5 GHz and 10.2 GHz, respectively. The excellent performance of the metasurface for two different polarizations makes it potentially useful in multi-polarization antenna systems."

    "abstract": "With the escalating penetration of renewable energy resources, the composition of power generation sources is now a diverse array of generator-like distributed energy resources (GDERs), including combined heat and power (CHPs), photovoltaics (PVs), wind turbines (WTs) and beyond. This trend has introduced significant challenges in two aspects: 1) the effective management of these GDERs as a cohesive entity and 2) considering GDERs dynamic characteristics. In this context, this paper proposes a linear transformation-based temporal-continuous (TC) approach specifically designed to aggregate GDERs. The study commences with an extensive review of the current state of modeling and aggregation research, highlighting the limitations of existing methods in capturing sub-hourly characteristics and addressing computational complexity. To bridge these gaps, a TC model of GDERs based on Bernstein polynomials is proposed, followed by the derivation of their polytopes and base polytope. Subsequently, the linear transformation of the base polytope into the aggregated polytope is executed. The efficacy of the proposed method is rigorously evaluated through numerical tests on a set of GDERs, with its performance compared against traditional TD model. The manuscript concludes by presenting results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and by outlining potential future research directions."

Our approach was tested using the MIMIC-IV-Note dataset, where we achieved a micro F1-score of 59.5 and Precision@8 of 70.8 after applying iterative PRF improvements. We also built a web-based tool that provides real-time coding predictions through an easy-to-use interface, automated data processing, and API connections that work with existing hospital systems. The results demonstrate that our approach provides hospitals with an effective tool for more accurate medical record coding while lightening the workload for clinical staff. Because the system integrates smoothly with existing healthcare IT systems, it presents a realistic option for enhancing coding efficiency in actual clinical environments."

Using an extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) model, the research integrates perceived trust, perceived risk, self-efficacy, and user loyalty to better capture psychological and behavioral dimensions in mobile financial services. A quantitative, cross-sectional survey was conducted with 159 respondents from various regions in Indonesia. Data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) via SmartPLS 3.0. Results reveal that habit and price value significantly influence users’ behavioral intention to adopt the app. Additionally, behavioral intention and user loyalty significantly predict actual system usage, with loyalty serving as a key mediating variable. In contrast, original UTAUT2 predictors, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and hedonic motivation did not show significant effects on behavioral intention. Similarly, the extended constructs, perceived trust, perceived risk, and self-efficacy were also insignificant despite high mean scores. This may reflect high digital confidence among younger users and strong institutional trust, leading to reduced risk perception and low variance in responses. The findings suggest that emotional engagement, habit formation, and perceived value are more critical than utilitarian or social factors. The study offers practical implications for mobile banking design and highlights the need for future research in highly digitalized user environments."

Based on the analysis results, the NSGA-III algorithm is employed to optimize the current allocation among the healthy phases, with the constraint of unity power factor operation. The control strategy aims to maximize average output power, minimize power ripple, and effectively address the challenge of current-limited control under generator-side constraints. The efficacy and applicability of the proposed FT control strategy are validated through simulation analysis conducted on a 10.5 MW, 18-phase HVFTPMSG system."

    "abstract": "Autonomous planning capability is pivotal for the effective operation of most unmanned systems. In some planning tasks, agents are required to learn how to achieve specific goals from a demonstrative dataset, such as navigating to a target location or satisfying certain conditions. Such tasks can be categorized as offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL), which are characterized by sparse rewards, with feedback signals provided only upon goal achievement. Recently, applying generative models to offline RL has become a mainstream approach, which models the trajectory distribution within datasets and achieves planning through trajectory generation and optimization. In this paper, we propose TFM (Trajectory Flow Matching). It models the trajectory distribution through Flow Matching, which accelerates the sampling process for trajectory generation. Additionally, we employ a hindsight mechanism for goal re-labeling of trajectory data, enriching the reward signals during training to address the sparse rewards problem. We conduct experiments in standard GCRL tasks under both single-task and multi-task settings. Through comparisons with baseline algorithms, our method demonstrates superior performance, along with strong adaptability and transferability across different tasks."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the application of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for generating synthetic climate data to support drought modelling in datascarce regions of Southern Africa. The primary focus was to reconstruct long-term time series of soil moisture and sunshine duration. These variables are crucial for understanding drought dynamics but are often characterised by incomplete records. Soil moisture and sunshine duration data were obtained from online sources. Subsequently, the GAN model was trained on these real-world datasets containing substantial gaps to learn their temporal structures and generate realistic synthetic values for the missing periods. A key contribution of this work is the application of GANs to reconstruct these critical variables, producing a 50-year hybrid dataset (1972-2022) that combines observed and synthetic data. The GAN discriminator achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve score of 0.889. This indicates strong classification capability and aligns with results reported in comparable studies. To evaluate the practical utility of the synthetic data, the hybrid datasets were employed as inputs for random forest and feedforward neural network models for drought prediction. The results demonstrate that integrating these synthetic variables improved drought prediction model accuracy, with some synthetic variables outperforming traditional ones in feature importance rankings. This underscores the potential of GANs to mitigate observational data limitations in climate applications. The study contributes to developing hybrid modelling strategies and highlights the role of generative models in enhancing predictive capabilities in regions with limited observational data."

Exact match is recorded for well-known languages like Mandarin and English due to their flat phonological structure. However, existing systems fail to respond to Jin dialects, which are complex and more regional; neither has a focused effort been made to generalise Jin data by scholars, researchers, or developers as a result, and the recognition accuracy remains relatively low. The chief aim of this project is to design an AI-based speech recognition technique that is customised for Jinn. To achieve the recognition, a large amount of acquisition and training from various sources can be introduced into the model to pick out the speech sign parts unique to Jinn. This methodology contributes greatly to the roof of a building that will provide accurate and reliable speech recognition for Jinn speakers and improve dialect recognition technology. Alongside this, the system can be a tool not only for educational research but also for practical use in the area of communication technologies, education of children learning their first language, and many others. In this respect, the article is of great value in speech recognition research because it improves the accuracy of the dialect systems and makes dialectal speech recognition more advanced."

To achieve the diverse and dynamic requirements of V2X applications, 5 G introduced the network slicing technique, which is a logical partitioning of a single physical network infrastructure. However, resource management and orchestration in V2X network slicing remain challenging due to the high mobility, real-time demands, and heterogeneous service requirements. This paper presents a systematic review of literature from 2018 to 2025 focused on AI-driven resource management and orchestration in 5G-V2X network slicing. We categorize state-of-the-art(SOTA) by their domain scope such as End to End solutions, RAN only solutions, and core network solutions and by orchestration architectures (centralized, distributed, O-RAN-based). Finally, we identified current gaps and outlined future research directions in the area of 5 G Network slicing."

Subsequently, a lowfrequency voltage transformer calibrator was designed using differential measurement principles. A three-stage progressive voltage ratio traceability system was established by combining low-voltage electromagnetic and high-voltage capacitive standards, forming a complete low-frequency voltage ratio traceability framework.

Unlike conventional single-and double-IRS reflections, this paper investigates the channel estimation problem in a triple-IRS-reflection aided wireless communication system, which offers greater flexibility to bypass dense obstacles in the environment. However, due to the complex cascaded channel formed by the three IRSs, conventional IRS channel estimation techniques cannot be directly applied. To tackle this difficulty, we propose a new channel estimation method for triple-IRS-reflection channels. Specifically, we first recast the triple-IRS-reflection channel into a more tractable form, which is the inner product of the composite reflection pattern of the three IRSs and their cascaded channel. Based on this form, the cascaded channel can be efficiently estimated by varying the composite reflection patterns and applying the least-square method. To minimize the mean squared error (MSE), we optimize the reflection patterns of the three IRSs and show that their optimal patterns can be independently determined based on three arbitrary unitary matrices. Numerical results show that our proposed channel estimation algorithm can achieve significantly lower MSE than other baseline schemes."

It helps manage the variability of renewable energy sources by storing energy for use as needed, thereby facilitating their integration into the grid. However, the high initial cost and the lack of ancillary services markets that promote its installation limit its large-scale implementation. This study proposes a method to determine the optimal sizing of a BESS providing frequency regulation within a distribution system. To achieve this, a multi-objective approach is used to evaluate aspects related to financial issues, BESS degradation, and grid impact, through which candidate sizings (BESS solutions) are classified based on Pareto optimality to identify non-dominated solutions. The methodology determines the optimal size by balancing non-dominated solutions using the Nash equilibrium, providing stakeholders with a final solution. Three cases are examined, each with a different combination of the proposed objective functions. The aim is to take on the role of an independent investor or a grid operator, who base their decisions solely on the information available to them. The results show a preference for BESS with a C-rate of 0.25, and demonstrate that the proposed method effectively supports decision-making for their installation in distribution systems."

    "abstract": "In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), the size of the state-action space grows exponentially with the number of agents, making traditional-greedy exploration often blind and inefficient. This low exploration efficiency hinders the system’s ability to identify optimal strategies in complex scenarios with sparse rewards, resulting in suboptimal policies. To address this issue, we propose a subgoal-based exploration method enhanced by large language models (LLMs). This method decomposes multi-agent tasks into multi-stage sub-tasks, providing explicit guidance for policy learning. Specifically, we leverage the reasoning and planning capabilities of LLMs to identify ordered subgoals in collaborative tasks, and generate both subgoal discriminators and subgoal-specific reward functions. Furthermore, we design a Subgoal Planning Forest (SPF) to store sequential subgoal interactions. Building upon this, we develop a dual-dimensional exploration decay mechanism (horizontal and vertical) that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation based on depth and temporal factors. Experimental results in SMAC demonstrate that, compared to baselines, our approach achieves faster convergence and higher task success rates in scenarios with sparse rewards and high-dimensional state spaces."

    "abstract": "Integrating renewable energy is vital for achieving carbon neutrality, yet Japan faces challenges due to its uneven resource distribution. To address the need to transmit electricity from wind-rich regions to high-demand areas, the model proposed in this study incorporates both tie line capacity enhancement and the addition of four planned wind farms equipped with battery storage, along with four new high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission lines. The Japanese power system is modeled as nine regions connected by ten inter-regional lines (4 AC and 6 DC), with various energy storage options in each region. The model simulates optimal system operation over 8,784 hours with the goal of minimizing total cost under a carbon neutrality scenario. Results show that reinforcing tie lines and integrating offshore wind are critical. In high-demand areas such as Tokyo, PV and battery storage dominate, while wind-rich regions like Tohoku and Kyushu serve as major exporters of renewable energy. Thermal power and CO₂ emissions remain major cost contributors, highlighting the need for further renewable deployment and grid upgrades."

    "abstract": "Multiple lightning strikes pose a significant threat to transmission line, but the effects of impulse corona during such events remain unexplored. This paper has investigated the impact of impulse corona on the lightning withstand level and lightning-induced overvoltages in transmission lines under multiple lightning strikes using ATP-EMTP simulations. Results demonstrated that corona effects significantly influence both lightning withstand levels of transmission line and overvoltages at substation entrance. For lightning withstand level, the corona model increased protection levels by 11.7% to 20.0%, with the most pronounced effect observed for the third strike. Regarding the overvoltages at substation entrance, the impulse corona has effectively reduced the peak value and led to a later peak time. These findings conclusively show that the influence of corona under multiple lightning strikes cannot be neglected in lightning protection studies, and have provided theoretical support for more accurate lightning protection design by quantifying the beneficial effects of corona under multiple lightning strikes, potentially leading to more economical insulation coordination strategies while maintaining adequate protection levels for power system equipment."

During the formation process, the number of USVs may vary due to the joining and leaving of USVs at specific system switching instants. To address the task requirements of USVs, a non-cooperative game model is constructed to balance the conflicting sub-tasks, transforming the formation control problem into a Nash equilibrium seeking problem of a non-cooperative game. By designing piecewise distributed control laws that adapt to system switching for the USVs, the states of the USVs are driven to asymptotically converge to the Nash equilibrium of the non-cooperative game, thereby achieving the control objective. It is theoretically proven that when the average switching interval is greater than an appropriate threshold and the USV control parameters are properly designed, the states of the USVs can achieve convergence. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the designed control laws."

Passive EMI filters (PEFs) are widely recognized for their effectiveness in suppressing CM noise; however, traditional designs face challenges such as excessive volume, limited broadband attenuation, and the necessity for overdesigning parameters. In this paper, a passive hybrid CM filter design approach is proposed to address these issues by utilizing insertion loss resonance characteristics. The passive hybrid filter is developed by integrating a balance technique with a PEF. Firstly, its CM equivalent circuit is established, and the insertion loss expression is derived. The key parameters influencing resonance are identified through sensitivity analysis. The impacts of the balance technique and PEF parameters on resonance are examined. Then, the resonant frequency can be shifted by appropriate configuration of these parameters, allowing for the insertion loss to be tailored across the desired attenuation band. Finally, the effectiveness is validated through simulations."

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification presents substantial challenges due to the high spectral dimensionality and significant inter-band correlation, which often lead to increased computational costs and reduced generalization capability. To ad-dress these issues, we propose a novel framework that integrates unsupervised spectral band pruning with a trainable attention mechanism for selecting bands for efficient HSI classification. Initially, spectral bands are clustered using DBSCAN algorithm, which identifies groups of correlated bands as well as isolated, un-correlated outliers. Initial importance score assigned to each band is inversely proportional to the cardinality of the corresponding cluster, with outlier bands receiving the highest scores. Based on the cluster representative, the top-n bands from each cluster will be selected while the remaining ones of the same cluster will be pruned for further processing. However, the outliers will always be included into the list of selected bands. To further enhance the discriminability of the unpruned bands, we introduce a Trainable Band Attention (TBA) mechanism that updates attention weights of the bands in an end-to-end fashion, initialized using the DBSCAN-derived scores. The images with these prior-informed attention-guided reweighted spectral bands are fed into the ResNet-18 for feature extraction and classification. Experimental comparison with ten other CNN/ Transformer-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for benchmark HSI datasets demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed method. Our CNN-based method achieves the highest overall accuracy (OA) of 98.82% on Indian Pines, a competitive OA of 97.07% on Salinas, and a strong OA of 98.46% on Botswana, while reducing the number of spectral bands with improved performance in terms of classification accuracy and training time."

Applying the PRISMA checklist to studies published between 2017 and 2024, 27 studies were selected to evaluate models for their performance in terms of accuracy, efficiency and computational cost. Bayesian and Small Area Estimation (SAE) techniques provided the best estimates, up to 92 %, but they are also the most computationally intensive methods. Logistic regression was selected as a compromise between efficiency and validity, particularly in the prediction of healthcare payment inequities. While providing a more encompassing picture of the available studies, this process was limited by the issue of bias and heterogeneity of the data used. Results show the growing use of Bayesian and spatial modeling and highlight the importance of the intersectional approach. Nevertheless, there are still some research gaps as the few studies in rural healthcare are using AI driven predictive models and are not validated in real- world studies. There is a need for a multi-pronged approach combining A.I., spatial modeling, and policy strategies for increasing gender equity in healthcare and supporting evidence-based policy-making in Africa more broadly."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of China's electric power industry and the continuous improvement of the non-stop operation technology of the distribution network, the power distribution system has put forward higher requirements for the safety, reliability, and operation efficiency of the equipment for power-carrying operation. Unloaded cable lines with high-frequency Disconnection, due to the presence of capacitive current, easily cause contact re-ignition and arcing phenomenon, posing a threat to operational safety. Currently, the arc extinguishing switch used in 10 kV lines has largely matured, but it still primarily relies on manual operation of the arc extinguishing rope in 35 kV line operations, which has weak arc extinguishing capability, poor versatility, high operating intensity, and other issues. For this reason, this paper designs an insulated pole-type electric arc extinguishing switch suitable for 10 kV and 35 kV distribution lines. The device employs a main contact and arc contact time-sharing structure, combined with a mechanical energy storage mechanism, that enables fast splitting and closing, significantly improving the reliability of arc extinguishing and operation efficiency. The contact opening distance and electrical performance parameters are optimized based on the 35 kV withstand voltage standard. The mass of the physical prototype is only 2.49 kg, which is 25.6% lighter than that of traditional devices, and it has good ergonomics and field adaptability. Structural validation tests demonstrate that the switch can effectively control the process of arc generation and propagation, making it feasible to popularize its application in <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$10 \\sim 35 \\text{kV}$</tex> distribution networks.

Detection methods based on the evolution of facial geometry features captured at different times may address this challenge without the need to direct users to perform complex actions. However, they use limited representations of facial characteristics and show insufficient robustness against sophisticated 3D attacks. This paper introduces a low friction face anti-spoofing method exploiting perspective distortion, requiring only two images captured at varying distances from the camera. This method relies on three key contributions: a distortion encoding strategy based on a high-density facial landmark grid, a hybrid feature extraction method combining color and geometry information, and three-dimensional facial modeling strategies to perform domain randomization. Our method performs competitively when compared to recently published methods in our comprehensive dataset and successfully satisfies levels 1 and 2 of the iBeta evaluation protocol accredited by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)."

    "abstract": "With the advancement of power systems, the vulnerability of state estimation has gradually become apparent. Although many studies have explored false data injection attacks (FDIAs) against power system state estimation and achieved promising results, most existing methods primarily target either traditional bad data detectors (BDDs) or neural network-based anomaly detectors (NADs). When both detectors coexist, the attack success rate of existing attacks typically declines significantly. To address the aforementioned challenge, a novel method based on diffusion models is proposed, leveraging the uncertainty caused by renewable energy sources (RESs) fluctuations. This method integrates attack area selection, region-aware diffusionbased generation, and targeted deployment to enhance both stealth and effectiveness. Extensive experiments on IEEE 14bus, 57 -bus, and 118 -bus standard test systems demonstrate that the proposed method can simultaneously bypass both BDD and NAD, maintaining a high attack success rate even under dualdetector scenarios. These results highlight the potential threat posed by advanced FDIAs in modern grid environments and underscore the urgent need for more robust and comprehensive defense mechanisms."

    "abstract": "Sentiment analysis of user reviews is vital for product evaluation, yet the behavior of large language models (LLMs) in lower-resource languages such as Indonesian remains under-explored. We compare three LLM families (Gemma, Llama, Qwen) against classic RNN baselines (Bi-LSTM, Bi-GRU) on a three-class Indonesian app-review dataset (InfoBMKG, 8,000 reviews) under two settings: zero-shot and LoRA fine-tuning. In the zero-shot setting, a domain-trained Bi-LSTM outperforms all LLMs (macro-F1 0.84), indicating that general pre-training alone is insufficient for this domain. After LoRA fine-tuning, all LLMs improve substantially; Gemma3-4B-it attains an Accuracy of 0.92 and a macro-F1 score of 0.89. Paired, stratified bootstrap testing (B is 10,000; two-sided) with Holm–Bonferroni correction shows that only Gemma3-4B-it achieves a statistically significant macro-F1 gain over Bi-LSTM, while other LLMs exhibit positive but non-significant trends. Despite these gains, Bi-LSTM remains more than 70 times faster under a unified inference protocol, underscoring a practical accuracy-latency trade-off. Overall, LLMs are not uniformly superior to classic deep learning models in this setting; parameter-efficient fine-tuning is key to unlocking LLM performance for Indonesian sentiment analysis. However, deployment choices should balance accuracy targets with latency budgets."

In order to study the influence of the wind storage power station connected to the weak grid on the active power transmission capacity of the wind storage power system, a line impedance model was established based on the doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) and battery energy storage systems(BESS), and the influence of different short-circuit ratios on the voltage and power of the wind storage system was analyzed and studied. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified through simulation."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of efficient application of quality-enhancement neural networks for hybrid video coding. First, we introduce a video compression scheme in which the enhancement network is fine-tuned (or overfitted) using the reconstructed frames available on the encoder side. Then, the updated weights of the network are compressed using the initial weights as side information and transmitted to the decoder, which uses them for quality enhancement of the decoded frames. Second, we propose to use the number of overfitting epochs and the configuration of frozen (non-overfitted) weights as parameters which should be tuned in order to find the trade-off between distortion reduction and the number of bits needed for the updated weights transmission. We compare the Lagrange sum minimization and BD-Rate minimization for parameter selection via full search and show that the BD-Rate minimization provides better rate-distortion performance. Finally, since the full search is computationally complex, we propose a model which is trained to select the parameters that minimize BD-Rate in one pass and show that when the MFQE 2.0 enhancement network is used, the bit rate savings from $\\mathbf{4 . 8 \\%}$ to $\\mathbf{1 4 . 0 \\%}$ for H.265/HEVC standard are achieved."

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of photovoltaic (PV) systems can cause overvoltage in distribution systems during the daytime. This study investigates the impact of EV charging on voltage margin in distribution networks with high PV penetration, particularly in tourist regions. Using Jeju Island, South Korea, as a case study, voltage variations are evaluated based on different EV charging scenarios using the Voltage Margin Evaluation Index (VMEI). The results indicate that high daytime fast-charging demand in tourist areas naturally coincides with peak PV generation, increasing local power consumption and improving the voltage margin by mitigating overvoltage. The most significant voltage margin improvements are observed in feeders with higher PV penetration. These findings suggest that EV charging can serve as a passive voltage regulation mechanism in high-PV penetration tourist regions. The proposed methodology can be applied to other areas with similar characteristics, providing insights into optimizing EV charging strategies for grid stability."

In this work, we develop a holistic optimization framework for the efficient deployment of cell-free massive MIMO in V-CRAN with multiple mobile network operators (MNOs). Specifically, we formulate a set of integer programming models to jointly optimize access point (AP) selection, user equipment (UE) association, cloud resource allocation, and MNO assignment while minimizing the maximum total power consumption (TPC) across MNOs. We consider two different scenarios based on whether UEs can be assigned to arbitrary MNOs or not. The numerical results demonstrate the impact of different deployment assumptions on power consumption, highlighting that flexible UE-MNO assignment significantly reduces TPC. The findings provide key insights into optimizing resource management in cell-free massive MIMO V-CRAN, paving the way for energy-efficient wireless network implementations."

The effectiveness of electroporation protocols is highly dependent on the selection of optimum initial setup parameters, such as waveforms and electrode characteristics, and this process is complex and time-consuming. To streamline these procedures, a novel deep learning framework was developed and trained on data collected both from the literature and from experimental setups, thus enabling accurate predictions of key target parameters and reducing the need for extensive preliminary testing. This approach is applied to cardiac pulsed field ablation, used in the treatment of various cardiac arrhythmias, as well as to high-frequency irreversible electroporation for cancer ablation. Furthermore, it is used here for the first time to optimize the application of microsecond electric pulses in combination with ionizing radiations to target cancer stem cells, with the goal of reducing radiation doses in cancer care. The achieved accuracy is promising and represents a significant step toward personalized therapies and the development of next-generation medical devices."

    "abstract": "Power system restoration requires careful planning to restart generators, energize transmission lines and critical loads. Some system operators use parallel restoration by considering pre-planned islands of the network. However, research on planning these islands for modern grids with photovoltaic-battery energy storage systems (PV-BESS) is limited. This research aims to develop a novel algorithm for optimal island formation in modern grids, with PV-BESS as black start units. The characteristics of PV-BESS such as PV availability, time of the day and BESS discharge curve are proposed in formulating its role as a black start unit. To energize the non-black start units and critical loads from the black start unit, the depth-first search algorithm is proposed. It identifies all possible cranking paths. Power and energy reserves in each path are analyzed to formulate a fitness function for determining optimal islands. Transmission lines not connected to the optimal islands are identified as cutsets and excluded from the restoration plan. The algorithm developed is tested on the IEEE 9 bus test system. Simulation results verify the requirement of having two restoration plans for the daytime and nighttime when using parallel system restoration."

Therefore, this research reveals the performance variation of bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) and metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) amplifiers when subjected to a 1.2/50 μs lightning voltage transient. The collector resistor was susceptible to damage from destructive level impulses in the BJT amplifier. MOSFET failure is visible with the impulse injection into the MOSFET amplifier circuit. Further, repetitive pulses with the peak voltage close to the destructive level could also damage the circuit or degrade the amplifier performance."

Reproducible baselines (Logistic Regression, Linear SVM) and a rigorous evaluation protocol are provided to address class imbalance, Thai–English code-switching, and adversarial obfuscation. All scam texts contained URLs; none appeared in legitimate messages, revealing dataset bias, with all scam samples containing a URL and none among legitimate texts, artificially inflating headline metrics. We addressed this issue by introducing URL-masked and domain hold-out evaluations. We outline our roadmap toward version 1.0 (around 50k messages), focusing on dataset scaling and robust benchmarking for Thai scam detection, adversarial stress tests, and PDPA-compliant release artifacts. *ThaiScamBench* establishes the first standardized evaluation for Thai scam detection, enabling transparent comparison and artifact-conscious evaluation.

    "abstract": "The magnetic confinement fusion device relies on the power supply to generate a strong magnetic field to constrain and maintain hundreds of millions of degrees of plasma. The fusion magnet power supply is the core actuator to achieve controllability. At present, the fusion magnet power supply in the form of low voltage and high current mostly adopts the thyristor rectifier scheme. Under the condition of long-term steady-state operation of large current, the magnet power supply in the form of thyristor rectifier will bring large reactive power and energy loss, and the large volume of rectifier transformer leads to low power density and poor flexibility of magnet power supply. In order to effectively improve the power density and working efficiency of the magnet power supply, the high-frequency synchronous rectification scheme using full-controlled devices has been applied to the magnet power supply. Based on the problem that the synchronous rectification scheme cannot output negative pressure to meet the demagnetization demand of the magnet, a control module composed of MOSFET and resistor is designed at the output end of the power supply, and the controllable demagnetization of the superconducting magnet is realized by cooperating with the magnet converter. Finally, the simulation model is built by PSIM and the prototype and control module are developed for testing, which verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the magnet power supply scheme and the control module."

Honeypots generate rich behavioral data from unsolicited traffic, but the scale and variability of such logs make manual analysis impractical. This study investigates the use of unsupervised learning methods, K-Means, DBSCAN, and Isolation Forest for detecting and characterizing cyberattack patterns from Dionaea and Cowrie honeypot logs collected at INSTIKI. The dataset comprises over 12,000 entries collected over a 14-day period, capturing diverse activities such as SMB scans, SSH brute-force, and web probing. After preprocessing and feature engineering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used for dimensionality reduction, and Dynamic Event Clustering (DEC) was applied to identify temporal bursts. K-Means clustering revealed three dominant behavioral groups with a silhouette score of 0.59. DBSCAN identified smaller, dense clusters and labeled 31% of data as noise, while Isolation Forest flagged 28% of entries as anomalies—many overlapping with DBSCAN noise points. These results highlight the models’ complementary strengths in detecting both common and novel threats. Visualization and temporal analysis further enhanced interpretability and real-time threat correlation. The findings support the integration of unsupervised learning into CSIRT workflows and early-warning systems, especially in data-rich but label-scarce environments. Future work includes real-time deployment, multi-institution datasets, and payload-level inspection."

While recent decoupled approaches utilizing foundation models (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">e.g.</i>, SAM) attempt to separate these tasks, they predominantly rely on reductionist “box-to-mask” or “prompt-to-mask” pipelines. Such simple interfaces compress rich referring expressions into simplistic geometric constraints, severing semantic consistency and failing to leverage open-vocabulary visual-semantic alignment, particularly in multi-entity scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">RSRefSeg 2</i>, an framework that logically reformulates the workflow into sequential subtasks of “<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">slack localization</i>” and “<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">refined segmentation</i>.” Central to our approach is a novel cascaded second-order referring prompter, designed to construct a robust semantic bridge between CLIP’s open-world understanding and SAM’s segmentation capabilities. Specifically, we introduce an orthogonal subspace decomposition mechanism that separates text embeddings into complementary components. This enables implicit cascaded reasoning to isolate target attributes from background noise: first performing slack localization via cross-modal interaction to identify potential regions, and subsequently generating refined prompts to guide SAM’s precise delineation. Furthermore, we incorporate parameter-efficient tuning to align natural image priors with remote sensing domains. Extensive experiments on RefSegRS, RRSIS-D, and RISBench demonstrate that RSRefSeg 2 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an approximate 3% improvement in gIoU while offering superior diagnostic interpretability.

    "abstract": "Detecting forest changes through remote sensing imagery is essential for effectively managing and monitoring forest resources. algorithms for forest change detection leveraging deep learning have shown remarkable performance across diverse scenarios. However, these algorithms face challenges such as imbalanced forest change samples and high false detection rates. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Global Grouped Coordinate Attention (GGCA) mechanism, which improves the model’s detection accuracy by emphasizing key features while suppressing irrelevant changes during the feature reconstruction process. Based on this, a lightweight forest change detection model, TinyForestCD, is designed. Furthermore,a hybrid loss function integrating CEloss and Diceloss is employed alongside an Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM) strategy, aiming to accurately extract key features from highly imbalanced forest change data. Extensive experiments conducted on a custom-built forest change detection dataset demonstrate that the Tiny-ForestCD model outperforms other comparative models across various performance metrics, achieving a performance metric of 80.65% in F1 score and 67.57% in IoU. Moreover, in the practical deployment in Hunan Province, the average F1 score and IoU for accuracy assessment of six sample plots are 81.06% and 68.25% , respectively, which are consistent with the test set results. In addition, in the deployment results of the Shaoguan area, the model also showed the best performance compared with other models, validating the model’s robustness and applicability in large-scale forest change detection. The research indicates that the TinyForestCD model has the potential for large-scale practical deployment, significantly improving the efficiency and accuracy of forest change surveys."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel multi-gear fiber-optic sensing strategy to resolve the long-standing trade-off between high sensitivity and wide dynamic range. The approach employs an array of parallel-connected Fabry–Pérot interferometers (FPIs), whose free spectral ranges (FSRs) are precisely designed to excite a multi-stage optical Vernier effect. This enables a cooperative “coarse-to-fine” measurement mode: the FPI with the largest FSR first operates independently, using its wide unambiguous detection range (UDR) to coarsely locate the target interval. The system then switches to a high-sensitivity mode, leveraging multi-order beat-frequency amplification for precise measurement within that interval. We constructed a sensing system using four intrinsic FPIs with cavity lengths of 11111 μm, 10000 μm, 1000 μm, and 100 μm, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate simultaneous unambiguous detection and high-sensitivity response across a temperature range of 30–90°C, achieving a maximum amplification factor of 668.5× and a sensitivity of –17.38 nm/°C. This work provides a novel and effective approach to designing high-performance fiber-optic sensors, successfully integrating wide dynamic range with high sensitivity in a single, flexible system."

    "abstract": "Natural cold seeps in the marine environment are significant contributors to atmospheric greenhouse gases. To accurately quantify the methane flux from cold seeps, a novel in situ acoustic measuring device was designed to determine the methane bubble flux using the attenuation in acoustic signal intensity caused by bubbles passing through a set pipe. The acoustic measuring device consists of an inverted conical tent and an acoustic measurement pipe with a rectangular cross-section. The acoustic measurement pipe comprises a bubble-fragmented homogenization unit and an acoustic cross-correlation sensor subsystem. The bubble-fragmented homogenization unit adjusts the rising gas bubbles to a diameter of less than 3 mm with a uniform spatial distribution. The acoustic cross-correlation sensor subsystem measures the bubble-rise rate and section void fraction to calculate bubble flux. The accuracy of the bubble rising rate is ±3%, and the relative error of bubble flux is 4.6%. The bubble flux of a single vent in the Lingtou promontory seep area is 2358.1 L, and the bubble rising rate ranges from 0.29 to 0.52 m/s, controlled by changes in ocean tides. Therefore, we believe this device can be a powerful tool for quantifying bubble flux in deep-sea environments."

A multilevel cooperative parallel framework is developed on heterogeneous accelerator platforms to improve load-balancing efficiency and intersubdomain communication efficiency. An asynchronous remote communication optimization strategy based on temporal updates is proposed to address the high communication intensity of FDTD. With the multilevel cooperative parallel framework, load-balancing efficiency is improved by approximately 40% in weak scaling tests, and a maximum acceleration ratio of about <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$2\\times $</tex-math> </inline-formula> can be achieved as the number of nodes increases.

The study employed techniques such as High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), SDS-PAGE, and mass spectrometry. Chromatographic methods including reverse-phase chromatography and electrophoresis under reducing and non-reducing conditions were used to study protein variability. The results revealed significant differences in venom composition between individuals of the species Centruroides bicolor in the David district compared to individuals from other adjacent regions.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm within edge computing (EC) systems, enabling numerous edge devices to collaboratively train artificial intelligence (AI) models while maintaining data privacy. To overcome the communication bottlenecks associated with centralized parameter servers, decentralized federated learning (DFL), which leverages peer-to-peer (P2P) communication, has been extensively explored in the research community. Although researchers design a variety of DFL approaches to ensure model convergence, its iterative learning process inevitably incurs considerable cost along with the growth of model complexity and the number of participants. These costs are largely influenced by the dynamic changes in topology in each training round, particularly its sparsity and connectivity conditions. Furthermore, the inherent resources heterogeneity in the edge environments affects energy efficiency of the learning process, while data heterogeneity degrades model performance. These factors pose significant challenges to the design of an effective DFL framework for EC systems. To this end, we propose Hat-DFed, a heterogeneity-aware and cost-effective decentralized federated learning framework. In Hat-DFed, the topology construction is formulated as a dual optimization problem, which is then proven to be NP-hard, with the goal of maximizing model performance while minimizing cumulative energy consumption in complex edge environments. To solve this problem, we design a two-phase algorithm that dynamically constructs optimal communication topologies while unbiasedly estimating their impact on both model performance and energy cost. Additionally, the algorithm incorporates an importance-aware model aggregation mechanism to mitigate performance degradation caused by data heterogeneity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hat-DFed outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average 1.8% improvement in test accuracy while reducing total energy cost by 36.9% throughout the learning process."

In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive co-channel interference mitigation model for UAV-enabled multi-cell systems. Specifically, the proposed model consists of two key components: a cost function and an update algorithm. First, we derive a new cost function that incorporates both magnitude and phase errors–critical metrics for guiding the estimated signal toward the desired signal. Second, the cost function is extended to formulate a parameter update algorithm, whose effectiveness is analyzed using both geometric and entropy-based approaches. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, establishing it as a robust solution for interference mitigation in UAV-enabled multi-cell ISAC systems."

    "abstract": "This letter presents a novel rectifier assisted by a self-bias junction capacitance compensation (JCC) for high-efficiency RF-to-dc conversion across a wide input power range. Unlike conventional tunable matching networks at the input, the proposed approach dynamically turns on the JCC in parallel with the rectifying diode by sampling the output voltage. This compensation mitigates intrinsic junction capacitance drift caused by the input power, significantly enhancing impedance stability without introducing extra matching circuit or requiring external bias power. The power consumption of the proposed JCC is less than 0.2% of the output dc power, making it negligible. Measured results show that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) remains above 50% over the input power range of −2 to 24 dBm, and exceeds 70% between 8 and 22 dBm, with a peak efficiency of 81.5% at 21 dBm. Compared to a reference design with a fixed impedance matching, the proposed JCC significantly broadens the ranges of input power and dc load at the same time."

    "abstract": "To address the issues of single-dimensional meteorological data screening and the lack of mechanistic interpretability in purely data-driven models for wind farm power prediction, this paper proposes a short-term power prediction method for wind farms based on feature selection and power characteristic guidance. Firstly, a multi-indicator feature selection mechanism is designed to extract the optimal feature subset by integrating multi-dimensional correlation metrics. Secondly, a dual data-knowledge driven model is constructed by embedding prior knowledge of wind farm power characteristics into the loss function, achieving a coupled mapping between data patterns and turbine operation mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed feature selection method improves prediction accuracy, while the introduction of the knowledge-guided term further reduces the RMSE of the BiTCN model, validating the synergistic advantages of data-knowledge fusion."

The current situation with renewables in the country veers heavily towards Photovoltaic generation, with a daily production during hot summer periods, at times higher than the daily nuclear facilities production. There are ample reasons to consider expanding the share of Wind Power both on- and offshore in order to diversify and improve the mix of the power grid.

    "abstract": "To improve the fuel economy of hybrid vehicles under complex driving conditions while maintaining the battery state of charge (SOC) within a desirable range, this study proposes an energy management strategy based on the Double Deep Q-Network (Double DQN). By employing two decoupled neural networks for action selection and value estimation, the strategy effectively mitigates the Q-value overestimation bias commonly observed in standard DQN approaches, thereby enhancing training stability and convergence. The state space includes instantaneous power demand, SOC, and historical power outputs. A reward function is designed to minimize equivalent fuel consumption, with SOC controlled through soft constraints to maintain it within the target range. A series hybrid powertrain model is developed in Simulink, and the proposed strategy is trained and validated under typical urban and mission-oriented driving cycles. Simulation results demonstrate that the method outperforms conventional rule-based and standard DQN strategies in terms of fuel efficiency and SOC regulation, while also exhibiting improved generalization and robustness in multi-objective energy optimization tasks for hybrid vehicles."

Although rice and sugarcane are prominent crops in Thailand distinguishing between them is challenging due to overlapping growth cycles and similar spectral patterns. Traditional methods often necessitate fully labeled balanced datasets which are difficult to obtain through natural investigation. This study proposes a phenology-based approach utilizing a sinusoidal equation to characterize crop growth throughout their complete life cycles. Satellite indices specifically the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) were employed to represent the sinusoidal signal. A One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) based on likelihood principles will be utilized to ascertain crop types. The OCSVM allows for the classification of a single label from unknown multi-labeled data supported by the phenological approach. This research presents a novel methodology aimed at overcoming the limitations of machine learning classification when datasets are insufficient. The results demonstrate the success of the proposed research concept."

By introducing price incentives, elasticity coefficients, and behavioral inertia factors, the load adjustment process of users under various price signals is simulated. Combining cost savings, behavior correction levels, and changes in abnormality indices, the impact of DR on improving abnormal behavior is assessed. The simulation results demonstrate that TOU price-driven user-side behavior regulation can effectively enhance load elasticity and mitigate abnormal risks, providing data support and methodological references for distributed load management and smart grid operations."

    "abstract": "For lightning protection of medium voltage (MV) distribution lines in Japan, zinc oxide surge arresters (SAs), which suppress lightning overvoltages, are generally used. These SAs require grounding electrode with low resistance dedicated to them, and distribution operators are struggling to obtain and maintain low resistance especially in areas with severe soil conditions. In recent years, externally gapped line arresters (EGLAs), which do not require grounding, are expected to be introduced. This study evaluates the cost– performance ratio of SAs and EGLAs under varying installation intervals and numbers of protected phases. First, the flashover characteristics of EGLAs were obtained by an experiment. Next, lightning protection rates for SAs and EGLAs were calculated using electromagnetic transient analysis. The total cost of installation required by each element was calculated, and the lightning protection rate and total cost were comprehensively compared. The calculation results showed that installing EGLAs every 100 m in two phases offers high lightning protection rates and low cost for the studied distribution lines. The findings support more cost-effective lightning protection design for MV distribution lines."

However, the electrification process is accompanied by several challenges, notably the requirement for larger batteries in vehicles and the need to expand the infrastructure of charging stations, due to limitations in vehicle range. Dynamic wireless charging systems offer an innovative solution that allows vehicles to recharge while driving, reducing the reliance on large-capacity batteries and stationary charging stations. However, further analysis and enhancements are required to achieve higher power levels. This paper presents a multiscale evaluation of an inductive wireless power transfer system, which is applied to a 90 kW electric vehicle charger that utilizes three active coils on both the primary and secondary sides. To ensure accurate output power regulation, algorithms are implemented for tracking the resonance frequency and adjusting the duty cycle, enabling effective power control within the system. Under optimally aligned conditions, a total power output of 95 kW is achieved at the load. The results in a misaligned condition show an equivalent output power close to 90 kW."

As this technology has matured, recent broad applications of wireless power transfer systems have indicated a trend toward to higher power, and higher efficiency of designs. However, realizing high power poses significant design challenges because the battery equivalent resistance changes during charging and the wireless charging system is in a low load phase. This paper addresses the issue of low efficiency in the LCC-S topology at low equivalent loads by proposing, using the principle of transformer impedance transformation, a transformer is added to the LCC-S to achieve system impedance matching and high-efficiency transmission at low loads. The transformer parameters are also analyzed and designed to obtain the optimal design parameters of the transformer for the wireless charging system requirements. wireless charging system with a power level of 1 KW was built, and when the load resistance is 1Ω, the efficiency of the improved LCC-S is 78.9 %.

Laboratory tests were conducted on insulators exposed to different artificial pollution distribution patterns, following the procedures outlined in the IEC 60507 and IEC 60815-1 standards. Leakage current measurements were analyzed using Digital Signal Processing, considering odd harmonic components up to the 15th order. The results demonstrate that leakage current intensity increases with pollution levels, with the primary indicators being the H7 and H11 components. Additionally, the occurrence of leakage current depends on the spatial distribution of pollution, environmental conditions, and the electrical context. The findings may contribute to developing more effective monitoring and preventive maintenance methods for polymeric insulators."

This gives us a chance to understand and predict how tourists will behave by using advanced data-driven methods. This study suggests using multi-modal big data from social media sites, online reviews, and geolocation data to guess how tourists will behave. The system is driven by AI. Using deep learning and natural language processing to find trends in text, pictures, and location histories is made possible by combining different types of data sources. Posts and reviews on social media give us real-time information about what tourists like, how they feel, and what they've experienced. Location data, on the other hand, shows us trends of behaviour in space and time. The suggested model uses a multi-stream neural network design that blends picture recognition, textual mood analysis, and trajectory mining to make very accurate guesses about how people will behave. With this allaround method, people involved in tourism can predict travel trends, find sites that are in high demand, and tailor their services to each visitor's needs. Using large datasets from the real world, a lot of tests show that the model can accurately predict the activities, tastes, and moving patterns of tourists. The structure is useful for smart tourism, location management, and urban planning because it lets people make decisions based on data and without waiting for information. This study adds to the growing field of AI in tourism by showing how multi-modal big data fusion can be used to improve behavioural analytics."

Simulation results indicate that both PI and FLC-based DVRs significantly reduce THD compared to the case without compensation, with the FLC offering slightly improved performance in harmonic mitigation. In the islanded mode, the DVR controlled by a PI strategy is implemented to address voltage disturbances and harmonics during disconnection from the main grid.

Multiple flexible resources which contain repair crews, emergency mobile energy storage vehicles, reconfiguration and islanding, source-side coupled components and energy storage dispatch, and load-side integrated demand response are considered in the post-disaster stage for IES repair and restoration. The validity of the proposed method and the rationality of the process are verified with an arithmetic example."

    "abstract": "We present a heuristic-based algorithmic framework for solving the Vacation Planning Problem (VPP), which involves the generation of optimized, personalized multistop road trip itineraries across wide geographical regions. Our approach addresses key challenges in road trip planning, including the selection and sequencing of overnight destinations, allocation of stay durations, and daily tour planning that maximizes tourist satisfaction. The proposed solution operates in two distinct phases: an offline preprocessing phase that clusters Points of Interest (POIs) based on their geographic distribution and precomputes personalized profit estimations based on user stereotypes and stay durations; and an online phase that formulates destination selection as a constrained Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem, followed by tour sequencing and route planning. Compared to previous VPP solutions, our approach maintains comparable itinerary quality but dramatically improves computational efficiency, thus enabling real-time performance. The algorithm has been integrated into the TouristHub platform and evaluated on both real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating its robustness, efficiency, and adaptability to different regional and user-specific configurations."

Under dynamic operating conditions, existing online parameter identification methods have limitations such as low data utilization and slow convergence, which restricts the accuracy of SOC estimation. This paper presents an integrated strategy that concurrently performs online battery parameter identification and SOC estimation. The foundation of this approach is a second-order RC equivalent circuit model. Then, the Multi-Innovation Least Squares (MILS) algorithm is introduced to identify battery parameters online in real time and continuously update the model, effectively utilizing historical information to improve identification accuracy and convergence efficiency. Meanwhile, to tackle the issue where the accuracy of traditional Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) based SOC estimation is constrained by errors in the observation equation, an adaptive EKF method based on fuzzy logic control is designed to mitigate the impact of observation errors. This joint strategy achieves precise online dynamic correction of model parameters through MILS and combines it with fuzzy adaptive EKF for robust SOC estimation under environmental disturbances. Capitalizing on the complementary benefits of both method, the accuracy and operational efficiency of SOC estimation are significantly enhanced."

To tackle these challenges, we propose an enhanced energy consumption estimation model that incorporates both ocean currents and USV steering energy costs. Based on this model, we introduce a novel three-stage algorithm, DARP-CTSTC-TENE, designed to optimize the efficiency of multi-USV collaborative coverage tasks. The proposed approach consists of three key phases: energy-aware region allocation, which partitions the workspace while considering energy balance constraints; spanning tree-based coverage path generation, which constructs energy-minimal coverage paths by accounting for environmental forces and maneuvering costs; and energy-aware end-node exchange, which iteratively refines the region allocation and coverage paths to achieve better energy distribution and task efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations, including comparative experiments with DARP-STC and DARP-ACO-IS algorithms, as well as realistic marine simulations, demonstrate that DARP-CTSTC-TENE significantly reduces total energy consumption while maintaining a balance between area coverage and energy distribution."

This study aims to reduce the structural size of existing high-performance Transformer-based vision models and evaluate their performance in an HMD that supports AR/VR environments. To this end, this study designed lightweight models Light-1 and Light-2 by applying the block pruning and quantization based on MobileViT and verified the effectiveness of the lightweight strategy in the HMD. The experimental results confirmed that the lightweight strategy significantly reduced the size of the model and the number of parameters while maintaining the performance of the original model. This study laid a practical foundation for integration with HMDs through lightweighting high-performance vision models, and is expected to serve as an important foundation for research that provides more intelligent and immersive AR/VR and metaverse experiences."

Considering the different time scales of voltage regulation devices and the impact of prediction errors in source-load forecasting, this paper proposes a multi-timescale coordinated power control method. During the day-ahead and intra-day optimization stages, a centralized optimization model is established with the objective of minimizing network loss and PV curtailment, thereby generating pre-control instructions for each voltage regulation device. In the real-time stage, the absolute power instructions for PV output are converted into relative ratio commands through proportional mapping, and a local-centralized two-stage control strategy is employed to mitigate voltage violations caused by random source-load fluctuations. Finally, simulation analysis conducted on a 21node distribution transformer area verifies that the proposed coordinated power control method can effectively improve the overall voltage profile of the area with minimal losses."

In many Congolese universities, campus entry remains largely unsecured, with 88% of surveyed institutions still allowing open access, 10% using student ID cards, and only 2% using biometric tools. This raises major security concerns, including unauthorized entry and potential threats to staff and students. To address this, we propose a fingerprint-based authentication system built using the open-source SourceAFIS library. We analyzed survey data from 60 universities in Kinshasa and Lubumbashi and conducted technology experiments, including the development of a biometric processing pipeline and the simulation of spoofing and replay attacks. Our results reveal that while fingerprint recognition enhances physical access control, it remains vulnerable to certain threats if not protected by additional measures such as encryption and liveness detection. These findings support the integration of secure and ethical biometric solutions to modernize physical access control in Congolese academic settings."

The results show that the yaw rate and lateral displacement tracking errors can be reduced by 14.9% and 28.2%, respectively, in the case of constant deviation or variable gain fault of in-wheel motor under double lane change condition with high/low road adhesion coefficient. Therefore, the fault tolerance and stability of distributed drive electric vehicle under the failure of in-wheel motor are realized."

    "abstract": "This study resolves a paradox in UAV loosely coupled navigation: high-precision IMUs can underperform lower-grade sensors due to misaligned Kalman filter trust mechanisms. Through simulations quantifying IMU accuracy, process noise, and observation noise interactions, we demonstrate that excessive trust in high-precision IMU predictions suppresses GNSS corrections, causing significant drift. Conversely, lower-precision IMUs with balanced Q-R tuning achieve superior cost-effectiveness. Key insights reveal: Q adaptation dominates over IMU-grade selection, conservative R settings disproportionately penalize high-precision IMUs. We establish practical guidelines: High grade IMU for GPS-denied environments (precise Q required), Moderate grade IMU for urban areas (tolerant tuning), and Low grade IMU for open-sky RTK (large Q recommended), redefining selection around Q-R-IMU synergy rather than standalone hardware specs."

The transformation of artificial intelligence represented by large language models has provided new opportunities for the digital and intelligent transformation of traditional power equipment operation and maintenance. For two typical business scenarios in the power operation and maintenance field, namely knowledge service and equipment condition evaluation, considering the differences in demand and technical adaptability of different scenarios, a customized technical route for adaptation based on large language models is designed, and a hybrid retrieval enhancement and domain prompt guidance based auxiliary decision-making method for differentiated scenarios in power equipment operation and maintenance is proposed. By constructing a knowledge base for the operation and maintenance of power equipment and a sparse-dense hybrid retrieval strategy, the associated knowledge of queries can be efficiently retrieved and integrated through the large language model to generate precision responses. By incorporating multi-dimensional condition evaluation rules into the prompt, the large language model is guided to conduct logical reasoning of the equipment operation condition, and the complete reasoning process and condition evaluation results are output. Finally, the superiority and effectiveness of the operation and maintenance knowledge service and equipment condition evaluation method proposed in this paper were verified on the power dataset."

    "abstract": "Tailless layout is one of the best aerodynamic solutions for the next generation fighter jets, with its good aerodynamic efficiency and stealth. However, since the Tailless Aerial Vehicle (TAV) eliminates the flat tail and vertical tail, its post-stall maneuver flight control is a technical challenge. Currently, most literature focuses on the aerodynamic modeling and stability control of TAVs, with relatively little research on flight control problems in special environments and tasks. Therefore, a post-stall maneuver problem of TAV with model perturbations and external disturbances is addressed. Firstly, an uncertain affine rotation model and a TAV non-affine rudder effect model for controller design are established. Then, an expanded state observer (ESO) is used to estimate the model perturbations and external disturbances in a unified way. Finally, a Nonlinear Dynamic Inverse (NDI) controller is innovatively designed based on the backstepping method for the rotational subsystem, and a composite control allocation method considering vector thrust is designed based on the effective set quadratic programming under the limitations of actuator amplitude and bandwidth. The designed control method not only achieves stable attitude control but also has strong robustness, and the simulation results prove the effectiveness and real-time performance of the controller."

To address this, this paper proposes an assessment framework for evaluating the hosting capacity of distribution networks with coupled microgrid integration. A probabilistic model is established to characterize uncertainties in photovoltaic generation, wind power, and loads. A collaborative optimization framework is then formulated, capturing intra-microgrid power balance, renewable curtailment, and multi-level network constraints on power flow, voltage, and current. To enhance computational efficiency, the nonlinear problem is reformulated as a convex program using second-order cone relaxation. The method is validated on a modified IEEE 33-bus system, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately assessing hosting capacity under microgrid integration scenarios."

Security is maintained with lightweight cryptographic protocols, including X25519 for key exchange, HKDF with BLAKE2b for key derivation, and ChaCha20-Poly1305 for authenticated encryption, ensuring end-to-end confidentiality and integrity of model updates. An experimental evaluation on the MNIST dataset across three deployment scenarios (ranging from 9 to 100 clients) reveals improvements in model accuracy from 93.90% to 96.04%. Communication overhead to the cloud was reduced by up to 90%, and cryptographic overhead remained under 5.3ms per operation. Additionally, the architecture achieved 100% resistance to model poisoning, 97.8% prevention of gradient leakage, and 100% confidentiality preservation.

    "abstract": "In recent years, pulsed power systems (PPSs) have been widely deployed in defense and military applications, with most featuring high-power, high-repetition-rate characteristics such as airborne radar systems, pulsed directed-energy weapons (laser/railguns), and electromagnetic catapults. Contemporary finite-capacity standalone power systems, extensively utilized in ground vehicles, naval vessels, and aircraft, face increasingly complex operational demands. The main power supply must simultaneously satisfy conventional loads and high-repetition-rate pulsed power loads while ensuring system stability and power quality-critical technical challenges requiring urgent resolution. This paper proposes a hierarchical control approach for multi-module pulsed load DC microgrids, combining Model Predictive Control (MPC) at the upper layer for coordinated power allocation among generation units and Sliding Mode Control (SMC) at the lower layer to enhance individual module control performance. The DC microgrid architecture integrates a motor-generator set, lithium-ion battery, and supercapacitors as power sources, driving a multi-module pulsed load configuration. Simulation analysis via Simulink validates the feasibility and superior performance of this control strategy in addressing stability challenges and improving dynamic response characteristics."

Fine-tuning these parameters is a promising path to enhanced operational efficiency, though it is hampered by computationally expensive, black-box evaluations that limit experimental scale. This work tackles the challenge of maximizing transaction throughput (TPS) in the Solana network under a strict zero-drop-rate constraint. Building on previous demonstrations of Bayesian Optimization’s (BO) efficacy, we present a comparative analysis of four acquisition functions (AFs)-Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), DYCORS, Expected Improvement (EI), and Thompson Sampling (TS)-for this high-dimensional optimization problem under a limited evaluation budget. Utilizing a simulated blackbox testnet environment to evaluate parameter configurations, our numerical experiments demonstrate that the UCB method is the most efficient strategy, achieving the highest TPS. The study also confirms DYCORS as a valuable, robust subsequent strategy. By rigorously examining the impact of AF choice, this research provides a practical and efficient framework for optimizing blockchain performance, offering valuable insights for enhancing throughput in distributed computing, IoT networks, and adaptive control systems."

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of future coastal inundation is crucial for developing effective adaptation strategies to mitigate loss of life and economic damage. Hydrological models rely on Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and streamflow data to simulate flood extent and depth. DEMs, derived from satellite data, represent surface terrain in a uniform gridded format, and their accuracy significantly influences flood vulnerability and exposure assessments. Since freely available DEMs vary in resolution, selecting an appropriate dataset is critical for reliable inundation modelling. This study evaluates the effectiveness of six freely available global DEMs—ALOS PALSAR, SRTM, CoastalDEM, CartoDEM, NASADEM, and FABDEM—for flood modelling in two major Indian cities: Mumbai and Chennai. We reconstructed two historic flood events, the August 28–29, 2017 Mumbai flood and the November 16–17, 2015 Chennai flood, using these DEMs. Our analysis indicates that FABDEM performed best in capturing flood depth and extent across both study regions. The findings offer valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of global DEMs for flood modelling applications. By assessing their reliability, this study supports researchers and practitioners in making informed decisions when selecting DEMs for inundation modelling across diverse regions and scenarios."

    "abstract": "Highway is one of the most promising application scenarios for cooperative multi-vehicle planning. Although some current studies have preliminarily achieved vehicle collaboration, two major challenges still exist. Firstly, current decision-making methods rely on manual discretization of planning mode, failing to adapt to the continuous highway scenes and lacking generalization ability. Meanwhile, manual discretization leads to the result that the derived equilibrium states are not optimal. To address the issues, this research refers to human driver intelligence and establish a cognition-driven unified multi-vehicle cooperative decision-making framework towards complicated highway environments. Inspired by human cognition, vehicle driving behaviors are represented by serials of relative areas, and the least action principle is utilized to derive the optimal equilibrium state of the multiple controlled vehicles at each timestep. Then, a collision-free control planning method is designed to generate control commands from the relative area decision outputs. The proposed methods are validated in 35 different scenarios that involve all typical highway components and a long highway scene with continuous traffic flow. Compared with five baselines, our method increases efficiency by 12.4% and safety by 8.3%. In addition, the results show good consistency across various highway scenes, proving better generalization ability. Validation on real vehicle-road-cloud platforms in Suzhou, China also proves the feasibility."

Echelon utilization of retired batteries involves matching their residual performance (such as State of Health, SOH) with secondary application requirements to fully exploit their remaining value. However, SOH assessment effectiveness is highly susceptible to the training dataset, making the accuracy and reliability of training data particularly crucial. Typically, training sets consist of hundreds to thousands of battery cells, where outliers inevitably occur due to measurement errors. These outliers can distort the original data distribution and compromise the accuracy of battery data modeling. To address this issue, this paper proposes using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to identify outliers, thereby reducing their impact on training models and ultimately improving SOH estimation accuracy."

The model is evaluated using real observational data obtained from the Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (GISTDA), captured through ground-based telescope systems for space object monitoring. The experimental results show that DCAS-EMAdp achieves an mAP@50 of 91.4%. Furthermore, evaluations on mAP50@95, Precision, Recall, and F1-score confirm that DCAS-EMAdp has high capabilities in detecting small space object detection and occluded objects, and its performance is sufficient for practical applications in resource-constrained real-time SSA systems."

    "abstract": "Modern storage systems such as NAND flash solidstate drives are increasingly exposed to channels where both errors and erasures coexist. Classical Reed-Solomon (RS) codes provide strong error-and-erasure protection but suffer from high decoding complexity and latency, limiting their applicability in high-throughput storage architectures. Low-Density ParityCheck (LDPC) codes, with iterative message-passing decoders, offer near-capacity performance at low complexity and are therefore the preferred solution in practice. While the decoding behavior of LDPC codes has been well studied for pure error or pure erasure channels, the mixed error-and-erasure case has received less attention, despite its direct relevance to storage. In this work, we analyze the potential correction capability of iterative error-and-erasure decoding for LDPC codes under hard-decision channels. Using density evolution, we derive recursion equations for the joint evolution of error and erasure probabilities and establish bounds on the region of correctable error-erasure patterns. The presented results provide theoretical correction bounds that complement existing studies on error-only and erasure-only channels, and offer guidelines for LDPC code and decoder design in storage systems where errors and erasures naturally coexist."

The effect of the positive DC pole voltage on the attachment properties can be considered using this method. The method has been further developed in order to enable a more accurate simulation of the expected direct strike region into the conductor. This is achieved by changing the resolution of attractive space matrix in order to focus on the attractive space of the positive conductor. With this, the calculation time can be less compared to the original version due to the smaller physical extent of the highlighted, in-depth investigated zone. The results can be used for a more optimized external lightning protection system and the determined shielding failure current range can be highly beneficial for overvoltage protection calculations on the transmission line."

    "abstract": "Accurate detection of active fires (AF) is crucial for improving estimates of biomass burning emissions and environmental management. Satellite remote sensing at shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands with 10-30m spatial resolution has a great potential in identifying the numerous small active fires missed by fire-monitoring systems using coarse spatial resolution data, but is challenging due to heterogeneous backgrounds and multiple interferences. By combing enhanced threshold method and abundant prior information, we developed a generalized and robust fire detection algorithm using the daytime Sentinel-2 SWIR observations over complex surfaces in China. To discriminate with high reflecting surface targets such as rooftop and solar panels, more thresholds with visible and SWIR bands along with land cover datasets are utilized. Moreover, industrial thermal anomalies are excluded by time series satellite images. Validations of Sentinel-2 AF detection through visual inspection show very low commission rates (<1-3%) over selected regions of the world. Since burnt areas in fire boundaries with higher temperature than backgrounds were taken as AFs, the average omission rates increase to ~3-4%. A maximum omission rate of ~7-8% occurs in African grassland, which has a short burning time. Despite consistent spatial patterns, 1 km MODIS and 375 m VIIRS detections performed in the medium infrared bands missed more than 90% of Sentinel-2 AFs. With the flexible framework, our method also has robust performance in similar Landsat 8/9 SWIR observations. By combing Sentinel-2 2B/2C and Landsat 8/9 observations, our reliable AF detection at fine scales (20-30 m) can provide a significant supplement for the biomass burning emission estimation with a temporal resolution of 2-3 days."

    "abstract": "Ozone pollution suppresses plant photosynthesis and reduces crop yields, yet many global assessments still rely on indicators or models that are difficult to compare across regions. We propose a concise and scalable remote sensing index, called Ozone Vegetation Exposure Intensity ( VEI<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O<sub>3</sub></sub> ), that combines near-surface ozone concentrations with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to characterize the spatiotemporal distribution of vegetation ozone exposure. Using global observations from 2003 to 2019, we find pronounced spatial and seasonal contrasts, with higher exposure in industrialized and densely vegetated regions, particularly during spring and summer in the Northern Hemisphere. VEI<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O<sub>3</sub></sub> is consistently associated with independent vegetation metrics: regions of higher ozone exposure generally correspond to lower Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF), indicating ozone-induced stress on vegetation activity. In site-level evaluations using the Community Land Model (CLM5.0) and FLUXNET eddy-covariance data, we identify a new potential critical ozone concentration of 42.38 ppb, which yields improved performance over the traditional AOT40 (Accumulated exposure Over a Threshold of 40 ppb) in broad, non-cropland contexts – suggesting it can complement existing ozone exposure indices. VEI<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O<sub>3</sub></sub> can be operationalized for ozone risk management: for example, by screening hotspots to prioritize field inspections and expand monitoring networks; by serving alongside AOT40 as a metric for evaluating seasonal mitigation plans and issuing alerts during peak growing seasons; and by coupling with land-use and crop distribution data to support emission-control planning and scenario analysis. Key limitations of our current approach include reliance on monthly ozone and NDVI products (with uneven monitoring coverage), a predominantly linear statistical framework that does not capture time lags or nonlinear dose–response behavior, and the absence of explicit stomatal-flux representation. Priorities for future work include controlled experimental validation, integration of VEI<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O<sub>3</sub></sub> with stomatal flux schemes in land-surface models, expansion of ground observations in data-sparse regions, and testing of alternative vegetation indices with stricter cloud and reflectance screening. VEI<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O<sub>3</sub></sub> represents a new remote sensing index for detecting vegetation ozone exposure. The critical levels and model-improvement directions inferred here should be treated as potential references that, with further validation and refinement, can help bridge the gap between observations, models, and policy, ultimately providing a reliable remote-sensing-based decision support tool for managing risks to ecosystem productivity and food security."

The device is fabricated at the end face of a strongly coupled seven-core fiber (SSCF), where the inter-core coupling merges light from multiple cores into a common supermode, enabling single-ended retrieval of interferometric spectra. By intentionally designing distinct cavity lengths, the two FPIs exhibit markedly different optical path differences (OPDs), allowing their interference components to be naturally separated in the spatialfrequency domain. A phase-locked demodulation technique is then employed to independently track OPDs variations, thus enabling simultaneous dual-parameter measurement. Experiments demonstrate a strain sensitivity of 6.49 nmμε with only 0.00129 crosstalk in the temperature channel and a temperature sensitivity of -6.62 nm/°C with 0.0882 crosstalk in the strain channel. Leveraging the dual-FPI configuration on the SSCF, the proposed sensor provides a compact and robust approach to ultralow-crosstalk, high-sensitivity strain and temperature sensing."

This paper presents a novel spatial-temporal-spectral Mamba (STSMamba) with deformable token sequence for enhanced MODIS time series classification, with the following key contributions. First, to disentangle temporal-spectral feature coupling, a temporal grouped stem (TGS) module is designed for initial feature learning. Second, to improve Mamba modeling efficiency and accuracy, a sparse, deformable Mamba sequencing (SDMS) approach is designed, which can reduce the potential information redundancy in Mamba sequence and improve the adaptability and learnability of the Mamba sequencing. Third, based on SDMS, to improve feature learning, a novel spatial-temporal-spectral Mamba architecture is designed, leading to three modules, i.e., a sparse deformable spatial Mamba module (SDSpaM), a sparse deformable spectral Mamba module (SDSpeM), and a sparse deformable temporal Mamba module (SDTM) to explicitly learn key information sources in MODIS. The proposed approach is tested on MODIS time series data in comparison with many state-of-the-art approaches, and the results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve higher classification accuracy with reduced computational complexity."

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed significant advancements in text-guided style transfer, primarily attributed to innovations in diffusion models. These models excel in conditional guidance, utilizing text or images to direct the sampling process. Traditional style transfer focuses on low-level visual features, such as brushstroke textures and color distributions, and appears more like applying an artistic filter to an image. Artistic attribute transfer, however, transcends the limitations of traditional style transfer by achieving the transfer of visual concepts from color and brushstrokes to high level aesthetic attributes such as composition, pose, and key semantic elements, resulting in more natural outcomes. Therefore, we propose an innovative text-to-image artistic attribute transfer framework named ArtCrafter. Specifically, we introduce an attention-based style extraction module, meticulously engineered to capture the subtle artistic attribute elements within an image. This module features a multi-layer architecture that leverages the capabilities of perceiver attention mechanisms to integrate fine-grained information. Additionally, we present a novel text-image aligning augmentation component that adeptly balances control over both modalities, enabling the model to efficiently map image and text embeddings into a shared feature space. We achieve this through attention operations that enable smooth information flow between modalities. Lastly, we incorporate an explicit modulation that seamlessly blends multimodal enhanced embeddings with original embeddings through an embedding reframing design, empowering the model to generate diverse outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ArtCrafter yields impressive results in visual stylization, exhibiting exceptional levels of artistic attribute intensity, controllability, and diversity.

Current access control models fail to provide flexible operation and strong security because they do not support real-time policy changes and multiple data sources. The research establishes HY-ABAC as a hybrid Attribute-Based Access Control system which unites blockchain technology with machine learning algorithms (policy gradient and random forest) to enhance security and operational speed and enable flexible policy administration for IoT systems. The system depends on a random forest classifier for making exact decisions and policy gradient for creating and updating policies in real-time. The system uses a local blockchain to track access transactions through decentralized and transparent and immutable methods which establish trust and defend against unauthorized changes. The proposed model supports the complete integration of sensing technology with communication systems and computing power and control mechanisms for secure intelligent system operation in consumer IoT. Using the ToN-IoT dataset, the model achieves 98% accuracy and processes 25% more transactions per block than Fabric-IoT and 11% more than ABAC-HLFBC. It further reduces policy configuration and verification time compared with Fabric-IoT, ABAC-IoT, ABAC-HLFBC, and DACSB."

    "abstract": "Affective touch has attracted significant interest due to its positive effects on child development and adult well-being. Studies showed that light and slow stroke of soft brush on hairy skin elicits affective sensation by activating C-Tactile fibers. Mid-air haptics, which uses focused ultrasound to create tactile sensations in free space, offers a promising method for eliciting affective changes. However, it remains poorly understood to what extent mid-air haptics can produce the perception similar to a brush stroke on hairy skin. Here, we conducted a psychophysical study comparing the tactile perception of mid-air ultrasound stimulation with that of real materials (sandpaper, aluminum resin, urethane rubber, cloth, and soft brush). Participants rated each stimulation on the dorsum of hand along three affective touch dimensions (pleasantness, surprise, ticklishness) and three discriminative touch dimensions (smoothness, softness, warmness). Univariate analyses revealed that ultrasound stimuli differed from aluminum resin, sandpaper, and urethane rubber in one or more dimensions of discriminative touch. Ultrasound stimulation with 10 Hz amplitude modulation significantly felt more pleasant than sandpaper, while no consistent differences between ultrasound and real textures ratings was observed in surprise and ticklishness. Multivariate analyses showed that ultrasound stimuli with amplitude modulation at 10 Hz and 100 Hz were significantly closer to real textures than unmodulated ultrasound. Questionnaires showed that over half of the participants identified ultrasound stimulation as a brush or cotton. These findings suggest that mid-air haptics can evoke perceptual attributes overlapping with those of real textures, including soft brushes, on hairy skin. Moreover, amplitude modulation may enhance the perceptual resemblance to realistic textures."

    "abstract": "This paper explores test-agnostic long-tail recognition, a challenging long-tail task where the test label distributions are unknown and arbitrarily imbalanced. We argue that the variation in these distributions can be broken down hierarchically into global and local levels. The global ones reflect a broad range of diversity, while the local ones typically arise from milder changes, often focused on a particular neighbor. Traditional methods predominantly use a Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) approach, targeting a few fixed test label distributions that exhibit substantial global variations. However, the local variations are left unconsidered. To address this issue, we propose a new MoE strategy, <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathsf {DirMixE}$</tex-math></inline-formula>, which assigns experts to different Dirichlet meta-distributions of the label distribution, each targeting a specific aspect of local variations. Additionally, the diversity among these Dirichlet meta-distributions inherently captures global variations. This dual-level approach also leads to a more stable objective function, allowing us to sample different test distributions better to quantify the mean and variance of performance outcomes. Building on this idea, we develop a general Latent Skill Finetuning (LSF) framework for parameter-efficient finetuning of foundation models. We provide implementations based on LoRA and Adapter. Theoretically, we derive upper bounds on the generalization error for both standard learning and PEFT. Under mild assumptions, we show that the variance-based regularization helps tighten these bounds. Furthermore, we prove that the covering number of the PEFT hypothesis class scales with the number of trainable parameters. Finally, extensive experiments on CIFAR-10-LT, CIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist validate the effectiveness of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathsf {DirMixE}$</tex-math></inline-formula>."

Beyond these functions, BHI has been consistently implicated in clinical studies in cardiovascular, neurological, and psychiatric conditions. This reality makes the investigation of bidirectional BHI mechanisms—and the derivation of interpretable biomarkers– - indispensable for cardiovascular, physiological, and neuroscientific research that treats the body as an interoceptive network of interacting organs rather than isolated systems. The growing interest in this perspective has generated a broad spectrum of frameworks, from signal-processing pipelines and computational models to dynamical systems. Building on previous surveys that have thoroughly mapped the field and deepened our understanding, this review offers a complementary perspective centered on mechanistic, physiology-inspired models of dynamical systems. For each model, we identify the physiological subsystem described, clarify core assumptions, and assess strengths and limitations. We then outline the technical perspectives necessary to realize the full potential of these approaches — especially for inferring latent interoceptive quantities that govern directional BHI but are not directly observable, and for integrating explicit brain modeling into these frameworks to better capture the neural mechanisms driving autonomic and cardiovascular dynamics. Mechanistic dynamical modeling has, over decades, deepened our understanding of physiology and pathology and informed the mapping and treatment of diverse conditions. Our objective is to provide a comprehensive account of state-of-the-art dynamical models, delineate methodological directions, and highlight application areas where such models can yield explanatory insight, reliable prediction, and actionable clinical targets."

    "abstract": "Cloud contamination in multi-temporal remote sensing images, particularly due to thick clouds, significantly impacts the accuracy of environmental monitoring tasks. While existing Low-Rank Tensor Completion (LRTC) methods address cloud removal, they struggle with strict multi-temporal correlation requirements and poor generalization due to parameter sensitivity. To overcome these limitations, we propose WLRT-DR, a novel two-stage framework combining Wavelet-domain Low-Rank Tensor Completion with Deep Regularization. First, we introduce discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to decompose multi-temporal imagery into frequency-specific subbands (LL, LH, HL, HH). Empirical analysis reveals distinct low-rank properties in each subband, enabling targeted low-rank processing that better preserves spatial textures and structural continuity compared to unified spatial-domain LRTC. Second, we develop a dual-phase architecture where wavelet-domain LRTC (Stage 1) is synergistically combined with deep network regularization (Stage 2). This hybrid strategy leverages the complementary strengths: wavelet-domain low-rank recovery efficiently reconstructs fundamental spatial features, while pretrained deep networks impose non-linear constraints to enhance spectral fidelity. Comprehensive validation on simulated (Landsat data covering diverse Beijing landscapes) and real-world data demonstrates that WLRT-DR delivers enhanced reconstruction accuracy, robustness to complex spatio-temporal patterns, and improved processing efficiency. The framework provides an effective alternative for cloud reconstruction by integrating traditional tensor completion and deep learning in a novel manner."

    "abstract": "Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are among the most prominent error-correction schemes in today’s data-driven world. They find application to fortify various modern storage, communication, and computing systems. Protograph-based (PB) LDPC codes offer many degrees of freedom in the code design and enable fast encoding and decoding. In particular, spatially-coupled (SC) and multi-dimensional (MD) circulant-based codes are PB-LDPC codes with excellent performance. Efficient finite-length (FL) algorithms are required in order to effectively exploit the available degrees of freedom offered by SC partitioning, lifting, and MD relocations. In this paper, we propose a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC or MC<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>) method to perform this FL optimization, addressing the removal of short cycles. While we focus on partitioning and lifting of SC codes, our MC<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> approach can effectively work for other procedures and/or other code designs. While iterating, we draw samples from a defined distribution where the probability decreases as the number of short cycles from the previous iteration increases. We analyze our MC<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> method theoretically as we prove the invariance of the Markov chain where each state represents a possible partitioning or lifting arrangement, i.e., sample, that has a specific probability. Via our simulations, we then fit the distribution of the number of cycles resulting from a given arrangement on a Gaussian distribution. By analyzing the mean, we derive estimates for cycle counts that are close to the actual counts. Furthermore, we derive the order of the expected number of iterations required by our MC<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> approach to reach a local minimum as well as the size of the Markov chain recurrent class through approximating the probability of getting arbitrarily close to the local minimum. Our approach is compatible with code design techniques based on gradient-descent. Experimental results show that our MC<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> method generates SC codes with remarkably fewer short cycles and substantial gains in error/erasure-rate performance compared with the current state-of-the-art. Moreover, to reach the same number of cycles, our MC<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> method requires orders of magnitude less overall time compared with the available literature methods."

    "abstract": "Multipath exploitation techniques have attracted considerable attention over the past decade, as they expand the detection coverage of conventional radar systems to Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) areas. However, existing methods rely on fully or partially known reflector surface information to achieve detection and localization of NLOS targets, which poses challenges for practical applications since scene information is often not available <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a priori</i>. To overcome this issue, we present a multipath exploitation-based millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) imaging radar framework, which first performs three-dimensional (3D) environmental perception and then transfers the reflector surface parameters to assist NLOS target reconstruction. To implement this process, we explore several key problems and propose corresponding solutions. First of all, we propose a joint multiple linear array beamforming (JMLA-BF)-based imaging algorithm to achieve high-resolution sparse imaging as well as extract weak echoes of NLOS reflector surface. Then, an iteration algorithm is proposed for NLOS building layout recognition and relocation. Meanwhile, we propose an unambiguous direction-of-departure (DoD) and direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation method for multipath signals from NLOS moving target using colocated MIMO radar. Finally, a path-oriented strategy is introduced to achieve NLOS target localization. Real experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and solutions in accurate 3D environmental perception and reliable NLOS target reconstruction."

    "abstract": "Distributed coherent aperture radar (DCAR) operating in MIMO mode is vulnerable to self-defense dense false target jamming, which closely resembles the true target signal and is therefore difficult to suppress. To address this challenge, based on the difference between the jamming and the target signal in the frequency modulation slope domain, we designed an algorithm combining biorthogonal Fourier transform (BFT) and echo preprocessing, so that there is a significant difference between the jamming and the target signal in the matched filtering (MF) outputs. First, the BFT analysis is employed to separate the echo components corresponding to up-chirp (UC) and down-chirp (DC) before multi-channel MF. Then, echo preprocessing is performed on the separated echoes using reference signals that have different chirp rates. This causes misalignment in the peaks of jamming after MF and enables discrimination between false and real targets. Finally, to prevent the jamming from obtaining higher gain in the process of coherent integration, time-domain filtering is applied before coherent integration. Experimental simulations validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in terms of jamming suppression."

However, preserving the effectiveness of the obtained structural information is important in image super-resolution. In this paper, we propose a cosine network for image super-resolution (CSRNet) by improving a network architecture and optimizing the training strategy. To extract complementary homologous structural information, odd and even heterogeneous blocks are designed to enlarge the architectural differences and improve the performance of image super-resolution. Combining linear and non-linear structural information can overcome the drawback of homologous information and enhance the robustness of the obtained structural information in image super-resolution. Taking into account the local minimum of gradient descent, a cosine annealing mechanism is used to optimize the training procedure by performing warm restarts and adjusting the learning rate. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed CSRNet is competitive with state-of-the-art methods in image super-resolution."

The proposed technique holds the inductor current ripple constant by leveraging the duty-cycle-dependent inductor current ripple and varies the switching frequency to hold this current ripple constant at its rated design value. Furthermore, this technique can be leveraged to spread conducted electromagnetic interference peaks at both the input and output ports of the inverter. Practical lower switching limits are derived and taken into consideration in developing this approach, and experimental results validate the feasibility in a common microcontroller framework. Hardware results are provided for both 6-level and 8-level FCML inverters and showcase loss reductions and improved electromagnetic interference performance."

    "abstract": "In wireless power transfer (WPT) systems based on SAE J2954, a wide variation in the coupling coefficient is inevitable due to misalignment between the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) coils. Designing a 2-stage system to be robust against this wide variation imposes high maximum electrical stresses on components and leads to significant efficiency variation across the coupling coefficient range. To alleviate this issue, a 3-stage configuration incorporating a post-regulator on the Rx side is typically employed, but this increases the overall system size and cost. Therefore, this article proposes an optimized Rx coil with a simple structure, which exhibits a narrower coupling coefficient range and a higher coil inductance than a conventional Rx coil. This enables a 2-stage system to be realized without a post-regulator, while significantly reducing the maximum stresses on components. In addition, it mitigates the efficiency variation and improves the overall system efficiency. This approach is particularly advantageous for electric vehicles, as it minimizes the design burden of the Rx side. Finally, 3.3 kW 2-stage and 3-stage WPT systems with a conventional Rx coil as well as a 3.3 kW 2-stage WPT system with the optimized Rx coil are implemented to experimentally verify and compare their performances."

    "abstract": "Free-space optical (FSO) communication has emerged as a promising technology for high-capacity wireless links, offering advantages such as unlicensed spectrum and immunity to electromagnetic interference. However, atmospheric turbulence introduces intensity scintillation and phase distortions that significantly degrade link performance. To address these impairments, we propose a hybrid probabilistic shaping (PS) and residual carrier modulation (RCM) scheme. A residual carrier is generated by slightly adjusting the bias point of the in-phase and quadrature (IQ) modulator, enabling robust phase recovery without additional pilot tones or high-power direct current (DC) components. Concurrently, PS reshapes the symbol probability distribution to mitigate turbulence-induced intensity fluctuations. Numerical and experimental results show that the proposed PS-RCM approach effectively suppresses turbulence-induced impairments. The proposed method provides a power-efficient and hardware-compatible solution for reliable coherent detection in turbulent FSO channels."

Then, we propose a decoupled precoder and receiver design for both DL and UL, which allows precoders and receivers to be designed independently at each satellite and user terminal (UT), respectively, with only local statistical channel state information (sCSI). Moreover, with the established beam based channel model, the design of space domain DL precoder and UL receiver can be converted into that of lower-dimensional beam domain vectors with only local sCSI, and the resulting space domain precoder and receiver are beam structured. Furthermore, we propose a low-complexity design and implementation for the beam structured DL precoder and UL receiver by exploiting properties of the beam matrix, significantly reducing the computational complexity.

Because AI systems are vulnerable to algorithmic bias, data breaches, and adversarial attacks, strong security measures are required. This study examines the relationship between privacy protection, AI security, and regulatory compliance and suggests a thorough security strategy to reduce these risks. The study uses a multifaceted approach that includes threat analysis, literature review, and assessment of current AI security measures. Additionally, to guarantee the legal deployment of AI, compliance with international standards like the GDPR and India's Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDP), 2023, is evaluated. Critical gaps in AI security are highlighted by a review of previous research, such as the lack of standardised regulatory frameworks, difficulties in protecting large-scale AI models, and inadequate resilience against adversarial attacks. According to the findings, AI system security is considerably increased by combining cutting-edge security mechanisms, moral AI principles, and regulatory compliance procedures. The suggested approach demonstrates its efficacy in government, healthcare, and financial applications, hence enhancing AI's robustness and credibility. This study highlights how urgently comprehensive security measures are required to handle the changing terrain of AI dangers and guarantee its moral and responsible application."

However, the recognition of these inscriptions poses major challenges due to character erosion, irregular stroke patterns, and the scarcity of annotated datasets. While modern OCR systems are effective for contemporary printed scripts, they fail to handle the complexity of ancient Thai characters. This paper presents a deep learning–based framework for Thai epigraphic character recognition, systematically evaluating three state-of-the-art convolutional backbones—ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNet-B0— under a 5-fold cross-validation protocol. Experimental results demonstrate that MobileNetV2 achieves the best overall performance, with an average accuracy of 0.7984, precision of 0.7709, recall of 0.7915, and F1-score of 0.7568, outperforming both ResNet50 and EfficientNet-B0. The findings highlight the effectiveness of lightweight CNN architectures for resource-constrained OCR tasks, particularly in domains where data scarcity and degradation are critical issues. This work provides the first systematic benchmarking of CNN backbones for Thai epigraphic OCR under a controlled evaluation."

To effectively reduce the damage caused by extreme weather conditions to the power system, it is essential to identify the weak links in the power system under extreme weather conditions. A vulnerability assessment method is proposed in this paper, which provides a quantifiable decision-making tool for improving the resilience of power system under extreme weather conditions. First, a typical storm scenario is modeled. We introduce a dual-parameter Weibull distribution to describe the variation of line failure probability. Moreover, a piecewise failure probability calculation method is employed to quantify the dynamic impacts of storm conditions on the power system. Then, we use the direct current optimal power flow model (DC-OPF) to calculate the load shedding and power flow changes. Next, to evaluate the operating status of power system, a comprehensive evaluation index system that considers both safety and optimization is proposed. Finally, the non-sequential Monte Carlo method is applied to generate evaluation data, and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is utilized to calculate the comprehensive evaluation index to identify the weak links on the system. Simulation results based on the IEEE 39-bus system show the effectiveness of the proposed method."

However, the inherent variability and intermittency of renewable energy, particularly photovoltaic (PV) power, pose significant challenges to the reliability and stability of power systems. Based on the dynamic response characteristics of proton exchange membrane electrolyzer (PEMEL), this paper proposes a coordinated control method suitable for photovoltaic fluctuations, and realizes the efficient and stable operation of renewable energy hydrogen production system. Firstly, the operational characteristics of PV systems are analyzed, and a mathematical model describing PV fluctuations is established. Subsequently, the dynamic response characteristics of PEMEL under variable load conditions are thoroughly investigated. The key influencing factors on the dynamic response of the PEMEL are identified and decomposed. Finally, a coordinated control method is then proposed to adapt the fluctuation patterns of PV power. This method effectively balances the slow response dynamics of the PEMEL with the intermittent nature of PV generation, enabling rapid tracking of PV power variations through dynamic adjustment of control parameters."

The results show that the “source-load-storage” coordinated optimization strategy can effectively smooth the load curve, reduce system operating costs, improve renewable energy utilization and system regulation flexibility, and verify the practicality and robustness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "The coexistence of grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) power electronics converters (PECs) in power systems has emerged as an increasing trend. This paper investigates the influence of GFM-PECs on the small-signal stability of GFL-PECs from a circuit-based perspective. An eigen-subsystem is firstly introduced for analyzing the complex multi-machine system. The eigen-subsystem method simplifies the analysis of complex to an equivalent two-machine model with one GFM-PEC and one GFL-PEC, while retaining the dominant stability modes of GFL-PECs. Futhermore, from the circuit viewpoint, it is identified that the GFM-PEC node can be equivalently modeled as a Vθ node in series with an equivalent inductance, which is related to the control dynamics of the GFM-PEC. Matrix analysis is also employed to explore the effect of GFM integration on network connectivity. The results indicate that GFM-PECs with appropriate control enhance network connectivity, thereby improving the small-signal stability of GFL-PECs, vice versa. Simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed analytical approach."

These phases demand rapid force generation, precise posture regulation, and dynamic balance under underactuated conditions, placing stringent requirements on control strategies. This paper presents a multi-stage curriculum-assisted reinforcement learning frame-work, where the robot first acquires fundamental jumping skills through reference motion imitation, and subsequently generalizes to multi-target jumping tasks. A tailored reward mechanism promotes whole-body coordination, particularly focusing on torso orientation and arm movements, thereby improving both stability and versatility. Simulation results on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot show that the learned policy enables various jumps, including a forward jump of 1.8 m, lateral jump of 0.8 m, vertical jump of 0.4 m, and aerial yaw rotation of up to 115°. Under 0.1 s impulse perturbations up to 250 N, the robot maintains over 80% success rate in stable landings, indicating strong robustness and task generalization capabilities."

The proposed system comprises a battery string, a switch array, a reconfigurable converter, SOC and current monitoring circuits, and control unit. The verification results demonstrate that the proposed system significantly improves equalization efficiency and reduces energy loss compared to traditional methods, making it particularly suitable for long series-connected battery strings."

However, because device-to-device connections are unstable due to power supply restrictions and frequent device failure, network operators face a heavy maintenance burden and require advanced management skills. To simplify network management, this study proposes an ad-hoc network management method incorporating mixed reality (MR) technology, enabling sub-optimal visualization and simple gesture manipulation. The network is visualized using virtual objects in the MR environment, where an MR goggle automatically selects an appropriate indicator among multiple options based on the usage environment. In addition, an ad-hoc network is updated by directly manipulating virtual objects in the MR environment with the operator’s gestures, called handtracking. Fundamental operations for network visualization and updating were validated through experiments using HoloLens2 as an MR goggle. The results indicate that MR technology can simplify ad-hoc network management, offering a more intuitive and efficient approach for use in dynamic environments."

    "abstract": "Accurate analysis of brain MRI is essential for early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s. However, variability in brain orientation and structure often leads to misalignment of critical regions of interest (ROIs), limiting the performance of automated classifiers. Traditional preprocessing methods, such as affine registration, are rigid and detached from the learning process. To address this, we propose STN-MRI, an end-to-end deep learning framework that integrates a Spatial Transformer Network (STN) as a learnable preprocessing module. The STN predicts affine transformations that align anatomical structures, producing ROI-focused inputs for a CNN classifier. We evaluate our approach on T1-weighted sagittal slices from the ADNI dataset and compare it to a baseline ResNet-18 model. STN-MRI improves classification accuracy from 84.7% to 89.6% and achieves higher F1-scores across all classes. Grad-Cam visualizations further confirm enhanced attention to disease-relevant regions. These results demonstrate the value of task-driven spatial normalization for robust and interpretable brain MRI classification."

    "abstract": "In response to the national “dual carbon” strategy, the development of a new power system centered on renewable energy has become a critical objective. Ultra-high voltage direct current (UHVDC) transmission is an essential solution for large-scale renewable energy integration and longdistance power delivery, yet it faces significant challenges such as commutation failure in conventional line-commutated converters (LCC). To address these limitations, the Hybrid Commutated Converter (HCC), based on fully controllable Integrated Gate-Commutated Thyristors (IGCTs), has been proposed as an innovative alternative. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the engineering application of the HCC technology in the Lingbao Converter Station retrofit project, including valve topology design, IGCT selection, and full-scale operational testing. A dedicated experimental platform was constructed to conduct key tests such as maximum continuous triggering, protective turn-on under fault conditions (BOD), and transient overload operation. The results demonstrate that the HCC converter valve achieves reliable turn-off, exhibits strong self-protection capabilities, and ensures stable operation under extreme conditions, confirming its potential for large-scale deployment in future UHVDC projects."

    "abstract": "Modular multilevel converter with full-bridge and half-bridge hybrid-submodules (SM-Hybrid-MMC) is gradually being applied in flexible DC transmission projects due to its economic efficiency and fault-tolerant capabilities. Balancing the capacitor voltages of submodules within the same converter arm is fundamental for the normal operation of MMC. The exist dynamic layered sorting approach enhances computational performance substantially without compromising the control effectiveness achieved by conventional capacitor voltage balancing algorithms. However, these algorithms are only applicable to half-bridge submodule MMC (HBSM-MMC). This paper proposes an efficient dynamic zoned capacitor voltage balancing algorithm for MMC with full-bridge and half-bridge hybrid-submodules, which significantly reduces the number of submodules involved in the sorting process. The proposed algorithm substantially decreases the quantity of submodules requiring active sorting operations. Implementation and verification are conducted using the ADPSS-EMT, with validation performed through an LCC-MMC HVDC test case. Simulation results demonstrate that the novel approach maintains equivalent voltage regulation performance to conventional methods while achieving two key advantages: (1) consistent capacitor voltage stability across all valve arm submodules; (2) the acceleration ratio reaching <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1104{\\%}$</tex> compared to conventional sorting algorithms."

By applying clustering techniques, we categorize the region surrounding Kolkata into distinct zones based on LST time-series and night-time light time series. Additionally, we employ an unsupervised deep transfer learning-based change detection method to identify urban changes over the past few years. The results of this analysis reveal that new urban development is predominantly occurring at the city’s periphery, gradually converting more land into built-up areas. This transformation is bringing a larger portion of the region under warmer LST zones, highlighting the effects of urbanization on local climate conditions. By understanding these patterns, we can better grasp the implications of urban growth on environmental and thermal dynamics, which is important for sustainable city planning in rapidly developing urban areas like Kolkata."

Recent research has explored the potential of utilizing machine learning methods to predict credit risk in the supply chain enterprises. However, the consensus on the most suitable approach for credit risk assessment in the manufacturing sector remains indefinable. This study mainly focuses on small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises and goals to grow a credit risk evaluation system by selecting relevant risk evaluation indicators such as financial and non-financial tailored to their specific characteristics. The sample data from Malaysia's stock market, surrounding SMEs from 2018 to 2023, has been analyzed consuming SVM and Gradient boosting machine learning algorithms to measure corporate credit risk. The appraisal results are extra analyzed using a partial requirement plot method to visually identify significant indicators. The answers reveal that an active credit risk evaluation system for supply chain finance in manufacturing SMEs should consider the financing companies' outline and asset status, the outline of core companies in the supply chain, and the general operation of the supply chains. The request of a Gradient boosting algorithm enhances the accuracy of credit risk assessment in manufacturing supply chain finance. Given the diverse impacts of dissimilar indicators on the evaluation results, supply chain enterprises and financial facility institutions should grow customized plans based on specific circumstances."

    "abstract": "A public wireless communication network enables virtual power plants (VPPs) to manage massive demand-side resources, but it also exposes them to jamming attacks. Existing anti-jamming channel access methods primarily aim to maximize network throughput. However, they fail to balance the distinct communication requirements of VPPs and other users. This is because of the non-equivalence between throughput maximization and a VPP's regulation capacity. To address this issue, this article proposes a semantic-aware channel access method for VPPs, where channel access decisions are made based on information semantics rather than throughput. First, the communication requirements of the VPP and other users are analytically modeled. Then, the channel access problem is formulated as a game. It is proven that the resulting game is a potential game with at least one Nash equilibrium. Finally, a distributed channel access algorithm is proposed to find this equilibrium-representing the VPP's regulation capacity under jamming attacks. Four jamming modes (fixed, sweep, dynamic sweep, and random jamming) are analyzed in case studies. Results validate the effectiveness of the proposed semantic-aware channel access method."

Modern data storage generally adopts SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) technology to monitor the internal working state of data storage and issue warnings for existing problems. However, the judgment of data storage faults by SMART technology is limited by the experience settings of the manufacturers, and it is unable to predict possible future faults. This paper proposes a power grid data storage fault prediction technology based on LightGBM, constructs a fault prediction system and conducts testing and verification. The test results show that this technology has high accuracy and effectiveness in predicting data storage faults."

    "abstract": "With the large-scale integration of renewable energy sources and emerging loads, the prediction errors and uncertainties in both generation and consumption can lead to significant deviations between the actual and expected operating states of distribution systems. These deviations may hinder the achievement of anticipated economic performance. To enhance the economic efficiency and operational flexibility of the system, this paper proposes a predictive - tracking - correction hierarchical optimization scheduling control method. In the day-ahead stage, a data-driven forecasting method based on long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks is developed. With the objective of minimizing total operating cost, an optimization model is established and solved using the adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) algorithm to obtain the day-ahead unit output schedule combination. During the intraday stage, model predictive control (MPC) is adopted to correct the day-ahead economic scheduling plan, thereby addressing the impact of prediction errors and operational uncertainties on the system. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through case-study simulations."

This vast data set provides a global perspective that is essential to the study of dynamic processes, such as climate change, urbanization, deforestation, and natural disasters. However, the large extent and complex character of raw satellite imagery limits its applicability, since such data sets require high-end processing streams that transform pixel-level data into practical research outcomes for industry, policy, and academic professionals. This present systematic review will examine the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), with particular emphasis on deep learning techniques, into satellite image processing workflows. Our analysis encompasses a wide range of methodologies that optimize feature extraction, enhance classification accuracy, and enable the analysis of complex spatial and temporal remote sensing data patterns. We evaluate both on-board processing solutions designed to minimize data transfer loads and facilitate real-time decision-making, and ground-based processing techniques that enable more computationally demanding algorithms. Furthermore, this review addresses upcoming trends in edge computing, energy optimization, and super-resolution approaches that attempt to mitigate inherent hardware constraints and functional limitations. By incorporating current research trends, pinpointing key challenges like data heterogeneity and processing delay, and sketching out possible guidelines for future development, this article is a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners striving to leverage the broad applications of artificial intelligence to augment Earth observations and informed decision-making."

    "abstract": "Battery energy storage system (BESS) plays a positive role in mitigating the output fluctuations of renewable energy and ensuring the safe and stable operation of power systems. However, participation in distribution network optimization and regulation can accelerate the aging of critical components in BESS, thereby reducing its reliability. Existing studies on BESS reliability have primarily focused on the impact of battery degradation on system reliability, while neglecting the impact of lifetime damage of the power conversion system (PCS) and its key components. To address this gap, this paper proposes a PCS reliability assessment method that considers the lifetime damage of its critical components. First, a thermoelectric coupling model is employed to convert the BESS mission profile into a thermal load profile for the components. Then, the lifetime damage of each component is calculated by applying a high-fidelity physical lifetime model and Miner's rule. Subsequently, the lifetime distribution of each component is obtained through Monte-Carlo simulation. Finally, an accurate device-level reliability assessment is achieved by integrating these component-level results based on the system's electrical topology. The simulation results indicate that providing reactive power support significantly reduces the lifespan of both IGBTs and capacitors within the PCS, which in turn affects its overall reliability."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the fully distributed time-varying optimization (DTVO) problem for networked heterogeneous systems, where each agent only has access to its own local time-varying cost function. Most existing distributed optimization studies focus on time-invariant objective functions and homogeneous agent dynamics, which cannot meet the requirements of dynamic optimization tasks in practical scenarios with diverse agent characteristics. To tackle this challenge, a fully DTVO algorithm is proposed by integrating output regulation techniques and adaptive parameter methods. This algorithm enables the outputs of networked heterogeneous systems to asymptotically converge to the optimal trajectory without relying on any global network information (such as topology structure or node quantity). Compared with existing DTVO studies, the proposed algorithm makes two key improvements: first, it expands the scope of agent dynamics from simple homogeneous models to more general heterogeneous dynamical equations, enhancing practical applicability; second, the introduction of adaptive dynamic gains eliminates the need for pre-known network global information, realizing a truly fully distributed control framework. Finally, simulation experiments on a multi-UAV system with heterogeneous dynamics verify that the algorithm can effectively solve time-varying optimization tasks, demonstrating its theoretical validity and engineering practicality."

To characterize their effects, this paper analyzes the performance of MA-enhanced flexible beamforming in two typical scenarios of beamforming, namely, beam nulling and multi-beam forming towards multiple directions in the near field. In particular, we aim to derive the worst-case sum beam gain towards these directions in the presence of antenna position errors given an optimal beamforming design. To tackle the intricate near-field steering vectors, we introduce Taylor expansion to approximate the near-field beam gain in each direction. By this means, we show that the worst-case sum beam gain in the beam nulling scenario can be derived by solving a quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem, for which the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique is applied. While in the multi-beam forming scenario, we derive the worst-case sum beam gain in closed-form, revealing several key factors affecting the performance degradation by antenna position errors. Numerical results validate the efficacy of our analytical results."

Nevertheless, practical implementations indicate that equipment produced by different manufacturers, owing to disparities in oscillation monitoring algorithms and strategies, is susceptible to false alarms when the grid operating environment undergoes changes, which has an impact on power grid dispatch operations.To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a multi-parameter identification approach for grid wide-frequency oscillations. Based on wide-frequency measurement data, a comparative analysis of multiple parameters can effectively eliminate false alarms caused by external interference or equipment measurement anomalies. This approach overcomes the drawbacks of single monitoring targets' inability to adapt to complex and dynamic operating environments, thereby substantially enhancing the accuracy of oscillation monitoring alarms. It can offer support for the safe operation monitoring and dispatch control of new power systems."

    "abstract": "With the increasing proportion of renewable energy power generation and participation in market trading, due to its randomness and volatility, the current decomposition method for medium- and long-term trading electricity based on the electricity balance and verification is difficult to apply to the power systems with high-proportion renewable energy. In this paper, a decomposition method for Medium- and Longterm trading electricity of renewable energy based on Lagrange-Soft Actor Critic is proposed. First, from the construction of the long-term output curves for the renewable energy, the coordination optimization decomposition for the trading electricity, and multi-scenario simulation calculation, a coordination optimization method for medium- and long-term trading electricity is put forward to deal with the randomness and volatility of the renewable energy. Then, with the goal of promoting the accommodation of high-proportion renewable energy, an optimization decomposition model of medium- and long-term trading electricity for the renewable energy based on Lagrange-Soft Actor Critic is established.Finally, case studies are conducted by actual data of a provincial power grid in China. The results show that The proposed method achieves significant computational acceleration while maintaining prescribed accuracy requirements, demonstrating superior efficiency for practical power system applications."

    "abstract": "Insulator defect detection plays a crucial role in ensuring the stability and reliability of power transmission systems. However, traditional detection methods often suffer from inefficiencies and limited robustness in complex environments. To address these challenges, we propose InDetYOLO, an optimized YOLOv11-based framework that enhances detection accuracy for insulator defects. Specifically, we introduce three novel modules: (1) the Adaptive Fusion Feature Enhancement Module, which strengthens the backbone's feature extraction capability; (2) the Dynamic Scale-aware Feature Pyramid Network, which incorporates Channel Attention, Selective Feature Fusion, and Dynamic Sampling to enhance multi-scale feature; (3) the Efficient Unified Convolutional Detection Head, which reduces parameter redundancy while maintaining high detection accuracy. Experimental results on a self-constructed insulator defect dataset demonstrate that InDet-YOLO exhibits superior detection accuracy with low computational cost compared to other methods. In particular, InDet-YOLO achieves an mAP50 improvement of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{4. 4 \\%}$</tex> over the baseline YOLOv11n model with 1.1 fewer GFLOPs, making it an efficient solution for practical insulator defect detection."

    "abstract": "The growing prevalence of cyber-threats poses significant security concerns for microgrid (MG) operations, creating an urgent need for effective attack mitigation technologies. Traditional model-based techniques, which combine observers with resilient control, offer potential solutions. However, the introduction of observers transforms the MG into an observer-integrated MG (OIMG), whose performance and stability can be affected not only by cyber-attacks but also by the observers themselves. Despite this, current resilient control strategies often overlook the impact of observer characteristics in the control design process, potentially reducing overall mitigation effectiveness. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a novel control design methodology that simultaneously accounts for MG dynamics and observer interactions. The proposed approach ensures stability and rapid response of OIMGs under cyber-attack scenarios by jointly designing the controller and observer. The stability and robustness of the method are rigorously analyzed through theoretical evaluations, and its effectiveness is further demonstrated via numerical simulations in MATLAB and PLECS."

Nevertheless, the effectiveness of this approach is fundamentally limited by the presence of noisy pseudo-labels and rigid training curricula. To overcome these challenges, we design a Bayesian Curriculum Learning (BCL) framework customized for remote sensing data analysis. Specifically, we estimate epistemic uncertainty via Monte Carlo Dropout and apply a Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model to jointly cluster samples in the loss–uncertainty space. This enables dynamic partitioning of data into confident, ambiguous, and noisy subsets. Each subset is then processed with a curriculum-guided strategy: label sharpening, temperature-controlled Mixup, and subspace projection, respectively. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that BCL consistently improves performance and training stability under limited supervision."

    "abstract": "As power ratings exceed 10 MW, wind turbine power converters increasingly adopt parallel configurations of smaller modular converters. However, direct parallel operation can lead to several challenges, including power quality degradation, common-mode voltage (CMV) issues, electromagnetic interference (EMI), and mechanical vibrations. Although phase-shifted PWM carrier techniques can mitigate these issues, they require fast synchronization among modules, which compromises system reliability and increases cost, thus limiting their suitability for modular designs. This paper presents, for the first time, the observation that hysteresis current control enables the inverter currents of parallel branches to naturally evolve into an interleaved state without the need for explicit synchronization. This self-interleaving behavior significantly simplifies system design and enhances reliability, as it eliminates the need for additional control algorithms or inter-module communication. Moreover, this phenomenon leads to a notable reduction in total harmonic distortion (THD) of the grid current, thereby allowing a reduction in the capacitance of the grid filter. This, in turn, reduces both system cost and physical footprint. Through system modeling and analysis, the underlying mechanism of self-interleaving is investigated. It is shown that the phenomenon arises from two key factors: the physical feedback of common-mode voltage and inherent system delay. Experimental results from a megawatt-scale prototype validate the stability and reliability of the self-interleaving operation, demonstrating its potential for application in high-power wind energy conversion systems."

First, a line vulnerability model is established by simulating typhoon scenarios to calculate the failure probability of distribution network lines under different wind speeds. Second, an optimal power flow model that considers network reconfiguration is constructed to evaluate the load loss of the system under each fault scenario. Third, the importance of each line is ranked based on its load loss contribution, and a reinforcement strategy is formulated accordingly. The simulation results based on the improved IEEE 123 node system show that the proposed method can effectively improve the typhoon resistance of distribution networks."

The Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF) results confirm that Q-Learning provides lower peak values over the entire distribution. Additionally, Bit Error Rate (BER) analysis is carried out under an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel, showing only a slight degradation due to the reduced spectral efficiency introduced by pilot subcarriers.

In order to explore the regulation value of external power through market-oriented means and determine the negative reserve capacity provided by external power required by the system the next day, the cross-regional negative reserve market clearing model considering the regulation capability of external power and variety of regulatory resources within the region is designed. The model takes the minimum cost of the system as the objective function, and simulates a typical week with high net load peak-to-valley difference and difficult power system regulation. It verifies that by considering the regulation capacity of external power, the total cost of the system can be reduced, the number of starts and stops of thermal power units can be reduced, and more new energy can be absorbed, which is conducive to the safe, economical and eco-friendly operation of the system."

These factors lead to blurred features and increased intraclass variance, ultimately degrading recognition performance. To overcome these challenges, the proposed model incorporates the GAM attention mechanism, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), and a dual-channel structure, where each component is designed to mitigate noise interference, capture nonlinear feature relationships, and exploit multi-feature complementarity, respectively. The model processes various types of underwater acoustic features through two independent network channels and fuses the outputs from both channels for final classification. This architecture fully exploits the complementarity of different features, thereby enhancing the model’s target recognition capability in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments. To validate the model’s effectiveness, multiple experiments were conducted, and its performance was compared with existing methods under low SNR conditions. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed dual-channel model achieves superior recognition accuracy."

Current research mainly focuses on the trajectory planning for quadrotor and single-pendulum aerial transportation systems. However, how to generate an effective trajectory for aerial transportation systems with double-pendulum swing effects remains a problem to be solved. To address this problem, a novel trajectory planning approach for the double-pendulum aerial transportation systems that incorporate obstacle-avoidance and swing suppression is designed. First, the corresponding constraints for generating the obstacle-avoidance trajectory are constructed by integrating the physical structure and nonlinear dynamics of the double-pendulum aerial transportation systems. Based on these constraints, the obstacle-avoidance trajectory is generated via mathematical programming techniques. Further, an anti-swing term is added to the trajectory to compensate for the swing-induced energy from the hook and payload during obstacle-avoidance, which ensures both obstacle-avoidance and swing suppression. Through Lyapunov analysis, it is proven that the position of the quadrotor asymptotically converges to the target point, and the hook’s and payload’s swing angles asymptotically converge to zero. Finally, the feasibility of the approach is verified through an actual double-pendulum quadrotor aerial transportation platform."

    "abstract": "Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is critical for ensuring the safety, reliability, and efficient operation of complex industrial systems. Conventional deep neural networks, such as long short-term memory network and convolutional neural network mainly adopt local recurrent and pooling operations, which have notable limitations in global modeling in RUL prediction for complex industrial systems. Although the emergence of graph neural network (GNN)-based approaches can solve the above-mentioned problems, there are few reports on using GNN for RUL prediction under cross-domain conditions. Consequently, a novel transferable topology-aware graph pooling network is proposed for RUL prediction under cross-domain conditions. Specifically, this article integrates local and global voting to construct a topology-aware graph pooling network. Furthermore, a loss function is constructed to describe domain differences, so that the RUL prediction under cross-domain conditions is accomplished. Considering most of the existing deep learning approaches are closed-box models, this article designs an in-depth interpretability analysis based on the feature distribution and integrated gradient for the proposed approach. The effectiveness of TTAPGN is demonstrated by a commercial aircraft turbofan engine dataset, and a bearing degradation dataset from Xi'an Jiaotong University."

In this paper, a hybrid decoding algorithm is proposed for staircase codes (SCCs), which performs HD decoding with the help of channel soft information via multi-level bit-marking (MLBM). The HD and SD in the proposed MLBM decoding algorithm is <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">weakly hybrid</i> that the soft information is only used for one-shot bit marking and does not involve in the decoding directly, thus providing good performance-complexity tradeoff. The marked bits indicate four reliability levels that are used to prevent miscorrections by checking conflicts with highly reliable bits and to enhance the error-correcting capability of the HD decoder by flipping unreliable bits. Particularly, three priority levels are set for bit flipping by combining with the decoding statuses of the associated component codes. The decoding results will, in turn, help to update the marked bits among the four reliability levels. Numerical results show up to 1.22 dB gains with steeper waterfall region and lower error floor when compared to conventional HD decoding for SCCs, at the cost of approximately a two-fold increase in the memory storage."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a generator-inspired control methodology for grid-forming (GFM) inverters that deliberately emulates a self-excited induction generator so that the inverter can hold its voltage and frequency under difficult loading and severe terminal disturbances across wide voltage and frequency ranges. The design integrates a Lyapunov energy function-based inner loop to provide high bandwidth and strong disturbance rejection, and it complements this with a passivity-based argument that furnishes a coherent large-signal stability guarantee beyond small-signal limits. Analytical insights are developed via the Krylov-Bogoliubov-Mitropolsky averaging method, which reveals an intrinsic resistive droop characteristic; these closed-form relations both explain the observed dynamics and yield simple, decentralized tuning rules. The methodology is validated on a controller-hardware-in-the-loop platform and exercised in real time across balanced, unbalanced, and nonlinear loads, as well as during parallel operation. Across these scenarios, the inverter maintains balanced three-phase voltages, limits harmonic content, settles quickly with well-damped transients, and remains resilient when multiple units operate in parallel. The contributions are a self-excited-machine–inspired GFM controller with enhanced dynamic performance and robustness, a single stability rationale grounded in passivity, closed-form expressions that guide tuning, and comprehensive hardware-in-the-loop validations demonstrating effectiveness and superiority under challenging operating conditions."

While conventional diagnostic tools such as periodontal probing and radiographic imaging are effective at detecting advanced disease stages, they lack the sensitivity required for early diagnosis. oPMNs, derived from circulating white blood cells (WBCs), transmigrate through the oral epithelium and appear in saliva with diverse morphological characteristics. Although deep learning-based WBC quantification has been extensively explored using peripheral blood datasets, the unique morphology of oPMNs necessitates the development of new image datasets and retraining of models tailored to their detection. To address these challenges, we introduce DePerio-an AI-powered diagnostic pipeline that integrates a novel oPMN isolation protocol with deep neural network (DNN) architectures. We evaluate the performance of multiple DNN models to achieve accurate detection and quantification of oPMNs. Validated against standard quantification methods for oPMNs and oral inflammatory load (OIL), DePerio achieved a detection error rate of less than 5%. In a clinical study involving 111 human saliva samples, spanning individuals from healthy to severe periodontitis cases, and successfully classified five distinct OIL levels. This robust and low-complexity platform provides a scalable and practical solution for early PD detection and longitudinal monitoring in clinical dental practice."

    "abstract": "Single-switch resonant pulsed power converters provide advantages for applications like ozone generation, due to the inherent defects of the topology, the stress of the switch exists, the leakage inductance energy of the transformer cannot be released, and the switching loss is high. It is necessary to rely on the snubber to achieve highly reliable operation. There are significant power losses in traditional diode-resistor (DR) snubbers, especially at high loads. This paper proposes a self-driven energy recovery snubber to overcome this limitation. The solution replaces the lossy resistor with a flyback circuit comprising a clamping capacitor, inductor, switch, and diode. A hysteresis controller, powered by and directly responding to the snubber capacitor voltage, autonomously regulates the snubber’s switch. This self-driven approach eliminates external control, synchronization, or auxiliary supplies. Key features include: (1) Recycling of dissipated snubber energy back to the input source; (2) Down-frequency operation in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), minimizing switching losses, and (3) Inherent simplicity and reliability from decoupled operation. The paper details the working principle across operational stages and provides practical design guidelines. Compared with the DR snubber, the experimental verification of the prototype shows that the power loss recovery and efficiency improvement are effective. The core concept offers a viable approach for enhancing efficiency in resonant pulsed-power converters and is readily adaptable for replacing the widely used RC/RCD snubbers."

This paper proposes an improved monocular depth estimation approach that integrates deep learning techniques with feedback from vehicle suspension states. Under the DispNet architecture, we replace traditional neural networks with the Standard Nonlinear Operator Form (SNOF) and incorporate vehicle suspension information to build a delayed state observer for real-time depth estimation error compensation. State compensation is achieved through solving Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI), ensuring error convergence during extended operation. Extensive real-world experiments using signal-collecting vehicles demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits excellent generalization capabilities across diverse environments and lighting conditions."

To address this, we propose a framework that combines Time-series Generative Adversarial Networks (TimeGAN) for artificial sequence generation with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) predictors. From 36 measured voltage sequences, TimeGAN generated 90 artificial sequences to expand the dataset and mitigate overfitting. Augmenting the LSTM improved quench prediction accuracy to ∼3% mean relative error. This study demonstrates the first application of TimeGAN to superconducting quench signals and highlights the benefit of ML-driven augmentation for improving quench prediction robustness."
