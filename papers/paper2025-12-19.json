    "abstract": "Estimating the initial rotor position is critical for the proper startup, efficient torque production, and reliable operation of permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs), as well as for preventing demagnetization. This article presents a comprehensive method for detecting the rotor position under standstill and flying shaft (i.e., no stator excitation) conditions in a surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motor (SM-PMSM). Initial rotor position detection in SM-PMSMs is challenging due to weak magnetic saliency, nonlinearities, and parameter variations. Even small inaccuracies can significantly affect motor efficiency, performance, and longevity, particularly in applications involving varying speeds or loads. In this work, a series of voltage pulses using basis space vectors are applied to the stator windings of a three-phase SM-PMSM. The positive and negative current values are evaluated, alongside the recorded differences between their absolute peak values. These differences, influenced by the permanent magnets, are leveraged to detect the rotor position without direct access to the rotor. A numerical model of a four-pole SM-PMSM is developed using Maxwell 2-D to validate the magnetic circuit changes. The proposed method's performance in early detection of demagnetization is also introduced and validated numerically and experimentally. Finally, the method's efficacy is experimentally assessed under standstill and flying shaft conditions, along with its impact on synchronous startup in sensorless control of SM-PMSMs and its effectiveness in early demagnetization detection."

    "abstract": "Huygens metasurfaces (HMS) formed by Huygens sources can flexibly control electromagnetic waves to generate any desired radiation pattern. This capability is precisely what holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) communications seek to achieve. Therefore, deploying HMS at the base station provides an attractive solution for next-generation wireless communication systems. Against this background, this study establishes an electromagnetic channel model to analyze the effective degree of freedom (EDoF) of HMS systems, in which EDoF directly characterizes the spatial multiplexing capability of HMS systems. This aspect has not been addressed in previous research. Specifically, we first model the channel of HMS using the electric and magnetic dyadic Green’s functions in electromagnetic theory. Since the channel is unique to HMS, it is specially called the Huygens channel. Then, we analyze the EDoF of the Huygens channel. Finally, by comparing with existing EDoFe studies based on the electric dyadic Green’s Function (EDGF) channel, the results demonstrate that the Huygens channel exhibits a larger EDoF in the near-field region. This provides important insights for the design and optimization of future communication systems, such as the HMIMO communications system."

    "abstract": "Quantum memories, which play a critical role in various aspects of quantum networks—such as timing synchronization, fidelity preservation, network performance continuity, and efficient resource management—are not well-suited for practical deployment due to their high cost and complex implementation requirements. For this reason, in our study, we propose a low-cost and easy-to-implement alternative method called soft memory, which does not require any physical quantum memory hardware and is based on a delay-aware routing strategy. Under varying threshold and request time window values, we evaluate two key performance metrics—mean time difference and request success rate—across three types of quantum networks: (i) memoryless quantum networks, (ii) quantum networks equipped with fixed qubit storage time, and (iii) the proposed soft memory architecture. Despite requiring no additional physical hardware, the soft memory approach achieves a request success rate nearly equivalent to that of a quantum memory with 0.15-second storage time, while providing a lower mean time difference."

    "abstract": "The identification of new biomarkers for various disease-related microRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) is an issue of critical biological significance. Computational identification for miRNA/lncRNA-disease associations is of great practical significance, which can substantially save the cost of traditional experimental detection. With the continuous development of sequencing technology, different multi-omics data have exploded. The existing computational methods identify disease-related miRNAs and lncRNAs by inputting all data resources. However, with the explosive growth of data, it is hard to treat new data as supplementary input to continue training former models trained by static data, which is a limitation in biology, medicine, and other fields.

Firstly, ILSMDL applies masking contrastive learning (MCL) strategy to enhance the generalization capability of itself. Secondly, this framework leverages graph transformer (GT) to encode node positional information for similarity networks (homogeneous graphs), and channel attention (CA) mechanism to improve representation by explicitly assigning adaptive weights to different masked and unmasked similarities. Thirdly, ILSMDL performs a deep matrix factorization (DMF) based on the reconstruction to reduce the false negatives and identify the latent miRNAs and lncRNAs associated with diseases. Finally, the incremental multi-view training pattern is devised to face this challenge. We consider these different similarity networks can be incrementally trained by our framework. In comparative experiments, ILSMDL demonstrates impressive capability across two datasets. Moreover, case studies further validate ILSMDL predictive reliability, underscoring its effectiveness in discovering new associations."

    "abstract": "Coastal aquaculture ponds, vital to marine aquaculture, are widely distributed along coastlines and hold significant economic and ecological value. Accurately mapping their distribution and types is essential for optimizing marine spatial resources and protecting coastal ecosystems. While deep learning has improved detection from remote sensing imagery, precise recognition still faces challenges such as large scale and shape variations, blurred boundaries in dense areas, and a lack of high-resolution fine-grained datasets. To this end, a Scale and Boundary Dynamic Awareness Network (BDA-Net) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, A Taylor-optimized Scale-adaptive Feature Interaction (TSFI) structure is designed to achieve efficient multi-scale feature adaptation for diverse pond sizes and shapes, overcoming fixed-scale Transformer limitations while preserving accuracy with lower computation via Taylor approximation. Moreover, a Frequency-guided Adaptive Boundary Convolution (FABC) is developed to resolve boundary confusion and detail loss by adaptively fusing multi-directional frequency features, enhancing contour-aligned sampling for improved fine-grained discrimination and recognition performance. Additionally, a high-resolution fine-grained dataset is constructed to fill the gap in low spatial resolution and coarse category subdivision of existing aquaculture pond datasets. Extensive experiments on this dataset and public benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed BDA-Net achieves an mIoU of 85.71%, outperforming the existing methods by over 5.45%."

    "abstract": "Cognitive abilities in robotic manipulation are crucial for advancing robotic intelligence. In complex environments with diverse objects, a robot must understand task affordances between objects to enhance its cognitive manipulation abilities. Task affordances represent potential manipulation relationships between objects. Leveraging the representation and reasoning power of knowledge graphs, we model task affordances in the form of <subject, relation, object =, where subjects and objects are nodes, and relations are edges. The paper proposes an attention-based object-task affordance graph generation network for robotic manipulation cognition. The proposed network effectively extracts subject, relation, and object features and combines them through multi-scale channel attention mechanisms to identify task relations and generate object-task affordance graphs. To train the network, we construct a novel objecttask affordance dataset that includes labeled task affordances across various scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the accuracy of object-task affordance graphs and endnotes the robot with manipulation cognitive capabilities during task execution."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a compact broadband circularly polarized (CP) filtering patch antenna with multi-element coupling structure. The antenna consists of two substrate layers. The upper substrate layer incorporates a main radiating patch with an etched rectangular slot, a pair of unequal-sized L-shaped parasitic stubs placed along the +45∘ diagonal of the main patch, and surrounding microstrip patches. The lower substrate features a ground plane etched with an asymmetric U-shaped slot on its top surface and a microstrip feedline on the bottom. The signal enters the port, propagates along the microstrip feedline, and couples to the main radiating patch through the asymmetric U-shaped slot, generating CP radiation. Further coupling between the main patch and the surrounding microstrip patches produces two additional CP modes, enabling wideband CP operation. Without the need for additional filtering circuits, the antenna achieves bandpass filtering characteristics by introducing two controllable radiation nulls near 2.0 GHz and its second harmonic at 4.0 GHz through the unequal L-shaped parasitic stubs. A third radiation null near 3.6 GHz is generated by the rectangular slot etched on the main patch. The proposed design maintains a compact profile (0.54λ0 × 0.54λ0 × 0.07λ0, where λ0 corresponds to the lowest operating frequency) while realizing integrated wideband CP and filtering performance. The measured results demonstrate an impedance bandwidth of 23.1% (2.64–3.33 GHz), an axial ratio (AR) bandwidth of 11% (2.8–3.125 GHz) and a stable in-band gain of approximately 7 dB. The out-of-band suppression levels reach 17 dB and 24 dB in the lower and upper stopbands, respectively, confirming good CP filtering performance."

    "abstract": "Decoding fine motor movements, such as finger trajectories, from brain signals poses a critical challenge for brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, particularly when employing electrocorticography (ECoG) because of its inherent signal complexity and inter-subject variability. Although traditional machine learning and deep learning methods have advanced coarse motor control, they often fall short in capturing and generalizing. To address these limitations, we propose DeepFingerNet– a novel architecture based on nested U-Nets designed specifically for ECoG-based finger trajectory prediction. DeepFingerNet enhances feature extraction and fusion by leveraging nested skip connections, which effectively integrate low-level spatial details with high-level abstract representations. We employ a hybrid loss function, combining cosine similarity and mean squared error, to optimize the direction and magnitude of the decoded trajectories. Evaluations on two publicly available ECoG datasets demonstrate the model’s effectiveness, achieving correlation coefficients of 0.69 (a 17% improvement over baseline methods) on BCI Competition IV Dataset 4 and 0.54 (a 5% improvement) on the Stanford University dataset, respectively. These results underscore DeepFingerNet’s potential to significantly improve the reliability and precision of fine finger predictions from ECoG measurements, thereby supporting advanced applications in neuroprosthetics and human-machine interaction."

    "abstract": "This study focuses on the application of the Manifold Deformation Design Scheme (MDDS) as an advanced control strategy for a custom-built robotic arm, aiming to achieve precise, stable, and efficient motion control under complex and dynamic working conditions. MDDS offers a novel approach to nonlinear system control by deforming the system’s dynamic manifold to conform to desired performance objectives. Through this transformation, it effectively simplifies controller design, reduces the dependence on gain scheduling, and enhances the system’s ability to cope with model uncertainties and external disturbances. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of MDDS, simulation experiments are conducted along three representative trajectories: linear, circular, and workpiece paths. The results demonstrate that the MDDS-based control system achieves significantly smaller position errors, faster convergence speeds, and superior stability compared with the traditional Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) control method. To validate the simulation findings, experimental tests are performed on a physical prototype of the robotic arm following the same trajectory profiles. The experimental outcomes closely match the simulation results, confirming that MDDS maintains lower error levels across all motion axes and ensures smoother and more precise motion responses. Overall, both simulation and experimental analyses verify that MDDS provides a robust, accurate, and efficient control solution for robotic arms, offering substantial improvements in motion precision, adaptability, and system stability over conventional control techniques."

Emotion analysis process is accurate in identifying expression in normal people in a single attempt. Emotion analysis is difficult in case of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) children which are suffering with communication problems and speech problems. This paper proposed an optimized deep learning model with multi label classification for predicting ASD and NoASD with emotion analysis in children of age group 1 to 10 years. The kaggle dataset [1] of 1857 ASD children and 1850 Typically Developed (TD) children are used in this paper. Proposed model performance is tested on Yale Expression Dataset [2], CAFÉ children dataset [3] and also tested on social media dataset of autism parents group. The model is implemented by extracting face landmarks and is used to predict ASD and NoASD as first classification label and emotion is detected based on landmarks by computing internal and external distances by feature wise. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is used to work with extracted face landmarks by using optimization methods, dropout, batch normalization and parameter updating. The proposed model is applied to predict 6 emotions irrespective of 4 general emotions with better accuracy."

In comparison to conventional robotic arms with multiple actuators, Bennett’s mechanism uses a closed kinematic structure and a single actuator to realize complicated spatial trajectories. Through both simulation and experimental comparison with a commercial UR3e collaborative robot, the mechatronic prototype of the Bennett mechanism demonstrated a reduction in energy consumption of up to 92% for identical tasks. The results confirm that closed loop mechanisms can be an energy-efficient option for tasks with simple, repetitive motion. While the Bennett mechanism is limited to predefined trajectories, its simplicity, low energy footprint, and suitability for repetitive tasks make it a promising alternative for dedicated automation scenarios. This study underscores the value of low-redundancy kinematic designs in future industrial robotics."

With the Kvasir-SEG dataset, the model achieves a Dice accuracy of 91.42%, an IoU of 84.88%, and an inference speed of 22 FPS, surpassing current benchmarks such as U-Net, ResUNet++, and PraNet. The network incorporates EfficientN etBO as a lightweight encoder and self-attention blocks for global context modeling, which facilitates both precise boundary definition and real-time deployment through ONNX optimization. Experimental outcomes validate that PolypTransNet presents a practical and reliable solution for AI-assisted colonoscopy, with excellent potential for clinical use in the early detection of colorectal cancer."

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly generative AI, it raises serious concerns regarding misuse. One of the most prominent issues is the increasing difficulty in distinguishing between real and AI-generated images, which can lead to misinformation, and loss of trust in digital content. As a result, there is a growing need for reliable detection methods capable of identifying synthetic content. In this study, we introduce a robust and generalizable model designed to accurately differentiate between real and generated images. Our approach utilizes a hybrid architecture that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for local feature extraction with Vision Transformers (ViTs) to performing classification. The model trained on Pro-Gan only, to perform binary classification between authentic and synthetic images. It achieved a high training accuracy of 99%. To evaluate its generalization capability, the model was tested on images from unseen generators Cycle-Gan and Style-Gan achieving accuracies of 89% and 81%, respectively. These results confirm the model’s strong performance ."

Traditional sentiment classification models struggle to effectively capture global semantics, and sentiment polarity may be reversed due to negation words, modifiers, or contextual cues. To comprehensively analyze global semantics and local features, this paper proposes a Chinese text sentiment classification model that integrates BERTand BiLSTM, adopting focal loss to dynamically adjust the weights of classification samples. The BERT pre-trained model is employed to obtain context-aware word embeddings, BiLSTM is utilized to capture long-range dependencies in text sequences, and the use of dynamically adjusted classification sample weights helps modulate the influence of salient emotional words on text classification. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model effectively captures long-distance dependencies in text sequences, emphasizes local key sentiment features, enhances contextual comprehension, and significantly improves the accuracy of text sentiment classification."

First, the raw EEG signals are segmented and subjected to dimensionality reduction using a one-dimensional CNN. Subsequently, Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is used to generate two-dimensional scalograms, realizing the joint representation of temporal and spatial features. Then, two-dimensional CNN, BiGRU and SAM are jointly trained on the scalograms to capture discriminative features from spatial, local, temporal and global levels. Finally, the fused features are used for multi-emotion state classification of EEG signals.

    "abstract": "Timely and precise identification of plant diseases plays a crucial role in minimizing agricultural losses and improving crop yield. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown effectiveness in automating the detection of plant infections, they often fail to interpret the overall image context because of their limited receptive scope. This shortcoming affects their ability to handle tasks that require detailed visual understanding. To address this, the present work introduces ChilliLeaf-ViT, a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based deep learning framework designed for accurate diagnosis of diseases in chilli plant leaves. The method makes use of a ViT model that was trained on ImageNet and is adjusted using a proprietary dataset that comprises six illness classes: White Spot, Curl Virus, Bacterial Spot, Cercospora Leaf Spot, Healthy, and Nutrition Deficiency. Unlike CNNs, the ViT architecture tokenizes images into fixed patches and employs a self-attention mechanism to learn relationships between them, enabling a more effective detection of subtle visual cues. During training, data augmentation and transfer learning approaches were used to enhance generalization. The proposed model attains an accuracy of 99.38%, outperforming standard CNN-based approaches in classifying leaf diseases. In addition, a Flask-powered web application has been developed to enable real-time disease prediction through image uploads, ensuring practical usability for field deployment. Overall, this research presents a reliable and efficient framework for automated detection of plant leaf diseases and highlights the effectiveness of transformer-driven architectures in advancing precision agriculture."

Nevertheless, a considerable amount of this data is still considered as dark data which is the term used for data that is either unstored unwritable, left unused or not available for data mining and the same is not subject to clinical insights or analysis hence it takes up valuable storage area. In this work, we propose a comprehensive strategy that merges machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) methodologies in order to recover and interpret the dark data generated from synthetic generated EHRs of blood cancer patients. The ensemble classifiers were used to model the structured data consisting of patient demographics and treatment parameters for prediction of treatment outcomes, and at the same time, unstructured physicians' notes were passed through ScispaCy biomedical model en_ner_bc5cdr_md, to detect medical entities and describe their relationships in context. The resulting insights were encapsulated in a single JSON framework that interlinked structured and unstructured data. The experimental results demonstrated that the Bagging Classifier reached the highest accuracy (0.82) surpassing other models like XGBoost (0.72) and Stacking Classifier (0.70). The proposed approach demonstrates a method for dark data extraction and highlights the potential of multimodal data fusion to enhance precision oncology research."

The proposed method simplifies the torque model of DCVC while maintaining the vector-control framework of conventional continuous current vector control (CCVC), thereby reducing implementation complexity. Theoretical analysis shows that the root-mean-square (RMS) phase current is reduced by $11.4 \\%$ compared to CCVC, resulting in a $21.4 \\%$ reduction in copper and converter conduction losses. The operating range analysis clarifies that the proposed method is effective in the low-output range, where linear PWM operation is maintained. In contrast, CCVC performs better in the high-output range with higher voltage utilization. Experimental verification confirms that the proposed method achieves a smooth transition between the two control modes without torque fluctuation and improves system efficiency across all operating ranges, achieving a maximum improvement of 7.32 percentage points compared with CCVC. Although a slight increase in torque ripple and acoustic noise is observed due to the trade-off between the torque-per-ampere ratio and torque ripple inherent in DCVC, the proposed $i_{\\mathrm{d}}=i_{0}=0 \\mathbf{A}$ control is experimentally demonstrated to be a highly efficient and easily implementable control strategy suitable for low-output SRM operation."

We describe a real-time, interactive system that retrieves past and current price data, trains HMMs to learn underlying market states, and infers transition matrices for predicting short-run behavior and calculating long-run steadystate probabilities. These steady states shed light on the long-run tendencies of financial assets, enabling strategic decision-making. Steady-state analysis is combined with portfolio optimization within the system, which dynamically optimizes asset weights to achieve maximum risk-adjusted return. Through the union of theoretical soundness and effective application, this book brings into focus how steady-state Markov analysis can be utilized effectively in real-time finance forecasting and investment planning."

The system integrates a lightweight YOLOv5-Ghost detector with an RGB-D camera to achieve accurate 3D position estimation of neighboring UAVs without external infrastructure. Extensive indoor experiments with two UAV types demonstrate that the system provides reliable localization and real-time performance in close-range scenarios. The method enables practical swarm collision avoidance and formation control. However, when targets are farther from the camera, distance estimation becomes less reliable and missed detections are more likely. This limitation, along with challenges from adverse lighting and occlusion, constrains the effective operating range of the system. The approach supports robust multi-UAV operations under denied environments, and future work will address autonomous navigation, large-scale field deployment, and adaptation to more diverse scenarios."

Forecasting accuracy is evaluated by comparing predicted outputs to actual observations, focusing on solar irradiance. Results show that LSTM models trained with mid-range sequences (11 years) achieved the highest accuracy, with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 1.9669%. These findings challenge the assumption that longer or shorter datasets automatically yield superior forecasts, highlighting the importance of context-driven data selection.

    "abstract": "To address bottlenecks such as insufficient I/O throughput, high access latency, and inefficient data scheduling in computer storage systems during large-scale deep learning data processing, this paper proposes a collaborative processing method integrating storage system optimization and intelligent computing. First, we design a hardware optimization scheme based on a hierarchical storage architecture, reducing storage access latency through dynamic ratio allocation between NVMe SSDs and HDDs. Second, we introduce an intelligent computing model combining reinforcement learning (Q-Learning) and gradient boosting decision trees (XGBoost) to achieve adaptive decision-making for data cache replacement and prefetching scheduling. To clarify the sources of performance improvements, experiments were conducted with three comparison objects: a traditional pure hard disk (HDD) + least recently used (LRU) cache benchmark system, a static hierarchical storage system without intelligent scheduling (Scheme A), and the proposed method (Scheme B). Validation was performed on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and CIFAR-100 using deep learning models including ResNet-50 and BERT. Experimental results show that:Compared with the traditional pure HDD+LRU benchmark system, Scheme B improves I/O throughput by 47.2%-61.5%, reduces data access latency by 38.9%-52.3%, and shortens deep learning model training time by 29.4%-36.7%. Compared with Scheme A without intelligent scheduling, Scheme B further improves I/O throughput by 36.4%-38.8% (e.g., from 324.5 MB/s to 442.6 MB/s on the ImageNet dataset), reduces data access latency by 40.6%-46.9% (from 3.2 ms to 1.9 ms), shortens training time by 25.5%-28.8% (from 178.4 minutes to 132.8 minutes), and increases cache hit rate from 71.5% to 89.2%.These results demonstrate that the proposed method not only improves basic storage performance through the hierarchical hardware architecture but also breaks through performance bottlenecks relying on intelligent components consisting of Q-Learning cache optimization and XGBoost prefetching scheduling, providing efficient storage support for large-scale deep learning data processing."

The primary objective is to overcome the limitations of traditional barcode scanners, which frequently encounter issues in challenging conditions such as glare, inadequate lighting, and misaligned orientations. The suggested system employs a multi-step image processing workflow to improve the visibility of barcodes. It starts with converting to greyscale and assessing the histogram, and then moves on to adaptive thresholding and dynamic re-binarization. Once a barcode is successfully identified, the system breaks it down into its components and decodes them using recognized symbology standards such as Code128. For extracting text, EasyOCR is used, ensuring precise recognition of printed date information and serial numbers. The system achieved a text detection accuracy ranging from 92% to 94% and recognized expiration and manufacturing dates with an accuracy of 85% to 90% when evaluated on 6,000 real-world product images. The recognition accuracy for both barcodes and expiration dates significantly improved due to the utilization of a large dataset. Using image enhancement methods, issues like glare and motion blur associated with the surroundings were reduced. The results demonstrate that the system operates consistently in different retail environments and provides a cost-effective, portable solution compared to traditional scanning techniques. This study establishes a basis for scalable implementation in retail spaces that interact with customers and manage inventory."

Ensuring confidentiality in such environments is crucial to maintaining trust and meeting ethical and legal standards. Existing methods often face challenges in controlling data access granularly, leading to potential breaches and unauthorized exposure of sensitive patient information. These issues arise from limited access control measures and ineffective management of user roles within complex health information systems. To address these concerns, this study proposes the implementation of a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) framework. RBAC categorizes users based on roles and assigns specific permissions, enabling precise control over who can access different types of patient records. The proposed method ensures that healthcare professionals access only the information necessary for their role, thereby preserving confidentiality and enhancing security. Findings reveal that RBAC significantly reduces unauthorized data access and ensures better compliance with privacy regulations such as HIPAA. By dynamically managing user roles and privileges, this framework enhances patient record protection while facilitating efficient data sharing within intelligent health information systems."

This paper introduces a comprehensive framework that combines post-quantum-style signature emulation with behav-ioral fingerprinting to detect fake or spoofed IoT devices. We simulate a network of ten devices where one adversarial node continually broadcasts repetitive, low-entropy sensor readings. By extracting behavioral metrics such as the proportion of repeated messages, the randomness of message content, and the variability in message timing, and applying an unsupervised anomaly detection model (Isolation Forest), we achieve perfect detection of the spoofed device and maintain a low rate of false positives. To strengthen auditability, we integrate a blockchain-inspired, hash-linked logging mechanism that records each verified interaction. Our results demonstrate that layering behavioral analysis onto cryptographic verification significantly enhances device-level trust in IoT networks."

Decoupling services as asynchronous passing of messages leads to reduced latency, better throughput, and greater fault tolerance due to Event-Driven Architecture (EDA). Asynchronous communication flow best practices of scalable microsystem systems utilizing EDA models are presented here. It examines to what extent event sourcing, message queues, and broker-based systems can mitigate bottlenecks of synchronous inter-service communication. The study adopts a mixed-method research design that includes architectural simulation and performance benchmarking through throughput, latency, and resource usage. Through the strict experimentation and assessment, findings show the improved scalability of event-based systems when subjected to varied workloads. Findings confirm that EDA-based coordination does have a measurable impact on performance via decoupling coupling and real-time response. The experiment also recognizes issues in EDA deployment, including event schema design and data consistency. The solution plan aims at service boundary modularization, resilience, and efficiency at operation levels. The article concludes by implementing scaled microservices deployment best practices through architecting asynchronous workflows.

This paper presents a blockchain-based framework for collaborative manufacturing that integrates machine management, task assignment, fault detection, and reward distribution. Using Ethereum smart contracts, the framework guarantees transparency, security, and traceability of machine activities and tasks. The system comprises three key layers: the Data Synchronization Layer, the Fault Management Layer, and the Security and Compliance Layer, which together facilitate seamless operation and data flow a cross the manufacturing ecosystem. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework through comprehensive metrics, including gas consumption, transaction execution time, and transaction costs. The results show the framework's efficiency i n terms of transaction execution, with minimal gas consumption per operation. However, for large-scale deployments, optimization techniques such as off-chain data storage and layer-2 solutions are recommended to mitigate gas costs and improve scalability.

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is talked about in a market impact sensitive way in the context of optimal trade execution in a high-frequency setting, in this context the market impact model is directly part of the action. The proposed solution leverages a DRL agent customized with deep neural networks to estimate the intricate trends in market data of high dimensionality, (e.g. order book status, trading volumes, and price dynamics). The agent is given an incentive to maximise the cumulative returns when they are subjected to execution costs and when they are subjected to the adverse effects on the market and, there are policies that adjust the type of order and the quantity of orders depending on the market dynamics are learnt. The types simulated in the reward function of the agent are transient and permanent market impact. The adaptability and robustness of the agent is extensively tested with simulated and historical limit order book information. It has also been demonstrated that the DRL agent has a superior balance of profitability and slippage reduction in some regimes of channeled markets compared to the traditional rule-based agents and optimization agents. We are optimistic that these DRL frameworks augmented with realistic market impact models can make new steps and come up with new designs that form a new paradigm of efficient and cost sensitive trade execution in high-frequency modern day trading systems."

However, prolonged propagation delay and constrained fronthaul capacity may result in the centralized decision problem. In this paper, a SE-oriented distributed user association with bilateral matching (SEO-DUABM) scheme is proposed to enable real-time association decisions and improve SE performance. Firstly, a satellite-UAV network model with CF architecture is established with the low earth orbit satellite, UAVs, and ground users. Then, the average SE is derived by introducing a two-phase signal combining method, and an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the average SE by designing the user association matrix. Following that, a distributed user association with bilateral matching is given to achieve stable association and enhance SE. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can maintain superiority under varying UAV antenna configurations."

    "abstract": "Raccoon is an additional digital signature scheme currently under evaluation in the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standardization process. Its security relies on standard lattice assumptions and is specifically designed for application scenarios resistant to side-channel attacks. In Raccoon, the modulus q of the Number Theory Transform (NTT) is a 49-bit non-prime number, rendering existing hardware designs relying on prime modulus reduction algorithms ineffective. This paper presents the first hardware design of a non-prime modular multiplication leveraging the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), decomposes the non-prime modulus q=q<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</inf>×q<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>. It includes three sub-modules: a parallel modular multiplication module to maximize the parallelism of DSPs, a prime modular reduction module that integrates the K-RED algorithm and congruence relation properties for the prime moduli q<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</inf> and q<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>, and a restoration module that utilizes the improved Barrett algorithm to obtain the correct result for the non-prime modulus q. Moreover, the hardware implementation of the pipelined NTT concluding the proposed modular multiplication is presented to verify functional correctness and enable benchmarking against state-of-the-art solutions. Evaluated on the Xilinx Artix-7 platform, the proposed NTT architecture utilizes 35678 LUTs, 15946 FFs, 48 DSPs, and 1.5 BRAMs, achieving an operating frequency of 98 MHz with a total latency of 6.59 μs.

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for environmentally sus-tainable agriculture and efficient crop management systems has positioned hydroponics as a vital alternative to traditional farming. Its ability to conserve water and utilize limited space makes it especially suitable for urban and resource-constrained regions. However, most existing hydroponic systems still lack intelligent automation and real-time disease diagnosis, resulting in operational inefficiencies and unpredictable crop health out-comes. The proposed system leverages an ESP32 microcontroller to monitor and control key environmental metrics—such as ambient temperature, humidity, water temperature, nutrient concentration (TDS), moisture level, and water availability. Based on preset threshold conditions, the system autonomously triggers actuators like inlet/exhaust fans and nutrient pumps to maintain optimal plant growth conditions. In parallel, an AI-based plant disease detection module was implemented using a lightweight VGG-16 convolutional neural network, fine-tuned on a large dataset of plant leaf images. The model analyzes images captured from the hydroponic setup and classifies them into healthy or diseased categories, enabling early intervention. The system was tested using Arduino IDE for embedded firmware, TensorFlow and OpenCV for AI model training and deployment, and Blynk for real-time IoT -based visualization. The VGG-16 model achieved a classification accuracy of 95.16%. The results validated the system's ability to autonomously manage environmental conditions and detect diseases in real- time, demonstrating its potential for deployment in smart, resource-efficient, and scalable agricultural environments."

While conventional Proportional- Integral- Derivative (PID) controllers remain the industry standard for TV C due to their simplicity and reliability, they struggle to adapt under nonlinear and time- varying flight conditions common in solid-propelled vehicles. This paper presents an interdisciplinary approach that integrates classical PID control with reinforcement learning (RL) for adaptive thrust vectoring in model rocketry. A dual-axis gimballed TV C system was designed and fabricated using plastic gear servos and an ESP32 microcontroller, with real-time orientation feedback from an onboard MPU-6050 IMU. A closed-loop PID algorithm demonstrated stable pitch and yaw stabilization under static thrust tests. In parallel, a custom Gym-based simulation environment trained a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent to benchmark intelligent control strategies under realistic nonlinear dynamics. Comparative results indicate that the RL controller achieved faster settling times and superior disturbance rejection compared to the baseline PID system. These findings highlight the feasibility of hybrid intelligent control architectures for small-scale rockets and serve as a practical foundation for future work involving embedded RL deployment, hybrid fallback strategies, and fully autonomous SRAD rocket systems."

To address this, we propose a novel three-layer framework for Digital Twin-based Predictive Maintenance (PdMDT). The architecture integrates real-time data collection, a hybrid (data-driven and physics-based) digital twin for simulation, and an intelligent decision-making layer. It is built on novel learning methods such as CNN-LSTM and RF-LSTM in its decision-making layer. We validated the framework on an industrial water pump with 51 sensors, predicting faults with a 10-minute lead time. We developed two models: a CNN-LSTM with an attention mechanism (98.29% F1 score) that identifies key sensor contributions, and a lightweight RF-LSTM (98.91% F1 score) suitable for edge devices. The proposed PdMDT framework provides a scalable and interpretable solution applicable to real-world industrial environments. By enabling precise fault prediction and root cause analysis, it significantly reduces downtime and maintenance costs, advancing the implementation of smart manufacturing. While validated on a real industrial dataset, future work will extend the framework to live plant deployments to assess scalability and robustness in production environments."

Since agricultural operations often span multiple areas, reliable rainfall forecasting that captures both spatial and temporal patterns is needed to ensure effective planning and risk prevention. This research involved three close weather stations throughout the Bandung area: Bandung Geophysics Station, Citeko Meteorology Station, and West Java Climatology Station. The 2D Convolutional Neural Networks and Temporal Neural Network methods were proposed to extract spatial-temporal features from climate data from the said multi-stations. The results show that when handling multi-area data, the proposed model achieved an accuracy improvement of approximately 11.24% to 93.88% compared to single-station data. Furthermore, it outperformed the feature selection method based on GMM-ARI, with an increase in accuracy of up to 11.47%, indicating a reduced necessity for feature selection. Compared to previous studies, the model achieved a 6.92% accuracy improvement over the 2D CNN-LSTM and a 17.05% overall improvement compared to the 1D CNN architecture. The findings also demonstrate that using TCN with dilated convolutions effectively overcomes the long dependency limitations found in RNN-based models and 2D CNN models, which capture spatial dependencies and regional interactions between adjacent weather stations, leading to improved forecasting accuracy."

Leveraging a publicly accessible dataset (DOI: 10.21227/pfzr-g090), eight distinct activities are classified through a ResNet50 transfer-learning model. Training and validation are carried out on preprocessed time-frequency images in a Kaggle environment equipped with an NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU, yielding a test accuracy of 94.5%. The trained network is then ported to a Raspberry Pi 3B+ to assess its performance under embedded conditions. Although only offline radar samples are used, the edge device achieves inference times below 10 ms per frame with CPU utilization under 20%, demonstrating its feasibility for low-power deployments. In relation to performance ranges summarized in recent survey articles [2], [10], the achieved 94.5% accuracy places the proposed system among the higher-performing embedded-oriented radar HAR solutions, albeit slightly below the 98% reported for the current state-of-the-art few-shot ProtoNet. Additional comparisons with a shallow CNN baseline and the compact tinyRadar LSTM model show that the ResNet50-based approach provides the most favorable balance of recognition accuracy and computational efficiency.

    "abstract": "Diamonds are a form of crystallized carbon and are one of the most coveted gemstones in the world with their prices varying depending on various factors such as weight and carat, cut, color, clarity and size. It is not an easy job to predict diamond prices precisely with the interaction of these attributes. ML is applied in this research to develop a model for prediction of diamond prices using Support Vector Regression, Linear Regression, XGBoost and Random Forest algorithms. Through carrying out extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature transformation, and principal component analysis (PCA), the data were preprocessed for training. Each model's accuracy was measured against primary parameters of Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> score and Mean Squared Error (MSE). Experimental results shows the fact that XGBoost model was the most precise in prediction with greater performance compared to other models with the lowest error rates and highest <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{R}^{2}$</tex> score. The accuracy of the model developed was also high with minimum error as the model gave an <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{R}^{2}$</tex> of 0.9897 and a MAE of 0.0328 and MSE of 0.0020. This study is very applicable to the diamond industry since it presents a reality-based method of price estimation that allows stakeholders to make logical decisions."

Mauritania, with its exceptional solar and wind resources, offers some of the most competitive conditions globally for hydrogen production. Instead of focusing on hydrogen exports, this study explores the technical feasibility and economic viability of establishing a renewable-powered steel plant in Mauritania, utilizing the country’s abundant iron ore reserves. The findings suggest that sustainably produced steel in Mauritania could be cost-competitive with current European prices. With ongoing declines in investment costs for emerging renewable technologies, Mauritania has the potential to become one of the world’s most cost-effective steel producers."

Vehicle pricing depends on several parameters including details like the brand, model, year of manufacture, mileage, and mainly the overall condition. This study presents a data-driven approach that employs a gradient boosting regression model-Cat Boost Regressor-to estimate the prices of used cars. The dataset, sourced from publicly available Indian automotive listings, was preprocessed to handle categorical and numerical attributes efficiently. Cat Boost was selected because of it's capability to natively process categorical variables and capture complex non-linear interactions without extensive feature encoding. The proposed system includes exploratory data analysis and also structured feature engineering to produce interpretable results. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the model achieves consistent predictive performance across diverse brands and segments, offering an effective framework for intelligent price estimation at the car market."

    "abstract": "cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the biggest killers globally, and it is crucial to predict CVD risk at the initial stage to reduce the mortality rate and morbidity of the disease. Thus, this research develops a deep learning approach based on the transformer architecture to predict CVD risk by analyzing EHRs. It is worth noting that conventional models are somewhat challenged with increased amounts and chronological characteristics inherent in-patient data. To cope with this challenge, we utilize transformer models that can model dependencies in the data for EHR and capture complex patterns. Further, the proposed approach converts structured and unstructured data, such as patient demographics, laboratory tests, prescriptions, and notes from electronic health records, into a risk assessment model. The transformer network successfully captures numerous dependencies of the features encountered in the medical field and trends in the medical history compared to traditional models like logistic regression or recurrent neural networks. Based on experimental results, the proposed framework exhibits better predictive performance, reliability, and interpretability to be a useful scientific tool for usage in clinical decision-making. By using deep learning with EHR analytics, this framework helps in early risk prediction for disease diagnosis, which has a positive impact on disease management. It also advances accuracy, extendibility, and flexibility, which paves the way for new AI-facilitated models in the healthcare environment. The future groundwork will entail improving the efficiency of the model and confirming its effectiveness in various populations as well as real-life practice."

    "abstract": "Industrial energy systems account for Germany’s most significant share of electricity consumption and offer substantial potential for temporal load shifting. Nevertheless, investments in energy flexibility remain limited due to low transparency, high complexity, and uncertain economic benefits. Existing approaches often require detailed process knowledge and costly audits. This paper introduces a method for the automated evaluation of energy flexibility in industrial energy systems. The method applies linear optimisation to historical load data and market parameters, combining a model-based potential analysis with a systematic assignment of suitable energy flexibility measures. The approach is designed for low-threshold applicability without detailed process information. The method was applied in two real-world case applications. Results showed reductions in peak load, network charges, and day-ahead market procurement costs. While maximum technical cost reductions were achieved at higher flexibility levels, economic feasibility depended on storage sizing. The method provides a transparent, data-driven basis for linking quantified flexibility potential with practical measures, thereby supporting informed investment decisions."

Supercapacitors emerge as a cornerstone technology due to their high power density, long cycle life, and low environmental impact, making them well-suited for intermittently available ambient energy sources. We begin by reviewing energy management mechanisms in WSNs and then present the key considerations for integrating supercapacitors as the sole energy storage element in BF-WSNs.

This study analyzes the technical and economic impacts of flexibility services on system adequacy using the open-source Antares Simulator. Adequacy is assessed through Expected Energy Not Supplied (EENS) and Loss of Load Expectation (LOLE). Senegal’s 2025 grid serves as the case study. Four scenarios are simulated to evaluate the role of flexibility services, including energy storage and Demand Side Response (DSR), in mitigating supply-demand imbalances. Results show that integrating either service reduces EENS by 94% and LOLE by 93%. Flexibility also lowers total system costs and reduces marginal prices by at least 0.9% and 17%, respectively. This techno-economic analysis underscores the critical role of flexibility in enhancing adequacy, supporting RES integration, and ensuring a more reliable and stable power grid."

Our system is trained on publicly available datasets labeled with various student behaviors-such as using a phone, reading, sleeping, writing, etc.-and teacher presence. RT-DETR enables high-accuracy detection, while DeepSORT assigns consistent IDs to individuals across frames, allowing for accurate behavior reporting per student rather than per frame. The system achieves a mean average precision (mAP) above 95 % and runs at 24 FPS, with detailed evaluation metrics including precision, recall, F1-score, MOTA, and MOTP."

    "abstract": "Businesses are responsible for severe environmental damage due to the overuse of natural resources, excessive waste generation, and poor dumping of toxic substances. Small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) play a critical role in mitigating the worldwide ecological impact, which has become a growing aspect of the business plan over the past twenty years. Supply chain management (SCM) is among the industries most ready for transformation. Sustainable SCM (SSCM) incorporates ecological operations throughout the supply chain. SSCM enables organizations to minimize their ecological impact by changing their purchases, manufacturing, dispersion, usage, and material recycling practices. This research examines how digital technology can enhance urban waste management in smart cities by addressing structural issues. A comparative analysis of Enterprise A and Retailer B's demandside supply chain identifies important waste sources such as oversupply, stock mismanagement, and delays in shipping and advertising. The study employs an integrated method that includes empirical evaluation of operational statistics, cuttingedge statistical approaches, and Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. The findings demonstrate that by improving SC cooperation, streamlining transportation, and improving stock management, IoT and AI technology significantly reduced waste. By using fewer resources and producing fewer pollutants, these digital innovations also follow the guidelines of the circular economy, so aiding overall sustainable operational management and resilience targets in urban contexts. The report emphasizes the need to incorporate digital technologies into waste management plans to develop more SSCM. This investigation highlights the power of digital technology for encouraging sustainable operational management and environmental conservation in smart cities by connecting conceptual models with real-world uses."

    "abstract": "Smart education platforms are revolutionizing modern learning by leveraging artificial intelligence to deliver personalized instruction tailored to individual students. Meta- learning, as an emerging AI paradigm, enhances this personalization by enabling rapid adaptation to diverse learner needs. However, existing intelligent tutoring systems often suffer from limitations in generalization and adaptability, requiring large amounts of labeled data and struggling to personalize instruction for new or atypical learners in real-time. To address these challenges, this paper proposes MAPLE (Meta-Adaptive Personalized Learning Engine). This novel framework integrates Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) into AI tutors, enabling fast and efficient adaptation using limited learner data. MAPLE is designed to pre-train on a diverse range of student profiles and fine-tune rapidly to new learners with minimal interaction, thereby enhancing the precision of feedback and instructional relevance. MAPLE operates within innovative education platforms to deliver real-time personalized feedback, adaptive content sequencing, and learner-specific strategy recommendations. It dynamically models each student's learning style, pace, and cognitive gaps, making instruction more responsive and engaging. The experimental evaluation of MAPLE demonstrates superior performance in adaptability and personalization compared to traditional machine learning-based tutoring systems. Key outcomes include a significant increase in learning retention, faster convergence to learner proficiency, and higher student satisfaction scores. By minimizing the need for extensive retraining and maximizing instructional relevance, MAPLE provides a scalable and efficient solution for personalized education."

    "abstract": "The accurate and early prediction of online learners’ final success significantly aids administrators in providing timely assistance, thereby enhancing the retention rate for online educational platforms. However, a primary challenge lies in the fact that most learners’ behaviors remain unlabeled until the end of semester, hindering researchers from utilizing traditional supervised learning methods to forecast their final success in the initial weeks. To address these challenges, we introduce a framework called data augmentation-based semisupervised and self-training method for early success prediction (DSSP). Specifically, DSSP initially gathers labeled datasets with a limited number of instances from completed online courses and then employs a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based approach to augment an auxiliary dataset, which maintains the same mixed Gaussian distributions as the labeled set. Furthermore, we apply a self-training method to capture the latent behavior pattern from unlabeled learners’ dataset and then train a multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based semisupervised predictor via consistency loss till convergence, so that the model can predict the online learners’ final success when given their behavior at the first few weeks of the semester. The extensive experiments on the public dataset OULAD (<uri xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/opendataset</uri>) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods."

This configuration delivers high voltage gain while maintaining control simplicity through a single-switch design and minimizing electromagnetic interference via the common-ground structure. A comprehensive theoretical analysis is provided, covering voltage gain, efficiency, component stress, and open-loop stability. A 48 V/400 V, 350 W laboratory prototype was developed to validate the proposed design under dynamic load and source variations, achieving a peak efficiency of 94.4%, an input current ripple below 1%, and a transient deviation of less than 10% under 30% load and 20% source step changes. These results confirm that the proposed integrated approach offers a compact, high-performance, and application-ready solution for electric vehicle powertrains and renewable energy systems."

    "abstract": "The detection of traffic objects in aerial scenes holds significant application potential in both military and civilian sectors. However, current aerial traffic object detection techniques based on computer vision face challenges including limited awareness of object direction, a heavy computational burden on the feature extraction backbone network, and inadequate capacity to learn crucial semantic information. In this paper, our focus is on investigating the mechanisms for predicting the directional perception of traffic objects in aerial scenes, achieving backbone network lightness, and exploring methods for extracting key semantic information from objects. Firstly, to tackle the challenge of poor perception of traffic object direction and angle in aerial scenes, we utilize techniques like equivariant vector field convolution, multi-task anchor-free prediction, and adaptive loss to develop a precise mechanism for recognizing and predicting object directions. Secondly, given the presence of small-sized and numerous objects in aerial scenes, we propose the adoption of a lightweight backbone network employing channel stacking to decrease the model’s computational burden. Additionally, we establish a theoretical framework and methodology for optimizing and compressing this backbone network, aimed at enhancing feature extraction and propagation for aerial traffic objects. Furthermore, to address the issue of inadequate learning of key semantic information features, we incorporate saliency attention and multi-scale contextual information to capture the essential semantic characteristics of the objects. We also establish a method for extracting semantic features specifically for aerial traffic objects. The approach presented in this paper broadens the applicability of aerial object detection algorithms and offers novel methodologies and theoretical foundations for object detection in intricate scenarios."

It presents a refined framework for analyzing phase-resolved partial discharge (PRPD) patterns in insulation diagnostics. The study questions the traditional one-to-one link between PRPD shapes and defect types, proposing three new categories: voltage-dependent, multiple, and ambiguous patterns. This is to better represent the changing nature of discharge phenomena. By testing insulation systems rated between 4 and 18 kV, including porous tape insulation and four-layer mica tapes, the authors show how PRPD patterns develop under different voltage levels, aging conditions, and stress factors. Examples include distributed micro-void discharges that change from “rabbit-ear” to rounded shapes, symmetric in polarity and phase. The article emphasizes the limitations of relying only on pattern shape for diagnosis and recommends additional localization techniques such as antenna probes and ultrasound detectors. This work is especially valuable for those seeking to improve the reliability of insulation evaluation and develop more advanced pattern-recognition systems for rotating electrical machines."

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral image (HSI) contain a rich spectrum of bands, enabling a nuanced understanding of observed scenes. As one primary goal, HSI classification mainly involves identifying subtle material variations pixel-wise using the spectral information. This paper addresses the critical challenge of HSI classification under spatial fragmentation, a scenario where conventional methods that rely on fixed spatial arrangements often fail. In brief, we first introduce the Patch-Level Spatial Perturbation (PLSP) strategy to fragment the HSI data. Then, we propose WESA, a novel Wavelet-Enhanced Spatial-Agnostic Framework, which is designed to be inherently robust to spatial disorder by integrating two key components: Wavelet Multi-Scale Analysis (WMSA) and Frequency-Spatial Aware Knowledge Distillation (FSA-KD). WMSA enhances discriminative feature learning by decomposing inputs into multi-frequency subbands, capturing stable features that are less dependent on spatial location. FSA-KD bridges the domain gap between spatially fragmented and intact data via knowledge distillation, enabling the model to recover crucial spatial-spectral insights. Evaluated on four diverse datasets, WESA demonstrates exceptional robustness.

    "abstract": "Practical use of fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) inscribed in multimode fibers (MMFs), especially in step-index (SI-) MMFs, is limited due to their unstable reflection spectra (RS). In this work, the physical mechanisms for RS instabilities occurring in Bragg reflectors inscribed in MMFs are considered theoretically, and methods to ensure RS stabilization are proposed and evaluated. They are based on mechanical modulation of MMF and on the use of long lengths of intermediate MMFs. These stabilization methods are experimentally investigated for FBGs inscribed in standard 50/125 and 105/125 SI-MMFs. Reduction of relative standard deviation of reflection peaks' amplitudes from 30-80% down to 1-4% is demonstrated. The efficiency of stabilized interrogation of SI-MMF FBGs is further confirmed by applying a strain test. Effective RS stabilization is also demonstrated for Bragg reflectors inscribed in specialty MMFs including those of no-core polypropylene light guide, silica graded-index MMF and polymer perfluorinated CYTOP graded-index fiber."

However, relying solely on text for conditioning these models does not fully cater to the varied and complex requirements of different applications and scenarios. Acknowledging this shortfall, a variety of studies aim to control pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to support novel conditions. In this survey, we undertake a thorough review of the literature on controllable generation with T2I diffusion models, covering both the theoretical foundations and practical advancements in this domain. Our review begins with a brief introduction to the basics of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and widely used T2I diffusion models. Additionally, we provide a detailed overview of research in this area, categorizing it from the condition perspective into three directions: generation with specific conditions, generation with multiple conditions, and universal controllable generation. For each category, we analyze the underlying control mechanisms and review representative methods based on their core techniques.

    "abstract": "Rectified activation is a highly effective post-hoc method for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, designed to enhance the robustness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). It operates by truncating high neuron activations to prevent over-confident predictions on unfamiliar data. However, this approach has two key limitations: it only truncates outlier activations without optimizing the post-truncation relationship between in-distribution (ID) and OOD data, and its performance is often unstable due to the manual selection of the rectification threshold. In this paper, we introduce Transformation Rectified Activation (Trans-ReAct), a novel method that addresses these issues. Trans-ReAct leverages two core innovations: (1) it applies mathematical transformations to strategically amplify the activation differentiation between ID and OOD data, and (2) it introduces a dynamic threshold anchor that automatically adapts the rectification threshold to the ID data, ensuring stable performance. Evaluated on three benchmark datasets, Trans-ReAct significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing the false positive rate at 95% true positive rate (FPR95) by up to 9.76% and increasing the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUROC) by up to 2.04%."

    "abstract": "Satellite networks are rapidly evolving, yet most Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) remain isolated from terrestrial orchestration frameworks. Their control architectures are typically monolithic and static, limiting their adaptability to dynamic traffic, topology changes, and mission requirements. These constraints lead to inefficient spectrum use and underutilized network capacity. Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises automation, its deployment in orbit is limited by computing, energy, and connectivity limitations. This article introduces Space-O-RAN, a distributed control architecture that extends Open RAN principles into satellite constellations through hierarchical, closed-loop control. Lightweight dApps operate onboard satellites, enabling real-time functions like scheduling and beam steering without relying on continuous ground access. Cluster-level coordination is managed via Space RAN Intelligent Controllers (Space-RICs), which leverage low-latency Inter-Satellite Links (ISLs) for autonomous decisions in orbit. Strategic tasks, including AI training and policy updates, are transferred to terrestrial platforms Service Management and Orchestrations (SMO) using digital twins and feeder links. A key enabler is the dynamic mapping of the O-RAN interfaces to satellite links, supporting adaptive signaling under varying conditions. Simulations using the Starlink topology validate the latency bounds that inform this architectural split, demonstrating both feasibility and scalability for autonomous satellite RAN operations."

Adopting the module distributed controllers is to realize an extension of cell-module (CM) number, increase MMC stability and reliability, and simplify the complexity of fault-tolerance mechanism. The proposed direct digital control can take into account wide filter-inductance variation and source-voltage harmonics, and help achieve seamless hot-swap features with low distortion on output currents and less interference to grid voltages. In this paper, the module-distributed controllers are introduced first, and then the fault-tolerance mechanism for either CM unplugging or plugging is presented in detail. Experimental and simulated results obtained from an MMC operated in power-injection and with a hot-swap feature have verified the analysis and discussion."

    "abstract": "Depth cameras have become an integral part of a wide range of applications, including industrial inspection, reverse engineering, human–robot collaboration, and biomechanical analysis. Their practical use, however, is limited by a narrow field of view and self-occlusions, which often prevent complete surface coverage of the scanned object. This paper introduces a methodology for systematically determining the optimal placement of a depth camera and an auxiliary planar mirror to maximize surface visibility. To this end, a simulation tool was developed that models camera rays, their reflections from the mirror, and their intersections with objects. The proposed method combines geometric visibility analysis with an optimization procedure that searches for configurations with maximum coverage. Validation was performed on a set of twenty objects ranging from simple geometric primitives to complex reference models. While a standalone camera achieved an average coverage of 51.68 %, the addition of a single planar mirror increased this value to 85.46 %, with complete coverage achieved for several objects. A complementary user study demonstrated that manually chosen configurations exhibit high variability and do not outperform the algorithmic design. The results confirm that the use of mirrors provides a cost-effective solution for overcoming occlusion-related limitations without resorting to multi-camera systems, and that the proposed methodology delivers consistent performance across diverse object geometries. The approach is particularly applicable in industrial inspection, robotic vision, and other domains where complete geometric information is essential."

    "abstract": "Since similar users frequently exhibit similar Quality of Service (QoS) when accessing similar services, effectively capturing neighborhood information hidden in QoS data becomes critical for latent factorization of tensor (LFT)-based QoS estimators. Current LFT models either calculate the complete set of neighborhoods or do not consider neighborhoods, resulting in a rapid rise in model complexity and poor estimation accuracy. Moreover, not every neighbor in the neighborhood set is beneficial to the user/service entity. To address these limitations, this study proposes a sampling-neighborhood-regularized latent factorization of tensor (SNLFT) model with three key ideas: 1) extracting primal latent factors (LFs), which are obtained to express related entities on the basis of high-dimensional and incomplete QoS data; 2) constructing the sampling-neighborhood set, which is acquired using the Gibbs sampling to reflect the similarities between the primal LF vectors of entities over time; 3) developing a sampling-neighborhood-regularized LFT model, where all the sampling neighborhoods of entities and L2-norm of desirable LFs are employed to regularize the objective function. Extensive experiments on eight dynamic QoS datasets demonstrate that SNLFT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in both estimation accuracy and computational efficiency."

    "abstract": "Parking in modern urban environments has become increasingly challenging as available spaces grow narrower and vehicles continue to increase in size. Although various automated parking technologies have been developed to address this issue, most production-level approaches are designed for relatively wide spaces and rely on simplified single-stage trajectories to ensure real-time feasibility. As a result, their applicability to narrow environments requiring multiple maneuvers remains limited. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a trajectory generation and tracking control logic for perpendicular parking in narrow spaces. The proposed logic emulates the way human drivers adjust their vehicle position through forward and backward movements, enabling effective parking even in narrow environments. The trajectory generation is based on a kinematic model and incorporates rear-wheel steering using a virtual wheelbase concept, allowing the existing logic to be applied without modification. To enhance robustness of tracking control, a disturbance observer is employed to compensate for road slopes and external disturbances, while a feedforward-based control strategy reduces the dependence on sensor feedback in lateral motion tracking. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through CARSIM simulations and real vehicle experiments, confirming its robustness and feasibility in achieving stable, collision-free perpendicular parking."

Both the sensor locations and uniform degrees of freedom (uDOFs) of this scheme can be expressed in closed-form expressions. Numerical simulation results indicate that the FO-ESDE exhibits enhanced uDOFs and inherits the superior mutual coupling (MC) performance of the first subarray's generator array.

Such a formulation of source coding is an alternative approach to the traditional framework and is inspired by an object tracking problem over proximity sensor networks. We define a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">multiset combinatorial Gray code</i> as a mulitset code with fixed multiset cardinality that possesses combinatorial Gray code characteristic. For source codes that are organized as a grid, namely an integer lattice, we propose a solution by first constructing a mapping from the grid to the set of symbols, which we referred to as colors. The codes are then defined as the images of rectangular blocks in the grid of fixed dimensions. We refer to the mapping as a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">color mapping</i> and the code as a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">color multiset code</i>. We propose the idea of product multiset code that enables us to construct codes for high dimensional grids based on 1-dimensional (1D) grids. We provide a detailed analysis of color multiset codes on 1D grids, focusing on codes that require the minimal number of colors. To illustrate the application of such a coding scheme, we consider an object tracking problem on 2D grids and show its efficiency, which comes from exploiting transmission parallelism.

However, due to the limitations of large-scale ground-based simulation facilities, the equivalent dose rate achievable through laser simulation has long been constrained to approximately 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">12</sup> rad(Si)/s.

In addition, the comparison between the laser and X-ray data indicates that the relative errors of the peak responses for the silicon-based devices are 4.77%, 2.41%, and 6.63%, respectively. A characteristic dual-peak response phenomenon was also observed in the experiments, and further analysis indicates that it primarily originates from spatial variations in the X-ray incidence position causing non-uniform energy deposition."

Machine learning models are applied to predict ESG scores with respect to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicators which lead us to a primary discussion of some challenges faced in ESG analytics, namely data sparsity, indicator interdependencies, and non-linear relationship. Through the Gradient Boosting methodology, PCA, and advanced feature engineering, we showcase a robust predictive framework that outperforms traditional statistical methods with respect to performance. This is a novel approach combining multi-source SDG data with advanced preprocessing techniques to deal with missing values and multicollinearity issues. The proposed model is significantly more accurate when compared to baseline methods and offers unique insights regarding feature importance within the environment, society, and governance domains. The present study highlights the importance of ESG metrics in sustainable development, the model performance is evaluated using various metrics, and the actionable implications for decision-makers are considered. Such interpretability is enhanced for practitioners, affirmed by the visual representation of results using feature importance plot, predicted vs actual score graph, and statistical comparison of models."

Offshore environments pose unique challenges: space/weight constraints and logistical limitations. The study evaluates systems against seven design criteria derived from NFPA 110, API RP 14F, and author experience: space, weight, self-discharge, fuel autonomy, power transfer time, short-circuit capability, and loading flexibility. The study reveals DGs outperform ESSs in volumetric/gravimetric energy density However, ESSs offer critical advantages: faster response times, eliminating UPS needs for critical loads, renewable energy integration potential, solving offshore refueling challenges, reduced environmental impact."

    "abstract": "Telehealth technologies are behind the modern healthcare revolution, especially helping nurses care for chronic illnesses. How RPM influences the care of diabetes, hypertension, and heart failure is measured in this study. With RPM, nurses can spot warning signs quickly, respond promptly, and make sure patients are part of their care plan using fresh data. The study looks at recent research and case studies to see how healthcare results, patient satisfaction, and workflow have advanced. The findings demonstrate that RPM helps patients follow their treatments, visit the hospital less often, and experience a better quality of life. As a result, nurses can be more comfortable giving more active and suited care when RPM is utilized in their work. RPM is a useful tool for managing chronic diseases, according to the evidence, despite issues with data security and technology uptake. Its long-term viability depends on ongoing investments in nurse education and the telemedicine structure."

    "abstract": "Digital image denoising is a significant challenge in image processing. It affects visual quality and the tasks that follow. This paper introduces a new multi-stage hybrid image denoising method. We compare it with the Enhanced Discrete Wavelet Transform (EDWT) method by Tuba and Zivkovic. Our approach starts with spatial filtering, then uses ensemble wavelet denoising, follows with residual refinement, and ends with edgeaware blending. We carried out experiments on standard images that were corrupted by both Gaussian and Salt & Pepper noise at different levels. We evaluated performance using Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), and Mean Squared Error (MSE), among other quality metrics. The results show that our multi-stage hybrid method consistently performs better in denoising. Specifically, it achieves an average PSNR of over 41 dB. It maintains an average SSIM of over 98% compared to the original image. Additionally, it reduces the MSE by more than 98% across all tested images and noise conditions. This method effectively preserves image details and structural integrity."

Valuable insights could be derived from the extracted unstructured information and analyzed by applying sentiment analysis techniques. In this paper, a comprehensive study on Twitter reviews is done by categorizing user sentiments into three classes: positive, neutral, and negative. This work is divided into two experimental segments. In the first segment, dataset comprising of 27,453 tweets is evaluated and three techniques are applied, namely, a rule-based method (VADER), a traditional machine learning pipeline using TF-IDF with Logistic Regression, and a deep learning model based on the transformer architecture, RoBERTa. Among these, RoBERTa achieved the highest accuracy of 72.13%, outperforming VADER (63.13%) and TF-IDF + Logistic Regression (69.14%), demonstrating the effectiveness of transformer-based contextual embeddings for sentiment classification. In the second segment, experiment is conducted with a reduced dataset of 5,000 tweets to simulate a low-resource environment. A comparison of Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting (GB) performance is explored. Logistic Regression and Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy of 75.8% and 75.9% respectively, highlighting their robustness even on limited data. The results show the effectiveness of both transformer-based and classical models, depending on the dataset size and complexity."

With a wide range of types and capabilities, CCTV plays a role in recording events that occur within a predetermined field of view (FOV). Various methods have been invented to store recording files, whether in the built-in storage inside the CCTV itself, memory cards, stored in the hard disk of a Digital Video Recorder (DVR), or via cloud-based storage as the latest and most recent method. However, on the other hand, problems often occur when technical problems occur, especially with the power supply, the process of recording cannot be completed, and finally, the file created by the system cannot be played back and remains as a temporary file in the storage. Fast Forward Moving Picture Experts Group (FFMPEG) is the key to starting the data recovery process, where the unplayable temporary files can be recovered and perhaps played. FFMPEG is a great open-source tool for transcoding, muxing, filtering, and playing back any recording made by humans or computers. It also supports various types of legacy formats created by various standards committees, communities, or corporations. In this study, FFMPEG will be used to rearrange the coding and to ensure that the broken video recording file can be played back, and provide an overview of what happened until the last moment of the recording was successfully recorded."

    "abstract": "Synthesizing realistic audio for silent videos is a challenging cross-modal generation task with broad applications in video editing and multimedia content creation. To address this, we implemented a Contrastive Video-Audio encoder (CVAP) framework that generates high-fidelity audio synchronized with silent video. The CVAP model integrates a deep video encoder to extract spatiotemporal visual features, a Variational Audio Autoencoder (VAE) for compact audio representation, and a Transformerbased temporal alignment module that learns the correspondence between visual events and sound patterns over time. A BigVGAN vocoder then converts the generated audio spectrogram latent representation into a waveform, ensuring high audio quality. At its front end, CVAP employs the MAViL visual encoder, whose masked-audio-video pretraining yields rich spatiotemporal features aligned with auditory semantics. These features enter a shared latent space formed by a mel-spectrogram variational autoencoder: video cues are projected into the same representation that the audio decoder will later reconstruct, ensuring that sight and sound speak a common language. The proposed approach is novel in its combination of advanced components and offers practical implications, such as automating effect generation for films and videos and enhancing multimedia experiences by adding contextually appropriate sound to silent video content. As validated by our experimental evaluations (Tables 1, 2, and 3), the proposed CVAP framework achieves superior audio synthesis quality, with significant improvements in Fréchet Audio Distance (FAD) and related metrics, thus providing a new pathway for more immersive and accessible audiovisual media experiences."

To address these challenges, this study employs machine learning techniques to analyze historical weather datasets. Advanced data preprocessing techniques, including normalization and feature engineering, were applied to manage missing values and inconsistencies within the dataset. Several machine learning models–Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM)–were implemented and evaluated using performance metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> Score.

Conventional translation approaches enforce rigid constraints forcing outputs to match input sketch edges exactly, producing unrealistic results when sketches are imperfect. Our technique utilizes sketches as soft guidance instead of hard constraints, generating more natural images. We introduce a joint completion framework treating sketches as contextual cues for image synthesis. A contextual GAN learns unified sketch-image distributions through shared representation. Key advantages include: (1) joint representation simplifies learning in common sketch-image space, avoiding cross-domain complexities; (2) outputs maintain semantic relation to inputs while exhibiting visual flexibility unlike strict conditional GANs; (3) identical architecture enables bidirectional sketch-image conversion. Experiments on benchmark datasets show improved performance over existing conditional methods, especially for poor-quality sketches, with strong generalization. The method achieves realistic results through context-guided completion rather than direct mapping."

The study evaluated model performances through accuracy tests together with precision, recall measurements as well as ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) analysis PRC (Precision-Recall Curve) evaluation and execution time assessment. SCHF + IBK produced the best brain tumor classification accuracy at <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{9 2. 9 8 \\%}$</tex> which established it as the optimal identifying method. SCHF + Decision Stump method produced similar results to PHOG + Decision Tree method as both achieved 92.02 % accuracy in the classification process. Reliability of classification extends from the PHOG + IBK model since it achieved 91.11 % accuracy alongside a precision level of 0.93. The combination of SCHF and Decision Tree resulted in the least effective yet most inefficient tumor prediction model with 81.01 % accuracy and weak ROC of 0.83 and recall at 0.81. The extremely fast execution time of 0.14 seconds for PHOG + Decision Stump makes this model the best choice for live applications due to its exceptional computational speed. SCHF + IBK produced the longest execution time of 1.16 seconds even though it achieved good classification outcomes. The examination reveals that IBK-based methods achieve top classification results but Decision Stumps execute the fastest compared to other models. The SCHF + Decision Tree classifier proved to be ineffective thus making it an unfit solution for tumor classification problems."

This Paper investigates Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) as a superior virtual reality gesture detection method in real-time. SNN saves energy and go faster since it uses spikes to process data, much like the brain. Following an SNN-based model, the proposed approach trained it on a motion recognition dataset utilizing certain learning techniques like Spike-Timing-dependent Plasticity (STDP). This Paper assessed the model's energy usage, speed, and accuracy on neuromorphic devices. Although SNN uses less energy and reacts faster than other deep learning models, the findings imply that it can correctly detect motions. Therefore, VR apps are quite suitable, especially on phones and connected devices.

    "abstract": "The increasing reliance on multi-megawatt DirectDrive Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generators (DD-PMSGs) for offshore wind energy conversion systems (OWECS) places a critical emphasis on their operational reliability. While DDPMSGs eliminate the failure-prone gearbox, their performance is fundamentally dependent on the health of their permanent magnets (PMs), which are susceptible to demagnetization and mechanical damage. This paper presents a detailed investigation on the electromagnetic signatures of common PM faults using high-fidelity Finite Element Analysis (FEA). A comprehensive 2D model of the $15-\\mathrm{MW}$ reference wind turbine generator, defined by the International Energy Agency (IEA), is used as a benchmark. The study systematically analyzes the effects of uniform and localized demagnetization, as well as broken magnet, on key performance indicators. The results demonstrate that each fault type generates distinct and quantifiable changes in the electromagnetic torque, three-phase back-electromotive force (back-EMF), and air-gap flux density distribution. By characterizing these unique fault signatures, this work provides a foundational understanding necessary for the development of advanced condition monitoring and fault diagnosis algorithms, ultimately contributing to the enhanced reliability and reduced operational costs of OWECS."

Despite its environmental advantages, the use of ammonia introduces considerable challenges in terms of combustion dynamics and pollutant formation. This research uses computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling through CONVERGE software to evaluate how varying the share of ammonia, diesel injection duration, and injection timing affects engine behavior under high-load conditions. The findings reveal that introducing a 10% ammonia blend results in peak pressures surpassing those of conventional diesel combustion. While ammonia tends to delay ignition and reduce the heat release rate, optimizing injection timing and shortening injection duration improves premixed combustion characteristics. Notably, nitrogen oxide (NO) emissions are substantially decreased by as much as 92%, with higher ammonia content, likely due to thermal DeNOx reactions. However, shortening injection at higher ammonia levels elevates NO output, and advancing injection timing has limited impact on this trend."

    "abstract": "Loan approval plays a central role in banking operations and directly affects the organization’s profit and risk exposure. With increasing loan applications and the limitations of traditional manual evaluation methods, financial institutions are turning to machine learning to improve decision-making processes. This study evaluates four machine learning models to predict loan approval status using a comparatively large and numerically focused data set. Logistic regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and ANN were implemented and compared under a consistent experimental setup. The data set used in this study contains structured financial data with features such as installment amount, annual income, debt-to-income ratio, FICO score, and revolving balance, relevant to real-world loan prediction scenarios. Among the models tested, XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy. The best model was also deployed using AWS SageMaker with API Gateway and Lambda for real-time inference, demonstrating the potential for use in production environments. The results highlight the effectiveness of different machine learning techniques in loan assessment and underscore the importance of using relevant numerical features for realworld applicability."

    "abstract": "Most critically, enforcing road safety laws and reducing roadway fatalities from traffic accidents will rely heavily on accurately detecting helmet use and motorcycle riders' number plates. Conventional methods of enforcement rely heavily on human observation and labour-intensive methods, and are problematic as they can be subject to human error under specific conditions (for example, poor weather and lighting). To demonstrate an automated system that could potentially mitigate some of these constraints, we developed a novel automated system by combining cutting-edge object detection models (You Only Look Once, Nano version (YOLOv8n), Faster R-CNN) and EasyOCR (optical character recognition) to assist law enforcement. YOLOv8n has been praised for its speed and accuracy; when developing and training the model, we sourced a dataset with images of riders wearing helmets and other images of riders without helmets, as well as the number plate images to ensure that during training, the model was able to learn both tasks as it related to the helmet use detection and number plates. EasyOCR is an excellent resource for extracting textual data from detected number plates, so combining YOLOv8n with EasyOCR allows for real-time data collection from the detected number plates. This unified platform is a big step ahead in roadway security technology. It offers an easily expandable yet successful way to keep an eye on helmet use and identify and punish drivers who don't wear them, all of which will help reduce traffic accidents and save lives."

The significant energy footprint of buildings (approximately 40% of worldwide energy use) and the desire to improve sustainability without compromising occupant comfort are the primary drivers of this movement. However, complicated cybersecurity issues are also brought about by the close integration of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, automated controls, and networked management. In this study, we provide a comprehensive examination of CPS-based smart building monitoring and control technologies, exploring how state-of-the-art sensors, data analytics, and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered decision engines are utilized to enhance responsiveness and energy efficiency. We present a comparison between contemporary CPS-enabled SBMS and conventional building management systems, emphasizing the enhancements in security, flexibility, and energy efficiency. A thorough analysis of energy optimization processes demonstrates how machine learning algorithms and feedback loops may dynamically strike a balance between efficiency and comfort. We also examine new security models being developed to defend these cyber-physical infrastructures against attacks. This survey is unique because it comprehensively covers recent CPS developments and identifies emerging trends that will influence next-generation smart building management, including blockchain, Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)based decentralized management architectures, and federated learning for collaborative optimization.

    "abstract": "Since its introduction, guessing random additive noise decoding (GRAND) has received extensive attention due to its simplicity, high parallelism, and good decoding performance. Among the different decoder architectures, the serial architecture demonstrates significant advantage in power consumption. However, there remains substantial potential for reducing decoding latency. Thus, an improved serial ordered reliability bits GRAND (ORBGRAND) decoder with low latency is proposed in this work. Apart from the parity constraint of Hamming weight (HW) which is considered to reduce the error pattern (EP) query times, two improvement measures are further proposed: 1) The serial sorter is optimized to further reduce the latency and area overhead; 2) High-frequency EPs storage module is added for lower latency with slight overhead increase. Implementation results for a (128, 104) cyclic-redundancy-check (CRC) code and a (128, 106) extended Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (eBCH) code indicate that the proposed decoder achieves a throughput of 27.7 Gbps with 264.5% growth compared with state-of-the-art serial ORBGRAND decoder. The area efficiency is 115.4 Gbps/mm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> and is improved by 123.6%."

This study examines the impact of renewable energy initiatives on rural development, livelihoods, and migration dynamics, employing a qualitative exploratory design and document analysis, supported by MAXQDA-based thematic coding. Drawing on peer-reviewed literature, international development reports, and policy documents, the analysis identifies five critical impact domains: economic development and income gains, gender and social inclusion, rural attractiveness and migration dynamics, land use and equity risks, and institutional design for local value creation. Evidence from Africa, Latin America, and Europe illustrates that decentralized solar mini-grids and community wind projects can quadruple household incomes, stimulate small business growth, and empower women entrepreneurs, while also reducing outmigration when implemented inclusively. Conversely, poorly governed large-scale projects-such as the Lake Turkana wind initiative-have triggered displacement, “green grabbing,” and community resistance. The findings emphasize that governance models, participatory planning, and fair benefit-sharing are decisive in shaping whether renewable energy stabilizes rural populations or exacerbates inequalities. To achieve just and resilient rural futures, integrated policy frameworks must link energy justice, migration-sensitive strategies, and local ownership. By positioning renewable energy as a catalyst for rural transformation, this study provides actionable insights for policymakers, practitioners, and researchers engaged in sustainable energy transitions."

    "abstract": "In mobile FinTech applications, secure microtransactions are crucial for safeguarding user privacy and fostering trust in low-value, high-frequency digital payments. Traditional cryptographic mechanisms often impose computational burdens on mobile and IoT devices, limiting scalability and real-time efficiency. Existing methods, such as RSA or TLS, suffer from large key sizes, high latency, and energy consumption, making them unsuitable for lightweight financial operations in constrained environments. To address these challenges, this study proposes a Lightweight Cryptographic Protocol based on the Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES) combined with a Hash-Based Message Authentication Code (HMAC). ECIES enables efficient asymmetric encryption using compact key structures, while HMAC ensures data integrity and authentication with minimal processing overhead. Together, the ECIES-HMAC framework secures microtransactions by encrypting payment data and verifying message authenticity, all while maintaining optimal performance. This protocol is deployed in mobile FinTech platforms to protect peer-to-peer payments, QR-based transfers, and digital wallet operations. It supports real-time transaction processing with strong resistance to replay, spoofing, and man-in-the-middle attacks. Performance evaluations show a 45% reduction in cryptographic latency and 30% lower energy usage compared to legacy."

Finding these bots using the procedures is challenging since they can mimic real trading activity while affecting the market and generating data breaches. This paper describes a Transformer-based sequence classification model called T-BERT. This model aims to spot fraudulent trading activity when examining data about trades occurring over time. A fine-tuned BERT model trained on labeled datasets, including individuals and bot activity, processes trade events. The result implies tokenization and temporal embedding augmentation of the trading events. Through contextual learning, T-BERT can detect behavioral patterns not immediately clear throughout the experience. T-BERT maintains a low false-positive rate and achieves a detection accuracy of 96.3% compared to the performance of traditional machine learning models. They represent a notable advancement in the performance of machines. Furthermore, the attention methods of the model improve the data’s interpretability by highlighting possibly fraudulent transaction sequences and simplifying the process of understanding bot behavior. The research results indicate that transformer-based designs successfully spot bot-driven financial threats. The T-BERT solution aims to improve the integrity and security of real-time trading platforms by offering a solution that is additionally scalable and interpretable."

    "abstract": "This paper suggests a novel AI-based hybrid model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for risk identification and regulatory compliance in order to address the growing problems of IT governance and compliance. Spatial and temporal feature learning are used in model training based on the UNSWNB15 dataset to achieve the best classification accuracy in identifying patterns of non-compliance behavior and cyberattacks. With a classification accuracy of 99% and an AUC of 0.95, the engineered hybrid solution's improved performance is confirmed by comparative performance evaluation utilizing baseline CNN, LSTM, and RF models. Additionally, the model validates the performance problems that result from dealing with class imbalance and offers suggestions to guarantee that AI systems are developed in a compliance-friendly setting. The results demonstrate how well AI-based models work to enable automated monitoring and decision-making for enterprise IT governance systems in realtime. This study improves regulatory risk assessment in dynamic IT environments in a scalable and interpretable way."

Traditional firefighting methods expose personnel to extreme hazards, including high temperatures, toxic gases, and structural collapses. This paper presents an IoT and AI-enhanced autonomous fire-fighting robot, designed to detect, navigate, and extinguish fires with minimal human involvement. The proposed system integrates flame, temperature, and gas sensors with an Arduino-based control unit and an AI-assisted flame classification model to minimize false alarms. Real-time environmental data is transmitted via IoT to a remote monitoring station, enabling both autonomous and manual override modes. The navigation system employs ultrasonic sensors and obstacle avoidance algorithms, while the fire suppression mechanism uses a servo-controlled water or CO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>-based extinguisher.

The recent development of direct-to-satellite smartphone connectivity through 5G Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) demonstrates particularly significant potential. This paper proposes a novel Monte Carlo method for calculating vegetation-induced blockage probability in satellite-to-ground line-of-sight (LoS) links. First, we present a physical tree modeling approach based on fractal geometry theory, capable of simulating diverse vegetation structures through parameter adjustments including recursion depth, branching ratio, and angle. We then develop an innovative computational framework that evaluates LoS probability by establishing Monte Carlo links with randomized angles through the tree models and analyzing their blockage status. The proposed method statistically determines LoS probability by quantifying unblocked links. Comprehensive simulations assess the impact of various tree parameters, demonstrating that increased recursion depth and branching angles substantially degrade LoS probability."

    "abstract": "Global energy scenarios have been progressively shifting toward renewable sources, driven by climate goals and policy mandates. However, the intermittent nature of renewables, such as solar and wind, necessitates scalable and flexible energy storage solutions. Green hydrogen has emerged as a promising carbon-neutral energy carrier, that can be used as a substitute vector in those sectors where electrification cannot yet succeed, such as hard-to-abate sectors and long-term large-scale energy storage applications. Underground Hydrogen Storage, UHS, in saline aquifers is considered a viable pathway to storing large volumes of hydrogen, enabling seasonal and backup energy supply, and creating necessary buffer for wider utilization of renewables worldwide. Reservoir simulation is used to assess the feasibility and optimization of such geological storage systems. Key input data includes petrophysical properties such as porosity and permeability but as relative permeability saturation functions. Due to the scarcity and inconsistency of hydrogen-specific data in the literature, this study proposed a new consistent and repeatable procedure for obtaining relative permeability. The key question addressed is whether hydrogen relative permeability is similar as other gases like nitrogen and methane where more data is readily available for relevant rock types. The novel protocol is tested across these gases, combining $\\mu \\mathrm{CT}$ imaging and pore-scale flow simulations to derive relative permeability curves over a broader saturation range, providing a final comparison between the obtained results. The comparative findings support the hypothesis of similar behavior between the different gases, justifying the use of model gases for early-stage UHS design, ultimately facilitating the development of such technology and the integration of hydrogen into renewable energy sy stems."

    "abstract": "In recent years, local governments have continuously invested in local tourism marketing, but failed to achieve the desired effect, and problems frequently occur, so there is a need for a marketing plan optimization and effect evaluation method to promote the development of tourism economy in various places. The purpose of this paper is to optimize the application of government tourism through advanced data analysis technology and marketing solutions, so as to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of government tourism marketing activities. First, this paper uses big data analysis methods in advanced data analysis to identify important influencing factors such as advertising volume, social media engagement, and weather conditions. Then, this paper uses the local resource government to optimize the allocation of advertising resources, and uses relevant algorithms to find the optimal combination of marketing solutions. Subsequently, the data results are obtained from the case application. The results show that after optimization, the government in this study has led to a significant increase in the number of tourists in Scenic Area B, with a growth rate of up to 25%, and at the same time, a 4.67-fold increase in the return on investment of the government's tourism marketing activities. Therefore, this shows that scientific advanced data analysis and marketing solutions can greatly improve the effectiveness of government tourism marketing activities. Based on this, this method has the potential to be promoted and applied in other cities, and can help many local government departments to improve the overall efficiency of their tourism industry."

However, achieving a fault tolerant operation system typically requires the implementation of fault detection algorithms along with modulator or control system. This paper proposes a different approach by introducing a self-adaptive control system designed to ensure fault-tolerant operation under open-switch fault conditions. The proposed control system is based on Model Predictive Control (MPC). The proposed controller intrinsically detects deviations from the desired setpoint and automatically cancels the usage of the faulty voltage vectors. Furthermore, the proposed control ensures capacitor voltage balancing, even under fault-tolerant conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed faulttolerant MPC method is demonstrated through several simulation tests. The results obtained confirm the validity and feasibility of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen a transformational educational environment due to the growing usage of artificial intelligence. It has evolved from a technological niche to a revolutionary solution that redefines teaching, learning and assessment. The motivation of this paper is to explore the capacities of small language models, which lack sufficient research in educational contexts, especially Phi-4. The main contribution of this study is to offer a benchmark of Phi-4 alongside a range of both small and large language models, such as Mistral, Falcon, Qwen and DeepSeek, across various school subjects. The goal is to evaluate differences in performance, adaptability, and potential integration into educational environments. In the pursuit of developing a comprehensive benchmark for Phi-4 in education, the methodology is characterized by the building of a custom dataset with question and answer pairs covering different subjects to allow an evaluation of different small and large language models. When evaluating the models with a ROUGE score for all subjects combined, it shows that Phi- 3.5 -mini-instruct leads in recall for ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L and Falcon-7b-instruct shows the best score regarding the precision and F1 score across both ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L as well as speed. Phi-4-mini-instruct reaches the second best score for all metrics except precision and F1 score for ROUGE-L where it ended in third place. Regarding the evaluation per subject, Falcon-7b-instruct gets the best scores for geography, medical and science. Phi-3-medium-128k-instruct gets the best score for math. Despite some limitations in the size of the custom dataset and number of subjects evaluated, this study can provide educators, researchers, and policymakers with insights into the strengths and limitations of emerging AI technologies. It can also lay the groundwork for a more inclusive understanding of AI in education, since the AI revolution will reshape how knowledge is communicated and acquired in the coming years."

This paper presents a hybrid Transformer-classifier model that utilizes sophisticated spectrogram-based feature extraction techniques to improve classification accuracy. Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Constant-Q Transform (CQT), Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), and Gammatone spectrograms are used in order to extract the fine-grained frequency and time-domain features of the guitar sound. These spectrograms are processed through Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Swin Transformers, which extract spatial and temporal features in an efficient manner. These extracted features are subsequently classified through ML classifiers. The experimental demonstrates that the MFCC delivers the highest classification accuracy when coupled with Vision Transformer and Swin Transformer. More precisely, with SVM and MLP classifiers, both models record an accuracy of 97 %. In the case of Linear SVM, Vision Transformer outperforms marginally with a 98 % accuracy, and Swin Transformer records 97 %. These findings highlight the high performance of hybrid Transformer-classifier models in guitar technique recognition without compromising computational efficiency."

This article proposes a dynamic source-aware transferable data-driven control (DSTDC) strategy to optimize computing resource allocation under the off-ramps scenario. A data-driven predictor is established to characterize the powertrain structure of vehicular platoon. To improve the computational efficiency of platoon control algorithm, a transfer learning method is constructed. Specifically, the knowledge of vehicle in the source domain is transferred to vehicles in the target domain, and the latter just should update the knowledge in terms of the individual dynamic characteristics and tasks. Furthermore, an adaptive domain switching mechanism is developed to address the issue of source domain vehicle departure in the off-ramps scenario. Here, the source domain vehicle will be subject to reevaluation in terms of the computing performance, data accumulation and driving stability. Finally, a platoon experiment platform is conducted, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DSTDC strategy."

    "abstract": "Remote Patient Monitoring systems (RPMs) are becoming increasingly important as the aging population struggles to manage chronic illnesses and secure consistent healthcare access. While these systems excel in tracking physical metrics, integrating emotion recognition can bridge the often-overlooked connection between emotional and physical well-being. By identifying emotional responses such as discomfort, distress, or contentment, RPM systems can provide immediate feedback for care adjustments and reveal long-term trends. Subtle shifts in emotional patterns may act as early indicators of mental health conditions linked to chronic diseases or transient emotional stress. Expanding RPMs to include emotion awareness makes care more adaptive and holistic. This review explores how emotion recognition can enhance RPM systems by addressing both physical and emotional health. It examines methods that leverage physiological and behavioral responses to capture emotional states, assessing the advantages, limitations, and applicability of these modalities in RPM settings. By incorporating emotion-aware tools, RPMs have the potential to deliver more comprehensive, responsive, and personalized care, revolutionizing healthcare delivery for diverse patient groups."

    "abstract": "To mitigate the impact of frequent wind fluctuations on power generation and fatigue loads in offshore wind farms, this study proposes a double-layer coordinated yaw control strategy that explicitly considers dynamic wind direction. The strategy features a hierarchical framework: the upper field-level control, executed centrally, maximizes total farm power generation by employing gradient descent combined with serial refinement to determine optimal yaw angles for various wind conditions. A novel Gaussian-Curl Energy-Conserving model is constructed to address strongly asymmetric wake interactions in large-scale wind farms. The lower unit-level control applies model predictive control over a continuous time horizon to track these field-level yaw references, featuring the dual objectives of minimizing tracking error and mitigating fatigue loads. Furthermore, a disturbance observer is incorporated for real-time compensation of systematic measurement errors. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control framework significantly enhances the wind farm power generation and reduces fatigue loads under stochastic wind environments, which exhibit strong applicability for large-scale offshore wind farm operations."

We approach this problem by leveraging the mathematical foundations of 3D observer fields to explore and analyze 3D flows in reference frames that are more suitable to visual analysis than the input reference frame. We design novel interactive tools for determining, filtering, and combining reference frames for observer-aware 3D unsteady flow visualization. We represent the space of reference frame motions in a 3D spatial domain via a 6Dparameter space, in which every observer is a time-dependent curve. Our framework supports operations in this 6D observer space by separately focusing on two 3D subspaces, for 3D translations, and 3D rotations, respectively. We show that this approach facilitates a variety of interactions with 3D flow fields. Building on the interactive selection of observers, we furthermore introduce novel techniques such as observer-aware streamline- and pathline-filtering as well as observer-aware iso surface animations of scalar fluid properties for the enhanced visualization and analysis of 3D unsteady flows. We discuss the theoretical underpinnings as well as practical implementation considerations of our approach, and demonstrate the benefits of its 6+1D observer-based methodology on several 3D unsteady flow datasets."

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across modalities, such as image, video, and audio understanding, by leveraging large language models (LLMs) as a backbone. However, a critical challenge in MLLM inference is the large memory capacity required for the key–value (KV) cache, particularly when processing high-resolution images. This pressure often forces heterogeneous CPU–GPU systems to offload the KV cache to CPU memory, introducing substantial transfer latency. KV cache quantization is a promising way to reduce this memory demand, yet it remains underexplored for MLLM inference. In this work, we characterize MLLM inference and present a text-centric KV cache quantization method that retains only 10% of tokens in high precision while quantizing the rest.

    "abstract": "The massive low earth orbit (LEO) satellite-empowered Internet of Things (MLS-IoT) network has many advantages including high capacity, low latency, large network coverage, and high reliability. However, the openness and broadcasting on satellite communication links pose huge challenges to protect the security of data delivery, especially to defend against eavesdropping. Leveraging the density of LEO satellite deployment and developing efficient secure communication schemes with the aid of physical layer security (PLS) technique deserve further exploration. To the best of our knowledge, it is an almost untouched issue to employ satellites to transmit jamming signal in MLS-IoT systems since lots of available researches in this line mainly considered cooperative jamming only on ground networks. For this purpose, we propose in this paper a PLS based secure communication enhancement scheme in MLS-IoT network. A jamming scheduling and resource allocation problem is presented for the secrecy rate maximization by dynamically switching the roles of satellites on sub-channels for transmitting private information or jamming signal. An iterative strategy is devised to jointly optimizing jamming scheduling, device association, channel assignment, and power allocation. Numerical results validate that our presented optimization approach could significantly improve the system secrecy rate and achieve the optimal jamming scheduling and resource allocation decisions."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Control allocation is essential for managing MIMO dynamic systems, such as autonomous vehicles and robotics, which operate across varying temporal scales, posing challenges in optimizing control actions. A common approach involves traditional solvers for overdetermined systems---most notably the singular value decomposition (SVD), the least squares QR algorithm (LSQR), and Arnoldi-type methods---, which, while effective for homogeneous temporal scales, struggle to handle mixed dynamics. Their inability to explicitly account for temporal variations and uncertainties often results in suboptimal performance and high computational costs. To address these challenges, this work introduces a novel combination of the Dynamic Confined Space of Velocities (DCSV) method with Krylov subspace exploration, significantly enhancing control allocation in mixed-temporal-scale systems. The DCSV method generates optimized initial estimates, which are iteratively refined using Krylov methods, achieving precise control with reduced computational costs. Comparative analysis against traditional solvers demonstrates that DCSV consistently outperforms these methods, achieving higher accuracy with fewer computational resources, particularly in systems with mixed dynamic scales. Since LSQR is closely related to quadratic programming (QP) and linear programming (LP) through its cost function, and SVD directly computes generalized inverses, their evaluation provides a basis for comparison with conventional control allocation strategies. The proposed method surpasses these approaches by achieving a better balance between computational efficiency and control precision. In addition, the uncertainty principle embedded in the DCSV framework establishes theoretical limits that ensure robustness in the allocation process, supported by a structured sequential exploration process formulated via pseudocode. By optimizing initial estimates through DCSV, fewer refinement iterations are needed, leading to faster and more accurate control allocation, as confirmed by formal analysis. This methodology offers a robust and efficient solution to the challenges posed by mixed temporal scales, with enhanced adaptability for real-world applications in dynamic and computationally constrained environments."

    "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition that can make social interaction and communication challenging. It is known for repetitive behaviors and difficulties in understanding nonverbal communication cues. The growing interest in autism, fueled by advances in global health expertise, has resulted in increased efforts to enable early detection and intervention. The fundamental purpose of early detection is to provide personalized behavioral development treatment programs, easing the integration of autistic people into the society. In this research, we investigate the efficacy of deep learning models for autism detection, by developing an ensemble of high-performing Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)-based models. We perform a comparative study of five deep learning models, Xception, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, DenseNet201, ResNet50V2 to analyze images of autistic and non-autistic children. To enhance the predictive performance and robustness, we create an ensemble model combining the three top-performing deep learning models, achieving a state-of-the-art 91.7% accuracy. We further improve our performance to 93.33% by performing histogram equalization on the images. The use of automatic hyperparameter tuning has helped explore alternative model configurations effectively and resulted in a highly optimized CNN architecture for autism diagnosis in children. Our ensemble model achieved state-of-the-art results using a publicly available dataset, which includes 2 classes and comprises a total of 2940 images for training, validation, and testing. Our research showcases the immense potential of deep learning and ensemble model in advancing autism detection and early intervention."

First, an initial correlation graph is constructed to reflect device operational states based on similarities between pre-diagnosis results and multidimensional performance indicators. Employing graph convolutions to aggregate features from each node and its neighbors. Additionally, a dynamic graph optimization mechanism adaptively evolves the graph structure based on node features and model feedback.

By reducing manual intervention, it enables rapid deployment of optimized models suited for different computational environments. However, traditional architecture design methods often involve extensive trial and error, are time-consuming, and fail to adapt well to varying resource constraints, leading to inefficient and inflexible models. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a framework based on Reinforcement Learning-based Neural Architecture Search (RL-NAS), which explores and identifies optimal architectures through a reward-driven search process. The proposed RL-NAS method is applied to optimize neural networks for image classification tasks across both edge and cloud platforms, striking a balance between model accuracy, latency, and resource usage. The experimental evaluation shows that RL-NAS generates architectures that significantly outperform manually designed baselines in terms of performance and computational efficiency. Furthermore, the method demonstrates robust adaptability to diverse deployment scenarios, confirming its effectiveness in scalable neural network design."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of wireless sensing technology in intelligent interaction, gesture recognition based on Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) has become a research hotspot due to its non-contact nature and strong environmental adaptability. However, in fine-grained gesture classification tasks, existing methods often suffer from insufficient recognition accuracy and lack of lightweight design, which hinders real-time deployment. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight gesture recognition framework based on ZFNet with integrated channel attention. Specifically, the Markov Transition Field (MTF) is employed to map RFID phase sequences into two-dimensional feature images, thereby representing both local and global temporal patterns in a form suitable for convolutional processing. Furthermore, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) modules are embedded into the intermediate convolutional blocks (Conv2-Conv4) of ZFNet to adaptively recalibrate channel responses, enhancing the representation of critical fine-grained features and improving discriminative ability. Finally, traditional fully connected layers are replaced with 1×1 convolutions combined with global average pooling, which significantly reduces parameter size and enhances generalization performance. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with the original ZFNet, the proposed model reduces the number of parameters by approximately 93% while achieving an average recognition accuracy exceeding 97%. These findings indicate that the proposed framework effectively balances accuracy and efficiency, exhibits strong cross-scenario adaptability, and provides a feasible solution for deploying fine-grained gesture recognition in real-time interactive applications."

Existing gamification methods, although strong in increasing motivation, cannot incorporate adaptive processes to adapt the learning paths into a student’s unique progress. Current adaptive learning systems depend highly dependent on predefined rules or simplistic student profiles and therefore struggle to dynamically adapt to the performance of the live student. This study proposes an adaptive gamification structure that uses machine learning algorithms to constantly assess student motivation, problem solving ability and learning trajectory. The main innovation is a dynamic dynamic adjustment model (DDA), based on Machine, based on reinforcement learning and predictive analysis. This model continually observes student interactions and performance standards to adapt adaptively the difficulty of the challenge and the difficulty of the task gamified to maximize cognitive stimulation. In contrast to static gamification methods, this adaptive system establishes a closed feedback loop, allowing personalized real -time learning. Experimental tests with undergraduate students in Computer Science have shown that adaptive structure increased by 31%engagement rates, retention of refined concept by 24%and increased accuracy of problem solving by 18%compared to non -adaptive approaches. Statistical significance (p <0.01) established the robustness of these findings. The AI adaptive gamification platform provides a scalable, personalized and student -centered learning environment, filling critical gaps in the teaching of conventional computer science. Outside the academy, this technology has the potential to apply to professional technical training, uppart corporate initiatives and on -line learning platforms, supporting intelligent educational ecosystems that continually adapt to student requirements."

However, existing methods overlook the information of intermediate nodes in meta-paths and fail to address the degree bias problem in networks. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a heterogeneous network node classification method (GCL-NC) based on graph contrastive learning, which uses meta-path view and augmented view to obtain comprehensive and effective node embeddings. Specifically, in the meta-path view, the intermediate nodes of the meta-path are introduced as virtual nodes, the features of all nodes in the subgraph are reconstructed by averaging neighbor features, and then node features are learned by using an encoder. In the augmented view, different augmentation strategies are applied to low-degree nodes and high-degree nodes respectively; subsequently, the augmented view is fed into the encoder for feature learning. Finally, contrastive learning is performed on the embedding vectors of the two views, and a classifier is employed to complete the classification task. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches."

The proposed system consists of active rectifiers, $\\mathbf{Z}$-source, and gridconnected inverter. The adoption of an active rectifier enables current control of the generator, facilitating the use of a highefficiency generator, specifically an interior permanent magnet synchronous generator. The Z-source is resistant to short-circuit operation caused by switching element false turn-on, enabling an increase in the switching frequency of the inverter and allowing for a smaller DC link capacitor. Moreover, the Z-source provides two controllable voltages to the DC link, enabling them to be controlled separately in a shoot-through mode. It enables the power converter system to operate at maximum efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed system is validated through simulations."

Through experimental analysis of a 30kW electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), a weighted correlation was established between ripple characteristics and efficiency, developing voltage-specific coefficients for performance evaluation. The correlation analysis yielded distinct weight factors at each voltage level (375V: 0.9617/0.0383, 440V: 0.5672/0.4328, 500V: 0.9621/0.0379 for current ripple (CR)/voltage ripple (VR) respectively). The experimental results demonstrate optimal charging performance at moderate state of charge (SOC) levels with high load conditions, achieving a peak power conversion efficiency (PCE) of $96.3 \\%$, and a $1 \\%$ reduction in the current ripple corresponds to approximately $1.45 \\%$ PCE improvement.

    "abstract": "Machine learning techniques have become crucial tools for enhancing risk detection in digital banking and investment channels, where vast amounts of transactional data flow daily. These technologies provide advanced capabilities for identifying suspicious activities, thereby enhancing security and fostering customer trust. However, existing methods often rely on static, rule-based systems that struggle to adapt to evolving fraud patterns and are limited by their dependence on labeled fraudulent data, which is typically scarce and limited in quantity. This paper proposes a framework titled Fraudulent Transaction Detection using Deep Learning (FTD-DL), which leverages an autoencoder-based deep learning approach to learn standard transaction patterns and detect anomalies without requiring explicit fraud labels. The FTD-DL framework addresses the limitations of existing methods by utilizing unsupervised learning to identify subtle, previously unseen fraudulent behaviors in real-time. The proposed method enhances fraud detection efficiency by calculating reconstruction errors for each transaction and flagging those with high deviation for further investigation or automated action. Findings from the implementation demonstrate improved detection of novel fraud patterns, reduced false positives, and scalable adaptability across different banking environments. This study highlights the potential of deep learning to revolutionize digital banking security, providing a robust and adaptive risk detection mechanism."

One common reason for failure is mechanical damage to the windings, often caused by short circuits or aging. Detecting such faults early is very important but not always easy. This paper compares different methods used to find these problems, including Frequency Response Analysis (FRA), Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA), Polarization-Depolarization Current (PDC), and ShortCircuit Impedance (SCI). Each method has its strengths and weaknesses. The study shows that using a combination of methods gives better results. FRA is good for finding winding deformation, DGA helps assess insulation condition, and SCI is fast but less sensitive. The paper explains that combining different techniques gives more accurate and reliable diagnosis. In the future, these methods could be connected to online systems for real-time monitoring of transformers."

Subsequently, a rapid convergence sliding mode controller is designed based on tracking errors to enhance the response speed and tracking accuracy of the system. Finally, the stability of the control method is proven theoretically through Lyapunov function analysis, and verified by simulation and experimental results performed in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. Results confirm the proposed method's superior disturbance rejection capability and high control accuracy.

It also raises the issue concerning the possible risks linked with its use with respect to one's socio-emotional and physical health. The goal of this paper is to forecast the potential negative effect of smartphone usage. Most of the existing works have focussed on using the smartphone sensor data or behavioral profiling for detecting depression and anxiety. In this proposed research, we aim to address the ill effects of smartphone usage in a multi-dimensional perspective. The proposed research finds the correlation between the smartphone usage and various factors such as sleep issues, eyesight problems, anxiety, social media addiction, or incapacity to effectively interact socially. In contrast to existing works that focussed on one dimensional analysis, this research applies a holistic approach to perform risk assessments through predictive analytics. The proposed model attained 92.50 % accuracy with Random Forest. The classifier was validated with test runs and was adjusted for class imbalance, using the SMOTE method. This adjustment aided in reaching 93.71 % accuracy. further confirming the strong statistical relationship between smartphone usage and mental health. The outcomes advise that mobile phone usage has a statistically significant impact on an individual's mental health and this research will prove to be essential to understand the ill effects of smart phone usage."

The model consistently achieved DR detection accuracies up to 91.3%, with F1-scores reaching 0.859 and inference times below 130ms on ARM-based mobile processors, validating its diagnostic precision under resource constraints. Compared to unquantized baselines and mobile CNNs, the proposed framework demonstrated a 4.7–5.2% increase in accuracy and a 45% reduction in memory footprint, with no significant loss in classification performance due to quantization. TensorFlow Lite optimization and lesion-centric preprocessing enabled consistent screening performance under low-light and noisy imaging environments.

These attacks can congest the networks, disrupt services, and compromise sensitive data, leading to delays, threatening operations, and causing serious financial or reputational harm. To overcome these threats, an intelligent attack detection method needs to be developed. This motivates the current work to propose a lightweight Deep Learning (DL) based DDoS attack detection for IoT. Our model employs an Autoencoder (AE) for learning a reduced latent space representation of features from the CICIoT2023 dataset. A lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is fed an image representation of the encoded features for classifying DDoS attacks. Additionally, we have used the focal loss function to handle minority class (rare attack types) detection, which contributes to the enhanced overall detection. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed model achieved a comparatively higher performance than the state-of-the-art approaches."

Traditional decentralized controllers lack global optimization, making them inefficient for complex 5G environments. To address this gap, this paper investigates a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) architecture with centralized control to enable dynamic load balancing and resource allocation. However, SDN faces critical security challenges due to its centralized network architecture, where the controller becomes a single point of failure and an attractive target for diverse attacks. To address this, the novelty of this work lies in integrating OpenFlow with SSL/TLS encryption and SHA-based authentication, thereby establishing secure communication channels that ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authentication. The proposed framework is implemented on an OpenFlow-based SDN using Mininet for simulation and Wireshark for traffic analysis. The performance is further evaluated using metrics such as throughput and latency across two different scenarios."

The analysis integrates electricity demand projections from full electrification of heating in residential and tertiary sectors, assesses photovoltaic potential using updated GIS and legislative data, and evaluates impacts on the regional transmission grid as defined by the Italian Transmission System Operator. The study concludes that investment in utility-scale PV and BESS infrastructure is a strategic and sustainable pathway for achieving regional decarbonization goals, even if CAPEX is still more expensive than providing electricity to the civil sector using fossil sources, due to lower capacity factors and higher generation and grid costs."

    "abstract": "The fast adoption of wearable health devices has resulted in massive volumes of physiological data, which is crucial to have a quick anomaly detection system to ensure that appropriate medical treatments are provided. Standard rule-based systems often fail the test of adapting to individual variation and the complicated temporal patterns natural in biological signals. Biosignals are naturally complex and offer a unique anomaly detection system using sparse representation autoencoders. This methodology aims to find anomalies in multivariate time-series health data. The suggested method directs autoencoders to get compact latent representations by training them on conventional physiological patterns using the advised technique. This approach also ensures that the sparsity is preserved to improve feature discrimination. Reconstruction error thresholds help identify anomalies, while sparsity ensures the system is resilient to noise and redundant data. Experiments managed on publicly available datasets, including ECG and PPG signals, have revealed that the model may considerably enhance its accuracy and recall. The findings of these tests suggest that the model outperforms the traditional baseline deep learning settings. As seen in the results, the inclusion of sparsity in autoencoders contributes to an increase in their ability to identify minor anomalies. This approach may be beneficial for real-time health monitoring systems, as it is highly sensitive and reduces the number of false alarms."

    "abstract": "Addressing the issues of false positives and missed targets that mainstream object target algorithms encounter when working with remote sensing images featuring heterogeneous backgrounds and multi-scale objects, the present work presents a modified YOLOv8n for lightweight detection of remote sensing imagery. The method introduces the C2f-SC module, replacing the C2f Bottleneck with a novel SCBottleneck, enhancing feature extraction capabilities and background suppression, thereby improving performance in small object detection. In the Neck section, the SimAM attention mechanism is incorporated, which enhances the recognition accuracy of key regions while keeping the model's parameter count unchanged. Furthermore, the TDAD-Head detection head is proposed, utilizing shared convolutions to decrease the parameter count and optimize the interaction between classification and localization tasks, thus enhancing detection performance. Additionally, the Slide Loss function is refined using the Exponential Moving Average (EXPMA) concept, resulting in the ES Loss function that dynamically adjusts sample weights to effectively address class imbalance issues. Empirical results reveal that, versus the baseline YOLOv8n, the improved algorithm achieves a 2.1% increase in mAP, while the parameter count and calculation are reduced by 29% and 25% respectively, and FPS is increased by about 24%, which realizes the balance between detection performance and lightweight."

The model incorporates a Context-guided Attention Aggregation RepBlock (CAA-RepBlock) that mitigates information loss during multi-scale defect feature extraction. This design enables accurate localization of critical features within complex textural backgrounds while simultaneously reducing network complexity. To enhance recognition and localization of key regions, a deformable attention mechanism is integrated, improving robustness against distorted defects and enhancing feature separability. Additionally, a multi-level Dilated Reparameterized Block with Enhanced Local Attention Network (DRBELAN) is developed to facilitate efficient cross-scale feature fusion. This module enhances comprehensive semantic information representation for dense defects while accelerating inference through reparameterization strategies. On the benchmark NEU-DET dataset, CFA-DETR achieves 81.1% detection accuracy with only 8.23M parameters. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model in detecting both distorted and densely distributed surface defects across diverse industrial scenarios."

Often, standard data analysis does not do a great job at finding the changing, irregular parts of big energy consumption data. The study explains how Apache Mahout, Spark, and Storm were added to K-Means and Canopy to make the CKMA framework for anomaly detection. CKMA is low-variance anomaly detection since it uses Canopy to create quick first clusters and then refines them using K-Means. LMR together with PCA is used to spot slight changes in the stability of the power grid. Seeing the results of tests, it becomes clear that the CKMA algorithm enhances processing speed and detection accuracy much more when integrated into distributed systems than traditional ones. With such a unified system, finding changes in power usage patterns is more reliable, adaptable, and up to date, so it is useful for managing smart grids and forecasting energy usage."

    "abstract": "As industrial systems evolve toward greater automation, adaptability, and intelligence, the demand for real-time processing on heterogeneous multi-dimensional platforms has intensified. These platforms, which combine general-purpose CPUs with specialized accelerators such as FPGAs, enable parallel execution and high performance. However, achieving real-time guarantees in such environments is complex due to heterogeneous processing capabilities, resource contention, and inter-task communication delays. This paper proposes two novel scheduling algorithms that are tailored for real-time execution in heterogeneous industrial computing environments. The Real-Time Priority-driven Algorithm (ReTPA) dynamically assigns tasks by considering both priority and processing unit availability, enhancing workload distribution and meeting tight deadline constraints. Extending this, the Communication-aware Real-Time Priority-driven Algorithm (CRETPA) introduces communication-aware scheduling decisions to mitigate inter-core latency and improve coordination among diverse processing units. In addition, the proposed framework explores the integration of Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) for reconfigurable hardware modules, analyzing its impact on scheduling feasibility under real-time constraints. Experimental results on industrial benchmarks reveal that ReTPA and CRETPA significantly reduce execution time, improve deadline adherence, and increase throughput compared to traditional scheduling approaches. These findings validate the suitability of the proposed methods for deployment in embedded control systems, smart manufacturing, and industrial automation infrastructures that require predictable and efficient real-time performance."

We formulate a joint optimization problem that maximizes the overall energy efficiency (EE) of the network while satisfying quality-of-service (QoS) requirements and ensuring a minimum harvested energy level for each gateway. The optimization variables include the transmit power allocation, beamforming vectors, RIS phase shift matrix, and power-splitting ratios at the gateways. To tackle the resulting high-dimensional and non-convex problem, we develop a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Simulation results show that the proposed PPO-based approach significantly outperforms benchmark methods, achieving higher EE while guaranteeing the energy sustainability of low-power IoT devices. These findings highlight the potential of integrating RIS, NOMA, and advanced learning-based optimization in future energy-constrained mMTC networks."

Some of them used segmentation method with the help of noise removal method, and there are also previous works which utilized ROI of iris image. Nevertheless, there are still limitation in terms of segmentation error. Thus, the problems of segmentation error become the motivation of this study to design an enhanced segmentation method to reduce segmentation error of noisy iris image, which lead to enhancement in accuracy performance of noisy iris recognition system.

Although these chemistries are well studied for irreversible capacity loss (permanent aging) under extreme conditions, reversible capacity loss remains comparatively underexplored across real-world temperature ranges. This form of loss is a temporary reduction in usable capacity caused by environmental factors such as temperature fluctuations, with capacity often recoverable once optimal conditions are restored. While not permanent, it reduces performance, impairs state-of-charge and state-of-health estimation, and limits battery management system effectiveness, particularly in applications subject to daily or seasonal temperature variations. This study addresses these gaps by evaluating reversible capacity loss and AC/DC internal resistance growth in NMC, LFP, and NCA. Electrochemical behavior is characterized using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) across five controlled ambient temperatures ($10{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ to 45°C) under standardized charge–discharge conditions. The findings establish benchmarks for reversible capacity loss in these chemistries and provide guidance for selecting LIBs suited to temperature-sensitive applications in grid storage, electric vehicles, and portable electronics."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a privacy-preserving occupancy detection method that estimates room occupancy without using cameras or other imaging devices, relying solely on environmental sensor data such as temperature, humidity, and CO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> concentration. While video cameras provide the advantage of high-precision, real-time behavior detection, concerns are raised regarding potential privacy infringements resulting from their continuous video recording. The model employs a Long ShortTerm Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies in the data. First, threshold optimization is performed to maximize the F1 score based on the model’s output probabilities. Next, three categories of supplementary featurestemporal, dynamic, and CO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>-related-are incorporated in addition to the baseline inputs to evaluate their contribution to occupancy estimation performance. Using permutation importance for feature selection, the performance of three configurations is compared: a baseline model, a featureaugmented model, and a feature-selected model. The baseline model achieves an F1 score of 0.86, while the feature-selected model achieves the best performance with $\\mathbf{F 1}=\\mathbf{0 . 9 3}$, Accuracy $=$ 0.92, and $M C C=0.84$. The permutation importance analysis indicates that diurnal periodicity and CO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> variation patterns are the most influential factors for occupancy estimation. These results demonstrate that high-accuracy occupancy detection can be achieved using only environmental sensors while preserving privacy. The proposed approach has potential applications in elderly monitoring support and energy-saving control systems."

The design process integrates analytical calculations with finite-element modeling (FEM) to optimize the PCB-based magnetics for high-frequency and high-power density. A hardware prototype was fabricated and tested, and the key inductance parameters (magnetizing and leakage) differed by less than 5% from the FEM predictions. Experimental results verified the FEM-based co-simulation, confirming accurate prediction of converter behavior and successful zero-voltage switching (ZVS) across the load range. The strong agreement between analytical design, simulation, and hardware results demonstrates a repeatable process for compact, high-frequency planar magnetics in modern power adapters."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to solve the application and scheduling problem of distributed generation and energy storage joint dispatching in power joint dispatching. Due to the widespread use of renewable energy and the development of energy storage technology, it is difficult for traditional dispatching methods to meet the various requirements of the current combined power dispatching for the utilization of renewable resources, such as economy, stability, and high efficiency. Based on this, this paper introduces a hybrid integer linear programming and deep learning model to construct a reliable joint dispatch of distributed power generation and energy storage, and realizes joint scheduling, in order to achieve a more efficient and reliable scheduling strategy, so as to improve the overall performance of joint scheduling. To this end, this study uses a deep learning CNN model to predict power load and renewable energy generation. The analysis results show that the joint scheduling of distributed power generation and energy storage based on hybrid integer linear programming and deep learning model studied in this paper has obvious advantages in joint scheduling. In the normal operation scenario, the total operating cost of the joint dispatch is controlled within 250,000 yuan, and the utilization rate of renewable energy reaches 90%; In the load fluctuation scenario, its utilization rate is increased to 92%; Through practical application, the operating cost in the third month has been significantly reduced, specifically reduced to 240,000 yuan, and the utilization rate has also been improved. It can be seen that this joint dispatching has a certain economy and efficiency, and can provide intelligent dispatching solutions for its power enterprises."

    "abstract": "Power electronics is a significant component of current energy systems, and enables the effective conversion of energy designations in various directions, including renewable energy systems (i.e., wind, solar), electric vehicles, robotics, and high voltage DC transmission. DC-DC converters represent an inefficient component of energy systems as they can boost or buck the voltage level between power sources and power loads. The low voltage sources available (i.e., fuel cells, low voltage solar photovoltaics) are of low and variable output, which results in limited applicability and consistency while remaining economically feasible. High-gain DC-DC boost converters (BC) can ameliorate these issues by providing a step-up output voltage to the level needed to accommodate our residential and industrial consumption, while containing the input current to a near-constant potential. This paper describes the demonstration of a high-gain DC-DC BC that generates significantly greater voltage gain than other designs. By using carefully coupled inductors, capacitors, diodes, and switches, energy is efficiently transferred and converted to obtain usable voltages. The converter has a constant duty cycle and a high output voltage, making it ideal for voltage step-up applications. Simulation results validate its performance, demonstrating its ability to convert low input voltages into high output voltages while saving energy. This converter has the potential to revolutionize renewable energy systems, solar PV installations, electric vehicles, and industrial high-voltage DC technologies."

The proposed system uses Python-based image processing to detect the brightest region in the camera frame, indicating the sun's position. The coordinates of this region are transmitted via serial communication to an Arduino Nano, which drives two servo motors to orient the solar panel along both azimuth and elevation axes, enabling real-time sun tracking. To improve tracking precision and voltage stability, four signal filtering techniques—Kalman Filter, Savitzky–Golay Filter, Particle Filter, and Moving Average Filter—are implemented and comparatively analyzed. Experimental results demonstrate that appropriate filter selection significantly enhances tracking accuracy and power output stability. This integrated system demonstrates a low-cost, intelligent solution for solar energy optimization through a combination of computer vision, embedded control, and smart communication. To monitor energy performance, a voltage sensor connected to the solar panel measures real-time output, which is read through the serial interface and displayed in a custom graphical user interface (GUI). A mathematical model estimates the charging duration based on the voltage input, and upon timer completion, the system automatically triggers an SMS alert to a registered number using the Twilio API."

Because of that, spotting warning signs early and calculating who is at highest risk have moved to the front lines of medical care. This paper looks at how several machine-learning models can flag future strokes by sifting through patient records and teasing out which factors matter most. Researchers feed a broad mix of data-demographics, habits, lab numbers, and history of illness-into algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests, boosting trees, and deep networks. Careful feature selection lifts forward familiar red flags-age, high blood pressure, heart trouble-while techniques such as oversampling and bagging help tame skewed class counts. Results show that the smarter models reach very high accuracy, opening the door to tailored treatment plans and on-the-spot risk alerts. In short, the study paints machine learning as a game-changing ally in stroke prevention, one able to reshape big healthcare systems through clear, evidence-driven insight."

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented generation (RAG), which incorporates non-parametric knowledge from external knowledge bases [1] into large language models (LLMs), has emerged as a promising approach for improving response accuracy in various tasks, such as question answering (QA). However, existing research has primarily focused on optimizing the retrieval and generation modules, while largely overlooking the critical role of answer post-processing in determining the final output quality. For instance, in the paper CRUD-RAG, the authors categorize RAG applications into four types—Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD). For each type, they construct corresponding datasets and conduct extensive comparative experiments to evaluate all components of the RAG system across different application scenarios. Their evaluation examines the effects of various LLMs, embedding models, retrieval strategies, and key hyperparameters on system performance, providing practical guidance for parameter tuning in task-specific RAG systems. Nevertheless, the study reveals persistent issues with answer quality in the Read task, where generated responses frequently contain invalid information, redundant content, and other quality defects. To address these limitations, we propose a controllable answer quality optimizer. Experimental results demonstrate that our optimizer achieves significant improvements across multiple metrics."

Traditional intrusion detection systems typically treat these domains separately, limiting their ability to detect complex, cross-domain threats. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of training a unified reinforcement learning agent that can simultaneously detect anomalies in both domains. Using the publicly available Water Distribution Testbed (WDT) dataset, we evaluate and compare the performance of three Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algo-rithms-Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C), Dueling Deep Q-Network (Dueling DQN), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Our experiments demonstrate that Dueling DQN consistently achieves the highest reward and fastest convergence in both single-domain settings. We then develop a domainaware dual-branch Dueling DQN agent, which achieves a rolling reward of 161.99 on the unified dataset-surpassing the physicalonly model and approaching the network-only baseline. These results suggest that a shared DRL policy can generalize across domains while reducing deployment complexity in CPS security applications."

    "abstract": "Sustainable development addresses many issues within a fragmented system and promotes social value generated by activities linked to the social entrepreneurship system. Although the potential for social entrepreneurship to support inclusive growth is well recognized, very few statistically based models exist to measure its effects or guide interventions. Specifically, there are no methods for policymakers or practitioners to empirically and systematically determine how drivers such as innovation, funding, regulation, or community engagement influence sustainability outcomes in a scientific manner. This study aims to bridge that gap by developing a comprehensive analytical framework for quantitatively assessing and optimizing the role of social entrepreneurship in sustainable development. The model includes four key sustainability factors: Innovation Level (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{x}_{1}$</tex>), Community Participation (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{x}_{2}$</tex>), Funding Availability (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{x}_{3}$</tex>), and Political Support (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{x}_{4}$</tex>), which are believed to influence sustainability collectively.

By combining machine learning with metadata fingerprinting and encrypted traffic analysis, the system can identify and classify threats even when payloads are hidden. This approach emphasizes the importance of transparency and accountability by utilizing role-based access control, semantic policy enforcement, and justification-related logging. Precisely Guided Signature Matching (PGSM and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) are employed by the system to minimize unnecessary data exposure while maintaining high throughput and detection precision. The balance between real-time monitoring, scalable rule enforcement and compliance with legal and ethical principles is achieved through this architecture, which stands in contrast to traditional DPI approaches that prioritize visibility over privacy."

    "abstract": "Generating adversarial examples (AEs) can be formulated as an optimization problem. Among various optimization-based attacks, the gradient-based PGD and the momentum-based MI-FGSM have garnered considerable interest. However, all these attacks use the sign function to scale their perturbations, which raises several theoretical concerns from the point of view of optimization. In this paper, we first reveal that PGD is actually a specific reformulation of the projected gradient method using only the current gradient to determine its step-size. Further, we show that when we utilize a conventional adaptive matrix with the accumulated gradients to scale the perturbation, PGD becomes AdaGrad. Motivated by this analysis, we present a novel momentum-based attack AdaMI, in which the perturbation is optimized with an interesting momentum-based adaptive matrix. AdaMI is proved to attain optimal convergence for convex problems, indicating that it addresses the non-convergence issue of MI-FGSM, thereby ensuring stability of the optimization process. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed momentum-based adaptive matrix can serve as a general and effective technique to boost adversarial transferability over the state-of-the-art methods across different networks while maintaining better stability and imperceptibility."

    "abstract": "The Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) is one of the most challenging factors in remote sensing, significantly influencing spectral measurements. Accurate BRDF measurement is crucial for understanding and correcting its impact on spectral data. However, existing approaches require specialized equipment and precise measurement setups, typically capturing data from a single point on an object’s surface. Meanwhile, advances in sensor technology have led to the development of compact and user-friendly spectral cameras, thereby reducing operational complexity. Leveraging these advancements, we propose a novel, modular framework for image-based BRDF measurement that does not require specialized instruments, such as a gonioreflectometer. Our approach begins with acquiring freehand, multiview overlapping images of materials from unknown positions on a hemisphere. We then apply computer vision techniques to estimate camera locations, automatically extract tie points between overlapping images, and establish image connectivity. This connectivity enables automatic tracking of Regions of Interest (ROIs), reflectance measurement across multiple viewing directions, and BRDF characterization. We validated our methodology using a hyperspectral dataset. The results demonstrate its effectiveness in extracting camera positions with an error of less than two degrees compared to Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) drone measurements, tracking ROIs with millimeter accuracy, and accurately measuring the BRDF of various land-cover types. This framework offers a robust, flexible, and accessible alternative for BRDF measurement in remote sensing applications."

    "abstract": "Federated Semi-Supervised Learning (FSSL) aims to learn a global model from different clients in an environment with both labeled and unlabeled data. Most of the existing FSSL work generally assumes that both types of data are available on each client. In this paper, we study a more general problem setup of FSSL with annotation heterogeneity, where each client can hold an arbitrary percentage (0%-100%) of labeled data. To this end, we propose a novel FSSL framework called Heterogeneously Annotated Semi-Supervised LEarning (HASSLE). Specifically, it employs a dual-model approach. Two models with the same architecture are trained separately: one uses labeled data only, and the other uses unlabeled data. This design enables the framework to be applied to clients with arbitrary labeling percentages. Furthermore, a mutual learning strategy called Supervised-Unsupervised Mutual Alignment (SUMA) is proposed for the dual models with global residual alignment and model proximity alignment. Subsequently, the dual models can implicitly learn from both types of data across different clients, although each dual model is only trained locally on a single type of data. Experiments verify that the dual models in HASSLE learned by SUMA can mutually learn from each other, thereby effectively utilizing the information of both types of data across different clients.

    "abstract": "At complex intersections, it has become a consensus to address the perception limitations (such as blind spots, the difficulty of accurately obtaining road condition information in distant areas or under adverse weather conditions) faced by single-vehicle intelligence through vehicle-infrastructure cooperation. However, under the constraints of limited spectrum resources, the sharply rising in the number of connected vehicles, and the pressing requirement for effective utilization of electric power, there has been no study on how to design a scheme that assists roadside unit (RSU) completing roadside cooperative message delivery (RCMD) with minimal transmit power. Towards this end, this paper proposes a general and energy-efficient RCMD scheme based on multicarrier multigroup multicasting rate-splitting multiple access. We formulate a joint optimization problem involving the RSU’s transmit power, along with the power and size coefficients of each message. Then we design a deep reinforcement learning-assisted bilevel resource allocation algorithm to solve this problem. Finally, we collect extensive numerical results, using the message delivery success probability and RSU’s transmit power as performance metrics, from the proposed scheme and multiple benchmarks. Results indicate that the proposed scheme not only exhibits strong adaptability (i.e., it can be deployed at any intersection regardless of the number of lanes, vehicles, or traffic complexity), but also significantly reduces the RSU’s transmit power while maintaining high message delivery success probability."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the thermal performance of some stator-mounted permanent magnet (PM) machines under forced liquid cooling. For reference, a conventional surface-mounted PM (SPM) machine is also analyzed. Three typical stator-mounted topologies are considered: the doubly salient PM (DSPM), flux reversal PM (FRPM), and flux switching PM (FSPM) machines. Initial evaluation with a water-jacket system demonstrates that stator-mounted machines achieve lower magnet temperatures than the rotor-mounted SPM machine. The extended modular FSPM machine further benefits from the flux gaps between the stator segments, which enhance heat dissipation and make it especially effective for liquid cooling. Several advanced cooling strategies are then proposed, showing improved performance compared with the standard water-jacket due to increased contact area. Moreover, the modular FSPM design enables semi-flooded cooling by utilizing the flux gaps between stator segments as cooling channels. Under this approach, water is shown to be significantly more effective than oil as a coolant. The results also indicate that the optimal flux gap width for maximum cooling performance depends on both coolant properties and inlet conditions."

The GaN-on-diamond HEMTs are fabricated using transfer process, and the DC I-V characteristics are measured and analyzed at different temperatures. The measured results show that a dV<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sub>/dT of -0.2 mV/K can be achieved. To provide physical insight, Raman spectroscopy measurements are employed, showing that elevated temperatures induce tensile stress in the GaN channel layer due to the thermal lattice mismatch between GaN and diamond. This thermal stress modulates the piezoelectric polarization, thereby influencing the threshold voltage. Based on these findings, a threshold voltage model accounting for thermal stress is proposed. Validation of the model demonstrates its accuracy in characterizing both the threshold voltage and DC-IV characteristics across varying temperatures. These findings will be useful for high temperature GaN electronics."

    "abstract": "Having a flat device-solution interface is crucial for nanophotonic biosensors to achieve stable and reproducible performance, by mitigating solid-liquid-gas interfacial processes at the nanometer scale. In this aspect, the metal-insulator-metal (MIM) film presents a capable solution, by hybridizing surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) and MIM gap plasmons, which is enabled by the latter's unique dispersion characteristic and wide tunability. In this meta-film, the SPPs propagate along a flat interface, and seal the gap plasmons which can be integrated with nanostructures, e.g., a coupling grating. In addition, by tuning the gap plasmons, the SPP-MIM hybridization meta-film can be designed to achieve a significantly reduced SPP evanescent depth and a significantly improved surface sensitivity. Using gold as the plasmonic material, such improvements are theoretically predicted across a broad spectral range, from visible to near infrared. Particularly, at 1550 nm, we show that a grating-coupled meta-film device is designed to have its evanescent depth shortened from 1.4 mm to 0.16 mm, with an enhancement factor of 5.6 in its surface sensitivity, as compared with traditional grating-coupled SPR. This unique characteristic of the SPP-MIM meta-film makes it an efficient combination of propagating SPR and LSPR, by simultaneously having a flat and simple biosensing interface, a short evanescent depth and a high surface sensitivity. It provides an inspiring approach for transforming various LSPR designs into stable biosensors."

    "abstract": "Distributed electric propulsion (DEP) technology has demonstrated significant potential due to its advantages in reducing carbon emissions, enhancing aerodynamic efficiency, and improving takeoff and landing performance. Moreover, DEP provides a hardware-level opportunity to integrate multiple propulsors into flight control, particularly for lateral-directional control. However, achieving this capability requires a multivariable optimal control approach to effectively coordinate both the propulsors and aerodynamic control surfaces. To address this challenge, this article proposes a model predictive control (MPC) scheme for lateral-directional control. Based on a linearized DEP flight dynamics model, the proposed MPC scheme enables dynamic optimal lateral-directional control for DEP aircraft. For the first time, the scheme has been implemented in both software and hardware using Jetson Orin and unmanned aerial vehicle (CUAV) autopilot running PX4 firmware. A DEP flight platform with eight electric propulsors, a wingspan of 1.8 m, and a cruise speed of 14 m/s is developed to integrate and validate the proposed control system. Flight tests demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only achieves dynamically optimal control but also satisfies real-time requirements."

Early detection of ASD is crucial to implement suitable treatments to improve the daily activities of people with ASD. This paper introduces a system for ASD detection using facial images. The proposed model presents a unique system inspired by Siamese networks. Unlike traditional Siamese networks focusing on input pairs, our model leverages architectural pairs for feature combinations. During training, we combine features learned from different or the same architectures. This enables information transfer and improves the model’s capture of comprehensive patterns. Experimental results on the 2940 facial images dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our system, which exhibits improved accuracy compared to using individual architectures. When (ResNet50, VGG16) architecture pairs are employed in the proposed approach, the highest performance is obtained with an accuracy of 78.57%. Leveraging the strengths of multiple architectures, our model provides a comprehensive and robust representation of input data, leading to improved performance."

    "abstract": "Objective: Recent neuroscientific research craves for understanding sophisticated brain networks formed by neuron ensembles across multiple regions. An ideal way to unveil the complex connectome is bidirectionally interacting (simultaneous recording and stimulation) with neurons at high spatiotemporal resolutions. Existing CMOS recording probes cannot provide micro-scale interactions with limited stimulation capability. Although optogenetics can achieve neuron-specific stimulation, conventional methods using optic fibers illuminate a large volume of tissue, resulting in unspecific perturbations. While our previous studies demonstrated micro-LED (μLED)-based optoelectrode for localized stimulation and recording, this work advances them into a fully integrated headstage combining the optoelectrode, CMOS IC, and flexible interposer for miniaturized implementation. The proposed system enables micro-scale interactions with high spatiotemporal precision through densely packed 256-neuron-size recording and 128-soma-size fiber-less opto-stimulation across multiple brain regions. Methods: Such high resolutions yet wide coverage is achieved by (1) advanced micromachining techniques integrating recording electrodes and μLEDs, (2) micro-second, independent 384-channel interaction via a low-power, area-efficient circuit, and (3) compact and reliable polyimide-cable-based hybrid assembly. Results: A compact (23.8×28.8 mm2) and lightweight (3.5-gram) headstage achieved the highest reported channel density in area (0.56 channels/mm2) and weight (109.71 channels/gram). A single acute in vivo experiment on a transgenic mouse identified >160 isolated pyramidal neurons and narrow/wide interneurons in the dorsal hippocampus, with local and broad-range effects from focal optogenetic stimulation. Conclusion and Significance: We implemented the hybrid integrated, large-scale opto-electrophysiology interface prototype and verified its feasibility in vivo, representing the first fully integrated platform extending our μLED-based probes into a complete system."

By separating the control plane from the data plane and centralizing network management through an SDN controller, this centralization introduces critical security threats to the control plane. Thus, this centralization inherently presents substantial security challenges to the control plane. This research systematically investigates security countermeasures for the SDN control plane through a thorough analysis of extant literature. We evaluated the merits of proposed techniques and delineate their limitations. Our methodology emphasized on two main approaches: (1) authentication/authorization and (2) secure communication. The strengths and weaknesses of the reviewed solutions are critically examined, and salient issues and challenges pertinent to these approaches are underscored. These include, but are not limited to, the paucity of real-world validation for proposed techniques, the imperative for robust strategies to secure multi-controller environments, and the necessity to accelerate transaction speeds through optimized blockchain protocols or alternative consensus models. Furthermore, this study delineates prospective research directions to foster advancements in SDN control plane security and assist researchers in discerning emergent areas within this domain."

    "abstract": "Core decomposition is a widely used hierarchical analysis algorithm for large-scale graphs. It achieves this decomposition by iteratively peeling the vertices along with their adjacency edges off into different hierarchies. With the timeliness requirements of modern applications, many researchers have introduced accelerators, particularly GPUs, to improve the computational efficiency of graph algorithms. However, the empty, sparse, and numerous hierarchies in large graphs lead to inefficient computation and parallelism, not only including unnecessary searching for the hierarchy’s vertices, but also significant thread wastage when peeling off the adjacency edges of these vertices. In this paper, we propose an adaptive parallel framework for core decomposition, named <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">AdaptiveCore</i>. First, it improves vertex searching efficiency by adaptively skipping the empty hierarchies and reducing the search space. Moreover, it greatly improves thread utilization by adaptively allocating the available threads to peel off the adjacency edges. Comprehensive experiments show that, compared with the state-of-the-art works, the proposed framework achieves an average speedup of 7.1× on the GPU platform and up to 2.0× on the multi-core CPU platform."

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence continues to play a pivotal role in reducing decision latency across resource-constrained environments such as operations, logistics, and service delivery. This paper introduces RAID (Rapid AI-Driven Decisions), an adaptive AI framework designed to support early-stage prioritization and filtering in structured decision workflows. The system was evaluated using 17,300 anonymized multivariate records from a publicly available dataset, analyzing combinations of categorical, numeric, and time-series inputs to generate preliminary outcome predictions. These predictions were benchmarked against historical labels and further reviewed for alignment with expert decision patterns. The model achieved an 82% agreement with expert logic, highlighting its potential to assist decision-makers in managing high-volume workflows efficiently. While initially tested in a triage-style scenario, RAID’s architecture is domain-agnostic and can be applied to environments such as inventory optimization, dispatch scheduling, or support ticket prioritization—any setting where intelligent filtering is essential to streamline operations."

Therefore, this paper investigated the ability of LoRa in assisting rapid interventions in real-time medical monitoring in critical cases like pulmonary edema, strokes, and heart attacks, where it is crucial to have early treatment. Known for having long-range and low-power capabilities, LoRa provides reliable and cost-effective solutions for transmitting health data, allowing for a convenient medical intervention. In this study, the major metrics of network performance are evaluated, which involve end-to-end delay, Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), Received Signal Strength indicator (RSSI), and packet collision rate in order to establish the efficiency of LoRa in dealing with critical medical cases. It was found that LoRa could facilitate real-time monitoring of patients in an appropriate latency, especially in short to medium-range placements. It shows that high PDR is present in close-range devices (≤200m), while low PDR is seen in long ranges beyond 800m, which makes them unreliable. In contrast, network congestion and increased distance of transmission could result in packet loss and higher delays, making it crucial to have strategies for optimizing the network, which may be achieved by implementing multi-gateway architectures and an adaptive spreading factor (SF). Finally, it could be concluded that medical monitoring systems based on LoRa could enhance medical interventions and save lives, which makes it earn a crucial role in the healthcare field."

It infers crossing intentions directly from short continuous video clips enriched with structured JAAD metadata. In contrast to GPT-4V-based methods that operate on discrete frames, BF-PIP processes uninterrupted temporal clips. It also incorporates bounding-box annotations and ego-vehicle speed via specialized multimodal prompts. Without any additional training, BF-PIP achieves 73% prediction accuracy, outperforming a GPT-4V baseline by 18%. These findings illustrate that combining temporal video inputs with contextual cues enhances spatiotemporal perception and improves intent inference under ambiguous conditions.

    "abstract": "Landfill leachate, a highly toxic liquid waste produced because of the degradation of municipal solid waste (MSW) and the ingestion of rainwater through waste layers, poses a significant environmental concern due to the presence of huge organic content, heavy metals, and other persistent contaminants. The nature and concentration of pollutants vary depending on landfill age, composition, and climatic factors. The larger the landfill age, the less will be the biodegradability of its organic content, and hence content shifts from easily degradable compounds to more recalcitrant substances, including humic and fulvic acids. Conventional leachate treatment method such as biological treatment and physicochemical techniques often possesses drawbacks of aged leachate, particularly in removing recalcitrant contaminants and achieving significant reductions in COD and ammonia levels. Hence, a multi-stage treatment approach is required to meet environmental standards. Electrochemical Oxidation (EO) is a viable approach of advanced oxidation process for leachate treatment since it fully degrades the organic content even if it is recalcitrant in nature, operating without any chemical transport, and with almost negligible sludge generation. EO is highly efficient in removing complex organics and ammonium nitrogen, especially in old leachate. This technology aligns with global sustainability goals and offers a pathway for developing compact, efficient treatment systems for challenging wastewater streams. The paper also discusses the integration of EO with biological systems and renewable energy sources (RES) to improve energy efficiency, reduce carbon footprint, and enable decentralized leachate treatment in smart cities and sustainable waste facilities."

To provide instant classroom feedback, this paper introduces a novel framework of AI Enhanced Learning Environment that uses real time emotion recognition. Unlike traditional systems who rely solely on the academic performance metrics, we leverage on facial expression and behavioral cues for assessing the emotional state of students such as confusion, boredom or engagement during the lesson time. The main contribution is the implementation of a continuous feedback loop of real time emotion detection and design of adaptive instructional strategies. A convolutional neural network and long short-term memory architecture is used to process the multimodal input to classify emotions very accurately. Based on these insights, we visualize the dynamic dashboard where the educators can change the pace of teaching and the content delivery, as well as the way of interaction with students according to the affective feedback. Passive classrooms can become emotion responding classrooms through this emotion aware mechanism thereby adding inclusivity and increasing in real time student comprehension. In addition, the deployment takes into consideration privacy preserving modules and ethical protocols for safe deployment. By design of an emotion intelligent education system, this integrates affective computing into the pedagogical design and by doing so it shows a pioneering approach towards emotion intelligent education systems where student centered learning is enhanced with Artificial Intelligence."

    "abstract": "Acquiring perfect channel state information (CSI) introduces substantial challenges in cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) systems, primarily due to the large dimensionality of channel parameters, especially under ultra-reliable low-latency communication (uRLLC) constraints. Furthermore, the impact of imperfect CSI on the average achievable rate within the finite blocklength regime remains largely unexplored. Motivated by this gap, this paper proposes a novel analytical framework that provides a closed-form expression for the average achievable rate with imperfect CSI in the Laplace domain. We demonstrate analytically that both the channel dispersion and the expected channel capacity can be expressed explicitly in terms of the Laplace transform of the large-scale fading component. Numerical simulations confirm that the derived expressions match closely with Monte Carlo simulations, verifying their accuracy. Furthermore, we theoretically show that although imperfect CSI degrades performance in the finite blocklength regime, the inherent characteristics of CF-mMIMO architecture effectively mitigates this loss."

    "abstract": "The Voltage Source Converter is a popular power electronic conversion topology, and an enabling technology in renewable energy applications. The converter is typically coupled with some form of AC filter to attenuate switching harmonics, the most common topologies being LC and LCL filters. Typical filter design techniques require estimation of the switching inductor current ripple, which is also the base for estimating the current ripple on the filter capacitor. This paper introduces a technique for estimating the current ripple by averaging the instantaneous ripple, allowing the extension of known DC-DC conversion equations to PWM converters processing AC voltages. The proposed approach simplifies the ripple current estimation and may be extended to multi-level conversion topologies. The technique is validated via simulation, and experimentally on three-level Neutral Point Clamped converters."

The developed system presents a deep learning model trained on the EfficientNetV2B1 architecture using a dataset consisting of synthetic and real images, and the test accuracy of the model has reached $97 \\%$. In addition, forest fire statistics in Turkey and Europe were analyzed comparatively, and it was emphasized that Turkey is in a better situation compared to countries such as Spain, Italy and Greece in terms of burned area per fire, but the critical importance of protecting the existing limited forest assets is emphasized due to the low ratio of forest assets to the country’s surface area. The study shows that this AI-based early warning system can make an important contribution to the fight against fires and statistically deals with land use changes after forest fires, revealing the transformation trends to agriculture and settlements, especially after large fires."

    "abstract": "Conventional traffic light systems, which run at set intervals without adjusting to actual road conditions, are the cause of the ongoing problem of traffic congestion at metropolitan junctions. This inefficiency leads to needless delays, higher fuel use, and higher emissions, all of which worsen environmental and economic issues. In this study, we offer a Dynamic Traffic Light System (DTLS) powered by YOLO (You Only Look Once), an advanced object detection system, to enable real-time, vision-based traffic control. The system records live traffic footage from strategically placed cameras, dynamically adjusts signal timings based on vehicle density, and detects and counts vehicles at intersections. Nearby intersections also convey traffic conditions to prioritize high-traffic locations, such as emergency routes near schools and hospitals. To foresee congestion patterns and proactively optimize traffic signal modifications, the model integrates predictive analytics with historical traffic data. This improves traffic flow, decreases wait times, and increases urban mobility. The system is a practical and sustainable option for smart city applications due to its modular and scalable architecture, which facilitates easy integration into current urban infrastructure."

In remote patient monitoring, ANFIS can play a crucial role in providing timely and accurate clinical support. Existing methods often struggle with real-time analysis, low interpretability, and limited adaptability to dynamic physiological changes, resulting in delayed or inaccurate diagnoses. To address these challenges, a novel ANFIS-Based Hybrid Decision Support System (ANFIS-BHDSS) is proposed, which integrates wearable IoT sensor data with ANFIS for continuous, adaptive, and explainable clinical decision-making. The proposed system monitors vital signs, including heart rate, temperature, and blood pressure. It infers risk levels for critical conditions, including sepsis, enabling early intervention through automated alerts and recommendations. This approach enhances the accuracy and reliability of decision support in remote settings while maintaining transparency for clinical validation. Experimental results demonstrate improved performance in detecting early warning signs with higher sensitivity and specificity compared to traditional models. The proposed method proves effective in enhancing patient safety, reducing hospitalization rates, and supporting healthcare providers in making proactive clinical decisions."

The proposed approach leverages a planar antenna array to construct a dedicated system model for near-field terahertz MISO communications. By combining Orthogonal Approximate Message Passing (OAMP) with Spatially-Adaptive Feature Modulation (SAFM), we develop a trainable network architecture tailored for terahertz near-field MISO systems. The algorithm not only ensures convergence in linear estimation but also enhances noise reduction through fixed-point iteration while exploiting non-local feature dependencies, thereby improving detection accuracy. Compared to standalone SAM or OAMP, the proposed SAM-OAMP demonstrates superior detection performance under identical experimental conditions. Experimental results indicate that the bit error rate (BER) and mean square error (MSE) of the enhanced approximate message passing algorithm decrease progressively with increasing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), leading to a significant improvement in overall system performance."

    "abstract": "Forecasting the risks associated with life insurance is crucial for the effective design of underwriting frameworks, the construction of models for pricing, and formulating corporate policies pertaining to investments. Governance policies on risk within the insurance sector and, more broadly, insurance policies themselves require accurate life insurance risk forecasting. The traditional actuarial techniques for forecasting life insurance risks have become obsolete due to the vast amounts of insurance data available today. This research makes use of the more advanced techniques of predictive analytics, specifically deep learning, and provides an explanation for how these techniques improve the risk assessments within life insurance. The proposed model leverages a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) design to differentiate complex data structure involving demographics, clinical, and behavioral data to assess risks accurately, a step other approaches have failed to achieve. The sequential design of the data preparation and the subsequent feature construction techniques ensures the model can operate reliably and maintain functional accuracy. The problem with the lack of explanation of predictive outcomes within deep learning is addressed within the research by incorporating exAI techniques. The research demonstrates the positive influence of deep learning on the underwriting analytics of life insurance making it more advanced. This is likely to improve the underwriting practices of life insurance by making risk a more equitable and science-based approach."

    "abstract": "Optimal traffic flow in cities worldwide is largely achieved through regulating traffic lights. Much study has gone into figuring out the best way to time signals. Optimization models that construct the signal plan using fixed parameters form the basis of most of these studies. Reinforcement learning (RL), a model-free alternative to traditional approaches, can sidestep these problems. This alternate can figure out the best control approach by experimenting. The scale learning capabilities of deep neural networks have made deep RL approaches more appealing in recent years. The reason for this is the difficulty of dealing with actual traffic situations. By adjusting the timing of lights in response to actual traffic conditions, intelligent traffic signal controllers have effectively decreased gridlock. The paper proposed Adaptive DQN for optimized traffic flow (ADQN-Opti Traffic flow), a subset of Deep Q-Networks that allows for real-time adaptation of signal timings to current traffic circumstances. ADQN-Opti Traffic flow improves traffic flow and decreases congestion by using RL and modeling traffic signal control as a Markov decision process(MDP) to reduce the vehicle wait time. By analyzing data collected from cameras, sensors, and networked vehicles, the model can make judgments that adapt to its current environment. ADQN-Opti Traffic flow utilizes a deep neural network to learn the appropriate transition between signal phases. Recalling past occurrences and computing Q-values allow us to do this. The deep actor-critic methodology outperforms other deep reinforcement learning methods and the conventional model-based approach on several criteria, as shown in simulated experiments."

Three techniques through which security is provided, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Hash-Based Message Authentication (H-MAC) and Enhanced Least Significant Bit (LSB). So the combination of encryption and steganography will provide most effective solution to concealment for secure the information. The LSB method uses least significant bits of pixel value, and these pixel values of image are substituted with concealed message. This is chosen for its simplicity and minimal impact on image quality. The image is used as base for embedding the message and carrier for concealed data. Hidden message is encrypted using AES algorithm before embedding after successfully transfers image seamlessly decrypt the message for authorized parties.

The ABR protocol achieves 0.49 packets/sec throughput with 1.01s latency and produces 0.272242 PER which demonstrates strong error correction capabilities. The security system uses 512-bit RSA encryption with automatic key distribution which increases energy consumption by 12 % from the base 9.38 J value. The combination of adaptive routing with a 15 -second update interval and lightweight cryptography ensures dependable operation in resource-limited environments by increasing PDR by 27 % compared to standard protocols while securing data from end to end.

In addition, the neck is redesigned with C3_ScConv to strengthen lesion feature extraction, suppress redundant/duplicate gradients, and improve sensitivity to small objects. Experimental results demonstrate that the improved YOLOv5-CSA achieves an mAP@50 of 92% and a recall of 98.0%, representing gains of 2.8% and 1.0% over the baseline YOLOv5, respectively."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a hill-climbing method to improve the performance of searching for the maximum power point (MPP) in a capacitor-directly-connected photovoltaic (PV) system, in which an additional capacitor is directly connected between a PV module and a power converter. The PV system improves PV output electrical energy by discharging the additional capacitor and compensating for the insufficient power required for the power converter to operate when solar irradiance decreases. However, the additional capacitor reduces the variation speed of the PV operating point. The difference in PV output power due to fluctuations in solar irradiance is relatively larger compared to that due to variations in the PV operating point. Therefore, the conventional hill-climbing method fails to search for the maximum power point (MPP) when solar irradiance fluctuates. The proposed hill-climbing method creates reference values based only on difference in PV output power due to the variations in the PV operating point and the PV operating point achieves tracking to the MPP. The simulation and experimental results show the proposed hill-climbing method improves PV output electrical energy of the capacitor-directly-connected PV system by $10.6 \\%$ on a sunny day and by $13.7 \\%$ under gradually increasing solar irradiance compared to the conventional hillclimbing method."

Leveraging fine-tuned language models and mixed-format service datasets—including structured metadata, unstructured issue descriptions, and semi-structured attachments—the system was evaluated across citizen services, infrastructure support, and municipal IT operations. The model consistently achieved classification accuracies of up to 97.1%, with F1-scores reaching 0.94 and interpretability scores as high as 0.94. Compared to rule-based or unimodal models, the proposed architecture reduced misclassification rates by over 25% and enhanced decision transparency through SHAP-based interpretability and attention weight visualization. The integration of contextual language representations, service-specific structured features, and semantic label hierarchies enabled robust triage, top-k intent prediction, and real-time service routing. Despite deep architectural complexity, the model maintained sub-2.5 second training cycles, validating its deployment feasibility across large-scale public ITSM infrastructures. The architecture is platform-agnostic and adaptable to evolving service taxonomies without requiring structural reengineering."

This research examines how machine learning and deep learning enhance healthcare by facilitating more accurate disease detection and creating personalized treatment plans for individual patients. AI systems process mixed health information from hospital records, medical test results, and patient DNA data to identify diseases earlier and develop more effective treatment plans. The analysis checks the performance of logistic regression-supported vector machines SVMs, as well as random forests and powerful deep learning CNN-RNN systems. Deep learning technologies surpassed ordinary methods in disease detection by producing a test accuracy of 94.8%. Artificial intelligence systems minimize treatment failures while increasing treatment success for different medical conditions by 14% and 16%. Natural barriers like heavy computing power demands and biased programs need fixing before medical use can become the normal practice. This research shows that AI can improve personalized medicine but demands fairness enhancements to make healthcare equally available to all patients. New research needs to update AI systems using real-patient health records to help doctors make better medical choices and achieve better results for their patients."

    "abstract": "With the growing penetration of renewable energy sources in modern power systems, the demand for advanced stability enhancement techniques has become increasingly critical. The Power System Stabilizer (PSS) plays a pivotal role in improving system stability, thus emphasizing the importance of developing methods to further enhance PSS performance. In this study, the IEEE 9-bus system was modified to better reflect the complexity of actual power systems by integrating a fourth generating unit connected via a transformer to bus seven, along with the addition of a solar power plant. Since each generating unit exhibits unique dynamic characteristics, their individual responses to disturbances can lead to complex interactions that pose significant challenges to overall system stability. To address this, the study proposes a novel hybrid tuning approach that combines the Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the Integral Absolute Error (IAE) criterion to optimize PSS parameters, thereby maximizing the damping of system oscillations. The proposed tuning method achieved a 7.3% reduction in IAE over the conventional method and a 26% improvement compared to the system without PSS, demonstrating superior damping performance."

Employing wearable IoT sensors, local edge processing, and AI-based predictive analytics on patient data is beneficial since it leads to timely responses and advancement in clinical procedures. Some of the parameters include the heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation rate, and respiratory rate, against which the system can check for abnormalities instantly. By so doing, the system takes preventive measures in dangerous scenarios like cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, and others that would have occurred or are about to occur, by giving early alerts to the concerned health professional if they are likely to happen. This cuts down on time use in intervention, especially in developing world scenarios where interventions may be needed for conditions such as famine or other epidemic-like situations. The Edge AI system has advantages such as low latency levels, data protection, low power consumption, and an organizational structure to counter the issues of network volatility and reliance on the cloud. Therefore, the implementation of the proposed system with the AI algorithms at the edge level means better patient outcomes, early detection, fewer mortalities, and optimal utilization of resources. The effectiveness of the method in real-time prediction and decision-making in emergency care delivery sheds light on the possibility of using the methodology to introduce social change in the dispensation of quality health care."

Early detection is critical for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. This study investigates the application of various machine learning models for cirrhosis prediction, including Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and a hybrid CNN-Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model. To address the gender imbalance in the dataset-where male samples outnumber female-synthetic data generation techniques are applied, with a focus on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGAN). Two hybrid balancing approaches are also explored: one combining CTGAN with Edited Nearest Neighbors (ENN) and the other with the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). This paper introduces a novel generative framework, the Transformer-Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (TransCTGAN), which incorporates Transformer-based selfattention layers into both the generator and discriminator of the CTGAN architecture. The effectiveness of synthetic data is assessed through model performance improvements after dataset balancing. Our results demonstrate that CTGAN-based augmentation significantly boosts predictive accuracy, showing the potential of synthetic data in enhancing machine learning models. While not all models show marked improvement, the approach effectively mitigates class imbalance without introducing bias toward the male-dominated class."

A water ejector is employed to maintain vacuum conditions passively, eliminating the need for mechanical vacuum pumps. The multi-stage configuration enables thermal energy recovery between stages, significantly enhancing system efficiency. Parametric Analysis revealed that increasing the feed temperature from $40^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ to $80^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ raised water productivity from $13 \\mathrm{~kg} /$ day to $60 \\mathrm{~kg} /$ day, a $362 \\%$ improvement, while the Unit Production Cost (UPC) dropped from $47 \\mathrm{~S} / \\mathrm{m}^3$ to $9 {\\$} / \\mathrm{m}^3$ (an $80.9 \\%$ reduction). Additionally, vapor flux increased from approximately $40 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{m}^2 . \\mathrm{h}$ to $181 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{m}^2 . \\mathrm{h}$ under optimal conditions, and permeate pressure was reduced to below 5 kPa with increased pump flow rates.

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of multimedia technologies and mobile devices has led to expanding digital video formats, enabling dynamic communication and immersive entertainment experiences. However, this digital convenience has also facilitated manipulating video content for fraudulent and unethical purposes, posing significant threats to information integrity and public trust. Video forensics has become increasingly critical, with authenticity detection at the forefront of ensuring multimedia credibility. However, the existing tampering detection methods often suffer from limited feature extraction capabilities and insufficient detection accuracy. This paper proposes an integrated video authentication framework combining three complementary techniques: file signature verification, metadata analysis, and quantization-based deep learning recognition to detect video forgery robustly. The ensemble-based framework improves accuracy, generalizability, and resistance to manipulation across diverse scenarios. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed deep learning quantization model achieved an accuracy of 95% on the VISION dataset and 71% on the CSM dataset. Furthermore, when integrated with metadata and file signature verification, the combined framework significantly outperforms individual methods in detecting tampered videos. The results highlight the effectiveness of a multi-layered approach to video forensics. Future improvements, such as incorporating more diverse datasets and enhancing fusion algorithms, are expected to further advance the reliability of video authentication systems, supporting critical applications in digital forensics, media verification, and judicial evidence validation."

This study presents a practical paradigm for speech synthesis from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals using machine learning techniques, focusing on inner speech classification. Inner speech is well suited for real-life applications, aligning naturally with the cognitive process of LIS patients while expressing themselves without additional effort or cues. EEG data were collected corresponding to six critical words, “help,” “pain,” “no,” “yes,” “up,” and “down” as participants focused on the meaning and connotation of these words without vocalization. The raw EEG signals were subjected to Band-pass and Band-stop filtering, followed by Wavelet transform for frequency domain analysis. Processed data were fed into a diverse set of models, including Random Rorest, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and a tuned Support Vector Machine (SVM), representing ensemble, neural, and kernel-based approaches. This study shows that XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy (93%) in the 3-word classification task, while LightGBM performed best in the 6-word task (87%), with both models achieving competitive results relative to the literature. This paper dives further into the techniques used in data collection, processing, and classification. The results of this study highlight the potential for real-time, noninvasive communication systems for LIS patients, paving way for brain-computer interface solutions that restore a fundamental human need: the ability to express thought."

    "abstract": "Edge detection is a fundamental task in image processing, essential for object recognition and structural analysis. The Sobel operator is popular for its simplicity and hardware efficiency but suffers from noise sensitivity, thick edges, and fixed thresholding limitations. To address these, this paper proposes a high-performance FPGA-based edge detection system comprising three variants. The first is a baseline Sobel implementation using standard <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$3 \\times 3$</tex> kernels. The second is a Modified Sobel method incorporating tuned kernels, Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), and Adaptive Thresholding to improve edge sharpness and noise resilience. The third leverages Winograd Minimal Filtering to reduce multiplications and optimize resource usage. All designs are implemented in Verilog and synthesized on a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA using Vivado. The architectures are designed to process streaming image data efficiently using line buffers, pipelined convolution units, and resource-aware logic. Image outputs are evaluated using visual clarity, while hardware utilization is analyzed using LUT, BRAM, and DSP reports. The Modified Sobel shows superior edge continuity, especially in low-contrast areas, while the Winograd-based method significantly reduces DSP usage and latency. Overall, the results indicate that both enhanced approaches outperform the traditional Sobel in edge precision and hardware scalability, making them well-suited for deployment in embedded vision pipelines, surveillance, and realtime robotic systems."

Using a standard webcam and lightweight Python-based modules, the system detects live user faces, verifies them via CNN-encoded embedding, and enables secure PIN/password entry through intentional blink duration interpreted as Morse code symbols. A fallback mechanism using keyword verification and Morse-based password reset further enhances usability and resilience. The proposed solution operates offline using local encrypted storage (SQLite), requires minimal hardware, and provides real-time visual feedback via GUI. This work extends prior research on resistive Morse systems by introducing a complete, low-cost, end-to-end biometric authentication model with practical applications in banking, health care, and secure terminals."

    "abstract": "In response to the challenges in the Engineering Change Management of complex products represented by commercial aircraft, such as the difficulty in identifying the scope of influence, fragmented decision-making basis, and low reuse rate of historical experience, this paper proposes an intelligent decision-making method based on a dynamic multi-layer knowledge graph. Firstly, a three-level knowledge architecture is constructed: the data structure layer precisely models the assembly relationship of components and document dependencies to achieve the automatic parsing of change propagation paths; the attribute association layer integrates dynamic attributes such as supply chain status, inventory fluctuations, and the validity period of regulations; The decision semantic layer facilitates explainable reasoning by identifying critical elements related to engineering changes, leveraging the relational network of historical problems, corresponding solutions, and their associated impacts. Based on this architecture, a change decision-making model is developed, introducing a mixed coefficient to balance expert experience and data patterns, and combining the dynamic threshold of historical case statistics to output graded decision-making suggestions. In the verification of a commercial aircraft Flight Control system change case, this method improves the accuracy of impact analysis and the efficiency of obtaining decision-making basis. It is verified that this method effectively breaks through the limitations of cross-domain data silos, providing decision support covering the necessity judgment for engineering changes, and has theoretical value and engineering practical significance for the change management of intelligent manufacturing systems."

    "abstract": "The development of Industry 4.0 has made industrial automation more complex, especially in integrating PLCs from different vendors due to differences in architecture, programming software, and communication protocols. This study addresses that challenge by designing and implementing a real-time, two-way communication system between Schneider Modicon TM221 and Siemens SIMATIC S7-1200 PLCs using the open Modbus TCP/IP protocol. The system was tested in a laboratory through several scenarios, such as data exchange, time synchronization, network interruptions, and device restarts. Test results showed 100% accuracy in data transmission and synchronization delays between 2 and 18 milliseconds—well within the limits for real-time applications. The system also recovered automatically from disruptions within 2 to 18 seconds, depending on the type of disturbance, with most scenarios showing no data loss. These findings demonstrate that Modbus TCP/IP is a reliable solution for integrating PLCs across different platforms, allowing smooth communication and coordination. The proposed system is practical, scalable, and suitable for industrial settings that require high interoperability, reliability, and minimal downtime."

    "abstract": "Weather radar is an effective means for large-scale monitoring of airborne animals. However, both ground clutter and meteorological echoes can interfere with biological echoes, affecting the quality of monitoring data. Current frequency-domain filtering methods can only suppress ground clutter, and clutter suppression techniques based on spectral polarization can suppress both ground clutter and moving non-weather targets, but neither of these can meet the requirements for biological monitoring. To enhance the quality of biological data, this study proposes the clutter suppression method based on spatial polarimetric spectral characteristics of airborne animals for biological monitoring. For ground clutter, based on the value jumps of the spectral polarimetric observables, the clutter range in the Doppler spectrum is determined, and the clutter is suppressed. For meteorological echoes, based on the continuity differences in spectral polarimetric observables, weather suppression is achieved by using the statistical differences of the observables obtained by using a sliding window in the range-Doppler spectrogram. The results indicate that the quality of biological data has been improved after applying the proposed method to radar data collected by operational S-band weather radar. Compared to other methods, the proposed method demonstrates the best performance in suppressing non-biological clutter while preserving airborne animals."

Recently, a diverse range of Arabic-centric LLMs has emerged, and with them, a variety of evaluation suites, designed to assess the alignment of LLMs with the values and preferences of Arabic speakers and address their capabilities on instruction following, open-ended question answering, and information delivery. However, the majority of these suites rely exclusively on multiple-choice questions and, thereby, fail to adequately assess the text generation capabilities of LLMs. To address this shortcoming, we propose a new automated evaluation benchmark, CamelEval. CamelEval comprises three test suites to evaluate general instruction following, factuality, and cultural alignment. Each test suite contains 805 carefully curated challenging test cases that reflect the nuances of Arabic language and culture. We envision CamelEval as a tool to guide the development of future Arabic LLMs, serving over 400 million Arabic speakers by providing LLMs that not only communicate in their language but also understand their culture."

    "abstract": "Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) allow to implement linear operations directly in the light domain, taking advantage of the extended bandwidth, low losses and minimal cross-talk associated with optical communication. These architectures benefit from the addition of dedicated electronics that enable run-time programmability, as well as closed-loop stabilization of the working point against drifts and turbulence. This work addresses the issue of the scalability, in terms of area and power consumption, of the electronic control layer, by proposing an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designed for real-time reconfiguration of programmable optical processors. The CMOS controller features 8 independent channels, each one closing a feedback control loop around an integrated photonic interferometric device. In the experiments, a pair of ASICs was connected to a 16-channel binary mesh consisting of 15 Mach-Zehnder Interferometers fabricated in a commercial Silicon Photonics platform. The resulting electronic-photonic chiplet-like system successfully established reliable free-space optical (FSO) links up to 50 Gbit/s, compensating the effect of simulated atmospheric turbulence. The inherent ability of the ASIC to drive each photonic device independently, though, makes it suitable also for applications beyond sheer working point stabilization, whenever a full reconfiguration of the PIC is needed, achieving sub-10 ms settling time when starting from a random working point. The proposed integrated design thus paves the way for the definition of compact and seamlessly scalable electronic controllers for programmable PICs."

    "abstract": "With the large-scale deployment of IPv6, it is becoming more and more important to probe active IPv6 addresses on the global Internet. However, the vast address space and the random distribution of active addresses make the probing process full of challenges, especially for the probing of IPv6 prefixes without seed addresses. Furthermore, the widespread existence of IPv6 aliased prefixes also causes significant trouble for probing. In this paper, we present <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">AddrProbe</i>, an active IPv6 address probing system, which dynamically probes all global routing prefixes based on learned fine-grained address patterns from limited seed addresses and quickly detects aliased prefixes during probing.

This article presents a comprehensive quantum strategy that reframes network administration as an assignment optimization paradigm, unifying multiple objectives and resource-utilization constraints. Unlike existing quantum approaches focused on discrete quantities, the proposed framework directly incorporates continuous- valued physical parameters into quantum computing parallelism, thereby enhancing adaptability and scalability for real-world network functions. Proof-of-concept quantum implementations demonstrate their potentials in key application domains, such as access control and resource management. Further discussion explores emerging research challenges and offers insights into structural design of quantum-assisted internet infrastructures."

    "abstract": "Accurate modeling of Internet topologies is crucial for evaluating communication protocols and traffic control strategies. However, existing topology generators often rely on rigid, structure-oriented assumptions - such as scale-free models - and fail to capture key structural properties, including betweenness centrality, clustering, and assortativity. Moreover, most current tools offer limited usability and adaptability, with outdated implementations and minimal user interfaces. In this article, we present a novel software tool, Generator of Internet Autonomous Systems Topology (Gen-AS), which implements the Deep-generative graphs for the Internet (DGGI) model - a datadriven generator for Autonomous System (AS) graphs. DGGI learns topological patterns directly from data using deep learning, enabling it to replicate complex network properties without relying on predefined structural assumptions. Designed to be flexible and user-friendly, Gen- AS features a Command Line Interface (CLI) and a Graphic User Interface (GUI), making it accessible to a wide range of users. Experimental evaluations show that Gen-AS significantly outperforms existing topology generators, achieving average improvements of 93.22% in assortativity, 94.43% in betweenness centrality, 98.87% in clustering, and 95.09% in node degree distributions. These results, measured using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metric, highlight Gen-AS's effectiveness in producing realistic Internet topologies."

First, the spatial harmonic magnetic field-circuit coupling model is applied for analyzing the current PWM harmonics, and based on which the losses can be predicted by using finite element (FE). Then, the lumped parameter thermal model (LPTM) of the flat wire PM machine is established to predict the temperature rise of the machine under sinusoidal and PWM excitation, respectively, with two cooling conditions, including natural cooling and oil cooling being considered. The proposed methodology can achieve an accurate temperature prediction for the PWM-fed flat wire PM machine, and the absolute error of temperature prediction is <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\boldsymbol{&lt;4.5} \\boldsymbol{{}^{\\circ}}$</tex-math></inline-formula>C for both natural cooling and oil cooling conditions. It is found that the additional loss caused by PWM excitation has a stronger impact on the temperature rise on the machine under natural cooling than that under oil cooling, due to the better thermal dissipation capability of the latter one. Experiments are conducted to validate the improved prediction accuracy considering PWM excitation."

This requires three nominal parameters of the servo drive model. The main contributions are threefold: 1) the OR-based model-independent speed observer diagonalizes the estimation error dynamics with a low-pass filter as a subsystem; 2) the variable bandwidth mechanism in an analytic rule continuously updates the feedback gain, while limiting it to a feasible region; and 3) the OR-based PI-type speed controller drives the speed error to zero exponentially, ensuring the desired critically damped input–output behavior.

    "abstract": "In Open-Set Single Domain Generalization (OS-SDG), one only has access to a single labeled source domain for training. It assumes that the learned model generalizes well to target samples belonging to the source label space whilst classifies target samples outside the source label space into a single “unknown” class. The current method synthesizes new samples that are semantically unrelated to known classes to simulate target unknown classes. This ignores that unknown classes actually may semantically correlated to known classes, making it difficult to discriminate samples at the margins of class decision boundaries as “unknown”. In this work, we introduce a Class-Aware Diversified Augmentation (CADA) method to overcome this problem. Our key idea is to synthesize explicitly new multiple unknown target classes with diversified semantic and learn the inherent correlation among the known and unknown classes, so to both increase the coverage of multiple target unknown classes and to optimize class margin separation. CADA is optimized by enhanced diversity maximization and class-aware minimization. The former synthesizes more novel classes by considering both semantic relationships to known classes and domain shift between the source and target domains. The latter employs class-agnostic clustering with synthesized samples to simulate class correlations among target classes, maximizing class margin separation. Theoretical analysis and experiments on five benchmarks show the efficacy of our CADA."

    "abstract": "The wind Turbine adopts Virtual Synchronous Generator (VSG) control to support grid frequency by releasing their energy reserve. However, the interaction between the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control and VSG control will weaken their inertia response capability. Therefore, this paper proposes an inertia support strategy for wind turbine based on switching operation point with equivalent time constant. Firstly, the inertia support characteristics of the wind turbine under VSG and MPPT are analyzed. Then, an equivalent time constant is employed to characterize the inertia support capability of wind turbines. In the initial stage of inertia response, the proposed method temporarily suspends MPPT control to release rotor kinetic energy as much as possible. During the inertia response period, wind turbine will change its operation state according to the curve determined by the equivalent time constant. During the recovery stage, the proposedmethod restricts the change of rotor speed to ensure that the kinetic energy recovery comes from wind energy entirely. According to the simulation results, the frequency nadir increases by 0.06Hz and the rotor speed nadir decreases by 1.21%. Besides, the rate-of-change-of-frequency has also been improved."

Over time, battery degradation reduces this capacity, making it essential for consumers, insurance companies, and leasing providers to assess the remaining battery State of Health (SOH). This is particularly relevant for used EVs, where battery condition directly affects resale value and usability. Given the non-linear aging behavior of battery packs, influenced by environmental conditions and usage patterns, accurately determining the SOH remains a challenge. This study compares various in-situ methods for estimating SOHC using a Peugeot iOn, analyzing real-world driving and charging data over three years, and about 2850 kilometers. The findings aim to bridge the gap between laboratory-based assessments and practical, in-situ estimations of SOHc, facilitating better decision-making for stakeholders."

Although some people experience an aura as an early warning, others miss the opportunity to get timely treatment.

A novel AI-based dual-branch fusion model has been proposed that leverages a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) trained on engineered EEG features alongside a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on spectrogram representations of the same signals. This hybrid model takes advantage of both structured and unstructured data modalities to improve predictive accuracy. The experimental findings indicate that the fusion model offers an accuracy of 95%, which makes it a potential candidate for biomedical applications. The proposed approach lay a foundation for future neurotechnology that is capable of identifying EEG patterns in migraine and other related neurological conditions, contributing to the advancement of AIdriven diagnostic tools in smart healthcare."

Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed controller achieves 96.8% efficiency, reduces current ripple by 18%, and shortens settling time by 22% relative to PI control. Furthermore, harmonic analysis confirms a significant reduction in higher-order harmonics, lowering the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) and ensuring grid-compliant power exchange.

    "abstract": "In the pursuit of software reliability, mutation testing plays a critical role in evaluating and enhancing the efficacy of test suites. However, a pervasive challenge in this domain is generating optimal mutations that align with the existing test cases, often resulting in inadequate coverage of the codebase. This gap leads to missed opportunities to identify potential faults and weaknesses in software, undermining the robustness of test suites. In this paper, we propose a novel approach utilizing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify a diverse array of mutations tailored to thoroughly probe different segments of the code, thereby ensuring comprehensive coverage. By leveraging LLMs, we generate mutations that are not only varied but also contextually relevant to the given code and test suites. This method facilitates the generation of mutations that are more likely to be ‘killed’ by the test suites, significantly increasing the number of detected faults. This, in turn, leads to a deeper understanding of the code's behavior and the enhancement of the overall quality of the software testing process. Our findings indicate a substantial improvement in test suite effectiveness, showcasing the power of AI in advancing software engineering practices."

A novel water wave optimization (WWO) algorithm is developed to minimize total operating cost while ensuring load satisfaction, operational constraints, and renewable variability. The optimization model simultaneously determines the optimal dispatch of DSM, BESS, grid power, and diesel generator (DG), while maintaining strict hourly power balance and zero energy not supplied (ENS). The WWO algorithm emulates the dynamic behavior of ocean waves—propagation, refraction, and breaking—to navigate complex solution spaces with rapid convergence. Simulation results over a 24-hour horizon demonstrate that the WWO-based strategy achieves superior performance compared to a genetic algorithm (GA), a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), and a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, with a 25.2% cost reduction over the GA and convergence within 83 iterations. The results validate the potential of DSM-BESS coordination and metaheuristic optimization for efficient, reliable, and sustainable microgrid operations."

Through smart contract capabilities of the IOTA Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) test network, we enable reduced fees, decentralized storage of real-time Internet of Things (IoT) sensor data, and provide tamper-proof reservations and payments. Users may see parking availability and make reservations thanks to a user-friendly interface that facilitates smooth interactions with the blockchain technology and the smart parking system. We also compare the performance of IOTA with Ethereum. For this purpose, we utilize the Ethereumbased Sepolia test network. Results demonstrate the potential of IOTA to revolutionize urban parking management by enhancing security and reducing costs, improving the overall efficiency."

Street lights act as a source of light during the night to facilitate night vision, improve security and prevent accidents. The system incorporates a cloud-based platform for monitoring and controlling the streetlights remotely, enabling real-time updates and diagnostics. One of the key features of the system is its ability to dynamically adjust the brightness of streetlights based on traffic density and real-time factors such as the presence of vehicles, pedestrian activity, and environmental conditions. During hours of low traffic, the lights operate in a dimmed state to conserve energy. However, when motion is detected, whether from vehicles or pedestrians, the lights automatically increase to full brightness, ensuring optimal visibility and safety. This dynamic control mechanism not only ensures optimal lighting but also contributes to significant energy savings by reducing unnecessary illumination during periods of low activity."

Due to the lack of general analytical tools, numerical methods are widely used, though researchers continue exploring new approaches. Deep learning has recently achieved remarkable success in areas like image classification and natural language processing, and its application to PDEs is gaining attention. Deep neural networks have proven highly effective at function approximation, making them promising tools for solving PDEs. A growing interdisciplinary field is using deep learning to tackle PDEs in engineering and physics. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a standard method by embedding physical laws directly into the learning process. This study presents a PINN-based framework enhanced by analytical insights and electromagnetic domain knowledge. It applies the method to electromagnetic field problems using Maxwell, wave, diffusion, and Laplace equations. PINNs accurately reproduce physical behaviors, aligning well with theoretical solutions. By incorporating PDE-based physical information as a regularizing term, PINNs improve neural network performance. This study also evaluates the wave, KdV-Burgers, and KdV equations. Experimental results confirm that PINNs are highly effective for solving PDEs and warrant further research in scientific computing."

    "abstract": "Cigarettes are harmful consumer products containing over 7,000 chemicals, including at least 60 known carcinogens. Smoking is a major cause of heart disease, lung cancer, and emphysema. Although smoking rates have declined over the past 50 years, tobacco smoke exposure still affects approximately 37% of the global population and contributes to 1.3 million of the 8 million tobacco-related deaths annually. In response, governments have implemented regulations to restrict smoking by designating smoke-free zones. However, limited enforcement has resulted in frequent violations. Therefore, surveillance systems capable of detecting smoking activity are essential to support compliance with these regulations. In this study, a smoking detection model was developed using the Single Shot Detector (SSD) method with VGG16 as the feature extractor. The model was trained over 60 epochs using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.00003 and a batch size of 4. Experimental results demonstrated that at a threshold of 0.5, the model achieved outstanding performance, with 97.5% accuracy, 97.4% precision, 100% recall, and a 98.7% F1-score. While performance decreased at higher thresholds, the model maintained exceptionally high precision up to a threshold of 0.9, though recall and F1-score dropped significantly. In conclusion, the SSD-based smoking detection model with VGG16 has proven to be an effective and accurate tool for identifying smoking activity in restricted areas. With its ability to detect objects reliably under varying lighting and environmental conditions, the model holds strong potential for integration into automated surveillance systems to enhance smoke-free zone enforcement."

By decoupling the decision processes for task execution and caching, our method leverages two independent Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) agents: one selects the optimal node for executing each task, while the other determines the most suitable location for caching results, taking into account task frequency, data freshness, and user proximity. This history-aware approach enables the system to adapt dynamically to fluctuating workloads and heterogeneous network conditions, ensuring that frequently requested tasks are cached closer to end users and resources are utilized efficiently. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that HiSCA2C significantly reduces response latency and enhances computational efficiency compared to existing methods, including A3C-R2N2 and DDQN. By integrating historical task data and decoupling scheduling from caching, our framework provides a scalable and robust solution for real-time service delivery in distributed fog–cloud infrastructures."

Our method employs the Depth-Anything-V2 model to create depth maps from single RGB images, followed by a computationally efficient 1D free space analysis algorithm that identifies navigable paths. By analyzing a region of interest in the lower portion of the frame and computing a 1D profile of the depth information, we determine optimal steering angles with minimal computational overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves comparable performance to more complex systems while operating at 10–15 frames per second on consumer hardware. The system shows particular promise for low cost autonomous vehicles, mobile robots, and advanced driver assistance systems where traditional depth sensors are impractical due to cost, size, or power constraints."

    "abstract": "Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks present a critical threat to online service availability, often leading to significant disruptions. Conventional defense mechanisms frequently struggle to adapt to the evolving and complex landscape of attack vectors. This paper introduces Sentinel Shield, a real-time DDoS detection and mitigation framework that leverages statistical analysis and traffic profiling to overcome these limitations. The system establishes normal traffic baselines from a simulated environment, enabling high-fidelity anomaly detection. A key contribution is an interactive dashboard for live monitoring and visualization of network threats. Experimental validation demonstrates that SentinelShield achieves a detection accuracy of over 95%, successfully identifying both volumetric and protocol-based attacks in real time. By integrating accurate detection with an intuitive visualization interface, SentinelShield offers a scalable and effective solution for modern security operations."

The target system is an urban grid with a scale of 28,000 households. The batteries in the detached housing area were equipped with voltage control and those in the large buildings and apartments areas were equipped frequency control. The analysis focused on time with large PV output fluctuations, and stability was evaluated using power flow analysis, eigenvalue analysis, and the voltage stability index (Sys Index). As a result, it was confirmed that the batteries for voltage control can adjust the node voltage, and that the Sys Index improved as the voltage targe value was set higher, while eigenvalue analysis indicated lower voltage target value enhance stability. In addition, the introduction of batteries for frequency control significantly reduced system frequency deviations and the effectiveness increased in proportion to the storage capacity."

    "abstract": "This This paper proposes a novel Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-based adaptive encryption framework to secure surveillance videos, addressing the rising challenges posed by dynamic security threats such as frame tampering, synthetic content injection, and unauthorized access. The framework integrates CNNs to classify video content into risk categories (normal, sensitive, high-risk), and dynamically adjusts encryption schemes based on these classifications. Lowrisk frames are encrypted using lightweight AES-128 encryption, while high-risk frames are protected with robust RSA encryption, ensuring computational efficiency without compromising security. A frame-linked key management system is also implemented, providing strong, non-predictable keys for each session. The system is evaluated on several datasets, including the VIRAT Aerial Video Dataset and UCSD Anomaly Dataset, demonstrating high performance in terms of encryption/decryption time, classification accuracy, and resistance to various attacks. The proposed framework achieves a high level of adaptability, with significant improvements over conventional encryption methods in realtime surveillance video protection."

    "abstract": "Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) play a crucial role in modern naval combat, supporting applications such as environmental monitoring and enemy detection. However, building reliable machine learning (ML) models for autonomous navigation and obstacle recognition is challenged by the limited availability of diverse real-world maritime datasets, particularly in extreme weather and lighting conditions. Manual data collection is expensive and time-consuming. To overcome this, we propose Naval Combat Generative Adversarial Networks (NCGAN), a novel approach to generate realistic synthetic images for day and night scenarios. This method significantly improves the dataset size and diversity, streamlining the process of training for ML models. NCGAN performance is evaluated through generator/discriminator losses, as well as identity, adversarial, and cycle-consistency losses. Synthetic data, combined with real images, is used to train an XGBoost classifier for enemy ship detection, with a K-fold cross-validation achieving an accuracy of 0.783. This research demonstrates that GAN-generated data can effectively complement limited real-world datasets, advancing the autonomy and operational effectiveness of USVs."

Accurate staging is crucial for determining the prognosis and treatment plan for affected children. Traditional methods for staging neuroblastoma are time-consuming, subjective, and prone to error. Limited experimental studies have evaluated deep neural networks for neuroblastoma prediction, and existing findings are inconsistent. Neuroblastoma prediction methods include clinical assessment, imaging techniques (CT, MRI, PET), genetic testing (e.g., MYCN amplification), and biomarker analysis (e.g., VMA, HVA). Artificial Intelligence(AI), Machine Learning(ML), and risk stratification models further assist in prognosis and treatment planning. This investigation employs a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model on clinical and genetic attributes from the Davide Chicco's Neuroblastoma EHR Dataset Repository facilitated through feature scaling via min-max normalization, one-hot encoding of categorical variables, label encoding for binary features, and SMOTE for class balancing.

    "abstract": "This paper presents the design and CST Studio Suite simulation of a 2-bit reconfigurable rectangular microstrip patch antenna with frequency agility and scattering pattern control for millimeter-wave and stealth applications. The antenna employs four PIN diodes around a rectangular slot and a defected ground structure (DGS), enabling independent control of radiation and scattering. The substrate used is Rogers RO3003 (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\varepsilon r=3.0, \\mathrm{h}=1.524 \\text{mm}, \\tan \\delta=0.0013$</tex>). It operates from 3-13 GHz with distinct multi band responses for All-ON, All- OFF, and hybrid switching states. Full-wave CST simulations show S11 <−10 dB and VSWR <2 at target resonances. The All-ON state provides wideband multimode operation; the All-OFF state narrows operation to higher bands; and the hybrid states allow selective frequency allocation. The integrated DGS improves bandwidth, impedance matching, and suppresses unwanted surface waves, supporting miniaturization and low RCS performance. Radiation results from CST confirm main lobe directivity up to 7.03 dBi with side lobes below −5.2 dB, aiding RCS reduction. These features make the antenna suitable for multi-standard wireless, cognitive radio, and stealth platforms, combining reconfigurable tuning with stealth-enhancing techniques for next generation mmWave communications and defense systems."

However, the technological shift as such can bring about great apprehensions in terms of transparency, fairness, and the extent to which human workers are prepared to work effectively with the AI systems. On that concept, the proposed study presents a new ethical AI-combined framework of the HRM where the theoretical incorporation of adaptive learning frameworks, ethical auditing layers and workforce preparedness measures will facilitate a responsible and human-centered AI implementation. The primary novel thing about the study is that it is multi-layered by working the adaptive AI models in a perpetual loop using continuous HR data to generate data-based HR suggestions in recruitment, promotion and workforce planning. These recommendations are audited on compulsory ethics and have no biases at all before any decision can be implemented as a way of ensuring fairness and determining whether the legal standards are being adhered to. A parallel Workforce Readiness Assessment System explores the readiness of the workforce for the collaboration driven by AI, which capitalizes on the avenues to upskilling the human capabilities according to the AI integration. Should the suggested framework guarantee the inculcation of ethical transparency and manpower adaptability in the interaction of AIHRM, not merely a proficiency in decision-making would be maintained, but also the conservation of human values and trust. The findings helped to emphasize the necessity to establish the synergy of AI automation and ethical responsibility and human flexibility since it is only the missing link within the suite of practices employed in HR currently and the harbinger of responsible digital change of organizations."

Conditional GANs such as Pix2Pix and StyleGAN2 were used to generate anatomically realistic tumor instances, addressing severe class imbalance across pediatric MRI and CT datasets. The system was benchmarked on multiple rare tumor types including CNS, Wilms, Neuroblastoma, and Rhabdomyosarcoma. Models fine-tuned on both real and synthetic data consistently achieved detection accuracies above 96.3%, with F1-scores reaching 0.898 and sensitivity improvements of 5.1–6.6% over baseline CNNs. Compared to traditional oversampling and augmentation methods, the proposed framework yielded a 28–34% reduction in false negatives for minority tumor classes. The integration of weighted loss functions and radiomic-enhanced embedding’s enabled robust generalization across multi-center datasets, even under modality shifts and annotation variability. With training convergence accelerated by 2.8× and classification latency under 200ms per scan, the model offers a scalable, clinically viable solution for early-stage pediatric tumor diagnosis in constrained healthcare settings."

    "abstract": "The fact that skin cancer is still a major global health problem emphasises the need for accurate and timely detection to lower mortality from the disease. The dependence of traditional methods on visual analysis and dermoscopy supports their subjective and time-consuming character. This study explores DL techniques, namely CNNs, to automate the process of classifying skin lesion types as benign or malignant. This work uses the ISIC dataset to test a proprietary Sequential CNN model and several pre-trained CNN architectures, including Inception V3, ResNet, DenseNet, and VGG19. With a 90% accuracy rate, an AUC-ROC score of 0.9669, and balanced recall and precision for both benign and malignant cases, the Inception V3 model outperformed the other competing architectures. This study provides significant evidence that DL may automate the detection of skin cancer, paving the way for a novel approach to the disease's early detection and management. However, issues with computational complexity, data imbalance, and model interpretability continue to exist. Future research will concentrate on lowering dataset biases and increasing model flexibility. Utilising these tools in actual clinical settings to enhance patient outcomes and diagnostic accuracy is the ultimate objective."

    "abstract": "Glaucoma remains a major global cause of irreversible blindness, with early detection often hindered by its asymptomatic progression leading to nearly half of cases going undiagnosed. In this study, we explore a novel approach that leverages both electronic health records (EHR) and retinal imaging to enhance diagnostic accuracy using machine learning (ML) techniques. A balanced dataset of 1,652 individuals, including 826 glaucoma patients and 826 controls, was extracted from EHRs to train three distinct ML classifiers: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and a feed-forward neural network. Separately, a convolutional neural network (CNN) utilizing transfer learning was applied to fundus images, capitalizing on imaging data's proven diagnostic value. While EHR-based models achieved moderate performance 67.5 % accuracy with Random Forest and slightly lower for the others these results align with the strengths and limitations of structured clinical data. In contrast, imaging-based models, consistent with prior studies, demonstrated superior performance, historically reaching up to 90 % accuracy. To bridge the gap between cost-effective scalability and high diagnostic precision, we developed a hybrid ensemble model that integrates predictions from both EHR and image modalities. This integrated system significantly enhanced performance, achieving 92.1% accuracy with an AUC of 0.93. Our findings underscore the potential of a multimodal machine learning approach to support early glaucoma detection, offering a promising and practical direction for scalable screening in primary care and ophthalmology settings."

    "abstract": "The exponential growth in large language model (LLM) deployment has provided computational demands that is never seen before, resulting in significant energy consumption and CO emissions. This paper introduces the Smart Meta-controller, which is an intelligent routing system that dynamically allocates user generated queries between lightweight and computationally intensive AI agents based on the complexity of predicted tasks. Our approach employs a fine tuned DistilBERT classifier that has 97% accuracy for initial complexity assessment, brought together with a novel dynamic escalation protocol that provides robust fault tolerance against misclassification. The system implements a two stage architecture: proactive classification for immediate routing decisions and reactive escalation for error recovery when lightweight agents find tasks beyond their capabilities. Experimental results in various workloads demonstrate substantial improvements: 68% reduction in computational load, 58% decrease in GPU hour consumption, 52% reduction in average response latency, and 62% decrease in energy usage per query, while maintaining 99.1% task completion accuracy. In production environments processing over 1.2 million queries daily, the system saves approximately 2.4 MWh of energy per day, which translates to an estimated reduction of 1.2 metric tons of CO emissions annually per 10,000 daily users compared to uniform deep model routing. This work establishes a new paradigm for sustainable AI deployment through intelligent computational resource allocation, offering significant benefits in operational costs and environmental impact without compromising quality of service."

Recent testing approaches and tools used are mostly manual and cannot accommodate real-time accessibility problems. To address these issues, a prototype of a web-based system was developed, containing an AI-based accessibility checker, adaptive content rendering, and assistive technologies. The accessibility audit was performed, and the subsequent verification of compliance and improvement of the site’s usability involved the application of machine learning models, numerous tests involving NLP, and computer vision analysis. Consequently, the WCAG compliance scores were increased by $31 \\%$, the task completion rate was increased by $33.6 \\%$, and the overall user satisfaction was increased by $43.9 \\%$. AI-based solutions reduced the workload significantly and enhanced the efficiency of detecting accessibility violations by $25.6 \\%$ compared to traditional methods. Nonetheless, some of the challenges that next-generation ATRs are geared to face include the following ethical concerns: algorithmic bias and privacy. In this paper, the author outlines the potential of AI in making the Internet environment as accessible as possible and the need to work together on that effort towards reaching the best results in making the Internet an accessible venue. In the future, the work will focus on enhancing the AI algorithm, the weighting of materials, and significantly reducing or eliminating questionable ethical concerns that keep specific learners out."

Distributed renewable resources play a strategic role in enhancing grid stability and reducing greenhouse emissions. Industrial plants, as major energy consumers, are particularly well-positioned to benefit from these distributed resources. NonIntrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) has emerged as a valuable technique for optimizing the use of renewable energy through the insights extracted from smart meters. However, its application in industrial environments remains partially underexplored. This research addresses this gap by presenting the first comparative study of seven state-of-the-art NILM methods in the literature. We evaluate their performance at different signal resolutions using two publicly available datasets from different industrial contexts, one of which includes energy production signals. Given the complexity of industrial systems, this study highlights the need to account for the distinct characteristics of industrial electrical loads and to carefully adapt NILM methods to these unique conditions."

    "abstract": "Cryptocurrency markets have grown rapidly, creating new challenges for regulatory bodies in overseeing financial transactions effectively. The decentralized and pseudonymous nature of blockchain technology makes it challenging to detect illicit activities such as fraud, money laundering, and market manipulation. Existing surveillance methods primarily rely on manual reviews and rule-based systems, which are often slow, inconsistent, and unable to scale with the increasing volume and complexity of cryptocurrency transactions. To address these limitations, this study proposes a Machine Learning-Based Anomaly Detection in Transaction Patterns (ML-ADTP) framework. This framework utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to automatically analyze large-scale blockchain transaction data, identify suspicious patterns, and flag potentially fraudulent activities in real time. By combining clustering, classification, and time-series analysis techniques, the framework adapts to evolving market behaviors, thereby enhancing detection accuracy. The ML-ADTP framework enables financial regulators and exchanges to automate monitoring processes, reduce false positives, and generate timely alerts for compliance investigations. This improves overall market transparency by 98.4% and reduces the risk of illicit financial flows by 39%. Evaluation of the proposed method on real-world datasets demonstrates improved detection rates by 97.5% and faster response times by 98.2% compared to traditional methods, highlighting its effectiveness in strengthening cryptocurrency market oversight."

    "abstract": "The growing complexity of energy grid trading within smart supply chains necessitates robust security and regulatory compliance frameworks. Ensuring trust, transparency, and efficient energy exchange has become a top priority for sustainable energy ecosystems. Existing methods often suffer from centralized vulnerabilities, lack of data privacy, and limited adaptability to regulatory changes, which undermine the integrity and efficiency of energy trading systems. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Blockchain-Enabled Federated Learning (BEFL) framework that integrates decentralized machine learning with secure, immutable blockchain technologies. BEFL ensures data privacy by allowing local model training while leveraging blockchain to maintain tamper-proof, auditable energy trading records aligned with regulatory policies. This framework supports secure peer-to-peer (P2P) energy transactions, enabling dynamic pricing and decentralized decision-making while maintaining data integrity and confidentiality. The proposed method is implemented within a smart grid scenario involving distributed energy producers and consumers, where real-time compliance checks and secure trading are performed. Results demonstrate enhanced security, improved trading transparency, regulatory alignment, and reduced risks of data leakage compared to conventional systems. The proposed method gradually enhances the data privacy preservation rate by 98.43%, the transparency index by 97.64%, the regulatory compliance accuracy by 96.53%, and the security breach detection rate by 96.52%."

Traditional mileage-based evaluations often fail to capture rare but high-risk scenarios that lie in the long tail of real-world distributions. To address this challenge, we propose Risk2Scenario, a scenario generation framework assisted by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach leverages real-world traffic accident reports and employs prompt-based hierarchical analysis to extract structured risk factors, constructing a domain-specific risk factor database. These risk factors are then retrieved and integrated into the LLM, enabling the generation of semantically rich, high-risk test scenarios. To further enhance scenario diversity and coverage, we employ a genetic algorithm to explore and mutate the generated scenarios. We validate Risk2Scenario in the CARLA simulator using the Basic Agent, demonstrating its effectiveness in uncovering safety-critical situations and revealing potential vulnerabilities in autonomous driving systems."

Utilizing PPO and SAC as policy backbones and incorporating LSTM-driven glucose sequence modeling, the framework was validated across synthetic and real-world datasets including UVA/Padova simulations and OhioT1DM records. The system consistently achieved Time-in-Range (TIR) performance exceeding 96.8%, with mean absolute error (MAE) reduced to 12.9 mg/dL and zero critical hypoglycemic episodes, confirming its dosing precision under variable physiological conditions. Compared to rule-based and conventional RL methods, the proposed model demonstrated a 4.5-5.6% improvement in glycemic outcomes and a 26% reduction in insulin dosing variance. The inclusion of hybrid reward shaping and noise-robust policy regularization enabled safe learning across diverse patient profiles, including meal-induced spikes and sensor noise conditions. With inference latency below 150 ms and online adaptation capability, the system is well-suited for real-time closed-loop insulin therapy applications. Its data-driven design supports deployment in intelligent artificial pancreas systems, without reliance on handcrafted dosing heuristics or fixed clinical protocols."

This study addresses the Capacitated Multi-Vehicle Routing Problem with Pick-Up and Delivery (CMVRPPD) using a Modified Genetic Algorithm (GA), applied to operational data from X Corp. Currently, route planning is done manually and based on historical data, resulting in low utility and inefficiencies. The novelty of this research lies in modifying the initial population generation, where the next port is selected using problem-specific heuristics rather than purely random selection. The results show that the number of operational routes can be reduced from 23 to 10, with an increase in utility by 6.58% (to 45.84%), although the total sailing distance increased by 5,538.16 nautical miles. While direct comparison with historical data is limited due to differences in assumptions—such as residual unserved demand and dual home-base usage—the proposed method offers improvements in capacity utilization and enables automated scheduling. This work contributes to the practical application of metaheuristic optimization in maritime transportation and supports decision-making in vessel routing under real-world constraints."

    "abstract": "An accuracy-adjustable, energy-efficient Dadda multiplier based on configurable addition and approximate partitioning is proposed. The structure uses the approximate width setting and voltage over scaling as approximation knobs to increase the multiplier's lifetime and dependability while also reducing energy usage. The latter can only be called at design time, but the former can be set during both design and runtime. The partial output generation is applied with voltage scaling with approximation based on accuracy. Typically, the voltage over scaled columns at lower bit significances with larger switching activities is what keeps the error within a reasonable bound. For low-overhead realization, the structure uses a small number of level shifters. Contiguous are the approximate columns that begin with the first column. The final addition in the Dadda architecture uses a power gated radix adder, which dynamically turns on and disables logical element of an adder b using the power gating approach to compute precise or approximate results. As a result, power consumption and key path latency are eliminated. LSP columns 1-4 truncation of the multiplier output is also recommended in order to increase the multiplier's efficiency even more. Xilinx ISE is used to synthesize the efficiency of the suggested Dadda structure, which is built in Verilog HDL. The evaluations indicate that, the multiplier design proposed is efficient with respect to power consumption and performance when analyzed with existing counter parts."

A complete spatial constraint model is established by defining a global coordinate system at the fixed platform center and computing all joint coordinates and rod length constraints. The coupled 12-dimensional problem is decomposed into two sequential six-dimensional subproblems, solving lower and upper rods stepwise to reduce dimensionality and complexity. A feasibility-prioritized constraint strategy and adaptive evolutionary operators are adopted, dynamically tuning crossover and mutation rates to enhance global search early and strengthen local convergence later. A local gradient refinement further improves solution precision. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method converges reliably to optimal solutions, with rod length errors maintained within 0.6 mm, exhibiting high computational efficiency and robustness, thereby providing theoretical and technical support for D-TSF clinical applications."

Previous studies have established climate impacts on these crops, but lack predictive frameworks that integrate future climate scenarios with both yield and quality outcomes. This project addresses this gap by applying machine learning models to forecast how temperature and rainfall affect the production and sensory attributes of coffee and cocoa. Using supervised learning techniques such as GRU, LSTM, Random Forest, and XG-Boost, we built predictive models informed by historical climate data and quality scores from public datasets. Our results demonstrate that tree-based models consistently outperformed recurrent neural networks, with TabNet achieving an $\\mathbf{R}^{2}$ score of 0.9579 for cocoa quality prediction and XGBoost models reaching $\\mathbf{R}^{2}$ scores of approximately 0.9 for yield prediction. Feature importance analysis revealed altitude as the dominant predictor (0.34), followed by annual precipitation (0.30) and temperature change (0.26), confirming the critical role of environmental factors over processing methods. Coffee and cocoa are studied together due to their overlapping climate sensitivities and economic dependencies on quality, providing a unified framework for climate risk adaptation. The resulting models are designed to guide farmers, processors and policy makers in making informed decisions to maintain yield and maintain flavor quality amid climate variability. Our final product is an interactive tool or dashboard that offers yield and quality forecasts customized to evolving climate conditions."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the design and implementation of a network simulation tool developed using Python and the Tkinter library, offering a desktop-based graphical user interface (GUI) for analyzing key network communication protocols and graph-based routing algorithms. The tool simulates Kruskal's algorithm, Routing Information Protocol (RIP), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), TCP New Reno, and Stop-and-Wait protocols, leveraging NetworkX for network topology management and Matplotlib for real-time visualizations of routing tables, congestion windows, and transmission timelines. Users can define custom network topologies, adjust simulation parameters and evaluate performance metrics such as throughput, latency, and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the tool's effectiveness, alongside network throughput of 88 Mbps and 33.6 Mbps, latency of 37.81 ms and 81.14 ms, retransmission rate of 0.5% and 3% and packet loss rate of 0.25% and 1.5% respectively. Stop-and-Wait exhibited efficiencies of 93.75% and 75.00%, reflecting robust performance under varying conditions. These findings validate the tool as an educational platform for network concepts and a foundation for future enhancements like dynamic topology support."

    "abstract": "The increasing availability of GPS trajectory data has advanced next-location prediction, yet reported accuracies vary widely due to differences in task formulation and spatial resolution. While sequence-based neural networks outperform classical statistical models few works systematically examine how task formulation and spatial granularity affect performance when using sequence-based neural networks models. This study presents a comparative analysis of three sequence-based neural models: RNN, LSTM, and Transformer, using large-scale GPS data from Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The evaluation covers both time-binned and transition-only formulations, and H3 hexagonal grids from levels 5–10. Results show that time-binned tasks and coarse grids are far easier. At H3-8, the Transformer reaches 80.2% Top-1 accuracy (F1 57.4%) for time-binned prediction but only 34.2% (F1 15.5%) for transition-only. Finer spatial resolution further reduces accuracy due to class explosion and sparsity: at H3-5, all models exceed ~95% Top-1, but at H3-10, performance falls to 52.8% (Transformer), 44.9% (LSTM), and 10.5% (RNN). Overall, the Transformer performs best, LSTM second, and RNN only strong in coarse, time-binned settings. These findings help explain performance variation in the literature, showing that next-location prediction depends not just on model architecture but also on matching task formulation and spatial granularity to the intended application."

A qualitative exploratory methodology was employed, drawing on a thematic synthesis of theoretical literature, empirical research, and industry reports. This approach enabled the translation of social and economic concerns into a set of operational indicators to support informed decisionmaking processes. The selected indicators address key issues such as labor rights, local employment opportunities, community health and safety, access to energy, and transparency in supply chains. The study highlights the need for a more socially responsive evaluation of energy technologies, emphasizing in the energy storage systems life cycle.

This paper introduces a lightweight communication protocol that integrates real-time collision detection, exponential backoff for retransmission control, and minimal-overhead encryption. The system leverages high-resolution inter-packet timing to detect message collisions and mitigates repeated transmission failures through a randomized backoff algorithm. In a simulated network environment with two concurrent TCP clients, the system successfully detected collisions at timing intervals as low as 11.78 ms and 36.95 ms. Retransmissions were managed using exponentially increasing delays ranging from 25 ms to 196 ms, significantly reducing the chance of repeated collisions. To ensure confidentiality, a symmetric XOR-based encryption scheme with a rotating 32-bit key was used, offering negligible computational overhead. Experimental results demonstrated over 95% successful message delivery in high-contention scenarios within a five-retry limit, indicating the protocol's suitability for real-time, secure communication in environments such as vehicular networks, IoT clusters, and embedded systems."

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled widespread device interconnection over low-power and lossy networks (LLNs), commonly using the RPL routing protocol. However, RPL is vulnerable to routing attacks-such as rank manipulation, sinkholes, and selective forwarding-that can undermine network reliability and performance. Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) are often ill-suited for these environments because they impose high computational and energy costs on constrained devices. In this work we introduce LightRPL-IDS, a lightweight, machine-learning-based detection framework tailored to the constraints and threat model of RPL networks. By relying on a compact, carefully chosen feature set and computationally efficient classifiers, LightRPL-IDS delivers rapid and accurate detection of RPL-specific attacks while minimizing memory and energy use. Implemented and tested in the Cooja simulator, the framework achieves detection accuracies above 94 % across multiple attack types and shows substantial reductions in resource consumption. These results indicate that LightRPL-IDS is a practical, scalable security solution for resource-constrained IoT deployments."

The framework combines data sharing protocols, exchange format standardization, and sophisticated predictive modeling methodologies to facilitate more effective collaboration among stakeholders throughout the supply chain. The study analyzes prevalent data exchange practices, identifies shortcomings in existing frameworks, and presents a new approach that bypasses these limitations. Five classification models were compared to predict delivery performance, of which Random Forest Classification performed best (99.44% accuracy, 98.99% recall, 99.49% F1 score). The envisioned framework performs better than conventional methods via facilitation of real-time decision-making and anticipatory risk management, thus immensely enhancing ontime delivery percentages and overall supply chain resilience. The present study adds to the growing body of literature on data-enabled supply chain management and has practical applicability for organizations interested in improving delivery performance via data collaboration and predictive analytics."

    "abstract": "Accurate and timely diagnosis of neuromuscular disorders (NMDs), including myopathy and neuropathy, is essential for initiating effective treatment and mitigating disease progression. Despite advances in machine learning for NMD analysis, existing models often rely on datasets with limited subject diversity, focus on binary classification, and lack clinical interpretability, which limits their applicability. Classification remains challenging due to overlapping electromyographic (EMG) signal patterns, high inter-patient variability, and subjective interpretation. To address these challenges, this paper presents an interpretable deep learning framework for multiclass NMD classification using intramuscular EMG signals. A robust feature set is constructed by combining three statistical feature selection methods with clinically validated descriptors. A hybrid Convolutional Neural Network–Long Short–Term Memory (CNNLSTM) model is proposed to capture both spatial patterns and temporal dynamics in EMG data. To ensure transparency and clinical trust, the model integrates explainability techniques, including Permutation Feature Importance, SHapley Additive exPlanations, Partial Dependence Plots, and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations, which provide both global relevance and case-specific diagnostic reasoning. Evaluated primarily on the Mendeley dataset and further validated on the EMGLAB and a private non-invasive surface EMG cohort, the framework achieves 95.83% accuracy, 98.61% area under the curve, and strong agreement scores (Cohen’s kappa: 93.75%, Matthews Correlation Coefficient: 93.82%) with a median inference latency of 59.56 ms per sample. These findings validate the framework as a practical and interpretable tool for near real-time NMD diagnosis, enabling clinically actionable decisions in both highdemand and resource-constrained healthcare settings."

At first, the current sensor fault operating characteristic is investigated, and the features of z1-z2 subspace currents are analyzed in detail. Then, on the base of the currents feature, a novel phase current sensor fault diagnostic strategy is proposed, most of the faulty phase current sensor can be diagnosed according to the changes in the diagnosis signals which are constructed from z1-z2 subspace currents. In further, to distinguish the blind spot caused by the symmetrical windings with 60° phase shift, an easy-implemented model-based current observer is designed, the faulty phase current sensor can be further identified according to the difference between the sampled and observed currents. With the combined hybrid signal and model-based diagnosis strategy, accurate discriminations of phase current sensor fault are desired to be achieved. The multiple experiments validate the correctness and the feasibility of the proposed methods."

    "abstract": "This article investigates covert attack methods for lithium-ion batteries. Effective execution of a covert attack requires both an accurate system model and the capability to restore the system to its normal state after the attack is concluded. To address these challenges, a maximum likelihood form of dual-mode H2 optimal unbiased finite impulse response (MLDMH2OUFIR) is proposed to estimate the system state. This approach mitigates the decline in attack model accuracy caused by variations in battery parameters. Furthermore, an attack exit process is incorporated to ensure that the system state reverts to its expected condition after the attack concludes, allowing the attack to be withdrawn from the target system without leaving any trace. Finally, attack simulation experiments are conducted on lithium-ion batteries. The concealment and effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by overcharging the SOC of the experimental batteries to 110%, 115% at different ambient temperatures without being detected."

    "abstract": "This article investigates the sliding mode control problem of uncertain nonlinear systems and its application in tracking periodic motion. Traditional sliding mode control fulfils perfect tracking at the cost of chattering, especially in the case of high-frequency scenarios. To address the limitations of this method, this article introduces the internal model of the reference signal in building the sliding manifold, which fully takes the advantages of two fundamental methodologies. Specifically, the internal model of the reference signal is involved in the closed-loop system dynamics after the sliding manifold is reached. Thence, all terms related to the reference signal in the tracking error can be eliminated and high-precision tracking can be achieved while reducing chattering phenomenon. Remarkably, the detailed expressions of the derivatives of the reference signal are unnecessarily required, which simplifies the controller design and implementation. It is rigorously proved mathematically that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable. Finally, the proposed control algorithm is applied for solving the position tracking control problem for permanent magnet synchronous motor servo systems, and experimental results verify the effectiveness and superiority."

    "abstract": "Traffic analysis plays a pivotal role in network management. However, despite the prevalence of encryption, attackers are still able to deduce privacy elements such as user behavior and OS identification through advanced learning-based methods that exploit side-channel features. Existing defense strategies, which manipulate feature distribution to evade traffic analyzers, are often hampered by the need for impractical decoder deployment across all routes in symmetric framework methods. Moreover, reversing feature distribution modifications to real-time traffic, especially through dummy packet crafting or padding, is a complex task. In response to these challenges, we propose Veil, a novel and practical defender designed to protect live connections against encrypted network traffic analyzers. Leveraging an asymmetric deployment structure, Veil is capable of reconstructing live streams at the packet-block level, thereby allowing for seamless deployment on any connection node while enforcing transmission constraints. By employing a traffic-customized DQN framework, Veil not only reverses statistical feature perturbations back to the traffic space but also directs the distribution towards a target class. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets validate the efficacy of Veil in efficiently evading analyzers in both targeted and untargeted modes, outperforming existing defense mechanisms. Notably, Veil addresses the key issues of impractical decoder deployment and complex real-time traffic manipulation, offering a more viable solution for network traffic privacy protection. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/SecTeamPolaris/Veil, facilitating further research and application in the field of network security."

    "abstract": "Data centers have become integral to contemporary infrastructure. However, their electricity demand significantly adds to global energy consumption, resulting in substantial electricity costs and carbon footprints. Power purchase agreements, when used as bilateral long-term contracts for procuring renewable energy, not only hedge against volatility in an electricity market to secure locked-in prices but also play a crucial role in reducing carbon emissions. This paper studies the strategy of a data center to sign such power purchase agreements, which encompasses an optimal agreement design problem (static) and an optimal signing timing problem (dynamic) to maximize long-term expected electricity cost savings. In particular, we develop a continuous-time stochastic process model for long-term market price evolution in an electricity market, alongside a power purchase agreement model comprising the starting time, contract term, contractual power supply, and locked-in price. These models enable a novel problem formulation for PPA signing, which further allows for a tractable solution via decomposition. We first fix an arbitrary starting time and explicitly analyze how to set the other three variables with the most expected total saving. We then propose a dynamic threshold policy that online identifies an optimal starting time based on real-time observations of market prices. The proposed strategy is extensively tested with simulation experiments to validate our theoretical analysis. Numerical results also provide additional insights – over 35% reduction in long-term total electricity expenditure can be made possible for data centers, as long as power purchase agreements are properly signed."

    "abstract": "With the widespread application of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in the medical field, real-time collection and transmission of medical images become feasible. However, existing privacy-preserving image retrieval schemes often suffer from low efficiency and high communication overhead when operated in resource-constrained IoT environments due to the lack of efficient models. Thus, achieving efficient and secure medicalimage retrieval on limited-resource devices has emerged as a critical challenge. To address this, we propose LPPUBR, a lightweight, privacy-preserving, unsupervised bitmap retrieval scheme designed for IoT environments with constrained resources. LPPUBR utilizes a secure and lightweight deep learning model to extract deep feature descriptors from images and employs product quantization (PQ) to encode them into binary bitmaps, enhancing retrieval efficiency while reducing computational and storage costs. Particularly, a cross-quantization contrastive learning strategy is applied to jointly train the neural network model and PQ codewords for unsupervised learning. Furthermore, to improve interaction efficiency and reduce communication costs among multiple servers, we optimize the intermediate value recovery operation and redesign the related protocols in n-party secret sharing using a group communication strategy. A comprehensive theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation demonstrate that LPPUBR maintains retrieval accuracy comparable to the original unsupervised model while ensuring data security. Moreover, LPPUBR surpasses existing schemes in terms of computational cost, communication overhead, and retrieval efficiency."

    "abstract": "Additive Friction Stir Deposition (AFSD) is an emerging metal additive manufacturing process gaining increased attention due to its solid-state processing nature, resulting in desirable mechanical properties and the capability of fabricating large parts. To understand the multi-physics nature of the process, modeling of thermal distribution and material velocity during processing is imperative, which can be addressed by solving the related partial differential equations (PDEs). However, complex coupled PDEs entail inaccuracies and slowness in utilizing the existing numerical methods, such as the Finite Volume Method (FVM). This work proposes a neural network-based method, coupled Physics Informed Neural Network (coPINN), as a fast and accurate mesh-free solution for predicting the thermomechanical states during the AFSD process. In the case studies, the proposed coPINN accurately predicts the velocity and temperature distribution for a steady-state non-linear coupled fluid dynamics-heat transfer model of the AFSD process faster than the existing FVM. Comprehensive comparisons with residual errors show the proposed method’s trustworthiness in handling coupled physics, non-linearity, and mixed boundary conditions. In addition, the solutions of our approach show better conformance with the actual experimental data than the FVM-based solver. Overall, this work shows more efficient neural network-based solutions of a PDEs-based model than a traditional numerical method."

Existing learning-based methods, however, often fail to exploit the intrinsic structure of channel data and neglect pilot allocation information, leading to suboptimal performance, especially in large-scale networks with many users. This paper introduces the pilot contamination-aware power control (PAPC) transformer neural network, a novel approach that integrates pilot allocation data into the network, effectively handling pilot contamination scenarios. PAPC employs the attention mechanism with a custom masking technique to utilize structural information and pilot data. The architecture includes tailored preprocessing and post-processing stages for efficient feature extraction and adherence to power constraints. Trained in an unsupervised learning framework, PAPC is evaluated against the accelerated proximal gradient (APG) algorithm, showing comparable spectral efficiency fairness performance, while significantly improving computational efficiency. Simulations demonstrate PAPC’s superior performance over fully connected networks (FCNs) that lack pilot information, its scalability to large-scale CFmMIMO networks, and its computational efficiency improvement over APG. PAPC is further validated through ablation studies and evaluated across several representative CFmMIMO scenarios, demonstrating robustness to pilot contamination, scalability, and adaptability to varying user counts without retraining."

Ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of these digital interactions is crucial for protecting patient privacy and maintaining trust. Existing methods often struggle with fragmented consent processes, limited data transparency, and susceptibility to unauthorized access. This paper proposes a Blockchain-Enabled Consent Management (BECM) framework that utilizes smart contracts to securely record, verify, and manage patient consent in real-time. The BECM system ensures immutable, transparent, and auditable consent logs, enhancing data governance across telehealth platforms. By integrating BECM, healthcare providers can automate access control, reduce administrative overhead, and improve compliance with privacy regulations. The findings demonstrate that BECM significantly enhances data integrity, strengthens patient autonomy, and reduces potential security breaches during virtual consultations. This methodology offers a scalable and interoperable solution for ensuring secure and confidential telehealth services. The proposed method achieves data integrity at 98.70%, patient autonomy at 96.73%, security and privacy compliance at 97.34%, and System Scalability and interoperability at 97.84%."

This work introduces a machine learning based framework to estimate the threshold voltage of individual transistors using PVT-aware input parameters such as channel length, width, supply voltage, temperature, and threshold voltage flavor. A comprehensive dataset was generated through detailed simulations of different transistors using Cadence Virtuoso and Spectre, covering a wide range of process corners and operating conditions. Several machine learning models like decision trees, support vector regression (SVR), and neural networks were trained to learn the nonlinear mapping between design inputs and Vth. Among them, the Random Forest model achieved the best performance with an R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> score of 0.9992 and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.000149, demonstrating high accuracy and generalization capability. A user-friendly graphical interface was developed to allow users to input design parameters and generate Vth results, significantly reducing dependency on time-consuming SPICE simulations.

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of wearable technology, smart gloves based on flexible sensors have shown great potential in fields such as game control, human-computer interaction, and virtual reality. Resistance baseline drift poses a critical challenge in practical applications of flexible sensors, as it is strongly influenced by factors such as wearing style, environmental fluctuations, and material relaxation. This drift becomes particularly pronounced during repeated usage, leading to inconsistent data distributions that degrade the accuracy and stability of recognition models. To address this problem, this study develops a smart glove system using flexible sensors composed of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)/iron(Fe) composites, whose performance is further optimized through plasma etching. We propose a Dual-Stage Adaptive Normalization (DSAN) algorithm based on Z-score standardization, which combines offline historical statistics with dynamic initialization at system startup to enable individualized sensor calibration. By collecting initial data under static conditions, the algorithm dynamically updates the baseline mean and standard deviation according to the current environment, effectively compensating for initial resistance offsets. In addition, a sliding window mechanism is designed to continuously track baseline drift trends, ensuring long-term stability and reliability of the sensors. Experimental results demonstrate that DSAN significantly mitigates the impact of initial resistance variation on recognition accuracy, improving performance on uncalibrated new data from 21.89% to 94.57%. This validates the algorithm’s effectiveness in compensating for sensor drift and offers strong support for the stable operation of flexible sensors under repeated wearing and complex environmental conditions, thereby promoting the long-term practical deployment of wearable devices."

The objective of this study is to investigate the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain technology to efficiently manage risks in DeFi platforms. Transparency, nonrepudiation, and decentralized control are the qualities guaranteed by Blockchain, and on the other hand, predictive analytics, proactive anomaly detection, and fraud prevention are the strengths of AI. The best use of these technologies in terms of risk assessment would be to design a system based on AI and blockchain - real-time risk assessment directly from the blockchain, secure data sharing assistance, and automating the risk mitigation strategies. We developed an artificial intelligence-based risk prediction model that was trained using past DeFi transaction data and we also drew up a framework that helps smart contracts provide automated responses to cybersecurity incidents. Our framework is more accurate in comparison with existing methods through simulations and case studies when it comes to risk detection and mitigation.

Existing cross-border digital asset management systems encounter issues of trust, lack of interoperability, regulatory discrepancies, and inadequate transparency. These limitations hinder the immediacy of verification, increase susceptibility to fraud, and impede compliance across multiple jurisdictions. To fill these gaps, this study formulates a Blockchain-Enabled Federated Identity Management framework (B-EFIM). The methodology is characterized by the iterative design, development, and evaluation of a blockchain-based system integrating smart contracts adjustable to specific jurisdictions with a permissioned distributed ledger, empowering clear, secure, and verifiable transactions. The proposed approach enables real-time supervision of asset movements, validates automated compliance, and establishes trust through verifiable records that are accessible to all stakeholders, including regulators, financial institutions, and asset custodians. It enables seamless alignment with regulatory requirements while enhancing operational effectiveness.

These networks require integrated oversight mechanisms that can adapt to real-time data flows and complex regulatory environments. Existing methods often struggle with fragmented regulatory regimes, lack of interoperability between systems, and insufficient transparency in AI-driven decision-making, leading to compliance gaps and ethical concerns such as data misuse and algorithmic bias. This paper proposes a governance framework that leverages AI-powered transaction monitoring systems aligned with the COBIT 2019 methodology to enhance compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and data protection regulations. The framework supports real-time anomaly detection, transparent audit trails, and policy-driven controls for the ethical use of AI. The proposed method enables financial institutions to automate regulatory reporting, mitigate compliance risks, and promote responsible data practices across jurisdictions. It also facilitates interoperability and consistency in data handling across intelligent financial networks. Findings indicate that the implementation of this framework improves detection accuracy, strengthens regulatory compliance, and increases stakeholder trust in AI-enabled financial ecosystems."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) increases exposure to large-scale cyberattacks. In scenarios such as peak DDoS waves or botnet outbreaks, malicious traffic can vastly outnumber benign flows. An attack-majority condition that biases detection systems toward “always attack” harming benign recall. This work investigates benign traffic detection under attack-majority conditions using the IoT-23 dataset (86.3% attack, 13.7% benign). SMOTE, ADASYN, Random Over- and Under-Sampling, no-balancing, and Class-Weighting methods were compared across classical machine-learning and deep-learning models. Evaluation was conducted in terms of overall accuracy, macro-F1, class-wise precision and recall, and training time. Results show tree-based models with class weighting or no balancing can sustain strong benign recall at lower cost, while certain oversampling (e.g., ADASYN) may reduce benign detection. These findings guide the design of efficient IoT intrusion detection for attack-dominated environments."

Compared with traditional converter fault detection methods, the proposed method does not require information such as voltages and currents of insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) inside the converter, fault line currents, and communication links, and exhibits higher accuracy, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of fault diagnosis.

    "abstract": "The rapid rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) within cyber-physical systems (CPS) has brought about transformative automation and interconnectivity across sectors such as energy, healthcare, and manufacturing. However, this expansion also introduces new vulnerabilities, particularly to Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), which are stealthy, multistage cyberattacks designed to bypass conventional defenses. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage APT detection and prevention technique that combines correlational analysis with an enhanced attack graph model tailored for CPS environments. The proposed model integrates APT specific behavior stages with real-time system vulnerabilities, leveraging Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base and temporal scores to quantify exploitability and predict attack progression. Our approach includes a three-step pipeline: (i) attack vector detection based on event correlation, (ii) alert clustering and filtering, and (iii) attack path prediction using logistic regression on historical threat data. Simulations were conducted using datasets from SCADA-based environments, and vulnerability data from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). The proposed detection method achieved a classification accuracy of 93.36% using a decision tree model that is able to demonstrate high precision in identifying APT patterns and their probable future stages. The significance of this study lies in its ability to bridge the gap between static vulnerability assessment and dynamic APT behavior modeling. We conclude the paper with potential future work to explore expanding the model to include scenarios with multiple adversaries and overlapping attack paths."

As AI chatbots are used more and more in fields like customer service, online shopping, and healthcare, there is a growing need to make these systems more human-like and emotionally intelligent. While chatbots are efficient at handling basic queries and providing quick responses, they frequently fail to understand the emotions behind a user's message, which can result in boring or robotic conversations. This paper discusses the current methods for detecting emotions from text and emojis, including machine learning and deep learning approaches, and highlights some of the major challenges in this field, including sarcasm detection, understanding cultural differences in emoji use, and the lack of standard datasets for proper model comparison. Furthermore, the paper suggests potential directions for future research to develop emotionally aware chatbots that can respond in a more personalised, human-like, and engaging manner."

The system mimics adaptive correction by simulating TCP packet flow, adding random errors, and using conditional rule-based logic. A 100% packet delivery ratio and high network efficiency were attained in the experimental results using a small-scale packet stream (50 packets, 3 induced errors).

    "abstract": "As COVID-19 expands globally, dependable health screening systems protecting people's privacy are more important than ever. Traditional screening techniques demand the provision of sensitive health data, which raises reasonable privacy concerns. This paper utilizes Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Logistic Regression to propose a novel architecture for reliable COVID-19 screening, thereby safeguarding patient data. Using a partially homomorphic encryption method, the proposed methodology encrypts patient characteristics, including symptoms, travel history, and exposure risk, allowing for direct logistic regression on encrypted data. The model is trained and evaluated using synthetic datasets imitating real-world screening scenarios. Experimental results show that, with almost little extra processing effort, the encrypted logistic regression model beats its plaintext counterpart (up to 93.5% accuracy). Other significant system features include meeting strict data security requirements and guaranteeing end-to-end data confidentiality. These results suggest that screening tools provided by HE might help to create a balance between data value and privacy, which is a significant consideration in developing pandemic response strategies."

The evaluation uses four metrics: counterfactual consistency scores, deletion-AUC for sufficiency analysis, perturbation robustness, and human simulatability assessments. Results show improvements in counterfactual consistency (median improvement = 0.086, p ¡ 0.001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, N = 6,000), with effect sizes ranging from small-to-medium for computational metrics to very large for human performance measures. Human simulatability studies show a 14-point improvement in prediction accuracy (Cohen’s d = 3.50, p ¡ 0.001). Optimal rationale length is 15-35 tokens. Deletion curves indicate better information organization and sufficiency. GPT-4o outperforms other models, with Claude-3.5-Sonnet balancing efficiency and quality.

This study would benefit from our suggested structure. The technology is designed for real-time applications and accurately detects static and dynamic hand motions. The system had this feature. This was meant to streamline the procedure. It can collect and examine gesture data from depth video sources and RGB. Using video frames, the CNN module encodes visual-spatial characteristics. The LSTM, the other hand, learns motion continuity and temporal links. It is its responsibility. Resilience is attained by the model using an efficient sliding window frame sampling method and a data augmentation pipeline. You do this to become more resilient. Both elements offer the appropriate strength. With little Latency, GestureNet-HCI reaches state-of-the-art accuracy. Experiments with publicly available gesture datasets indicate that it is suitable for real-time uses. Among the pertinent data in these sets are Chalearn LAP IsoGD, NVGesture, and others.

This study focuses on the Tokyo Metropolis and proposes a multidimensional evaluation framework incorporating six indicators: earthquake probability, flood depth, population density, elderly population ratio, shelter burden, and solar panel installation coverage. Based on this framework, we calculated a V2S Need Index for all 53 administrative districts and identified significant regional disparities, with Region A emerging as the priority area for further analysis. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we developed a 72-hour emergency power demand prediction model for shelters in Region A and performed hypothetical calculations of V2S supply capacity. Results indicate that heating demand in large indoor spaces, such as school gymnasiums, strongly affects energy needs. For a shelter accommodating 1,500 people, achieving 95% coverage requires 1,123 kWh in cold conditions, 396 kWh in hot conditions, and 287 kWh in mild conditions—equivalent to 21, 8, and 6 EVs respectively (assuming 60 kWh battery capacity and 0.9 discharge efficiency). These findings demonstrate both the technical feasibility of V2S for disaster response and the importance of targeted regional deployment strategies."

The Japanese government has set a target of achieving $\\mathbf{1 0 0 \\%}$ electric passenger-vehicle sales by 2035, and medical facilities are also considering switching from conventional gasoline vehicles to EVs. The proposed method constructs a three-dimensional road network by integrating elevation data provided by the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (GSI) into the road network obtained from OpenStreetMap (OSM) using OSMnx. Route optimization is carried out in two stages. In the first step, Dijkstra’s Algorithm is used to find the optimal route between all destinations. In the second step, Simulated Annealing (SA) is used to optimize the visit order for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). As a result of the optimization, considering elevation increases energy consumption along the routes in this paper by approximately $\\mathbf{1 8 \\%}$ compared to the case without elevation. Furthermore, it shows that taking elevation into account enables the minimization of energy consumption."

The framework uses FastText embeddings with TF-IDF weighting to produce distinctive log representations, followed by a robust PCA method that adapts to log pattern changes without requiring extensive computational resources. A cloud-edge collaborative architecture allows model updates while maintaining local processing capabilities. Experimental results show that RPCA achieves high detection accuracy on benchmark datasets and offers significant computational efficiency compared to traditional deep learning methods. Robustness testing indicates competitive performance against log variability, making RPCA suitable for dynamic IoT environments where log patterns frequently shift.

This paper proposes an integrated framework combining active learning, uncertainty-driven labeling, and stacked ensemble models to improve the robustness and balance of multi-class financial risk prediction in corporate client datasets. The approach leverages uncertainty quantification to systematically identify ambiguous instances, enabling targeted human relabeling and model retraining. Extensive experiments on real-world B2B financial data demonstrate that while XGBoost achieves the highest single-model performance, the proposed ensemble method provides more balanced results across classes, ensuring perfect recall for minority cases (Low Risk) and reducing boundary mis-classifications between Medium and High Risk. SHAP-based interpretability analysis further reveals the contribution of individual base-learners and supports explainable risk assessment. The findings validate the value of uncertainty-aware active learning and interpretable ensemble modeling in advancing robust, actionable B2B risk profiling. Future work will focus on operationalizing the active learning pipeline and expanding feature integration for even greater predictive performance."

    "abstract": "This work focuses on reducing the energy consumed by the air distribution system for clean rooms in a biopharmaceutical industry through the installation of a solar panel array. For this purpose, a procedure for optimally sizing the array is proposed, which aims to minimize the number of photovoltaic solar panels (modules) needed to meet certain requirements by selecting the optimal number of strings in parallel and the optimal number of panels connected in series per string. In addition, an analysis of the influence of the tilt angle of the panels on the energy supplied by the array is conducted as a basis for the future design of a tracking system. The results show that, with the correct tilt angle, grid energy consumption can be reduced from $24.08 \\%$ in winter to $28.25 \\%$ in summer."

    "abstract": "As more and more people buy electric vehicles (EVs), we need smart routing and charging systems to make them more energy-efficient and reduce traffic jams. This paper suggests a real-time optimization framework that combines Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) with Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) to make EV routing and charging more flexible and aware of traffic. The ACO algorithm uses a weighted graph to model the road network, taking into account things like the cost of energy, the time it takes to travel, and the delay in charging. VANET protocols allow for decentralized communication, which makes sure that everyone has the most up-to-date information about where vehicles are, where charging stations are, and how busy the network is. Using MATLAB to run simulations shows that the proposed system uses 17.3% less energy, routes 23.7% more efficiently, and waits 12.1% less time to charge than baseline models. These results show that ACO-V ANET hybrid systems are good at helping smart transportation networks support long-term EV mobility."

    "abstract": "To meet high efficiency and signal quality standards, digital pre-distortion (DPD) is widely used in base stations. It effectively balances the linearity and efficiency of power amplifiers (PA). Traditional research faces two challenges: first, the added overhead of the feedback link; second, the wide dynamic range of feedback signals, which imposes high demands on the ADC of the receiving chain. If these demands are not met, it can result in saturation distortion, thereby impacting DPD calibration. This work eliminates the need for a dedicated DPD feedback structure by repurposing the ISAC sensing receiver as the DPD calibration path. This approach avoids the hardware overhead of a conventional separate feedback link through innovative component reuse .The innovation introduced in this paper is the integration of folding technology into the receiver, thus effectively preventing saturation issues in the received signal. We present an optimization of transmission and reception beamforming, enabling signal folding followed by DPD processing without the need for recovery. Theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrated in this paper to show the quantization advantages of signal folding DPD. According to the performance result, the proposed method can achieve 2dB ACLR gain with 4bit quantization."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a cost-optimal operation framework for grid-connected AC microgrids with integrated electric vehicles (EVs), aiming to minimize total operational costs through intelligent scheduling of distributed energy resources. The proposed system comprises solar photovoltaic (PV) generation, diesel generators (DGs), battery energy storage systems (BESS), and multiple EVs with controlled charging. A constrained optimization model is formulated, incorporating power balance, generator and storage constraints, grid exchange limits, and EV-specific charging schedules. To solve this complex scheduling problem, an improved artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is developed, integrating chaotic initialization and enhanced neighborhood search to accelerate convergence and improve solution quality. Comparative simulations are conducted against standard ABC, genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) under identical microgrid configurations. Results show that the improved ABC algorithm achieves the lowest total cost of 148.07 (USD/day), reducing costs by up to 9.66% compared to GA, while also demonstrating faster convergence. The inclusion and coordination of EVs as flexible energy assets significantly enhance operational efficiency, reduce diesel reliance, and promote better utilization of renewable energy. This research highlights the superior performance of the improved ABC algorithm and the transformative role of EVs in cost-effective and sustainable microgrid operation."

    "abstract": "Meatballs are highly perishable and typically spoil within a few days, even if stored refrigerated. To extend their shelf life, some unscrupulous sellers illegally add borax, a chemical preservative known for its antimicrobial properties but banned in food due to its toxic effects on human health. Conventional borax detection methods often rely on expensive specialized equipment and trained operators, limiting their accessibility. To address these challenges, technological innovations such as the Electronic Nose (e-nose) offer a promising alternative. E-noses, which use gas sensors to mimic the human olfactory system, can evaluate food quality and detect harmful substances such as borax. In this study, the TGS 2600 and TGS 2611 gas sensors were used in the e-nose sensor array, each exhibiting distinct responses to volatile compounds released when meatballs containing borax are heated. The outputs of these sensors were analyzed using software to classify aroma patterns through simple learning and simulation. To interpret data containing uncertainty and ambiguity, the Mamdani fuzzy logic method was applied, which categorizes borax levels into three groups: safe (low borax), alert (near the threshold), and unsafe (high borax). This approach successfully translated sensor readings into comprehensive categories and achieved an accuracy rate of 91.1%, underscoring its potential as an effective tool for food safety monitoring."

    "abstract": "The increasing adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has intensified the need for effective zero day attack detection, as traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) struggle with centralized data dependency and the requirement for labeled attack samples. We propose a Federated Learning (FL)based anomaly detection framework designed to address these limitations by training models solely on benign data distributed across IoT nodes. Leveraging the CICIoT2023 dataset, we apply Pearson's correlation-based feature selection to enhance feature relevance, reduce dimensionality, and ensure computational efficiency in resource-constrained environments. The trained model captures normal traffic patterns and identifies anomalies when evaluated on datasets containing both benign and malicious samples. The experimental results demonstrate high detection accuracy across heterogeneous clients. Additionally, the model achieves competitive performance when compared to existing FLbased techniques while maintaining privacy. By tackling data heterogeneity, reducing label dependency, and preserving data privacy, the proposed framework offers a scalable and resilient solution to safeguard IoT networks against emerging zero day threats, contributing a step forward in IoT security research."

    "abstract": "In the smart grid networks, data-intensive service becomes more and more popular. It is important to exchange data between different devices with high efficiency. The secondary data market leverages users’ bids information on monthly data usage to sell or buy leftover data caps from each other. It has been deemed as a promising third party that will satisfy different users’ data demands effectively. In this work, we introduce a new third party, DataMart. Different from the traditional data trade platforms, it can not only incentive all traders to bid users’ data demands and unit price truthfully but also permit all traders to bid heterogeneous users’ requirements, such as available time interval and data operator. Next, to guarantee the bid truthful, we design a data matching mechanism including two steps. First, we use the auction theory to determine the winner set and find a transaction price. Then to match buyers and sellers as many as possible, we divide each trader into multiple and virtual traders, and formulate a one-to-one matching game with ties. Furthermore, to solve it, a data matching algorithm based on matching theory is proposed to match buyers and sellers. Additionally, from the theory perspective, we analyze the existence, stability, truthfulness, and complexity of the data matching mechanism. Finally, the performances of the matching results are evaluated compared with the existing algorithms and demonstrating the practicability and efficiency of our proposed algorithm."

To address this challenge, this paper proposes a computationally optimized UAV emergency scheduling mechanism for low-altitude urban logistics. The proposed framework integrates an emergency priority determination model, multi-task fusion scheduling, and a two-level path planning algorithm. A hybrid Genetic Algorithm–Deep Reinforcement Learning (GA–DRL) optimization strategy is introduced to enhance global search and real-time decision-making efficiency, while an edge–cloud collaborative computing architecture accelerates task allocation through GPU-enabled parallel processing. Experiments based on real-world mission data from Shenzhen’s central urban area demonstrate that the proposed mechanism reduces average computation time by 38%, shortens response time by 45%, and increases task completion rate to 95.8%, significantly outperforming baseline scheduling methods. The results validate the system’s adaptability and robustness in complex urban environments. This study contributes a scalable and high-performance computational framework that advances both drone dispatch optimization and intelligent computing for urban emergency logistics."

Charge Place Scotland (CPS) is the charging station operator (CSO) that implements and maintains the public EV charging infrastructure including all CPs in Scotland, and we used data on all of CPSs charging sessions (CSs) for eleven months in our analysis. Our research aims were to: 1) characterise factors associated with CS duration based on CS and CP attributes for EV users served by CPS, and 2) analyse whether adding more connectors at CPs could reduce CS duration on the CPS network. Using data from over one million CSs representing 6,335 CPs, we conducted a descriptive analysis, then bootstrapped the CS data into five linear regression model sets containing 1,000 models utilising datasets representing 1,000 CPs (containing at least 22,000 CSs). Average duration of CSs at rapid and ultra-rapid connectors was approximately 45 and 40 minutes respectively, while those at slow and fast connectors were over 3.5 hours. Bootstrap model sets demonstrated that number of connectors at the CP was not associated with reduced CS duration, but rapid connectors were associated with a statistically significant mean reduction in CS duration of about seven minutes. It is recommended that rather than adding additional connectors at CPs, CPS should upgrade existing connectors to rapid or ultra-rapid, and government programmes should incentivize use of these public CPs to offset the extra cost to consumers."

The sheer volume of user comments poses severe challenges in identifying recurring issues, providing timely feedback, and quantifying user sentiments. This paper introduces an integrated solution to problems above by combining three basic paradigms: semantic comment clustering, intelligent query matching, and sentiment analysis. Through clustering associated comments, semantic clustering helps producers respond to common questions better. Based on this as a premise, query matching identifies the most relevant previous answers to user questions and thus eliminates redundancy and speeds up responses. Finally, sentiment analysis provides an additional layer by categorizing feedback as positive, neutral, or negative, giving producers essential understanding of user sentiments. Collectively, these technologies introduce an end-to-end system that supports automated feedback management, stimulates timely engagement, and ultimately improves digital interactions for all parties involved."

Two significant biometric signals that represent the electrical and mechanical behavior of muscles are electromyography (EMG) and myomechanography (MMG). The system can gain a better understanding of the user's intended movements by employing multi-channel sensors to record both signals from distinct muscle regions. This method increases the prosthetic hand control's accuracy and responsiveness, making it more dependable and natural for daily use. An array of synchronized, low-noise sensors is used in this study to capture and process both electromyography (EMG) and myomechanography (MMG) signals, allowing for more detailed and responsive control signals. A root mean square (RMS) model is used for classification after real-time processing using advanced filtering and feature extraction techniques. Simulation and case study results showed improved control accuracy, reaching 95.3% for dynamic hand gestures and 93.8% for static grasps, with an average error of 4.2%.

    "abstract": "As the digital payments in India have been rapidly increasing, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is one of the most sought-after methods of financial operations. Nevertheless, with this expanded usage, fraud has also grown at an alarming rate and is posing significant challenges to users and financial institutions. In this work, the author aims to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions of UPI using different machine learning methods. To maximize the reliability of the model, the dataset was subjected to a lot of preprocessing to eliminate redundant entries and normalize the feature values. A number of classification models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Convolutional Neural Network, were implemented and tested. The dataset was used in training the model using around 85 percent of the data and the other 15 percent was used in the validation and evaluation of the performance. Evaluation metrics that were used to gauge the efficiency of each algorithm included accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and AUC-ROC. The Random Forest classifier was the most accurate of the models in the detection of fraudulent pattern with Decision Tree and K- Nearest Neighbors coming next. In constructing effective fraud detection systems, the study focuses on the need to have proper feature engineering, data preprocessing and algorithm selection. Also, it points out the inefficiency of algorithms such as the Naive Bayes to handle interdependent variables and the need to keep re-training to keep up with changing fraud patterns."

    "abstract": "DeepPainSense is an intelligentsystem that operates in real time to identify chronic pain as well as emotional conditions like stress and anxiety through a multimodal strategy. It gets information from three main sources: facial expressions from a camera, body movements from motion sensors, and muscle activity from sensors that measure muscle movement. muscle activity (monitored through EMG sensors). Advanced deep learning methods are employed to analyze these signals, utilizing ResNet-50 combined with LSTM for facial recognition, BiLSTM or Transformer models for recognizing motion patterns, and ID CNN with LSTM for processing muscle signals. For precise predictions, an attention-based fusion layer integrates all feature outputs. The system can tell when there is pain and also notice actions like guarding, limping, or bracing, and it checks how bad the pain is. It also uses multitask learning to identify emotional states, which helpes in fully understanding both the patient's physical and mental health. DeepPainSense also incorporates Explainable AI (XAI) through tools like SHAP and LIME, which clarify the rationale behind each prediction, fostering trust among both users and healthcare professionals. Real-time feedback is given via a chatbot or voice assistant, which is especially helpful for home physiotherapy, remote monitoring, and taking care of elderly people."

For instance, the dynamic of fraud approaches is incompatible with the majority of conventional fraud detection systems, which are mainly based on rule-based systems. In this paper, we analyze several cutting-edge machine learning (ML) models for real-time fraud detection in the financial transaction arena, such as LightGBM, DNNs, GCNs, and Transformers. We test these models on a dataset of more than 10 million transactions and assess their temporal efficiency, accuracy, precision, and recall. LightGBM is the best model for fraud detection, according to the results, since it performs better than the other models in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. The issues of class imbalance, real-time adaptability, and computational cost related to these models are then discussed. To boost performance, we intend to investigate the combination of federated learning and deep reinforcement learning in the future."

Resonant DC-to-AC converter topologies are well known for their improved efficiency in comparison to conventional converters, due to the reduction of switching losses. In this contribution a load sided resonant inverter operating a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine is considered. In order to operate the machine under resonant condition at different speeds, the resonant tank must be adjusted. To do so, a capacitor array is designed, which enables a reactive power compensation across a specified speed range of the machine. The design and layout of the capacitor array is derived and the required capacitances are optimized via a Genetic Algorithm. The design is then validated with measurements of a demonstration setup."

Each method addresses a critical aspect of data communication—congestion control, reliable transmission, optimal routing, and frame synchronization, respectively. The work integrates these protocols across different layers of the OSI model to simulate real-world communication scenarios. Performance is assessed using key metrics such as latency and throughput, offering insights into the efficiency and reliability of each approach. The results, visualized through graphs and charts, help interpret the behavior and effectiveness of these strategies in ensuring robust data transfer. On average, the system achieved a latency of 0.0258 seconds and a throughput of 65.47 packets per second.

    "abstract": "In the realm of organizational security, the integration of risk assessment into the software development process for websites and organizations often involves relying on external security experts. However, our study proposes a self-contained dual-framework approach for internal teams. This research presents an agile methodology that uses two successful strategies to improve software risk assessment for web-based applications: (1) The OCTAVE Allegro risk assessment framework, which helps identify and evaluate an organization's critical assets. This framework produces reliable results even without extensive security expertise, (2) The STRIDE threat modeling tool which systematically identifies and assesses potential threats, providing a structured approach to threat assessment. The outcomes of this study deliver a comprehensive risk analysis for web application software, encompassing asset identification, risk assessment, and detailed analysis. A strategic roadmap is also outlined for mitigating risks and implementing effective countermeasures, particularly protecting investments that significantly impact core business operations. This research is especially beneficial for organizations aiming to enhance their information security frameworks, particularly those that rely heavily on web applications. As a practical outcome, the study proposes tailored mitigation strategies and countermeasures for assets with critical business implications, demonstrating improved assessment speed and clarity for small and medium-sized enterprises lacking in-house security expertise."

    "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a brain disorder for which symptoms such as repetitive activities or movements start appearing in early childhood. Early detection of ASD empowers parents to take appropriate actions and proper care of the affected children. Earlier research works have mostly focused on detecting ASD from either facial images or behavioral data. However, combining both types of features would ensure better prediction of ASD. In this research work, we have proposed a system to detect ASD in children by evaluating both facial image and behavioral features. We have developed an integrated dataset that contains both images and behavioral data by combining two existing individual image and behavior datasets. We have designed a multimodal model architecture, trained different CNN models on the new integrated dataset, and evaluated the performance of each model. MobileNetV3Large model has outperformed all the other models with an accuracy of 97.36%. Finally, a simple webapp has been developed that takes an image and other behavioral data as inputs and predicts if the child is a probable ASD patient."

This paper addresses that gap by consolidating key concepts and design methods for UNS implementation in manufacturing. To demonstrate practical relevance, a case study illustrates how UNS enhances data integration and operational efficiency in real manufacturing environments. By providing a structured and practical reference, this work equips both academia and industry with the tools needed to accelerate UNS understanding and adoption."

The proposed architecture integrates a single PIN diode per unit cell to dynamically switch between distinct surface impedance states and reflection phases. This enables three concurrent functionalities: beam steering for radiating and scattering patterns; radar-cross-section (RCS) reduction through absorption; and polarization conversion, including linear-to-left/right hand circular polarization (LHCP/ RHCP) and cross-polarization transformations. A 32×24 reconfigurable metasurface array fed by a Rotman lens is designed, fabricated and measured. Experimental results show that the RHM can achieve E-plane beam steering from −30° to 60° and H-plane beam steering from −30° to 30° through surface impedance modulation and feeding port selection respectively, under 9 GHz surface wave (SW) excitation. Beam steering up to ±60° in E-plane is achieved across 11-15 GHz via programmed reflection phase gradients under space propagating wave (SPW) illumination."

    "abstract": "Roadside multi-sensor networks, such as RGB-D camera networks, play a crucial role in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). These systems rely on accurate extrinsic parameters (i.e., the relative positions and orientations) of each camera in the network. However, achieving fast and accurate large-scale extrinsic parameter calibration is challenging, especially when the overlap between camera views is limited due to cost constraints. To address this issue, we propose an automated, scalable, and marker-free calibration method that requires no human intervention. Our approach leverages dynamic rigid bodies, such as moving vehicles, as bridges to establish associations among all cameras without manual placement or supervision. The proposed method consists of three main stages: 1) calibrating camera height, roll, and pitch using the ground plane; 2) estimating each camera’s 2D position and yaw angle based on trajectories; and 3) refining these estimates by matching features on the road surface using SuperPoint and SuperGlue. Real-world experiments involving 58 roadside RGB-D cameras deployed in a parking lot demonstrate that our method significantly improves calibration efficiency while maintaining high accuracy, making it well-suited for large-scale RGB-D camera network deployment."

To address this limitation, we analyze Riemannian online gradient descent for h-convex and strongly h-convex functions and establish O(T) and O(log(T)) regret guarantees, respectively. These bounds are curvature-independent and match the results in the Euclidean setting. We validate our approach with experiments on the manifold of symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrices equipped with the affine-invariant metric. In particular, we investigate online Tyler’s M-estimation and online Fréchet mean computation, showing the application of h-convexity in practice."

Second, using diffeomorphism theory, the system state is transformed, and the second-level control strategy is formulated to ensure compliance with inequality constraints. Furthermore, through Lyapunov stability analysis, the uniform boundedness and uniform ultimate boundedness of the system are validated. This control scheme constrains system velocity within the desired range and reduces the amplitude of velocity fluctuations. Finally, simulation-based validation on a nonlinear system confirms the effectiveness of the proposed control approach."

While practitioners employ various optimization techniques, that we refer as “knobs” in this paper, to tune model efficiency, these are typically afterthoughts and applied in isolation without understanding their combined effects on energy efficiency. The goal of this exploratory empirical study is to emphasize on treating energy efficiency as the firstclass design consideration by demonstrating how strategic knob selection across five AI pipeline stages (data, model, training, system, inference) creates cascading efficiency gains. We evaluate 30 experimental variants on ModernBERT, an encoderonly architecture, examining individual techniques and their orthogonal combinations. Results shows that model pruning provides the highest single-knob energy savings (up to 84.6%), while orthogonal combinations reduce energy consumption by up to 94.6% while preserving 95.95% of baseline F1 score. This work provides actionable frameworks for informed green AI that balance efficiency, performance, and environmental responsibility in AI systems."

    "abstract": "High-power ultrafast pulses are critical for advanced applications such as diffraction-limited storage ring (DLSR) light sources, yet conventional pulse-shaping techniques face limitations in simultaneously achieving fast rise/fall times, minimal pulse oscillation, and high-voltage stability. To address this, we propose a dual-path ferrite nonlinear transmission line (DP-FNLTL) architecture integrating two functional branches: NLTL1 for rising-edge sharpening via current-dependent permeability modulation and NLTL2 for trailing-edge truncation through magnetic crowbar switching. Theoretical analysis, PSpice simulations, and experimental validation confirm that the DP-FNLTL compresses input pulses (34.6 ns bottom width, 5.86 ns rise time, and 7.7 ns fall time) to meet stringent DLSR specifications. The 70 mm NLTL1 configuration achieves a 2.27 ns rise time with <inline-formula content-type=\"math/tex\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\" version=\"MathJax\">$&lt;$</tex-math> </inline-formula>1% prepulse oscillation, while NLTL2 compresses fall time to 1.94 ns via volt-second saturation. Integrated systems deliver 24 kV amplitude, sub-3 ns rise/fall times, 6.78 ns bottom width, and sub-3% prepulse/tail oscillations at an optimized 7 kA/m axial bias field, establishing DP-FNLTL as a robust solution for accelerator-compliant ultrafast high-voltage pulses."

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly adopted by firms for different organizational purposes. While such AI adoption is expected to affect firm performance, it may also have different effects on firms' stakeholders such as employees, shareholders, and customers. To provide a more comprehensive understanding of the stakeholder implications of AI adoption, we conduct a systematic review of 84 relevant papers published in business journals in the past 8 years (2017-2024). Our review suggests that firms' AI adoption does have different, sometimes conflicting, effects on different stakeholder groups. We also uncover several limitations of the extant literature and develop an integrative AIMS (AI Impacts Multiple Stakeholders) framework that summarizes important directions for future research. Our AIMS framework emphasizes the need to consider underexplored stakeholder groups such as suppliers and competitors, as well as the trade-offs and dynamics among different stakeholder groups induced by AI adoption. Our framework also encourages future research to move beyond examining the direct impact of AI adoption on stakeholders by investigating when (contextual factors) and why (underlying mechanisms) AI adoption affects stakeholders, thereby advancing the literature on AI-stakeholder relationships. Finally, we discuss the implications for future operations management research, encouraging scholars to adopt a supply chain perspective to study the stakeholder implications of firms' AI adoption."

    "abstract": "Consumer internet of things (CIoT) devices are increasingly being integrated into various aspects of wireless communication, enhancing the scalability of networks. Along with these, in sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a prominent technology that can dynamically control the wireless environment. As a progression of this technology, recently, simultaneously transmitting and reflecting-RIS (STAR-RIS) has gained significant attention for its ability to achieve full-space coverage by simultaneously transmitting and reflecting signals. On the other hand, multiple input multiple output (MIMO) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technologies have already proven their dominance in fifth-generation (5G) wireless communication networks by obtaining massive connectivity and high spectral efficiency. This paper proposes a mode switching-based STAR-RIS aided MIMO-NOMA framework for 6G wireless networks to cover the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) region as a footprint. The proposed framework adopts the selection combining and maximum ratio combining protocols to meet the quality of service requirements of the CIoT devices in NLoS regions. The study also derives mathematical formulations for the proposed framework by analyzing key performance metrics, including achievable data rate (ADR), outage probability, bit error rate (BER), diversity order, and throughput. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system, comparative analyses are conducted against benchmark models such as STAR-RIS assisted single-input single-output (SISO) orthogonal multiple access and STAR-RIS assisted SISO-NOMA schemes. Simulation results affirm the superiority of the proposed framework for both the reflecting and transmitting regions of the STAR-RIS. In the transmitting region, under the maximum ratio combining protocol, the far CIoT device of the proposed STAR-RIS aided MIMO-NOMA framework attains an ADR at least 0.45 times higher than the conventional framework. Further, the BER of the proposed framework is 0.93 times lower than conventional framework."

    "abstract": "The challenge of fraud detection, especially in credit card transactions, continues to grow as fraudsters adapt to increasingly sophisticated tactics. Traditional methods, including rule-based systems, are often limited by high false positives and poor adaptability to new fraud patterns. This study introduces a cutting-edge approach using an attention-based ensemble framework that synergizes the strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), graph neural networks (GNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and long short-term memory (LSTM) models. A key innovation of this model is its confidence-driven gating mechanism, which dynamically combines the most reliable prediction, ensuring both accuracy and transparency. By incorporating dependent ordered weighted averaging (DOWA) and induced ordered weighted averaging (IOWA) operators, the model effectively integrates outputs from various classifiers, improving robustness. Additionally, SHAP-based feature selection reveals the most influential variables, providing deeper interpretability. Extensive evaluations across three diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of this framework, surpassing individual classifiers and existing ensemble models in both balanced and highly imbalanced settings. This research paves the way for more reliable and transparent fraud detection systems, capable of adapting to evolving fraud tactics in real-world financial environments."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a probabilistic simulation framework for quantitatively evaluating the contribution of solar cell generators (SCGs) to modern power systems. Unlike conventional generators using storable fuels modeled by simple two states, solar generation is non-storable and inherently uncertain, requiring a more realistic approach. A multi-state probabilistic model is therefore developed—not as a fixed structure, but as a direct reflection of solar resource variability. By integrating the PV output curve with the empirical probability density function (pdf) of solar irradiance, the model captures weather-dependent generation behavior. Case studies on a scaled Jeju Island system verify its effectiveness in evaluating reliability (LOLE, EENS), production cost, and CO₂ emissions, and demonstrate its value for scenario-based planning under increased solar penetration. The proposed framework highlights the transition from deterministic assumptions to probabilistic realism, offering a robust foundation for sustainable and data-driven energy planning."

    "abstract": "The issue of network security is extremely urgent; an effective intrusion detection system is becoming increasingly important for modern network security. Thus, interpretable AI methods have played a role in real-world IDS. This study used two machine learning models to analyze the UKM-IDS20 and NSL-KDD datasets, namely LightGBM and CNN, mainly for training and evaluating binary and multi-label network traffic data. Moreover, interpretable artificial intelligence techniques such as SHAP and LIME were required to interpret the models. SHAP and LIME highlight the different feature importance patterns among models and enhance artificial intelligence models' transparency, understandability, and credibility. During the usage of SHAP, for the LightGBM binary classification model, the top 5 features contribute more than 72% to the interpretability of the model. Among them, the feature dst_bytes has a relatively significant impact. The same situation is that in the LIME analysis stage, the contribution value of dst_bytes is also the highest, which fully demonstrates that there is a high degree of consistency between SHAP and LIME. Moreover, in the NSL-KDD dataset, the outputs of CNN models such as Normal, DoS, Probe and R2L all achieved perfect scores (100%). Only the performance of the U2R class declined, with an accuracy of 80% and a recall rate of 36%. LightGBM has achieved excellent performance on the UKM IDS dataset, with a Metasploit accuracy score of 99%, which indicates that compared with CNN, LightGBM performs better in both binary classification and multi-classification scenarios. Therefore, adaptive intrusion detection systems are crucial for protecting computer networks. Furthermore, the continuous update of the IDS dataset also enables the proposed system to be applied to the datasets related to recent attacks for testing."

In this present study, we have created a full machine learning system based on voice recordings as well as handwriting photographs to render PD diagnosis more consistent and precise. For the vocal aspect, we extract time-frequency features like MFCCs, spectral rolloff, and zero-crossing rate from on-the-fly audio and then process them through a Random Forest model. At the same time, we process handwriting features, which are affected by the movement problems in PD, through a convolutional neural network on black-and-white images. The system combines the output from each model using an ensemble method to give the ultimate diagnosis. Tests show that this voice-and-handwriting-based method is better than methods based on individual modalities alone. It has the potential to be an early-detection and telemedicine tool that is non-invasive, user-friendly, and low-cost."

A controller network produces candidate structures from model input; reinforcement learning guides the search in this work. The improved CNNs found by NAS were more accurate in classification and ran faster than hand-made baselines. The models were also superior at generalizing over many low-variance samples.

Highfrequency trading prediction using conventional machine learning techniques is limited to performance since centralised processes generate privacy issues along with the delay and modelling biases due to limited data variability. The current study introduces a novel framework that combines Federated Learning technology with Long Short-Term Memory neural networks to obtain higher accuracy of the prediction of HFT and data privacy. The scientists plan to develop an HFT trend prediction method enabling encryption security with the combination of FL and LSTM concepts. This method is based on an integration of FL technologies and LSTM neural networks to provide distributed model training while preserving the confidentiality of raw sensitive data and market generalisation using different trading setups. During its analysis, the proposed Federated-LSTM framework processed NIFTY-50, NEPSE and SP-Feb 2021 datasets. The designed framework provided impressive performance output with up to 98.3 % accuracy, 98.1 % precision, 97.8 % recall, and a 98 % F1 score. The model used in the proposed project has demonstrated superior degrees of accuracy and had greater strength than other approaches, DNN-DWT and MLP and LSTM-CNN. FL with LSTM generates better HFT predictions that preserve the integrity of data protection. The method opens up new avenues of producing resistant financial trading methods that provide accurate outcomes."

The present study explores the influence of interactivity and personalization upon Gen Z's experience, namely how perceived relevance acts as a mediating variable for social site use. With data drawn from a sample of 412 members of Gen Z, the research employed a 17-question questionnaire to collect data and the SEM-PLS method of data analysis. All the hypotheses proposed in the study were supported through the findings. Specifically, the study proved that content personalization and interactive features both boost users' perception of content relevance. This sense of relevance, in turn, plays a key role in driving social media engagement—it effectively closes the gap between personalization and interactivity and higher user engagement. These insights provide important direction for marketers seeking to create content strategies that will truly resonate with Gen Z and result in higher engagement on social media."

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of edge computing has made large-scale data analytics possible, but it also raised concerns over scalability, security, and the effectiveness of communications. Under decentralized scenarios, conventional Federated Learning (FL) methods struggle with heterogeneous devices, constrained bandwidth, and security vulnerabilities. This work proposes a Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) framework that enhances resource efficiency, scalability, and privacy for large-scale data analysis in edge scenarios to mitigate the above problems. Our approach introduces a multi-level aggregation structure where the resulting model is enhanced by a global server, but intermediate nodes perform regional aggregation, and edge devices train models locally. By restricting the exposure of raw data, this hierarchical framework enhances data privacy, reduces communication cost, and relieves computing bottlenecks. Compared to traditional FL, experimental evaluations on real-world datasets indicate that it reduces bandwidth usage by 40%, improves model accuracy by 8–12%, and enhances training efficiency by 35%. Applications where safe and scalable analytics are crucial, like smart cities, industrial IoT, and personalized healthcare, gain significantly from the proposed approach. Federated learning in edge computing can be a solid basis for HFL, encouraging the development of safe, effective, and flexible AI-powered analytics, as per our investigation."

The suggested approach maximizes audio signal feature extraction efficiency by using a transformer-based neural network that includes shared and task-specific layers. While the standard encoder stores high-level language and auditory features, individual task decoders improve emotional detection and auxiliary task representations. Self-attention guarantees adaptive feature weighting, therefore resisting speaker fluctuation and noise. The research seeks to make virtual assistants, customer support bots, and mental health monitoring apps more accurate, smart, and customized, enhancing real-time human-computer interaction (HCI) systems. Additional context from supplementary activities helps users to generalize their emotions. Experimental results using benchmark SER datasets reveal a quite significant 96.5% increase in emotional recognition efficiency compared to conventional single-task models. This work increases AI-driven human-computer interaction through enhanced emotional perception and reaction of robots. Improving real-time deployment in edge devices and extending it to multilingual datasets should be the main priorities of future development."

While proportional-integral (PI) control remains the prevailing standard due to its intuitive design and high stability, it exhibits limitations in achieving fast dynamic response and high robustness for multiple operating points. Based on the framework of PI controllers, a neural network controller is proposed in this paper. The inherent structure allows it to be interpretable, and the nonlinear characteristics make it particularly advantageous for boost converters operating in quasi-resonant mode. A comparative analysis between the control performance of a PI controller and proposed neural network controller demonstrates the advantages of this method."

This study quantifies the hosting capacity for distributed energy resources (DERs) and additional (spare) loads that can be connected without violating operational limits or requiring network upgrades. A 31-bus distribution test system, modeled for time-domain analysis, is assessed using DIgSILENT PowerFactory’s hosting-capacity function under varied operating conditions. Results indicate that, at the CPUT bus during BESS charging, up to 20.24 MW of DER can be accommodated while respecting constraints. When BESS delivers active power, allowable spare-load capacity increases markedly: approximately 70% of buses exhibit enhanced hosting capability, with more than 50% spare-load accommodation. The findings provide actionable guidance on integrating DERs and leveraging BESS to defer upgrades while maintaining secure operation."

Traditional security methods struggle to keep up with the scale and complexity of 6G environments, which face increased risks of cyberattacks. To address these demands, the proposed architecture combines Tor-style multi-hop routing with real-time intrusion detection via a 1D-CNN model, dynamic traffic rerouting using an SDN controller, and secure key rotation managed through blockchain smart contracts. This integrated system enables intelligent, scalable, and automated defense by quickly detecting attacks like DoS, maintaining seamless traffic flow, and ensuring trusted, immutable key management across massive device networks. Its flexibility and automation align perfectly with 6G's vision of AI-driven, secure, and privacypreserving communication, making it a robust solution for safeguarding the complex and highly connected 6G ecosystem. The results show that throughput decreased by 19.3% during the attack and recovered by 10.3% post-attack compared to the pre-attack phase. Delay increased by 22.1% during the attack and remained 12.6% higher than the pre-attack level even after mitigation. These findings indicate partial throughput recovery but with sustained delay overhead."

Traditional Post-Training Quantization, Quantization-Aware Training & Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methodologies exhibit limitations in accuracy, memory & inference efficiency respectively. Recently proposed Low-Rank Quantisation-Aware Training (LR-QAT), serves as a lightweight, memory & inference efficient general extended pretraining QAT method. This paper presents an elemental adaptation of LR-QAT, making it feasible to train large models like GPT-2 Medium & BERT-Base-Uncased on low resource consumer grade GPUs. Our method freezes pretrained weights, injects simulated low-bit noise in accordance to LR-QAT, trains LoRA adapters and quantization parameters within this grid, fuses the adapters into a single full-precision checkpoint, and finally emits BF16, INT8 & NF4 models from one training run. Experimental evaluations on benchmark Natural Language Processing tasks such as Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2) and Question-Answering Natural Language Inference (QNLI) from the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) dataset demonstrate that the proposed method edges past both traditional Post-Training Quantization and customized Quantized LoRA (QLoRA) in performance metrics, while maintaining comparable memory usages at reduced bit-widths."

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are essential tools for real-time monitoring, identifying, and preventing cyber threats. However, traditional IDS methods often struggle to detect unknown attacks, handle high-dimensional data, and adapt to evolving threat patterns, resulting in increased false positives and reduced accuracy. To address these challenges, this study proposes a Deep Autoencoder (DAE)-based framework that utilizes unsupervised learning to model standard behaviour patterns in financial network traffic. The DAE is trained solely on benign data and flags anomalies based on reconstruction errors, effectively detecting zero-day attacks and previously unseen intrusions. The proposed method is applied to real-time financial transaction logs and network activity data to monitor irregularities and cyber threats. Experimental results demonstrate that the DAE model significantly improves detection accuracy while reducing false alarms, outperforming conventional IDS techniques. This highlights the DAE's potential as a robust, intelligent intrusion detection mechanism tailored to financial cybersecurity environments."

Unlike a synchronous generator (SG), an IBR’s response to a disturbance depends on its controls, involving factors such as operating mode, current limits, and grid code requirements. Therefore, the large-signal behavior of IBRs and their impact on transient stability must be studied. This paper presents hypotheses rooted in the physics of the transient stability phenomenon, choosing the most accurate models for IBRs to study the phenomenon, and documents simulation results on the IEEE 9-bus test system. The simulation results corroborate the hypotheses and highlight the impact of different control designs and operating modes on the critical clearing time (CCT), the metric considered for transient stability in this paper."

In the first phase of this investigation, 45 data points were collected for the algorithm's training, including ZOI, dose, bacterial/fungal type, core size, and nanoparticle shape. As indicated by the feature significance investigation, the silver nanoparticles' core size is the most vital determinant of their antibacterial potential. Six distinct machine-learning regression techniques were then used to train the data, and four metrics-RMSE, MAE, MSE, and R2 were utilized to evaluate the models' efficiency. Additionally, the significance of the features incorporated into the prediction models has been assessed. The best model for forecasting antifungal and antibacterial activity has been found. Through this approach, researchers may use machine learning to reduce the need for trial and error while addressing the issues of cost and time consumption in laboratory studies."

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach for power electronic converter control, offering the capability to optimize switching behavior without relying on an explicit mathematical model of the circuit. This study applies a direct gate control (DGC) framework, in which the DRL agent directly determines the on/off state of the switching device, thereby eliminating the need for conventional PWM generation. The control policy is trained through interaction with a simulation model of a buck converter, and the reward function is carefully designed to balance voltage regulation accuracy and switching loss reduction. Building upon previous work, this paper analyzes the influence of the switching penalty coefficient in the reward function on control performance. Simulation results demonstrate that increasing the penalty effectively reduces the switching frequency while maintaining fast transient response and stable voltage regulation, achieving a flexible trade-off between efficiency and dynamic performance. Moreover, the DGC framework exhibits fast convergence and stable operation, enabled by its frequency-independent and direct control characteristics. These results highlight that appropriate reward parameter tuning is essential for achieving both robustness and efficiency in DRLbased converter control and suggest future potential for extending the reward formulation to minimize actual switching losses throughout transient operation."

    "abstract": "With the increasing popularity of drones in urban logistics and distribution, low-altitude airspace congestion and scheduling conflicts have become increasingly prominent. Achieving efficient and safe channel management has become a pressing issue. This paper proposes a drone logistics operation model based on hierarchical channel management. Tasks are scheduled in layers according to payload, speed, and mission type to address resource conflicts and operational risks under varying mission requirements. In terms of methodological design, this study constructs a system architecture encompassing task access and classification, channel allocation and optimization, and operational monitoring and feedback. An optimization objective function is introduced to balance operational efficiency and safety. Experimental verification in a real-world urban setting demonstrates that the hierarchical channel model significantly outperforms traditional models in terms of average task completion time, channel utilization, conflict rate, and emergency response time. Channel utilization is increased by over 25%, and conflict rate is reduced by approximately 35%. These results demonstrate that the proposed method not only effectively improves the overall operational efficiency of logistics tasks but also maintains system stability and robustness under high-demand and emergency response conditions. The research’s contribution lies in incorporating the hierarchical concept from transportation engineering into drone airspace management. It proposes a scalable hierarchical scheduling mechanism, providing new technical insights for the efficient operation of future urban drone logistics systems."

    "abstract": "Wind power has become an essential component of modern renewable energy systems. However, in real-world industrial settings, wind farm data often suffer from missing values due to communication failures, power fluctuations, or extreme weather conditions. These data gaps pose significant challenges to downstream tasks such as forecasting and operational scheduling. Existing deep learning-based imputation methods are typically point-wise and fail to model the structured and temporal nature of missing data in wind power systems, resulting in suboptimal performance.To address this issue, we propose TA-MaskImpute, a novel imputation framework that integrates dynamic segment masking and temporal-aware strategies for wind power data restoration. Built upon the pretrained time-series model Timer, our framework adopts a decoder-only structure for lightweight transfer learning. Specifically, we introduce: (1) a dynamic segment masking mechanism that samples mask locations and lengths from statistical distributions (e.g., Gaussian or Pois-son), combined with a staged masking schedule to improve generalization and training diversity; and(2) a temporal-aware guidance module that addresses the overlooked autocorrelation in label sequences by incorporating frequency-domain consistency into the training objective, thereby complementing time-domain reconstruction and improving robustness in multi-step imputation.Extensive experiments on real-world multi-site wind farm datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and stability, showing strong potential for practical deployment in industrial wind power scenarios."

Using multi-year field data and ERA5-Land weather inputs, the proposed model achieved a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 4.76 days and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.62 days, improving prediction accuracy by over 15% compared to a conventional linear degreeday model (RMSE: 5.63 days). Partial dependence analysis revealed a saturating delay effect beyond six heat-wave days, particularly when stress occurred within $\\mathbf{1 0 - 1 5 \\%}$ of cumulative GDD around floral initiation. The model generalized well across cultivars and site-years, providing a robust and interpretable tool for phenology modeling under heat stress.

It features a centralized manager that orchestrates a distributed fleet of container hosts via a secure agent-based model and utilizes a VPN gateway to enforce strict network isolation, effectively separating the control and data planes. Evaluation of the prototype provides concrete evidence of its capabilities: a single host can concurrently support a class size of 25 isolated lab environments, while its load-balancing engine seamlessly distributes requests across multiple nodes to ensure horizontal scalability. Furthermore, security assessments confirm robust user isolation, with all inter-container and control-plane access attempts successfully blocked. The findings establish SiberBox as a viable, cost-effective blueprint for academic institutions to deploy their own flexible and secure hands-on cybersecurity laboratories, thereby helping to democratize practical cyber education."

This work discusses a transfer learning method for automated brain-tumour analysis on MRI scans, we implemented a convolutional neural network that learns to recognise the unique spatial and textural patterns of each category. The model reliably separates glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumours and healthy tissue by extracting multi-scale features, progressively refining them through stacked convolutional and pooling layers, and mapping the resulting representation to class probabilities via fully connected layers and soft-max activation. The system offered high classification accuracy with less computational power, making it suitable for clinical applications.

To address these limitations, this paper proposes ACBLM (Attention-Based CNN-BiLSTM Model), which integrates a 1D-CNN to extract local action features, a bidirectional LSTM to capture global temporal dependencies, and an attention mechanism to focus on key behaviors while suppressing noise. Experiments on six rational and four irrational planning domains show that ACBLM consistently outperforms GRNet and LGR across various observation ratios, achieving higher accuracy and stability, particularly under low observability and complex behavioral scenarios. The results demonstrate ACBLM’s robustness, generalization capability, and potential for real-world applications."

    "abstract": "Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) has been considered as a competitive candidate multiple access technology to address the challenge of high spectrum efficiency and massive connectivity for 6G communications. However, the use of uniform quantization with limited accuracy may lead to considerable BER performance degradation for the message passing algorithm (MPA) in SCMA detection. In practical communication systems, SCMA operates with channel coding to provide low-latency and reliable communication, and low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are employed in this work. To address this issue, the quasi-uniform quantizer is proposed, where the uniform quantization strategy is adopted when the probability information value is small, otherwise, the non-uniform quantization is used, which improves the dynamic range of message exchanging in MPA and minimum sum algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed quasi-uniform quantizer achieves superior BER performance even with lower quantization precision compared to the uniform quantizer, and subsequently, the computation cost for hardware implementation can be reduced."

Previous studies have explored various algorithms aiming to extracted the signals and classify Autism Spectral Disorder (ASD) based on Electroencephalography (EEG) signals, offering valuable insights. However, there is still scope for improvement in handling highly non-stationary signals across ASD diagnosis. The article propose a model that named as Convolution neural network (CNN-ASD) and the Continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to properly take features from EEG signals. This approach uses an adaptive filter bank to control dynamic data in the frequency domain to accurately distinguish both stages. Our experiments demonstrate that, the proposed model outperforms BiLSTM with AM and ResNet50, and it achieves notable classification accuracy for normal and ASD classes. This method enhances the performance of medical devices and benefits for their use in healthcare."

When used to manage private financial data shared across several organizations, centralized machine learning (ML) systems pose data privacy, security, and compliance issues. For competitiveness and regulatory purposes, financial companies may conceal customer information, which can reduce the accuracy of models and datasets. Cyberattacks on central archives complicate the development of secure, collaborative credit scoring systems. This study proposes the Blockchain-Enabled Federated Learning Credit Risk Assessment System (BFL-CRA) to address these issues. A permissioned Blockchain and Federated Learning (FL) protect raw data and decentralize model training across financial organizations. The BFL-CRA protocol requires each institution to establish a model and utilize blockchain smart contracts to deliver encrypted model modifications.

By integrating immutable blockchain logs, audit trails can be made tamper-proof, enhancing trust and regulatory visibility. However, existing centralized compliance systems face significant challenges, including vulnerability to data breaches, a lack of transparency, and difficulties in maintaining cross-jurisdictional regulatory alignment. To address these limitations, this work proposes a novel framework that combines Federated AI with Blockchain-Integrated Audit Logging (F-AI-BC-AL). Federated learning enables decentralized model training across institutions without sharing raw financial data, preserving privacy and reducing data transfer risks. Concurrently, blockchain ensures every transaction, data access event, and AI-driven compliance check is logged immutably using smart contracts for policy enforcement. The proposed method is applied to real-time Anti-Money Laundering (AML) monitoring in cross-border financial transactions, enabling institutions to detect suspicious activities while collaboratively maintaining secure auditability. Results demonstrate enhanced detection accuracy, data confidentiality, and improved regulatory traceability, with a significant reduction in audit reconciliation time. The outcome establishes a secure, scalable, and regulation-aligned compliance ecosystem that is resilient to tampering and privacy violations."

To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel framework named WESP-LAR (Wavelet Enhanced Signal Processing for Low-latency Audio Recognition), which leverages Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for efficient time-frequency feature extraction and integrates lightweight neural models for classification. WESP-LAR is optimized for low-memory usage and real-time execution on edge processors. The proposed method enhances audio feature representation while significantly reducing latency and computational overhead, making it ideal for embedded AI scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that WESP-LAR achieves superior accuracy and robustness across diverse audio datasets, outperforming traditional FFT-based and raw waveform approaches."

Despite its potential, one of the critical challenges in MEC systems is optimizing energy consumption while maintaining acceptable latency and ensuring Quality of Service (QoS). In this work, we present an ideal task offloading technique that successfully strikes a compromise between latency and energy usage in extensive IoT communication networks. Considering energy limitations and delay sensitivity, IoT device users assess their local conditions and decide whether to offload compute jobs in the first step. To further reduce MEC resource constraints, the second stage dynamically coordinates with central cloud servers to optimize power allocation and channel selection algorithm. The blended offloading system ensures effective use of edge and cloud computing infrastructures. Through simulations the suggested algorithm performs significantly better than conventional offloading techniques for task delay and energy usage. The outcomes demonstrate the usefulness of our model in real-time Internet of Things scenarios, providing a scalable and efficient solution for intelligent, energy-conscious, and delay-aware task offloading."

Trustworthy data transfer coupled with maximizing energy usage is a hugely significant problem. Adaptive mobile sinks navigate the network dynamically to gather data, making them less congested and consuming less energy as their trajectories shift according to data streams, node density and network status. This paper suggests a proposal of a graph neural network to predictive management of adaptive mobile sinks in WSNs, known as Connectivity-Aware Graph Neural Network (CAGNN-MSP-WSN). First, sensor node input data is collected and sensory data is trained through a Connectivity-Aware Graph Neural Network (CAGNN) to determine mobile sink routing. To maximize the weight parameters of CAGNN classifier, an Augmented Gold Rush Optimizer (AGRO) is presented to improve routing prediction accuracy. The CAGNN-MSP-WSN is applied and tested on the basis of the performance metrics, such as accuracy, error rate, energy consumption, and computational time. The findings indicate that CAGNN-MSP-WSN method has a higher accuracy of 30.57, 17.21, and 24.10 and lower computational time of 19.84, 24.93, and 31.62, respectively than available approaches."

Six distinct approaches to solving TP's were investigated to determine an efficient place to start for cost optimization: NWCM, VAM, KSAM, Raval's Approximation, AMSTP, and AMM. Each method's accuracy and computational speed were evaluated using self-developed Python code across ten test cases. Solutions were manually verified and cross-validated using MS Excel to ensure their correctness. The results showed that KSAM provided the most precise results, matching the optimal cost in 60 % of cases and having the lowest average deviation (2.60%). VAM performed well with a 4.18% deviation, while Raval's Approximation (7.83%) and AMM (9.06%) had moderate accuracy. NWCM, which does not consider costs, had the highest deviation (44.23 %), making it the least suitable for cost-focused decisions. AMSTP, though the fastest, had a higher deviation (10.31 %), making it a good choice when speed is a priority but not ideal for accuracy. Execution times showed that AMSTP was the quickest, while Raval's Approximation took the longest. This study highlights that KSAM is best for precise cost calculations, AMSTP is useful for fast estimates, and NWCM should be avoided in cost-sensitive situations. These insights can help businesses make smarter transportation decisions, reducing costs and improving efficiency."

    "abstract": "Psychoactive drugs, which influence mood, awareness, thoughts, and behavior, are widely researched upon due to their impact on both individuals and society. This work presents a Psychoactive Fusion Machine Learning framework consisting of a classification model to identify psychoactive drugs based on chemical attributes and drug usage, utilizing personality traits and demographic data. Combined with a regression model to predict impulsivity and sensation-seeking scores (ImpSS) using demographic and personality features. This model leverages various algorithms including XGBoost resulting in an accuracy of 85 % for the identification of psychoactive drugs, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine yielding high accuracies of around 97 % when used in the prediction of behavioral patterns under drug influence, Random Forest with an accuracy of 83 % in the prediction of Impulsivity. The results demonstrate the potential of combining personality psychology and chemical analysis with machine learning to achieve precise and explainable predictions, opening pathways for applications in healthcare, policy-making, and substance use research, such as early predictions of critical care patients and patients who need an immediate intervention in order to avoid the severities of the abuse."

    "abstract": "Despite the broad applicability of recommender system, these remains underutilized in many academic services, such as student assessment, evaluation, and monitoring. To address this gap, this study aims to design and develop a recommender system for undergraduate program study plans, with a focus on assisting irregular students. A greedy algorithm is employed to provide a simpler, more precise, and efficient approach to creating a Program of Study (POS). The frontend and backend are developed using Nuxt and Vue, while PostgreSQL is used for the database. The accuracy is validated by comparing its generated study plans with those created by domain experts. The results show no significant difference in recommendations, indicating high accuracy in course selection. Nevertheless, variations are observed in course allocation and the number of units per semester, allowing the system to maximize the available units in each term. As a result, fewer units are undertaken in the latter part of the curriculum. This means that the developed system optimizes the academic load distribution. Additionally, the system outperforms manual evaluation in terms of time efficiency with an average of 0.32 seconds, compared to the 30-minute to 1-hour manual process. These demonstrate that the system has the potential to optimize academic planning, which ensures efficient course distribution, maintains accuracy, and reduces processing time."

Manual classification and evaluation processes are often time-consuming, error-prone, and lack scalability. This study introduces a hybrid ensemble of deep learning models aimed at automating the detection, classification, and freshness estimation of flowers. The proposed system targets five flower categories—daisy, dandelion, rose, sunflower, and tulip—utilizing state-of-the-art architectures including CNN, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0, and VGG16. To enhance predictive performance, ensemble techniques such as model averaging and stacking are employed. In addition, freshness estimation is conducted by analyzing five visual parameters through image processing techniques. Experimental results reveal that the ensemble model achieves an average classification accuracy of 86%, validating its effectiveness. This hybrid approach offers a robust and scalable solution for real-time floral classification and freshness prediction, with potential applications in agriculture, floriculture, and supply chain automation."

In this paper, the access point (AP) duplex mode optimization problem for a multi-static ISAC system based on network-assisted full-duplex (NAFD) that supports simultaneous uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) communications is studied. We introduce a comprehensive performance evaluation framework that employs communication rate and the squared position error bound (SPEB) as the evaluation metrics for communication and sensing performance. To tackle this multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP), we propose an AP mode optimization algorithm based on Deep Q-Network (DQN) to maximize the communication rate and minimize the system SPEB simultaneously, and analyze the trade-off between the communication performance and sensing performance of the system. The simulation results show that the method proposed can maintain good convergence for different communication and sensing performance weights."

    "abstract": "Prolonged exposure to high-energy visible (HEV) blue light from digital displays is a growing health concern, linked to digital eye strain, sleep cycle disruption, and potential long-term retinal damage. Conventional blue light filters are typically static or manually configured, failing to adapt to the dynamic nature of on-screen content, which often leads to suboptimal filtering or a compromised visual experience. This paper introduces LuminaAdapt, a novel, real-time adaptive filtering system designed to mitigate blue light exposure intelligently. The system operates by continuously capturing the display content through a low-latency screen-sharing pipeline. Each frame is processed in real-time to extract key colorimetric and luminance properties, including average brightness, dominant hue, and color temperature. A novel control algorithm leverages these extracted features to automatically and dynamically modulate the color temperature of a system-level overlay filter. This content-aware approach ensures that the filtering intensity is precisely tailored to the visual information being displayed, applying stronger filtering for bright, blue-rich content (e.g., documents, web pages) and lighter filtering for dark or color-sensitive content (e.g., media, graphics). Experimental results demonstrate that LuminaAdapt can reduce blue light emissions in the critical 440–490 nm wavelength range by an average of 68.7% during typical computer usage, significantly lowering user exposure while preserving high perceptual image quality and color fidelity. By providing an automated and adaptive solution, LuminaAdapt presents a promising approach to enhancing digital wellbeing without requiring user intervention."

VGG16 and DenseNet provided detailed high-level features, EfficientNet offered efficient feature extraction, and MobileNetV3 enabled rapid processing. Later, a hybrid model was developed by merging the features extracted from the above applied models for emotion-based ASD identification.

    "abstract": "With the increasing demand for terrain visualization in many fields, such as augmented reality, virtual reality and geo-graphic mapping, traditional terrain scene modeling methods encounter great challenges in processing efficiency, content realism and semantic consistency. To address these challenges, we propose a Text-Guided Arbitrary-Resolution Terrain Scene Generation Network (TG-TSGNet), which contains a ConvMamba-VQGAN, a Text Guidance Sub-network and an Arbitrary-Resolution Image Super-Resolution Module (ARSRM). The ConvMamba- VQGAN is built on top of the Conv-Based Local Representation Block (CLRB) and the Mamba-Based Global Representation Block (MGRB) that we design, to utilize local and global features. Furthermore, the Text Guidance Sub-network comprises a text encoder and a Text-Image Alignment Module (TIAM) for the sake of incorporating textual semantics into image representation. In addition, the ARSRM can be trained together with the ConvMamba-VQGAN, to perform the task of image super-resolution. To fulfill the text-guided terrain scene generation task, we derive a set of textual descriptions for the 36,672 images across the 38 categories of the Natural Terrain Scene Data Set (NTSD). These descriptions can be used to train and test the TG-TSGNet<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>. Experimental results show that the TG-TSGNet outperforms, or at least performs comparably to, the baseline methods in image realism and semantic consistency with proper efficiency. We believe that the promising performance should be due to the ability of the TG-TSGNet not only to capture both the local and global characteristics and the semantics of terrain scenes, but also to reduce the computational cost of image generation."

    "abstract": "In this paper, an all-metal high-efficiency dual-port phase mode antenna (PMA) is proposed. By adjusting the phase difference between the two ports in the PMA, distinct characteristic modes are excited, enabling a continuous transition of the radiation pattern from a conical beam to an axial beam. Consequently, the PMA achieves element-level two-dimensional beam steering, with the main beam capable of scanning within ±45° in the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">xoz</i> plane and ±48° in the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">yoz</i> plane. Furthermore, high port isolation exceeding 30 dB in the dual-port PMA is achieved by introducing a novel decoupling technology, named the evanescent-wave-based decoupling method. Due to its all-metal structure and high port isolation, the PMA maintains a total efficiency exceeding 98% under all excitation conditions. To validate its potential for high-efficiency wide-angle scanning, a 4 × 4 planar phased array based on the PMA is designed and fabricated. By employing enlarged element spacing and introducing the defected ground structure, mutual coupling between array elements is significantly reduced, resulting in improved array efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that the 4 × 4 array achieves wide-angle beam steering of ±66° in the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">xoz</i> plane and ±90° in the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">yoz</i> plane, with a total efficiency ranging from 79% to 94.5%."

To be compatible with the prevailing digital systems, a fully digital generative SemCom framework is proposed by designing a Channel Discrete Denoising Diffusion Model (CD3M). To capture symbol transitions under digital channel distortions, a discrete Markov chain model is first constructed, which guides CD3M to learn robust denoising dynamics over digital constellations. On this basis, a unified generative digital SemCom architecture is established by integrating CD3M with Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQVAE), i.e. CD3M-VQVAE, which enables channel-adaptive denoising with a single codec pair. Simulation results demonstrate that CD3M-VQVAE outperforms other single-codec and classical coded-modulation schemes, and can reach the performance of multi-codec methods at moderate SNRs under certain compression rates."

JPAs are better suited to frequency domain simulations over a broad frequency range and parameter space. We present JPA simulations using the recently released flux-aware Josephson junction (JJ) and inductor models in Keysight Advanced Design Systems (ADS). We simulate two different flux-driven JPAs: one based on an RF SQUID, and another based on a DC SQUID. We efficiently run harmonic balance simulations over a wide range of circuit parameters. We compare the use of RF and DC SQUIDs in these JPAs by analyzing their simulation results. This work provides a foundation for future SQUID-based JPA simulations in Keysight ADS."

This coil can be fixed directly to the shaft, which helps provide the mechanical strength needed for high-speed rotation. However, because of the shape characteristics of the REBCO tape, the coil ends tend to become long, increasing the axial length of the motor. In addition, excessive bending or twisting can damage the tape; thus, careful design is necessary. In this study, we developed a design method to shorten the saddle-shaped field coil and evaluated its electromagnetic performance. We introduced a generalized flatwise curvature to represent bending and twisting and set the allowable curvature of the REBCO tape to 0.1 mm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sup> based on its mechanical limits. Using this condition, we designed two types of shortened coils. Model A arranges the coils based on the curvature of the innermost coil, while Model B equalizes the curvature of all coils to prevent interference at the coil ends. Three-dimensional finite-element analysis revealed that the axial gap flux density distribution of both models is almost the same. However, Model B has a slightly larger high-flux-density region because its straight part is longer, resulting in better output performance. The obtained torque also exhibits a strong proportional relationship with the axial integral of the gap flux density, confirming that the coil ends are important regions that contribute to motor output."

    "abstract": "From mass media theory, the message flow and the opinion evolution in real social networks adhere to a two-step communication process: opinion leaders first receive the messages from the message sources, and then convey their opinions to the normal agents. During this process, opinion leaders often exhibit confirmation bias by updating their opinions based on messages close to their opinions, reflecting their limited willingness to accept dissonant messages. However, few prior works jointly consider the two-step communication process involving message sources, opinion leaders, and normal agents, as well as the confirmation bias of opinion leaders. In this paper, we propose a unified framework called MOLENA to analyze how messages f low and opinions evolve in the two-step communication process. In the MOLENA framework, we introduce a mathematically tractable message preference model to quantitatively describe the confirmation bias. We obtain the approximate analytical solution of the opinion leaders' and normal agents' steady-state opinions, and theoretically analyze the influence of system parameters on their steady-state opinions. Furthermore, we examine the influence of messages on opinion leaders' steady-state opinions and study how opinion leaders influence normal agents' steady state opinions in the two-step communication process. Finally, we validate our theoretical analysis through numerical experiments and verify the correctness of the MOLENA framework via social experiments. This study is critical to understanding how messages f low and opinions evolve in real social networks and to designing effective mechanisms to guide agents' opinions."

    "abstract": "Visible light communication (VLC) is expected to be a key component of future wireless networks due to its abundant license-free spectrum, inherent high-level security, and the already deployed lighting infrastructure. VLC performance, however, depends on device orientation and the availability of an unobstructed line-of-sight (LoS) link, with transmitter semi-angle and receiver field-of-view (FoV) further affecting alignment, coverage, and reliability. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can mitigate blockages, orientation issues, and mobility challenges, but their data rates remain far below those of direct LoS links. This article introduces the novel concept of movable access points (MAPs)-aided VLC systems, where dynamically repositioned APs provide new degrees of freedom to ensure LoS connectivity, and transmitter-receiver alignment while providing ultra-high data rates for mobile users. Simulation results show MAPs outperform RIS-aided, fixed- AP, and RIS-only VLC systems in dynamic environments. The article also outlines key challenges and future research directions, including integration with emerging wireless technologies."

    "abstract": "Winding deformation in power transformers under Short-Circuit (SC) faults compromises equipment integrity and grid reliability, yet conventional diagnostic methods, such as Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) and Frequency Response Analysis (FRA), rely on offline procedures, hindering timely fault detection. This study proposes a non-intrusive, real-time diagnostic technique based on Leakage Magnetic Field (LMF) analysis to quantify axial and radial winding deformation. A three-dimensional electromagnetic-structural finite element model, developed for a 110 kV transformer, establishes a nonlinear mapping between LMF distribution and mechanical stress, validated by simulations showing a 26-fold deformation increase under fault conditions. A high-sensitivity magnetic sensor array, strategically placed on the transformer tank, captures dynamic LMF variations, following optimized layout principles for enhanced accuracy. Coupled with a Least Squares (LS) based magnetic field inversion algorithm, the system achieves precise deformation diagnosis with errors below 1.3%, enabling millisecond-level fault warnings. Experimental validation confirms the method’s accuracy and feasibility, offering a cost-effective, safe solution for real-time condition monitoring in smart grids. This approach overcomes the spatial-temporal limitations of traditional diagnostics, supporting predictive maintenance and paving the way for advanced fault warning systems."

    "abstract": "Large-scale and high-precision classification are key merits of spaceborne hyperspectral technique, providing a vital basis for rapid discovery of diverse anomalies. However, its vast data volume poses major challenges for real-time applications. Compared to classical hyperspectral image classification (HSIC) methods, deep learning (DL) strategies have improved accuracy but still face bottlenecks due to model complexity and cannot be conducted on resource-constrained orbital platforms. Thus, we propose a lightweight framework to achieve the optimal trade-off among memory, time, and accuracy. The key breakthrough adopts a memory-efficient dimensionality reduction (DR) method that reduces the memory cost by over 60% while breaking away from the conventional paradigm that spectral DR inevitably compromise spectral-spatial structures, thus greatly enhancing information fidelity. Moreover, the created convolution-enhanced Transformer (CET) fulfills seamless integration of global–local feature using minimal convolutional blocks on the single encoder, thereby remarkably reducing network complexity and enhancing computational speed. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our model matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and exhibits remarkably low computational cost (parameters < 35 K, FLOPs < 300 M, GPU memory < 1.5GB), suggesting its potential for onboard deployment. And the devised architecture reduces detection time by at least 20% while sustaining robust capability across varying imaging scenarios. Our results create a new efficiency-accuracy paradigm for real-time HSIC, crucial for achieving instantaneous remote sensing. The source code will be released at https://github.com/leixia9601/SSUFCT after accepted."

    "abstract": "The water hammer effect, an energy dissipation phenomenon in fluid pipelines triggered by transient fluid impact, possesses both destructive potential and exploitable energy. Addressing traditional energy harvesters’ narrow bandwidth and low spatial efficiency, this article designs a multisource heterogeneous ambient energy harvester. This device achieves efficient recovery of water hammer impact energy through the synergistic operation of piezoelectric, electromagnetic, and triboelectric mechanisms. The harvester employs a ring-symmetrical three-dimensional structure. By utilizing multiple sets of piezoelectric cantilever beams and a free inertia vibrator, combined with a modal decoupling strategy, it converts axial impact into radial multimodal vibrations, synchronously capturing tri-axial energy. Experimental validation confirmed the power density metrics and electromechanical conversion efficiency under multisource synergy. The piezoelectric volume energy density reached 36.65 mW/cm<inline-formula content-type=\"math/tex\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\" version=\"MathJax\">$^3$</tex-math> </inline-formula>, while the electromagnetic and triboelectric surface power densities were 0.56 and 0.12 mW/cm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>, respectively.

    "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition that impacts individuals of all ages. This disorder comprises of symptoms ranging from social and communicational challenges to an exhibition of repetitive behaviors. Early diagnosis and prognosis of ASD is focal for managing its symptoms, supplementing learning outcomes, and social skill development. Conventional diagnosis of ASD based on behavioral evaluations confronts problems owing to the lack of clear-cut rules. On the other hand, Machine Learning and Deep Learning models-based techniques excel in diagnosing ASD by assessing behavioral factors, finding even the tiniest contrariety in gaze and facial attributes. This paper aims to propose an AI-based Autism Detection System leveraging two distinct models. For children aged 2 to 8, XceptionNet model is employed to assess facial dysmorphology in Autistic children's images with an accuracy of 85%, while individuals aged 9 and above undergo evaluation by Light Gradient Boosting Machine Classifier which considers diverse indicators, such as the ASD score, age, gender, ethnicity, etc. to detect Autism with 99% accuracy. Thus, the proposed models enhance the accuracy of ASD detection by addressing the distinct characteristics and requirements of people of all age groups with Autism."

Traditional URL classification techniques often rely on manually engineered features, which can easily be circumvented through obfuscation methods and also lack adapt- ability. This research aims at designing a robust and intelligent character-level CNN in order to learn URLs into a variety of classes through end-to-end learning. Raw URLs are fed into the model at the character level, and convolutional layers are used to extract sequential patterns bearing information on the URL type. Tests carried out on a public dataset show our approach achieves a test accuracy of 98.2, with both high precision and recall in all classes. The study proves the deep learning paradigm is effective when applied to raw sequential data in cybersecurity and provides interpretability and performance benefits for character- level models."

To ensure fairness in resource allocation, we first establish transmission rate models for each communication link. We then formulate an optimization problem aimed at maximizing Jain’s fairness index (J), subject to constraints on transmission power, bandwidth, and IRS configuration. To tackle this challenging non-convex problem, we develop a Multi-Agent Soft Actor-Critic (MASAC) algorithm tailored for joint resource optimization. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing significant improvements in both fairness and system throughput. Compared to baseline methods, our algorithm achieves a more balanced resource distribution while maintaining high overall performance."

The fine-tuned models achieved macro F1-scores of 0.77 for aspect detection and 0.84 for sentiment classification. The analysis shows that overall public sentiment is predominantly negative, with Smart Governance being the most discussed domain, driven by concerns over transparency and budget allocation. The study also uncovers a nearly balanced sentiment on Smart Economy and a paradoxical negative sentiment towards Smart Environment.

    "abstract": "Adaptive curriculum generation in mobile learning systems aims to personalize educational content based on learners' needs, preferences, and contextual factors. With the rise of mobile technology, intelligent curriculum adaptation has become essential for enhancing learning efficiency and engagement. However, existing methods often rely on static learner models or shallow personalization techniques, which fail to capture the complex and dynamic relationships among learners, content, and contexts. To address these limitations, this study proposes a Graph Attention Network-Based Learner Profiling (GAT-LP) framework that models learners and educational resources as interconnected nodes in a heterogeneous graph. The graph attention mechanism dynamically assigns weights to nodes based on their relevance, enabling fine-grained profiling and real-time curriculum adaptation. The GAT-LP framework is applied to generate personalized microlearning pathways in mobile environments, where learners receive content sequences optimized for their current knowledge state, interaction history, and peer influence. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves learning outcomes by 98.4%, engagement rates by 97.5%, content relevance by 97.4%, and adaptation latency by 96.3% compared to traditional methods. This highlights the potential of graph-based attention models in transforming mobile learning experiences through deeper personalization and contextual awareness."

Traditional cybersecurity training methods often fail to engage learners effectively or provide adequate assessment of knowledge retention. This paper presents a novel framework combining gamified cybersecurity training with Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven learning analytics specifically designed for UK Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) programs.This approach utilizes behavioural science principles together with machine learning algorithms and incorporates real-time performance tracking, predictive modelling, and automated content adaptation based on individual learning patterns to create personalized, adaptive learning experiences. This optimizes both engagement and improves cybersecurity competencies. The effectiveness of this approach is highlighted through case studies of UK-based implementations, including the Cyber Explorers program and Gamified Intelligent Cyber Behaviour Assessment and Skills Training (GICAST) initiative. These case studies demonstrate significant improvements in learner engagement and knowledge retention as well as skills application, through data such as 60% boost in learner engagement by gamified training and 77% improvement in concept understanding from GICAST. Moving beyond conventional compliance-based training to establish interactive, data-driven experiences, the proposed framework addresses the key challenges in cybersecurity education and fosters long-term behavioural change. Results of AI-enhanced gamification show its ability to effectively bridge the cybersecurity skills gap while providing data-driven insights to educators for continuous program improvement."

    "abstract": "The effective processing of API calls by cloud providers such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, or GCP has become increasingly challenging as multi-cloud adoption has increased. Reliability, cost maintenance, latency reduction, and performance improvement are some advantages of using several clouds. Traditional approaches frequently fail because they don't respond well to the dynamic and shifting nature of workloads in multi-cloud environment. We solve this by introducing a deep Q-network-based AI approach for autonomous API request routing. This provides reinforcement learning for picking the most relevant and valuable cloud provider based on live metric parameters such as latency, cost, and failure rates. The system remains versatile, subject to changing conditions, to ensure that performance optimization is achieved across AWS, Azure, and GCP. These findings show significant improvements and accomplishments in key performance indicators (KPI). API latency has been reduced from 250 ms to 140 ms, approximately a 44% reduction, with a corresponding decrease in the cost per request of 20%. The success rate has increased from 92% to 98%, and the failure rate has decreased from 8% to 2%. There is also a balanced load across the three clouds <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(34 \\%, 33 \\%$</tex>, and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$33 \\%)$</tex> with an energy savings of 10%. Thus, our results demonstrate that AI-enhanced reinforcement learning can be highly beneficial in enhancing multi-cloud API orchestration. Besides these, they will also be resource-efficient and therefore very scalable solutions for the modern-day cloud architectures."

This study proposes a comprehensive AI-driven framework that integrates machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict traffic demand and identify high-traffic zones in major U.S. cities. Leveraging the Highway Statistics Series: Urbanized Areas dataset, traditional ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) served as baselines, while DL models with deeper architectures (Dropout and Batch Normalization) were applied to better capture non-linear patterns. To model spatial dependencies inherent in urban traffic networks, GNN models—including GCN, GraphSAGE, and GAT—were applied by treating roadways and intersections as graph structures. Among all models, the Wide-Deep (DL) and GraphSAGE (GNN) achieved the highest accuracy (94% and 95%) with F1-scores of 0.93 and 0.93, respectively. These findings underscore the effectiveness of combining structural learning with deep/spatial architectures for urban road/traffic analysis. Beyond prediction, the framework offers actionable insights for urban planners-infrastructure stress, need for supplementary roads, and improving public transit system allocation, laying the groundwork for future extensions involving real-time data integration and adaptive traffic control via hybrid GNN-reinforcement learning models."

    "abstract": "The growing demand for high-resolution multimedia on System-on-Chip (SoC) platforms has made robust validation of Display Intellectual Property (IP) a critical aspect of silicon tape-out. Traditional RTL simulations are inadequate for exercising real-time display scenarios, leading to an increased focus on FPGA-based emulation and post-silicon debug methodologies. This paper presents a dual-phase validation framework for Display IP that leverages FPGA emulation for pre-silicon testing and a hardware platform for post-silicon validation. The methodology adopts configuration-driven regression scripts and test cases targeting functional, protocol, and performance features of the Display Processing Unit (DPU). Validation includes sanity checks, resolution upscaling, underrun simulation, Cyclic-Redundancy-Check(CRC) based accuracy testing, and DisplayPort protocol compliance tests. The proposed framework achieves greater than 95% functional coverage and approximately 90% feature coverage and supports faster bug detection and shortened debug cycles. The results demonstrate that the dual-phase approach is reusable, scalable and provides high confidence in silicon readiness of Display IPs integrated in modern SoCs."

WiFi channel state information (CSI) varies with human movement, providing rich spatiotemporal information for activity recognition tasks. Considering that the spatial characteristics of CSI signals can determine an individual’s location, the temporal characteristics can be used to analyze the motion state of the human body. This paper proposes a modified residual network architecture, constructing an inverted residual shuffle attention block (IRSAB) that emphasizes spatial and channel features while preserving temporal information. This information is fed into Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory(BiLSTM) to extract forward and backward temporal dependencies. Through comparative experiments with other existing models, our method achieved an average recognition accuracy of 99.06% on the UT_HAR dataset, surpassing existing approaches."

This paper focuses on the study of intelligent location awareness technologies in complex dynamic environments, proposing a hybrid fingerprint indoor positioning scheme based on Angle of Arrival (AOA) and Time of Arrival (TOA). The feasibility of the proposed scheme is analyzed. The scheme is based on channel modeling using scene geometric information, and utilizes the obtained Channel State Information (CSI) to estimate the AOA and TOA through algorithms based on enhanced matrices and matrix beams. The estimated AOA and TOA are used as fingerprints for training. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves high positioning accuracy in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) environments."

This paper presents a high-resolution methodology for estimating the effect of vegetation on window solar heat gain using LiDAR-derived 3D environment comprising of 2.5 D grid, 3D building models and vegetation. Within this environment, solar heat gain is computed per window triangle by incorporating dynamic shading via ray-casting. Results demonstrate that vegetation reduces cumulative annual window solar heat gain by $11.31 \\%$ in an urban setting, with greatest reductions observed on south-facing, upper-story windows and during summer months.

This research explores the psychological and social drivers behind gamers’ decisions to purchase virtual goods, with a focus on enjoyment, social influence, personal attitude, and repeated platform use. The study centers on understanding what truly motivates spending in a freemium environment. An online survey targeted Indonesian Steam users who had previously made in-game purchases. From the 202 valid responses, statistical analysis using PLS-SEM was applied to test behavioral relationships among key variables. The results suggest that consistent platform engagement and peer influence are stronger predictors of purchase decisions than personal attitudes. Contrary to expectations, attitude alone does not significantly shape buying behavior in this context. Instead, enjoyment fuels continued use, which in turn increases the likelihood of purchasing. These findings suggest that spending on digital goods is less a matter of rational choice and more a product of habit and social immersion. While the results provide valuable insights for digital platform designers and marketers, the focus on a specific demographic and platform limits broader generalization."

    "abstract": "Edge computing networks need to dynamically distribute their limited and heterogeneous computation resources to handle changing tasks efficiently. This paper proposes a new auction-based dynamic resource allocation strategy for completely decentralized, heterogeneous edge situations. To ensure fair and optimal task assignment, end-to-end resource exploitation is optimized by allowing independent edge nodes to bid aggressively for incoming tasks depending on their available capacity and processing quality in real time. Extensive experiments conducted on a heterogeneous five-node testbed show that, in contrast to conventional static allocation techniques, the auction-based mechanism achieves a very high 98.2 % utilization rate of resources, minimizes task rejection to zero, and significantly prevents residual resource fragmentation. Fairness metrics also make sure that nodes are assigned tasks more fairly. The system shows remarkable scalability and flexibility to near-saturation network conditions with minimal computation overhead. The study adds to the decentralized edge resource orchestration and offers promising possibilities for use cases in smart cities and the Internet of Things that are limited by latency. In the future, the model will be scaled to massive-scale real-time edge settings, communication overhead will be reduced, and adaptive bidding will be used to mitigate load concentration."

    "abstract": "Abstract-Among the many infrastructures transitioning in recent years toward more sustainable energy paradigms, Mountain Huts (MHs) deserve particular attention due to their location in fragile environments and frequent isolation from the main power system. As a result, their operation must rely solely on local electrical production. For this purpose, Diesel Generators (DGs) are currently their main or unique energy source, with a negative economic and environmental impact. In addition, especially in the Italian Alpine region, MHs are expected to experience a future increase in load consumption, due to their growing touristic popularity. A recent trend among visitors is to reach MHs by Electric Bicycles (EBs), which may require local recharging, thus further contributing to increasing the MH energy needs. This paper optimizes the size of a pool of renewable generators and energy storage systems, alongside the traditional DG, to supply the power required by a MH. Moreover, the effect of the presence of EBs is evaluated both as a challenge due to load increase, but also as a potential source of income and technical opportunity to improve energy management, via bidirectional battery charging. The results based on real load data from an Alpine hut show that the use of only DG has a cost more than four times higher than the proposed optimal solution. Additionally, the foreseen presence of EBs could generate an additional income, further reducing the total operational cost. Finally, the proposed EB recharging policy enables a further small economic benefit."

    "abstract": "Single-phase-supplied variable-speed drive (VSD) systems are widely used in industrial applications, typically following a two-stage design with a boost-type power factor correction (PFC) rectifier at the input and a three-phase voltage source inverter (VSI) at the output. However, the reliance on large electrolytic DC-link capacitors, required to buffer power pulsations at twice the grid frequency, together with the boost inductor, introduces drawbacks in terms of reliability, volume, cost, and complexity. To address these limitations, a dualinverter topology with a three-phase open-end winding (OEW) machine and the motor power pulsation buffer (MPPB) concept is employed. In this approach, power pulsations are absorbed by the total drive system’s inertia, drastically reducing the required DClink capacitance and thereby eliminating the need for electrolytic capacitors, which enables a more compact, reliable, and longlifespan drive system. This paper presents hardware verification of the dual-inverter MPPB system. A custom-built 1.8 kW demonstrator, supplied from a single-phase $230 \\mathrm{~V}_{\\text {rms }} \\mathrm{AC}$ grid and driving a threephase OEW motor, is developed and experimentally tested. The measured waveforms confirm that power pulsations are buffered in the mechanical inertia rather than in capacitors, while maintaining PFC operation, regulating the secondary DClink voltage, and ensuring stable speed control. These results validate the effectiveness of the dual-inverter MPPB concept."

    "abstract": "This paper experimentally verified the dynamic characteristics of a PV battery system that maximizes PV panel power generation using passive methods without a power conditioner. The method for maximizing power generation involves determining the number of PV panels to connect in series during the system design phase so that the maximum power point voltage of the PV array matches the battery voltage. After that, the PV array and battery are simply connected directly during the construction of the PV battery system. In practice, the maximum power point voltage of the PV array is affected by PV cell temperature. The design ensures these two voltages match at the cell temperature corresponding to high solar irradiance and high power generation. Previously, the highest cell temperature was used. This paper improves upon that by using the cell temperature commonly observed between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM. In the experiment, the theoretically calculated maximum power point voltage was determined from the measured cell temperature. The deviation between this voltage and the operating voltage of the battery (the PV array’s operating point) was measured, along with the utilization efficiency of the generated power. Experimental results showed that during low solar radiation conditions like rain or cloudy weather, this deviation increased, causing efficiency to drop to around 95%. Conversely, during sunny conditions with high solar radiation and high power generation, the deviation decreased, achieving maximum efficiency of 100%. Under daytime weather conditions suitable for power generation, power was generated with high efficiency exceeding 95%, yielding results as expected."

Rotor bar damage in three-phase AC induction motors can cause performance degradation and system failure. This study aims to develop an effective method in detecting and classifying rotor bar damage early. This work was carried out by collecting current and vibration signals from motors with various conditions and amounts of rotor bar damage. The signals were processed using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) with levels 8 and 11 to obtain approximation coefficients around 30 Hz. Feature extraction on the DWT processing results was carried out to obtain important information. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was carried out as a signal analysis to classify signals into healthy bar and damage bar. The damage bar are represented in four conditions namely one, two, three and four broken bars. Performance testing results show that the proposed classification model method has an accuracy of 95-100% on five different signals taken from five different conditions. The result indicates the excellent and consistent model performance across signal data variations. In addition, testing results show that the combination of current and axial vibration signals does not significantly influence on the accuracy."

    "abstract": "We propose a novel non-contrastive self-supervised learning framework for intrusion detection, which reformulates threat detection as a next-packet prediction task to eliminate the reliance on labeled data and explicit negative sampling. The proposed method integrates a Temporal Transformer Network (TTN) to autoregressively model packet sequences, learning latent representations by predicting subsequent packets in unlabeled traffic flows. These representations are then refined through a Graph Attention Head (GAH) during fine-tuning, which constructs dynamic graphs to capture temporal and semantic relationships for accurate threat classification. The TTN-GAH cascade inherently addresses evasion tactics by modeling causal dependencies in network traffic while mitigating class imbalance through graph-based label propagation. Moreover, the architecture achieves computational efficiency by avoiding contrastive pairs, reducing pre-training costs significantly compared to conventional approaches. Experimental validation demonstrates that the method generalizes to novel attacks by leveraging its pre-trained embeddings, offering a paradigm shift from static feature classification to dynamic sequence modeling in cybersecurity. The results highlight superior detection performance and robustness, establishing the framework as a scalable solution for modern ML-based intrusion detection systems."

While advanced models exist, a foundational understanding of baseline performance and key behavioral indicators is often overlooked. This study identifies the most significant dynamic behavioral features for detecting modern Trojan-Ransomware. Using features from dynamic analysis and the Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) algorithm as a baseline model, this research evaluates the discriminative power of these features on training and testing data (80:20). Experimental results show that GNB is highly effective in identifying malware (recall 94.2%), but its performance is weak in recognizing normal files (recall 45.4%). This imbalanced performance highlights the importance of feature analysis to understand the causes of classification errors. The main contribution of this study is not to propose GNB as an optimal solution, but to use it as an analytical tool to identify the most characteristic behavioral features of ransomware, and rigorously document the limitations of a simple baseline model. This analysis provides crucial insights into why misclassifications occur and establishes a clear performance benchmark that more sophisticated models must surpass."

Since then, this method has been extensively employed to evaluate the security of various cryptographic algorithms with Grain family structures. Atom is a small-state stream cipher with a 159-bit internal state, based on the Grain family structure, and offers 128-bit security. It was proposed by Subhadeep Banik et al. in ToSC 2021. Given its structure and security claims, Atom presents an interesting target for further cryptanalysis. In this paper, we conduct a detailed study of conditional differential attacks on Atom. We first investigate the difference propagation of roundreduced Atom with differential algebraic transitional form (DATF) technique introduced by Liu et al. and develop an input difference selection strategy. Next, we present a condition imposing algorithm to handle the complicated conditions. We revisit previous research and show that our algorithm can control differential propagation over the same number of rounds (0–15 rounds) using just 21 conditions, a significant reduction from the 98 conditions required by prior methods. Finally, we apply the conditional differential attack to 51-round Atom, enabling the recovery of 3 key bits with data and time complexities of 2^29. The distinguisher of 51-round Atom has been thoroughly verified through practical experiments conducted on a 4.20GHz AMD 7950X3D CPU. To the best of our knowledge, this is the best result of conditional differential attack on round-reduced Atom reported in the publicly available literature."

Therefore smart healthcare, as part of this digital evolution encompasses the integration of AI, IoT, and cloud-based solutions, all of which should enhance decision-making, service delivery, and sustain ability. Industry activity indicates that Digital Twins are heading toward mass adoption leveraged through advances in connectivity, data analytics, and modeling capabilities, but face challenges with limitations in system interoperability, data privacy and security, and achieving real-time synchronization.

    "abstract": "Cybersecurity has become essential in today's more interconnected digital world to protect people, businesses, and countries from a wide range of cyber threats. With an emphasis on identifying risks and bolstering defences, this research paper offers a thorough analysis of cybersecurity in the digital era. Although there are still vulnerabilities in cybersecurity and an increasing concern in the IoT area regarding the detection of assaults in IOT systems, IoT networks are a promising technology whose deployment is expanding quickly. IDS emerges as the top security option. Protecting networks from a variety of hostile activities is mostly dependent on anomaly-based network IDS (intrusion detection system). One of the most important concerns nowadays is enhancing the security of IoT networks. The effectiveness of several ML methods in forecasting attacks on Internet of Things devices has been examined in this study. The ADASYN techniques were then applied to the problem of unequal classes. The evaluation measures used in the performance comparison include the AUC curve, recall, accuracy, precision, and F1 score."

    "abstract": "Intrusion detection in financial networks endures an essential challenge to preserving data safe and interrupting sophisticated cyber threats that target transactional systems. Cyber threats that target transactional systems are challenging to comprehend. Traditional machine learning and rule-based methods often fail to perform effectively because they are unable to recognize the complex, changing, and non-Euclidean structure of financial data or the intricate relationships between entities. This study presents a method for detecting intrusions in financial networks based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN). The technique leverages the capabilities of GNNs to model dependencies at the node, edge, and graph levels. The results of this study demonstrate that when current methods have not proven adequate, including their inability to depend on fixed attributes and evolve to deal with new forms of threats. It also offers a new architecture that takes into consideration node embeddings, temporal dynamics, and information about the graph’s topology to ensure it can appropriately identify unusual behavior. The proposed model consistently outperforms traditional methods in terms of precision, recall, and F1 Score. The results can be demonstrated by experiments on datasets containing real-world financial transactions, and the significance of GNNs contributes to ensuring intrusion detection systems that are accurate, scalable, and adaptable. These outcomes have a significant impact on both the progress of fraud prevention and the real-time safety of financial systems."

Based on this, this paper first proposes a path loss model for OAM waves. Then, a terahertz OAM measurement platform is constructed in indoor scenarios, and a spiral phase plate (SPP) is used to generate multi-mode OAM waves at 132 GHz. Finally, the large-scale characteristics of the measured channel data are analyzed. The results show that, compared with the free space propagation loss model, this model better explains the wave loss characteristics of vortex waves, and the prediction accuracy is improved by an average of 11.8%."

With the rise of Deep Neural Networks, MAC protocol recognition based on Deep Learning (DL) has gained significant attention in recent years. However, existing DL-based MAC protocol recognition methods still suffer from insufficient adaptability to complex channel environments and limited ability to capture long-term dependencies, leading to challenges in achieving high accuracy. This study proposes a transformer-based MAC protocol recognition model to overcome these limitations of traditional methods. Utilizing the transformer’ s encoder structure, the model effectively captures long-term dependencies and global features within the data, thereby enhancing its ability to accurately identify various MAC protocols. Experimental results demonstrate that the transformer-based approach outperforms other classical networks, underscoring the potential of transformers in handling sequential data and improving model performance."

Though India is almost fully electrified, there still exist certain parts that haven't yet received electricity due to a number of reasons. The places that has access to electricity, its reliability is still under question The development of hybrid microgrids presents a sustainable and cost-effective solution for electrifying rural areas. By integrating photovoltaic systems (PV) with other renewable energy sources, in this case a biogas-powered generator, battery storage, and connection to the main power grid, hybrid systems ensure reliability, reduce dependency on fossil fuels, and mitigate power shortages. This work explores the design and implementation of a microgrid that manages two energy sources and a battery system. By integrating renewable resources and leveraging innovative storage and control strategies, this hybrid microgrid design demonstrates the potential for a cost-effective, reliable, and environmentally friendly energy solution.

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Biliary Atresia (BA) is the leading cause of liver transplantation in infants, making early diagnosis critical. While ultrasound is the primary screening tool, automated segmentation is challenged by the atrophic, irregular gallbladders with indistinct boundaries and low contrast common in BA patients. This task is further hindered by a key limitation in existing networks: skip connections often introduce background noise when fusing high-resolution details with high-level semantics, leading to failures in localizing weak boundaries. To directly address this fusion-related issue, we propose MAF-UNet, an architecture centered on our novel AttenFusionBlock (AFB). This cross-attention-based module leverages decoder features (\"Query\") to adaptively select and re-weight crucial details from encoder features (\"Key/Value\"), enabling precise, context-aware feature fusion. The complete MAF-UNet architecture also incorporates a MixStructure Block (MSB) to capture diverse morphologies and a cascaded dual-path gated prediction head to refine the final output. On a clinical dataset of 80 infants, MAF-UNet achieved an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 84.60%, significantly outperforming several state-of-the-art models. Ablation studies confirm that the performance gain is primarily attributed to our core AFB module. MAF-UNet effectively segments morphologically diverse gallbladders, providing a reliable quantitative basis for the early assessment of BA."

This topic falls within the concept of artificial intelligence in computer vision. It seems easy for humans to recognize a person just by looking at them, unlike machines. In this paper, we propose developing a hybrid model that combines spatial CNN features, temporal representation of parameters using an LSTM model, and facial action units (AUs). This model is capable of more accurately understanding and detecting subtle facial expressions. The model uses VGGNet and ResNeXt models to extract features from image sequences and uses AU maps as auxiliary input to improve model performance, adding tangible physiological interpretations to the model. The LSTM model is used to recognize temporal patterns. The model was trained using the Emotional Wearable Dataset 2020 video database due to the lack of a robust and available Arabic database for similar purposes. Frame preprocessing was performed to identify facial edges and enhance illumination to enhance images. The model achieved a high accuracy of 68.7% for accurate facial expression detection using the video database."

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial vehicles (UAVs) are massively used currently for different commercial and local applications like surveillance, searching, deliverance, etc. One of the main applications of UAVs is in the field of Intelligence Transportation System (ITS). For ITS, the actual path of the trajectory should be the same as the desired input for an appropriate location with respect to the desired trajectory. Moreover, it should be fast and robust with minimal overshoot and error between desired and actual path for the desired purpose of ITS. The kinematics of the quadrotor is highly unstable and it is an underactuated system with 6 Degrees of Freedom (DOF), whereas the movement of the quadrotor is dependent upon rotational and translational subsystems. In this paper, the trajectory of the quadrotor is tracked by using the Integral Sliding Mode Controller (ISMC) which is a modified form of the Sliding Mode Controller (SMC). The advantage of using ISMC control is the robustness, convergence, accuracy and the ability to operate under varying disturbance conditions. The integral action in ISMC compensates the phenomenon of chattering which exhibits in the conventional sliding mode controller and as a result, the trajectory becomes smooth with fast converging towards the desired point. Moreover, a comparison analysis is carried out by implementing different state-of-the-art controllers including Proportional Integral Derivative (PID), Backstepping and Sliding Mode Controller (SMC) in MATLAB."

By employing an electrode homogenization approach rather than the traditional spherical particle approximation and applying a nonuniform spatial discretization of the partial differential equations, a nonlinear statespace model was derived from the local electrochemical equations with minimal simplifying assumptions.

The necessity of effective detection and response systems to counter these sophisticated threats is emphasized in the paper. The suggested approach, which is based on file and process behavior monitoring, offers a simple, real-time ransomware detection and response solution. In contrast to conventional signature-based techniques, the suggested approach makes use of dynamic signs like high entropy in altered files, frequent file renaming, suspicious file extensions (like.locked or.encrypted), and anomalies in processes (like svchost.exe running without authorization). The system continually monitors a specified directory, looks for code injection signatures in Portable Executable (PE) structures, detects rapid renaming patterns, and computes entropy levels to identify potentially encrypted data. A built-in quarantine module separates infected files, while an alert mechanism provides email messages and refreshes a live dashboard. In order to detect possible command-and-control (C2) activities, the system also incorporates outbound traffic monitoring. According to experimental data, the system can detect ransomware-like actions in real time with little system overhead."

    "abstract": "The distribution feeders of Sentul Substation supplying the industrial area have experienced multiple distribution network disturbances in recent years, causing extended outages and operational challenges. Self-healing technology such as FLISR (Fault Location, Isolation, and Service Restoration) is capable of accelerating fault recovery by automatically isolating faults and performing service restoration. However, the successful implementation of FLISR requires the availability of sufficient spare capacity in backup feeders and their corresponding substation transformers. This study proposes a pre-fault optimization method for distribution network reconfiguration using Modified Archimedes Optimization Algorithm (AOA) to determine an optimal switching configuration that minimizes total power losses while ensuring sufficient backfeed capacity to implement FLISR operation. This study developed a model based on available network data from distribution feeders at Sentul Substation and performed simulations under selected fault scenarios. Simulation results show that the proposed modified AOA-based reconfiguration reduced total power losses by 41.7%, relieved transformer overloads from 95.5% to 83.16%, improved the minimum bus voltage from 0.9474 p.u. to 0.9603 p.u., and increased spare restoration capacity from 8.23 MW to 14.25 MW. These results highlight the main contribution of this study: a modified AOA-based reconfiguration model that improves smart grid resilience and supports FLISR deployment."

This paper presents a lightweight, decentralized authentication protocol tailored for IoHT environments, integrating blockchain technology, Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs), and zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs). Our protocol employs the Proof of Elapsed Work and Luck (PoEWAL) consensus mechanism, enabling secure, energy-efficient participation in a private Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. The scheme ensures strong mutual authentication between healthcare providers and IoHT devices without exposing sensitive data. An informal analysis is done to demonstrate the protocol’s resilience against common attacks.

As global energy demands transition to renewable energy sources (RES), wind energy is essential for mitigating carbon emissions and promoting sustainable development. However, its intermittent characteristics and fluctuations present risks to grid stability, necessitating creative methods for smooth integration. This study designs and simulates a wind farm to demonstrate its integration into the grid network, accounting for variable power generation due to weather conditions. It also records all necessary calculations, including losses, energy, and profit, utilizing appropriate methodologies. Furthermore, it employs available transfer capability to illustrate the power that can be transmitted to the rest of the network as generation fluctuates to expand transmission lines effectively."

    "abstract": "SQL injection (SQLi) attacks are arguably the most prevalent and destructive security attacks against web applications currently in use. SQLi attacks allow malicious users to exploit input validation vulnerabilities, thus granting unauthorized database access, data exfiltration, and even complete system compromise. To address this critical issue, this paper proposes a combined framework that employs machine learning techniques along with secure coding practices for the prevention, detection, and mitigation of SQL injection attacks. A Naïve Bayes classifier identifies anomaly-based SQLi attacks by monitoring HTTP requests for anomaly-based signatures that indicate the existence of evil SQL code. This machine learning-based detection system learns to evolve with new and changing attack vectors and gets better with time. In addition to detection, preventive measures such as prepared statement usage, input validation, and real escape string functions are employed to clean user input and eliminate injection points. Moreover, the system also includes a deception system, which leads the attackers to a decoy or imaginary database, so there can be ongoing observation of malicious activity without any loss of actual assets. This not only helps with threat analysis but also serves as a deterrent. The integration of proactive defense, reactive detection, and strategic deception greatly improves web application security. The system as presented shows strong immunity to both currently known and as-yet unknown SQL injection attacks, and thus it is a complete solution to one of the most vexing problems on web application security.

    "abstract": "The rise in penetration of renewable energy sources (RES), especially wind and solar, presents important challenges to power system operation and electricity markets. Renewables cut emissions and are cheaper in the long run but are intermittent, creating volatility, uncertainty about revenues, and reliability risks. This study analyses the performance of markets in delivering resilience to the grid given high levels of renewables. A grid simulation over 24 hours was then developed in order to study four aspects of the problem; (i) Stability of revenues for the generators, (ii) Reduction in the cost of imbalances as a result of flexibility, (iii) Reliability in terms of Loss of Load Expectation (LOLE), and Energy Not Served (ENS), and (iv) the impact on costs for consumers. Findings show that flexibility participation reduces costs incurred due to imbalance by $\\sim 60 \\%$, and resilience mechanisms reduce the effective tariff faced by consumers from ₹32/kWh to ₹6.8/kWh. Reliability indices also improve greatly when flexibility and ancillary services markets are introduced. In addition, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) model was applied to find the optimum levels of renewable penetration and flexibility that result in the least total system cost, which correspond to approximately 0.7 for flexibility and approximately $\\mathbf{5 5 - 6 5 \\%}$ for renewables. These results point to the economic and technical need for reengineered electricity markets that incorporate flexibility products, ancillary services, and resilience incentives. This dissertation provides a complete methodology of simulation, reliability metrics, and optimization to inform policy makers, system operators, and investors of resilient renewable dominated grids."

    "abstract": "With the popularization of technologies such as cloud computing and mobile office, enterprise network structures are becoming increasingly complex, and traditional network security models based on boundary protection are no longer able to meet current needs. Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), as an emerging network security model, does not distinguish between internal and external networks. All entities accessing resources require authentication and authorization, which can effectively address the challenges brought by boundary blurring [1–3]. ZTA, as an emerging paradigm of network security, adheres to the core principle of “never trust, always verify”, abandons the traditional mode of distinguishing between internal and external networks, and requires all access requests to undergo strict identity authentication and authorization[4]. This article first introduces the background, definition, and development process of ZTA, and elaborates on its process from initial theoretical proposal to gradual implementation and practice. Then, a detailed analysis was conducted on the general architecture model of ZTA, including core technical components such as identity authentication, access control, and trust evaluation. At the same time, the application practice of ZTA in typical scenarios such as enterprise environment, cloud services, and the Internet of Things was explored, demonstrating its flexible adaptability in different business scenarios[5]. Finally, the future development trend of ZTA is discussed, and it is pointed out that it will continue to evolve in terms of deep integration with traditional security protection concepts, enhancing its own security and elastic service capabilities."

    "abstract": "The task of separating overlapping sounds, known as the cocktail party problem, becomes even more challenging when applied to children's voices, which have higher acoustic variability and spontaneous articulation. While deep learning-based models such as Conv-TasNet, DCCRN, DPRNN, and SepFormer have demonstrated strong performance on adult voice data, their robustness to children's voices remains rarely explored. In this study, we present a comparative evaluation of four speech separation models using a specialised dataset constructed from overlapping recordings of elementary school children speaking. These models were pre-trained using the LibriMix dataset with noise from WHAM! and then fine-tuned on synthesised child voice mixes. Evaluations were conducted using real classroom recordings involving two to five simultaneous speakers. The SI-SNRi metric was used as the primary measure, complemented by qualitative analysis using spectrograms and waveforms. Our results show that SepFormer consistently outperforms the other models, achieving up to 14.1 dB SI-SNRi with two speakers and maintaining 9.4 dB with five speakers, followed by DPRNN (13.2–8.5 dB). Conv-TasNet and DCCRN performed lower, particularly under heavy overlap. Qualitative observations confirm that the transformer-based architecture provides better harmonic reconstruction capabilities and temporal accuracy in the context of child speech. These findings emphasise the importance of long-term modelling for speech separation tasks in educational settings and real-world applications for children."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Since its introduction, the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm has attracted considerable attention from researchers worldwide due to its simple structure, ease of implementation, and remarkable performance in continuous optimization problems. In the existing literature, DE algorithms typically employ two types of crossover: exponential and binomial. To address the limitations of exponential crossover, this paper proposes an enhanced approach that replaces the traditional crossover probability CR with crossover length L. This modification helps maintain an appropriate crossover ratio during the evolutionary process, thereby improving both the stability and performance of the algorithm. Building on this foundation, we further propose an adaptive DE algorithm that integrates the improved exponential crossover with a leader-based framework, namely DLADE. In each generation, the population is divided into leader and regular subpopulations. The leader subpopulation adopts three distinct mutation strategies to strengthen exploration, preserve population diversity, and mitigate premature convergence. Meanwhile, collaboration between leader and regular subpopulations is achieved through information exchange and sharing, effectively balancing global exploration and local exploitation. Experimental evaluations on the CEC 2017 benchmark functions demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms several representative adaptive DE variants, highlighting its superior performance and promising application potential."

We compare two of the most popular DRL algorithms, Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), within a multi-fidelity setup combining fast Python-based surrogates an high fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations using ANSYS Fluent. The optimization objectives, e.g., lift-to-drag ratio, fuel economy, and structural weight constraint, are integrated into the multi-fidelity reward function. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based architecture bridges aerodynamic geometry and performance space. The findings show that PPO outperforms DQN in continuous design space. The findings show that PPO performs better in a continuous design space, leading to an improvement in aerodynamic performance. This paper is interested in the technical feasibility of employing DRL and the significant improvement achievable with its use, specifically in aircraft wing shape optimization where DRL can autonomously find highly efficient aerodynamic configurations."

However, securing SDNenabled smart grids requires a defense-in-depth approach that combines diverse emerging technologies. This paper proposes a multi-layered security concept model leveraging blockchain for data integrity, explainable AI for transparent decision-making, generative AI for adaptive threat detection, quantum-safe cryptography for future resilience, big data analytics for anomaly detection, and radio frequency fingerprinting for device authentication. We present our model and discuss how each layer and technology contributes to a cohesive security architecture.

This research introduces an innovative framework that integrates natural language processing (NLP) in conjunction with graph neural networks (GNNs) to automate the generation of Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Ollama Llama3 converts user prompts into structured components, which are subsequently transformed into a graph representing cloud service dependencies. A graph neural network constructed using PyTorch analyzes this graph to generate optimized YAML configurations that conform to cloud best practices.

Furthermore, this system supports DevOps automation, optimizes costs, and effectively manages multi-cloud environments. This research bridges user requirements with IaC execution, rendering cloud resource management attainable for non-expert users.

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for energy-efficient wireless communication has propelled research into advanced beamforming algorithms suitable for 5G MIMO systems. This study presents a comprehensive simulation-based evaluation of three beamforming techniques: Least Mean Squares (LMS), Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR), and Analog Beamforming. The performance is assessed in terms of energy efficiency (measured in bits/Joule), directional gain, and beamformed signal characteristics under varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions using a uniform linear array (ULA) antenna configuration. Results demonstrate that the LMS algorithm consistently yields superior energy efficiency compared to the other methods. Specifically, at an SNR of 20 dB, LMS achieves an energy efficiency of approximately 12.6 bits/Joule, outperforming MVDR (10.4 bits/Joule) by 21.15% and Analog Beamforming (11.2 bits/Joule) by 12.5%. These improvements indicate that LMS is particularly well-suited for energy-constrained 5G environments, balancing low computational complexity with robust signal enhancement. The study highlights the trade-offs inherent in each technique and provides valuable insights into the selection of beamforming strategies for next-generation wireless systems."

    "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects social communication and interaction. Early diagnosis of ASD can mitigate the severity and help with ideal treatment direction. Computer vision-based methods with traditional machine learning and deep learning are employed in the literature for automatic diagnosis. Recently, deep learning with a facial image-based ASD classification has gained interest due to its ease of collection and non-invasiveness. We observed that the existing approaches utilized either local or global features of facial images to diagnose ASD. However, its important to consider both local and global features to obtain fine-grained details and larger contextual information for accurate detection and classification. This paper proposes a sequencer-based patch-wise Local Feature Extractor along with a Global Feature Extractor. Finally, the features from these modules are aggregated to obtain the final feature for the classification of ASD. Experiments on a publicly available Autism Facial Image Dataset demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance. We achieved accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of 94.7%, 94.0%, 95.3%, and 94.6%, respectively."

Our study employs a different feature extraction approach based on the Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix to lower the dimensionality of features. Finally, we evaluated different SVM kernels, such as linear, radial basis function (RBF), and polynomial kernels, to evaluate system effectiveness in identifying visual patterns indicative of ASD.

    "abstract": "Graph cut algorithms are widely used to solve min-cut/max-flow problems across various optimization applications. A common approach in recent FPGA accelerators of graph cut algorithms is to store the entire graph data in on-chip memory, thereby facilitating parallel computation. While effective for small graphs, this approach fundamentally limits scalability and prevents the processing of large-scale graphs. To address this limitation, first, we propose a cached folding grid architecture that dynamically manages graph data between on-chip and off-chip memories for large-scale graph processing. Second, to reduce redundant off-chip data movement, we develop an algorithm-specific selective fetching strategy that fetches only the necessary data of graph cut algorithms. Third, we introduce a selective traversal technique designed to reduce the execution time of the re-height operation by skipping invalid data. Compared to state-of-the-art FPGA accelerators, which are restricted to processing graphs with up to 2 million nodes, our design significantly improves scalability and can handle graphs with over 8 million nodes using the same on-chip memory. Moreover, our proposed accelerator achieves a 2.9× and 2.0× speedup compared to the fastest CPU and GPU implementations, respectively."

    "abstract": "Seeding conflict in online society is a public issue obtaining increasing attention. In this paper, we take a step to study the problem of maximizing conflict in online social networks from the adversarial perspective. More specifically, we combine the widely used stochastic information propagation model and opinion dynamics model to jointly model the processes of adversarial content propagation and opinion evolution through peer pressure on social networks, based on which we define the adversarial perturbations maximization (APM) problem. The APM problem focuses on two popular network conflict measures, disagreement and polarization. Our analysis begins by showing the complex nature of the APM problem. We show that by decomposing the objective into a subtraction of two set functions, an upper bound of the objective which is essentially a difference of two submodular (DS) functions can be devised. Then inspired by the success of modular-modular procedure and reverse influence sampling technique in related optimization tasks, we build a two-level approximation framework to maximize the upper bound heuristically with a data-dependent guarantee and further strengthen the approximation result using the sandwich approximation framework. Also, we apply dimension reduction technique to design a faster naïve greedy algorithm for the objective. Experiments show both the seriousness of this problem and the performance of our proposed algorithms."

A better harmonic suppression strategy is proposed, which uses multiple synchronous rotating frame transformations (MSRFTs) with model predictive current control (MPCC). First, mathematical models for the dominant 5th and 7th harmonic components are established. Second, the MSRFTs change these harmonic components into dc quantities within their respective frames. Low-pass filters (LPFs) are employed to extract the harmonic currents respectively. The MPCC algorithm generates compensating voltages based on the extracted harmonics, which are injected into the stationary reference frame to achieve effective harmonic suppression. Meanwhile, a complex vector decoupling strategy is adopted to eliminate the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</i>–<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">q</i> axis cross-coupling in the fundamental current control loop, for enhancing the parameters robustness. Simulation and experimental results demonstrated that the method mentioned above significantly reduced the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the phase current over a wide speed range. Furthermore, it’s better than the conventional MSRFTs combined with proportional-integral (PI) control method. This approach exhibits superior harmonic suppression capability and dynamic response performance."

    "abstract": "Due to the dynamic changes and complex time-delay characteristics of signal transmission between brain regions, this information can help identify early signs in individuals with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Conventional Functional Connectivity Networks (FCN) may overlook interaction delays, leading to inaccurate representations of activity between brain regions. Recognizing the varying delays between patients and healthy individuals, we constructed a dynamic FCN using a Sliding Window based on Derivative Regularity Correlation (SWDRC) and a Functional Delay Network (FDN). These methods aim to improve the detection and analysis of brain networks through the Correlation-based Derivative Regularity (CDR) algorithm. The key advancement of this study is the CDR algorithm, which enables nonlinear time series alignment, unlike traditional correlation methods. This improvement allows for the analysis of asynchronous and nonlinear features in brain activity. Using CDR, SWDRC identifies local and asynchronous characteristics via a sliding window, while FDN quantifies measurable delays between brain regions in both healthy subjects and patients. Our methods show strong potential for revealing the mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative conditions. In classification experiments, combining complementary features from SWDRC and FDN achieved higher accuracy, effectively extracting disease-related patterns. FDN analysis of ADNI data indicates an increasing network delay from Healthy Control to Mild Cognitive Impairment to AD. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/hxpotato/SWDRC."

    "abstract": "Conventional static measurement of head-related impulse responses (HRIRs) is time-consuming due to the need for repositioning a speaker array for each azimuth angle. Dynamic approaches using analytical models with a continuously rotating speaker array have been proposed, but their accuracy is significantly reduced at high rotational speeds. To address this limitation, we propose a DNN-based HRIRs identification using sequence-to-sequence learning. The proposed DNN model incorporates fully connected (FC) networks to effectively capture HRIR transitions and includes reset and update gates to identify HRIRs over a whole sequence. The model updates the HRIRs vector coefficients based on the gradient of the instantaneous square error (ISE). Additionally, we introduce a learnable normalization process based on the speaker excitation signals to stabilize the gradient scale of ISE across time. A training scheme, referred to as whole-sequence updating and optimization scheme, is also introduced to prevent overfitting. We evaluated the proposed method through simulations and experiments. Simulation results using the FABIAN database show that the proposed method outperforms previous analytic models, achieving over 7 dB improvement in normalized misalignment (NM) and maintaining log spectral distortion (LSD) below 2 dB at a rotational speed of 45°/s. Experimental results with a custom-built speaker array confirm that the proposed method successfully preserved accurate sound localization cues, consistent with those from static measurement.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel broadband spherical quadrifilar helical antenna (SQHA) to address the challenges of multi-system and multi-band compatibility in automatic satellite navigation and positioning for intelligent marine propulsion system applications. The proposed antenna comprises conformal radiating arms, a spherical polylactic acid (PLA) shell, and a broadband feed network. In contrast to conventional QHAs with identical radiating arms, the radiating arm in this design incorporates four sphere-conformal helical segments with unequal widths, which significantly enhance impedance matching and broaden the operational bandwidth. Furthermore, the designed feed network delivers equal-amplitude excitation signals with a 90° phase difference across a wide frequency range, thereby ensuring stable and high-quality circular polarization. To validate the design, an antenna prototype is fabricated and measured. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed antenna achieves a wide impedance bandwidth of 87.3% (0.745–1.90 GHz) and a wide 3-dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth of 82.7% (0.73–1.76 GHz), with a maximum gain of 5.5 dBic. The design exhibits excellent impedance and AR bandwidths, high gain, and robust conformal adaptability, offering a promising solution for enhancing the navigation accuracy and communication reliability of intelligent marine propulsion systems in dynamic marine environments."

    "abstract": "Industrial time series often display complex, non-stationary behaviors with trends, periodicity, and abrupt fluctuations. Generating high-quality synthetic data in such domains is essential for simulation, forecasting, and anomaly detection in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications. However, distributional heterogeneity, sparse failure patterns, and long-term dependencies make this task highly challenging. We introduce HNRF-TS, a rectified flow framework with hybrid noise initialization, designed for scalable and robust time series generation. The hybrid prior combines isotropic Gaussian noise with structured codes from a lightweight generative adversarial network (GAN), yielding semantically aligned and diverse latent representations. To improve sampling efficiency, we propose a bimodal adaptive strategy that allocates denser ordinary differential equation (ODE) steps at the beginning and end of the trajectory while using coarser steps in smoother middle regions. This preserves critical temporal features while lowering computational cost. We further enhance fidelity with modules dedicated to modeling trends and seasonality, which capture global drifts and periodic signals inherent in industrial data. Across multiple IIoT datasets, HNRF-TS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including GAN-based and diffusion-based methods. It achieves up to 75.8% reduction in Context-FID and over 60% improvement in correlation metrics on long-horizon tasks. Moreover, high-quality samples can be generated with as few as 20 sampling steps, offering significant efficiency gains without sacrificing accuracy."

    "abstract": "The manufacturing industry encounters numerous optimization problems, one of which is the optimization of storage location assignment (OSLA) problem in logistics. OSLA is a combinatorial optimization problem focused on improving the efficiency of picking operations in logistics centers. We explore quantum annealing (QA) as a potential solution to combinatorial optimization problems and investigate its applicability to the OSLA. The objective function for this optimization is the average travel distance of workers to their assigned destinations. However, this value is derived by solving the Traveling Salesman Problem for multiple orders, which is itself a combinatorial optimization problem. Therefore, it cannot be analytically represented in a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization form. To address this limitation, we employed black-box optimization with annealing (BBO-Annealing), which combines a surrogate model with an annealing algorithm, an approach that has recently gained attention in applied research involving QA. To evaluate the effectiveness of quantum computing, we compared results obtained using simulated annealing (SA) with those obtained using QA. Additionally, to assess the optimization performance of our proposed method, we compared it with a genetic algorithm (GA) that did not utilize a surrogate model of the objective function. QA demonstrated a higher probability of finding the optimal solution (33.3% vs 26.7% with SA). However, the optimization performance of GA surpassed that of the proposed method. Our analysis suggests that the relatively lower performance of our method was primarily attributable to the strong influence of constraints. The optimization performance can be improved by incorporating methods that consider the uncertainty of surrogate model predictions such as the lower confidence bound."

The forwarding weight values of all parameters can be configured by the upper-layer software according to different network states.

The entire design is coded in Verilog HDL, implemented on the Xilinx xc7z100ffg900 - 2 FPGA platform, and simulated and analyzed using ModelSim SE - 64 10.6d, which verifies the correctness of the multi-parameter weighted scheduling algorithm and the circuit design."

Numerous CPSs, including smart cities, self-driving cars, and water treatment facilities, are developing rapidly as a result of extensive research from both academia and business, as well as advancements in hardware and software. CPSs are now exposed to a variety of dangers since they have developed into complex, diverse, and integrated systems that offer broad functionality. Both academics and professionals must create new methods for CPSs because most conventional approaches become outdated when faced with new threats. To achieve this, we offer viewpoints on several topics related to the development of digital twins to feed CPSs, where the basic models can be utilized to boost the utility of the abilities they offer, increase the productivity of the digital twin creation process, and serve as a particular, fine-adjustedbasis framework that functions as a physical digital twins."

With global temperatures projected to rise by $1.6^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ to $2.4^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ by 2050, the study examines how these changes affect water needs and energy consumption for irrigation. Using a combination of the FAO model for water requirements and a linear optimisation model for energy systems, the research evaluates three temperature scenarios and their implications. Results indicate that water requirements could increase by up to 13% during peak months, leading to a corresponding rise in energy demand and system costs of 6% for the highest temperature scenario. The study also explores the viability of solar/battery and solar/biodiesel hybrid systems, highlighting the benefits and challenges of each. The findings underscore the necessity for adaptive strategies in designing sustainable irrigation systems to enhance agricultural productivity and resilience to climate change."

    "abstract": "The rapid advancements in quantum computing technologies present a significant challenge to traditional cryptosystems. To mitigate the potential collapse of existing cryptosystems, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) initiated the standardization of post-quantum cryptography in 2016. During the NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization process, CRYSTALS-KYBER was selected as the sole standardized public key encryption algorithm in July 2022. Following the determination of standardization, deploying lattice-based cryptographic schemes for Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) capable of resisting quantum attacks in resource-constrained embedded devices, such as smartphones and ARM-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices, is of great significance. ARM NEON is an extension of the Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) instruction set, widely employed in ARM-based processors to perform parallel vectorization operations on data. This paper analyzes NEON coprocessor instructions based on the Phytium-FT-2000 processor. ARM NEON technology is employed to optimize the Montgomery reduction, NTT transformation, and other algorithms within the Kyber algorithm. Furthermore, the hardware platform's accelerator is invoked to perform global vector optimization of the algorithm, fully utilizing register storage space and leveraging the parallel computing capabilities of the NEON instruction set. Experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in algorithm efficiency through the optimization provided by ARM NEON technology, based on the Phytium-FT-2000 processor. It is approximately 6 times faster than the version without NEON technology, and compared to the pure C implementation of the Kyber algorithm, the operation speed improves by approximately 39 times."

    "abstract": "The growing climate crisis has placed corporate environmental accountability under increasing legal and ethical scrutiny. This study examines the concept of corporate legal liability in environmental crimes, with a particular focus on the context of climate change and its global implications. Existing legal mechanisms often fall short in attributing direct responsibility to corporate entities due to limitations in evidence linking emissions to specific environmental damages and the fragmentation of legal standards across jurisdictions. To address these issues, this study proposes the Climate Forensics-Based Legal Attribution Framework (CF-LAF), which integrates scientific climate forensics with legal attribution models to identify and quantify a corporation's contribution to environmental degradation. By tracing specific greenhouse gas emissions to corporate activities and linking them to climate-related harms, CF-LAF offers a robust, evidence-backed approach to establishing legal liability. The framework is applied to hypothetical and real-world corporate scenarios, demonstrating its potential for use in national litigation and international tribunals. Findings suggest that CF-LAF significantly enhances the evidentiary strength of environmental claims, aids in shaping policy reforms, and supports the development of enforceable legal precedents for corporate climate accountability. The proposed method gradually improves the emission volume by 98.45%, the legal emission threshold by 97.42%, the climate impact evidence by 96.38%, and the causation and attribution index by 97.92%."

    "abstract": "Identifying neural markers of stress and cognitive load is key to developing scalable tools for mental state assessment. This study evaluated whether a single-channel high-density EEG (hdrEEG) system could dissociate cognitive and stress-related activity during a brief auditory task-based protocol. Sixty-eight healthy adults completed resting-state recordings, cognitively demanding auditory tasks, and exposure to unpredictable lateralized startle stimuli. Participants also rated their stress and anxiety using a modified State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). EEG analysis focused on frequency bands (Theta, Gamma, Delta) and machine-learning-derived features (A0, ST4, VC9, T2). A double dissociation emerged: Theta and VC9 increased under cognitive load but not startle, supporting their sensitivity to executive function; in contrast, Gamma and A0 were elevated by the startle stimulus, consistent with stress reactivity. ST4 tracked cognitive effort and worry, while T2 negatively correlated with self-reported calmness, indicating relevance to emotional regulation. These results demonstrate that a short, uniform assessment using portable EEG can yield multiple reliable biomarkers of cognitive and affective states. The findings have implications for clinical, occupational, and educational settings, and may inform future neurofeedback protocols targeting simultaneous regulation of attention and stress."

This paper seeks to help engineers and developers differentiate between auxiliary loads and system losses, demonstrating how each affects the overall design and, thus performance, of solar PV and BESS projects. To explore these impacts, we will compile typical losses and auxiliary power demands in a grid-connected, utility-scale, solar PV, and BESS system.

This study investigates the effectiveness of various machine learning and deep learning models in classifying electricity subscribers based on their active power consumption profiles. Using a real-world dataset containing over 21 million hourly consumption records from 25,476 subscribers in Southeastern Turkey, four consumer types were defined: General Subscriber, Lighting, Transformer, and Industrial Facility. Two modeling approaches were explored: (i) traditional machine learning models (e.g., LightGBM, Random Forest) using statistical and temporal feature extraction, and (ii) deep learning models (1D-CNN, CNN-LSTM, LSTM, ROCKET) trained directly on raw time series data. The 1D-CNN and ROCKET models outperformed others with a classification accuracy of 98%, while LightGBM achieved 96% accuracy among classical models. Evaluation metrics, including confusion matrices and F1 scores, indicated that 1D-CNN was particularly effective in learning temporal patterns from imbalanced data, especially in minority classes. Unlike most prior studies focusing on load forecasting, this work demonstrates how time series can be utilized for direct consumer classification. The results provide a practical and scalable framework for electricity distribution companies to enhance operational efficiency, consumer profiling, and energy management strategies."

The inconsistency of regulatory frameworks that rely on internationally recognized standards including ISO/IEC 27001, PCI DSS, and PSD2 lack iteratively evolving standards on secure financial transactions and overall compliance standards. Existing compliance practices are static, region-focused, and not tailored for sustained compliance, leading to inefficient compliance processes and insecure financial transactions. Propose the RegTech-Driven Adaptive Compliance Framework (RDACF), a name for the proposed framework. RDACF integrates regulatory technology (RegTech) and artificial intelligence (AI) to provide a mechanism of dynamic compliance capability within multi-jurisdictional fintech environments that leverage real-time compliance technology. RDACF uses a context-adaptive AI policy engine to programmatically map transactions against relevant international standards, and jurisdiction standards. This is achieved using the Cross-Border Smart Transaction Monitor (CSTM) secure transaction compliance system, which allows for the modification of its rules based on the classification type of the transaction, classification geography, and risk profile associated with the particular transaction. It is proposed that the framework will deliver increased compliance accuracy and reduced operational risks as well as mitigate the scalability problems encountered in global fintech firms. The results from the tests indicated that RDACF has improved regulatory responsiveness, decreased compliance costs, and enhanced transaction security while being a secure framework for strong digital finance ecosystems. The framework's results, as proposed based on RDACFs methodology can in future research lead to an improved compliance accuracy rate of 98.43%, regulatory responsiveness rate improved to 97.68%, transactional security rate improved to 96.51%, and scalability by 98.70%."

This introduces critical drawbacks, including environmental pollution, escalating fuel costs, and frequent load shedding by ESKOM. Such disruptions adversely affect the consistent use of electrical and electronic resources essential for effective teaching and learning, particularly in technical and vocational education and training colleges. This study investigates the deployment of hybrid renewable energy systems as a sustainable alternative to reduce dependency on the conventional grid and lower electrification costs for a TVET campus. Using the Homer Grid simulation tool, various system configurations are analysed to determine the optimal techno-economic setup. Key performance indicators assessed include the renewable energy penetration ratio, distributed generation potential, grid stability, and contribution of renewables to overall energy demand. The study evaluates life cycle cost, capital investment, cost of energy (COE), total annual energy production, and monthly average output to compare system efficiencies. The net present cost (NPC) is employed as the primary metric for conducting the techno-economic analysis. Findings support the feasibility of adopting a hybrid renewable energy approach to enhance energy reliability, reduce operational costs, and promote environmental sustainability in educational infrastructures."

The risk associated with the fair labour, discrimination, and safety issues can be addressed with the help of predictive analytics, automated compliance, and AI-compliance monitoring. The use of AI can also be expanded to support worker well-being and mental health through the identification of work stressors, burnout prevention, and creation of a physiologically safe workplace. But in the case of AI, there are ethical or legal considerations around the agency of workers, bias in algorithms, as well as privacy or confidentiality of data. Due to these reasons, it is necessary to adopt the strategy approach, where AI and human observation are used to determine the work decisions trade-offs in an observable and just manner to employers and employees alike.

    "abstract": "The increasing deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has amplified the importance of effective anomaly detection to ensure network security and reliable operation. Traditional methods often struggle to accurately identify complex and subtle abnormal patterns within high-volume, multidimensional traffic data. In this study, we introduce a novel framework that combines Transformer-based deep learning models with self-similarity features derived from the Hurst exponent to enhance anomaly detection performance. By extracting fractal-based features and employing attention mechanisms within the Transformer architecture, our approach effectively captures long-range dependencies and dynamic traffic behaviors. Experimental results on a benchmark IoT dataset demonstrate a high detection accuracy of 95.64%, outperforming many existing methods. The proposed model not only improves detection effectiveness but also provides interpretability and robustness against noisy data. Visualizations of confusion matrices and anomaly frequency analyses further validate the effectiveness of our approach. This work highlights the potential of integrating fractal features with advanced neural architectures for real-time, reliable IoT network security."

    "abstract": "Skin cancer, a potentially fatal condition, results from abnormal skin cell growth due to excessive ultraviolet (UV) exposure. Early and accurate differentiation of malignant and benign lesions is essential for effective treatment. This paper presents a new hybrid deep learning model to improve skin cancer classification by integrating the feature extraction ability of MobileNetV3Large and EfficientNetB0, two of the most recent lightweight convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To tackle common challenges in medical imaging, including class imbalance and visual artifacts, we employ a robust preprocessing pipeline that includes inpainting, adding image resampling, and hair artifact removal. All these approaches enhance data quality significantly and support better model generalization. Moreover, extensive data augmentation is also applied in an effort to boost the training set and avoid overfitting. Our system also involves an Explainable AI (XAI) module that runs on the LIME platform offering understandable visual explanations of model output, thereby making it easy to close the gap between black-box AI and clinical credibility. On the ISIC dataset, our dual-CNN model performs very well with accuracy of 96.7%, recall of 94.85%, precision of 92.4%, and F 1 -score of 91.6%. In this paper, we demonstrate the benefits of combining lightweight CNNs with explainability tools to develop interpretable, robust, and clinically useful skin lesion classification solutions."

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous networks are a special type of network that contains different types of nodes and edges. Link prediction in heterogeneous networks can reveal hidden interaction patterns among diverse entities, serving as a key task in handling the associations within complex information structures. Existing research mostly relies on various similarities between node pairs to measure the likelihood of links, thereby predicting connections between nodes. However, this approach misses edge information when capturing node details. To address the aforementioned issues, we proposes a edge embedding based on meta-path subgraphs for link prediction model (EMSLP). EMSLP extracts subgraphs through meta-paths, converts meta-path subgraphs to line graphs, utilizes graph convolutional networks to process line graphs, reduces redundant noise and extracts edge information, and performs link prediction through MLP. Experiments on the generalizability and effectiveness of the model were conducted on three real heterogeneous network datasets: ACM, IMDB, and Amazon. The results demonstrate that EMSLP outperforms other baseline models in terms of AUC and AP metrics on all three datasets. This model exhibits excellent link prediction performance."

This study introduces a centralized and power-efficient Floating-Point Unit (FPU) architecture intended for concurrent access by multiple lightweight processing cores. Unlike conventional percore FPU replication, the proposed model incorporates a shared computation paradigm governed by FIFO queuing and arbiterbased control mechanisms to facilitate equitable and conflict-free access. To further enhance energy efficiency, the design integrates operand reuse detection, dynamic precision scaling, and clock gating–techniques that collectively curtail redundant switching and lower dynamic power consumption. The Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA is used to realize the proposed architecture, which is implemented using Verilog HDL via the Vivado 2024.2 toolchain. Simulation and functional validation are performed using ModelSim, affirming IEEE-754 compliance and timing correctness. Empirical synthesis results reveal a significant reduction in area and power metrics: 52.9% fewer Lookup Tables (LUTs), 53.8% reduction in flip-flop usage, and 45% lower total power compared to traditional FPU deployments. The system achieves a sustained clock frequency of 150 MHz while maintaining computational integrity.

    "abstract": "The transition to renewable energy resources is a strategic step in supporting the Indonesian government's policies on carbon emission reduction. A significant effort is the utilization of solar energy through grid-connected rooftop Solar Photovoltaic (PV) systems in the residential and commercial sectors. This study aims to analyze the techno-economic aspects of implementing grid-connected rooftop solar PV system. Simulation results A 900VA residential class with an installed capacity of 0.87 kWp generates 1299.95 kWh of electricity annually, while a 2200 VA commercial class with a capacity of 2.175 kWp produces 3175.68 kWh/year. Economic analysis, comparing two scenarios based on Ministerial Regulation of ESDM No. 26 of 2021 and No. 2 of 2024, indicates significant differences in energy savings. With a discount rate of 6.95%, the Net Present Value (NPV) is negative for the 900VA residential class and positive for the 2200VA commercial class. The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for the 2200VA commercial class exceeds the discount rate, while the 900VA residential class falls below it. The Discounted Payback Period (DPP) for the 900VA residential class is longer, and for the 2200VA commercial class, it is shorter than the project lifespan under both 900VA regulation scenarios. The implementation of rooftop PLTS is currently financially unfeasible without supportive incentives or government policies promoting solar power plant adoption. Recommendations include system optimization to enhance energy efficiency, reducing initial investment costs through subsidy schemes, and evaluating energy policies to support the better adoption of rooftop PLTS in the residential and 2200VA commercial sectors."

The central aim of the study is to develop and implement a robust vector control strategy that enables independent and precise regulation of both active (real) and reactive (imaginary) power flows between the wind turbine and the electrical grid. Such decoupled control is critical for enhancing grid stability, maintaining voltage levels, and improving the overall power quality, especially under fluctuating wind speeds and variable grid load conditions. The proposed control architecture is specifically tailored to ensure high performance and reliability during transient events, such as wind gusts or grid disturbances, while simultaneously meeting stringent grid code requirements related to power factor correction, fault ridethrough capabilities, and dynamic voltage support. To thoroughly evaluate the efficacy and resilience of the control strategy, a high-fidelity simulation platform is developed within the MATLAB/Simulink environment. This simulation framework incorporates detailed models of the wind turbine, DFIG, power electronic converters, and grid interface, allowing for comprehensive testing under a wide range of realistic operating scenarios. Quantitative metrics such as response time, steady-state error, harmonic distortion, and system stability margins are used to validate the control performance and ensure the system’s compliance with modern grid integration standards."

The architecture includes combining advanced deep learning models like DeepLabV3+ and attention mechanisms with Vision Transformer (ViT) in a teacherstudent setup. By utilizing both pseudo-labeling and attention modules like SCSE (Spatial and Channel Squeeze & Excitation), the proposed model improves overall accuracy of feature extraction and segmentation. The experimentation is been carried out using high-resolution remote sensing datasets such as DLRSD, WHDLD, and ISPRS Potsdam-each covering varied terrain and label distributions. Experimental results shows that DeepLabV3+ employing ResNet-101 and ResNet-50 backbones with attention mechanisms scored a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.7237 on the DLRSD dataset. While, DeepLabV3+ model with ViT and SCSE attention achieved an mIoU of 0.7024 on WHDLD dataset. Moreover, the DeepLabV3 with ViT achieved a high mIoU of 0.8965 on the ISPRS Potsdam dataset.

These platforms eliminate the need for traditional intermediaries, offering transparency, automation, and reduced transactional friction. However, existing DeFi lending solutions face challenges such as smart contract vulnerabilities, poor user trust, limited risk management, and inefficient system design processes. These issues often result in security breaches, collateral mismanagement, and reduced adoption. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a framework using the Blockchain-Based System Development Life Cycle (BSDLC) methodology. BSDLC introduces structured phases—including requirement analysis, system design, smart contract development, testing, deployment, and maintenance—tailored to the unique needs of blockchain-based systems. These phases ensure systematic identification of risks, secure coding practices, and continuous verification of smart contract behavior through rigorous testing. The proposed BSDLC-based method is applied to develop a safe, trustless P2P lending application on the Ethereum blockchain. The platform enables users to borrow and lend digital assets using collateralized smart contracts, which are enforced by oracles for real-time asset valuation. The implementation ensures tamper-proof loan execution, automated liquidation, and complete transparency, all without requiring central oversight. The findings reveal that applying BSDLC significantly enhances the security, reliability, and usability of decentralized finance (DeFi) lending applications. It reduces vulnerabilities and ensures system integrity, making it a scalable and trustworthy solution for modern financial ecosystems."

While the Versatile Video Coding (VVC/H.266) standard achieves remarkable compression efficiency, its computational complexity often results in high energy consumption in resource-limited IoT environments. To address this, we present ECO-VVC, a novel framework for Energy-aware Cognitive Orchestration of VVC in SoftwareDefined Networking (SDN)-enabled IoT networks. ECO-VVC uniquely integrates VVC tool-level adaptation, energy-aware quantization parameter scheduling, and SDN-assisted edge orchestration into a unified optimization loop. A fuzzy multiobjective controller dynamically balances energy use, end-to-end latency, and QoE, leveraging telemetry data such as battery level, decoding load, stall events, and network state information. Comparative evaluation with state-of-the-art methods including SDN-assisted HAS, latency-aware encoding, and VVC energyquality tradeoff models demonstrates ECO-VVC's superiority in reducing decoding energy and transmission overhead while maintaining perceptual quality. Experiments show up to 45 % lower decoding energy and 28 % reduced transmission cost, with video quality preserved (VMAF <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\geq 92$</tex>).

    "abstract": "Appropriately matching DNA sequences about one another is one of bioinformatics' most essential difficulties. This is true because the quantity of genomic data will keep rising at an exponential rate. GenMatch-FastAlign, based on the findings of this study, is a game-changing method that precisely matches patterns in a brief period without sacrificing accuracy. This paper aims to increase the speed and accuracy of DNA sequence alignment in large genomic databases. This effort is being done to reach this goal. Matched subsequences may be found in a brief period by using the provided technique combining adaptive sliding window methods and hash-based indexing. This could be done using the technique. Using this method, one can identify subsequences congruent with the main sequence. Compared to the other alignment techniques already in use regularly, this approach significantly cuts the time needed for computation. Because it uses biological concepts as motivation for its optimization techniques, GenMatch-FastAlign may minimize the number of mismatches and maximize the alignment sensitivity. This lets it reach both of these objectives at once. Genomic data acquired from both short and longitudinal reads is therefore relevant.Comprehensive testing on benchmark datasets reveals GenMatch-FastAlign to be faster in data alignment and more memory-efficient than competing tools like BLAST and BWA. The method can also be parallelized, making it appropriate for usage in cloud-based settings and remote genomic analysis systems. It is also possible to parallelize. The GenMatch-FastAlign software's scalable solution has many applications, including real-time genetic analysis, variation discovery, and customized treatment. Here are a few uses that fit this description. Sequence alignment acceleration, which does not affect the precision of the process, is used to achieve this. The results of this work have significantly contributed to computational genomics through their discoveries. Eliminating the current performance restrictions allows them to explore complicated DNA sequence data more efficiently and effectively."

    "abstract": "The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources has introduced significant uncertainty into modern power systems, creating challenges in maintaining reliable and economic operation. To address this issue, this study proposes an optimal power flow (OPF) framework based on Information-Gap Decision Theory (IGDT). The framework is designed to handle severe uncertainty in renewable power generation while ensuring robust and stable system performance. The IEEE 30-bus test system, integrated with 4 MW of wind generation and 1 MW of solar generation, is used as the test platform. To enhance flexibility and reliability, a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) is incorporated, enabling the system to effectively mitigate fluctuations in renewable output. The optimization problem is solved using the Binary Differential Evolution (BDE) algorithm, which efficiently identifies the best compromise among conflicting objectives such as fuel cost, system losses, emissions, and voltage deviation. Simulation results demonstrate that the inclusion of BESS consistently improves performance across all metrics compared to the no-BESS case. The findings indicate substantial reductions in generation cost, system losses, and emissions, while simultaneously enhancing overall system stability. Furthermore, analysis of the percentage error between the BESS and non-BESS scenarios reveals that the most favorable outcome occurs at $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}= 0.2$, corresponding to a daily profit of ${\\$}$139.2152. These results confirm that the integration of IGDT with BESS and BDE provides a resilient, efficient, and economically viable strategy for operating renewable-dominated power systems under uncertainty."

    "abstract": "In modern low-power VLSI design, power efficiency has become a critical consideration, especially in processors intended for embedded and battery-powered systems. RISC-V, an open-source and modular instruction set architecture (ISA), provides an excellent platform for implementing customized low-power designs. Fine-grained clock gating and power gating are two effective techniques used to minimize dynamic and static power consumption, respectively. These methods allow selective disabling of the clock or power supply to idle functional units within the processor, thereby significantly reducing unnecessary energy usage without compromising performance. These techniques are particularly beneficial in pipelined RISC-V cores, where not all stages or submodules are active during every clock cycle. By integrating control logic that dynamically determines when a unit is idle, fine-grained gating ensures that only the required sections of the processor are active at any given time. This selective activation reduces switching activity, which directly lowers dynamic power. Similarly, power gating is applied to completely shut off leakage-prone blocks like caches or memory buffers during idle periods. The implementation of such power-saving mechanisms requires careful RTL design and synthesis strategies to ensure functional correctness and timing closure."

Conventional data warehouses are faced with the volume, speed, and diversity of retail new data streams. The structure of an AI-powered data warehouse that is proposed in this paper includes the incorporation of machine learning, the data ingestion pipelines that operate in real-time, and the likes of dynamic optimisation engines to enable real-time retail analysis. The framework applied through literature synthesis and empirical examination of large-scale simulated data sets in retail outlets showed the best results in inventory management, dynamic pricing, sales forecasting, and customer segmentation. The model takes into account cloud-based storage, streaming platforms, AI-based analytics, and optimisation layers that enable scalable, low-latency analytics of the retail enterprise. Confirming these findings, it is visible that data warehouses with the application of artificial intelligence are a revolutionary solution capable of providing not only technical but also business scalability of retail analytics."

    "abstract": "In an era of digital transformation, safeguarding sensitive data is more critical than ever. Traditional approaches to encrypting information protect data but can still draw attention to its existence. Steganography provides an alternative where secret information is hidden inside innocent-looking media, for example, images, in order to deny its very existence. This paper introduces Zahiran, a lightweight desktop application that employs image-based steganography and allows the embedding of secret text messages based on the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique. Zahiran provides methods to embed and extract text from image files (PNG and JPGs) with no perceptible image degradation. Implemented using Python, the system uses multiple libraries like Tkinter, PIL, Stegano, and is designed using the Model-View-Controller to maintain tier-based modularity and clearity within the code. The tool has a user-friendly, easy-to-use and intuitive graphical user-interface which allows users with different technical expertise to use the software. OTP based access control, reset and multiplatform support are some of the key features. Functional testing indicated that the application has the ability to successfully conceal and extract the messages without loss of functionality and performance. In this work, we also compare Zahiran with various other steganography tools and show that it exhibits some of its distinctive advantages regarding accessibility and visual fidelity. While being a fundamentally insecure method since it is based on LSB substitution, Zahiran provides a practical tradeoff between usability and security for secure communication."

These devices facilitate the simultaneous control of local bus voltage and the optimization of power flow within electrical power transmission systems. The multilevel converter capability to operate with high voltage levels while generating low-distortion AC voltages, makes multilevel topologies suitable for UPFCs. Within this framework, this paper presents a novel multilevel converter topology and control strategy specifically designed for UPFC applications. The proposed solution employs a dual inverter topology driven by sliding mode direct power controllers, which are controlled via decoupled Proportional-Integral (PI) compensators. The characteristics, capabilities, and resulting flexibility of the proposed UPFC and control subsystem is validated through a series of simulation tests."

The proposed system incorporates a navigation-based propulsion power model into a direct-current naval shipboard microgrid (DC-NSMG), where the propulsion-induced constant power load is modeled as a dynamic disturbance to the microgrid controller. The navigation NMPC processes real-world automatic identification system (AIS) waypoints as a reference and updates optimal thruster power based on the ship’s trajectory. This integrated approach enables more accurate resource allocation under dynamic operating conditions and introduces a novel control architecture by coupling a navigation-based propeller model with microgrid power management. By simulating the integrated system in the baseline case and in the destroyer case, the control robustness is validated."

    "abstract": "Autonomous automobiles need a real-time, consistent pathfinding system to appropriately and efficiently negotiate changing surroundings. Sometimes, traditional approaches fall short in multiple respects, including scalability, flexibility, or handling of difficult terrain. This paper presents an improved Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) method to help nav-assisted autonomous automobiles overcome obstacles. The enhanced ACO adds environmental feedback systems, dynamic heuristics, and adaptive pheromone updates to improve route selection under real-time restrictions. The key goals in urban and off-road settings are to lower calculation time, accident risk, and route distance, thus enhancing pathfinding efficiency. This work has been simulated using reasonable traffic models, and the method is compared to industry standards in navigation systems like A* and Dijkstra's to evaluate it. Comparatively to traditional methodologies, the results of trials show an increase in convergence time, an improvement in route optimality, and an increase in adaptability to barrier conditions. The suggested ACO variation provides next-generation intelligent transportation systems with scalability and outstanding performance and boosts the decision-making capability of autonomous systems. The following projects will concentrate on hardware implementation on actual autonomous systems to evaluate their viability and real-time responsiveness under different circumstances."

    "abstract": "The fast digitization of healthcare technology has led to more questions about patient privacy. It is exceptionally accurate when sharing medical images for research and diagnostic purposes. There are several situations in which conventional anonymization techniques fail to stop re-identification. This paper introduces a de-identification framework founded on a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). This research effort aims to tackle the significant difficulty of safeguarding patient privacy in the medical imaging domain. The proposed approach can create synthetic facial features in medical images while preserving diagnostically necessary data. Extensive studies using benchmark datasets were done to assess the diagnostic usefulness and privacy preservation. It was discovered following a decision that large-scale studies had been conducted. While preserving high fidelity in clinically relevant areas, the results imply that the de-identified images significantly reduce the probability of re-identification. They also maintain an above ninety percent accuracy on diagnostic tasks. These results concluded that GAN-based de-identification is dependable and scalable, guaranteeing the safe distribution of medical images. By applying this method, data can be sent in a way that follows privacy criteria. They promote cooperation in medical research without compromising the patients’ privacy."

By extracting spectral-spatial representations via STFT and CWT, and modeling temporal dependencies with BiLSTM, the proposed system effectively distinguishes all five sleep stages—Wake, N1, N2, N3, and REM—across subject-independent settings. Evaluated on benchmark datasets including Sleep-EDF and MASS, the model achieved classification accuracies up to 92.3%, with F1-scores exceeding 86.4%, particularly improving sensitivity for transitional stages like N1 and REM. Compared to baseline models using handcrafted or single-channel features, the proposed approach yields a 5.4% gain in accuracy and demonstrates enhanced generalization under leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. The integration of multi-lead EEG fusion and frequency-domain representations enables robust classification across varying signal morphologies and recording protocols. Designed for real-time deployment, the model maintains inference latency under 200ms per epoch, supporting its application in both clinical and wearable EEG monitoring systems. This architecture represents a scalable, explainable, and domain-adaptive solution for sleep disorder diagnostics and long-term physiological monitoring."

Integration of dropout regularization and adaptive learning rates enabled fast convergence and strong generalization across diverse cytological patterns. With inference latency below 180ms per image and scalable architecture for real-time deployment, the proposed system demonstrates clinical-grade reliability for large-scale cervical screening applications. Its modular design supports future integration of ensemble models and domain adaptation pipelines across varied staining protocols and cytology platforms."

Given the growing globalization of data flows and computer services, safeguarding legislative autonomy raises significant ethical questions. Systems that would handle jurisdictional conflicts, data privacy violations, or enforcement gaps resulting from the incompatibility of national laws with international digital operations are not currently in place. A lack of coordination, responsibility, and adaptability makes current models unable to keep up with the ever-shifting character of digital ecosystems. The reason for this inquiry proposes a multi-layered strategy comprising legislative intent mapping, cross-border regulatory APIs, and real-time data localization audits, known as the SOV-DOME framework (Sovereign Oversight and Verification for Digital Operations and Multinational Enforcement). The objective of this framework is to enhance digital sphere sovereignty. SOV-DOME enables governments to enforce compliance, exercise their legal authority, and facilitate intergovernmental collaboration without interfering with legitimate Internet trade. Its accordance engine, which employs artificial intelligence to validate operations, and its blockchain technology verification system guarantee openness and flexibility to new rules. Without sacrificing international digital cooperation, the results reveal that SOV-DOME significantly reduces jurisdictional ambiguity, increases legislative sovereignty in digital ecosystems, and enhances enforcement efficiency by 45 percent."

YOLOv7, a state-of-the-art real-time object detection model, offers high-speed performance and accuracy, which faces challenges in maintaining object identity over time. Existing tracking methods often suffer from drift, occlusion, and identity switching due to noise, dynamic environments, and lack of temporal consistency. To address these issues, here is the proposed SMODT-Y7PF (Secure Multi-Object Detection and Tracking via YOLOv7 with Particle Filter), a hybrid framework integrating YOLOv7 for robust detection and Particle Filter algorithms for probabilistic tracking and motion estimation. This combination improves identity preservation and resilience against occlusion and noise. The proposed method uses YOLOv7 to detect multiple objects in each frame and employs Particle Filters to maintain object trajectories by estimating the posterior distribution over time. This integration ensures secure and consistent tracking in real-time applications. Experimental results show that SMODT-Y7PF significantly improves tracking accuracy, reduces identity switches, and enhances robustness in dynamic and cluttered environments, making it ideal for smart surveillance and autonomous navigation systems."

The adaptive firewall dynamically blocks or unblocks IP addresses without manual intervention, generates periodic PDF reports for administrators and exposes a web dashboard and CLI for naturallanguage commands. As evaluated in Section VI, by leveraging LLM-based summarization and dynamic PF tables, the system reduces time to mitigation and lowers false positives compared with static rule sets."

    "abstract": "The demand for high-speed, low-power clocking in digital integrated circuits has made True Single-Phase Clocking (TSPC) a preferred design choice for its simplicity and efficiency. This paper presents the design and optimization of a 2/3 frequency prescaler using TSPC logic. The methodology involves schematic design, transistor-level tuning, and performance optimization using the Cadence Virtuoso platform. Critical paths were identified and optimized through improved layout and timing analysis. The proposed design consumes 32 transistors without compromising performance. It also improves timing efficiency, with setup delay of 1.002 ns and hold delay of 0.279 ns. Although power consumption increases slightly to 0.085 W it remains within acceptable limits for high-speed systems. The use of NAND and AND logic supports modular TSPC-based frequency division, making the design a strong fit for next-generation clock distribution networks."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a low-cost and intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) system for gas, environmental, and health monitoring in hazardous industrial environments. The proposed system integrates low-power sensing modules with LoRa communication and an Attentional Bi-LSTM model deployed at the edge. Distributed sensor nodes, built on Arduino microcontrollers, collect temperature, humidity, and gas concentration data using DHT and MQ-series sensors. These readings are transmitted via LoRa to a NanoPi Neo Plus2 gateway, where the Attentional Bi-LSTM model performs multivariate time-series forecasting for early hazard prediction by capturing temporal dependencies and dynamically focusing on critical features. Local edge processing eliminates cloud dependency, reduces latency, and enables immediate visual and auditory alerts through reverse LoRa communication in case of potential risks. Experimental evaluation demonstrates stable LoRa transmission exceeding 1 km in obstructed environments at a baud rate of 9600 bps, along with high predictive accuracy and robust system performance. By combining LoRa-based wireless sensing with edge-deployed deep learning, the proposed system provides a scalable, energy- efficient, and practical solution for proactive gas detection and environmental and health monitoring in safety-critical industrial applications."

While Deep Learning (DL) techniques, particularly Transformer-based models, have shown significant advancements, they often struggle with redundancy elimination, coherence preservation, and contextual relevance. In this research, we propose a novel Hybrid Transformer-GNN Framework (HTGF) that integrates Transformer networks with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture document relationships, semantic dependencies, and content importance effectively. Additionally, we incorporate a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based reward mechanism to optimize summary fluency, coherence, and informativeness. Our framework employs hierarchical attention mechanisms to prioritize key sentences and a novel redundancy-aware contrastive loss function to improve abstraction. We evaluate our model on benchmark datasets and compare its performance against state-of-the-art methods using widely accepted evaluation metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing models in terms of ROUGE scores, coherence, and factual consistency. This research provides a robust and scalable solution to MDS, offering new insights into DL-driven text summarization."

The research evaluates DJIA 30 component stocks through five optimization methods which include Genetic Algorithm (GA), Standard Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Adaptive PSO, Parallel PSO and Island Model PSO. The methodology implements a fuzzy inference system that uses risk and Sharpe ratio inputs to generate unified fitness values for portfolio evaluation. The experimental results demonstrate that Adaptive PSO achieves the optimal balance between computational speed and solution quality through its maximum Sharpe ratio (1.088) and Sortino ratio (1.075) in out-of-sample testing. The parallel implementation methods led to high computational expenses without producing superior results. The optimization methods of Markowitz and Maximum Sharpe performed exceptionally well during in-sample testing but produced unstable results when tested out-of-sample. The research demonstrates that adaptive parameter adjustment provides superior benefits than increased computational complexity for medium-sized portfolio optimization problems and fuzzy logic enables successful management of multiple portfolio objectives."

    "abstract": "Air pollution is an important threat to the environment and public health. Raising awareness of air pollution among city managers and citizens can help to mitigate the problem. However, data acquired from stationary sensors frequently fails to give complete coverage of the metropolis. Furthermore, the expensive cost of the equipment associated with these stations restricts their deployment to all sections of the city. To address this constraint, this study describes the design and construction of a transportable sensing device equipped with low-cost sensors that can collect air pollutants from a variety of metropolitan areas. A fundamental issue with low-cost sensors is their limited accuracy, which necessitates calibration and improvement. In this study, after designing and building a mobile sensing device, it was deployed. Machine learning models, such as linear regression, KernelRidge, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), were used to calibrate the PM2.5 data from the PMS5003 sensor. The results show that the XGBoost model had the highest accuracy and best performance for PM2.5 calibration, with mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) values of 2.83 and 1.68, respectively. The built mobile device was then used for six days to monitor pollution in numerous streets in Hamedan, allowing for a field evaluation."

    "abstract": "Promoting data sharing is one of the critical strategies for thriving in the digital age, and enormous demand for location-based services propels data sharing in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), particularly in the case of integrating mobile crowdsensing (MCS). However, data security and privacy concerns are increasingly posing serious challenges to the development of data sharing. Although a slew of works have been designed to achieve secure data sharing in IoV, they are inadequate for addressing the privacy issues identified in the data sharing model and often suffer from performance limitations. In this work, we propose an efficient and secure data sharing scheme under the MCS-integrated IoV. Specifically, motivated by the distributed point function (DPF), we design a double-output DPF and leverage it to construct a secure updating scheme that protects full privacy while ensuring high efficiency. Then, based on the XOR filter and a series of subtle transformations, we carefully design a secure spatial test protocol to determine whether a point falls within an arbitrary spatial range efficiently. Afterward, we propose a secure retrieving protocol by using the idea of shared shuffling, in which the offline sub-protocol is presented to generate random masks, and the online sub-protocol is designed to quickly retrieve the desired data items. After formally proving the security of our proposed schemes, we experimentally evaluate their efficiency by comparing them with the alternative solutions, and the results indicate that our proposed schemes offer superior performance, particularly in terms of communication overheads."

    "abstract": "The enhanced mobility brought by legged locomotion empowers quadrupedal robots to navigate through complex and unstructured environments. However, optimizing agile locomotion while accounting for the varying energy costs of traversing different terrains remains an open challenge. Most previous work focuses on planning trajectories with traversability cost estimation based on human-labeled environmental features. This human-centric approach is insufficient because it does not account for the varying capabilities of the robot locomotion controllers over challenging terrains. To address this, we introduce a novel real-world learning pipeline that unifies offline demonstrations, online reinforcement learning, and multi-modal perception to achieve robust legged navigation. The framework employs multiple training stages to develop a planner that guides the robot in avoiding obstacles and hardto- traverse terrains while reaching its goals. We first develop a novel traversability estimator in a robot-centric manner. The training of the navigation planner is directly performed in the real world using a sample efficient reinforcement learning method. With the proposed method, a quadrupedal robot learns to perform traversability-aware navigation through realworld interactions in diverse offroad and unstructured environments. Moreover, the robot demonstrates the ability to generalize the learned navigation skills to unseen scenarios."

This paper proposes a coordinated restoration strategy for 500 kV extra-high-voltage transmission networks (EHVTNs) and 220 kV high-voltage transmission networks (HVTNs), incorporating HVDC integration and emergency repair crew (ERC) scheduling. First, an integration and operational model for HVDCs is developed using the adjoint network method, which transforms complex self-impedance constraints into a mixed-integer linear programming formulation, enabling accurate and efficient HVDC integration. Second, fault repair priority indicators—derived from topological connectivity, reachability, and power flow betweenness—are introduced. Based on these indicators, an ERC scheduling optimization model is formulated to prioritize critical fault repairs and minimize overall restoration time. Then, by incorporating the synergistic effects of HVDC integration and ERC scheduling, a bi-level restoration optimization framework based on model predictive control is proposed to coordinate the restoration of EHVTNs and HVTNs. Finally, case studies on an actual 379-bus power system in China are conducted, and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces restoration time and improves restoration performance compared to conventional approaches, thereby providing effective technical support for rapid grid restoration following large-scale blackout events."

    "abstract": "Future wireless networks, such as 6G, are envisioned to deliver ultra-reliable, high-quality services with ultra-low latency and dynamic connectivity across heterogeneous environments, driving the adoption of edge–cloud collaborative architectures. Within this paradigm, container-based microservices, with their lightweight, modular, and portable characteristics, offer an effective foundation for scalable and adaptive service provisioning in heterogeneous wireless networks. The layered architecture of microservices facilitates efficient resource management through layer scheduling and caching. However, dynamic service requests and diverse container layers pose major challenges for layer-aware service provisioning in future wireless environments. These include <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">time-exceeded offline service provisioning, tangled microservice orchestration</i>, and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">layer cache redundancy</i>. To address these challenges, we propose Tri-Ring, an asynchronous online provisioning framework for future wireless networks, empowered by large AI models (LAMs). The framework optimizes request dispatching, orchestration, and layer updates across three timescales. At the small timescale, we formulate request dispatching as a linear programming (LP) subproblem. At the medium timescale, the estimator-assessor algorithm manages microservice orchestration, where a diffusion-enhanced prediction model serves as the estimator to predict layer caching strategies. Moreover, submodular optimization serves as the assessor to determine deployment and scheduling. At the large timescale, we introduce the age of layer (AoL) to guide the pruning of infrequently accessed cached layers to reduce storage overhead. Comprehensive evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrates that Tri-Ring outperforms existing baselines, increasing utility by 44.78%, reducing microservice startup time by 78.64%, and optimizing storage resources by 36.38%."

    "abstract": "The incorporation of information and communication technologies (ICT) into microgrid systems has considerably improved their control and operational efficiency. However, this integration has exposed the microgrid systems to cyber threats that can potentially compromise the security and reliability of this critical infrastructure. To address these challenges, this article proposes a robust algorithm incorporating hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) in microgrid systems for cyberattack detection. The HMAC-based detection algorithm ensures the integrity and authenticity of all transmitted messages by embedding cryptographic tags in communication protocols. Our framework assigns a unique symmetric key to the sender and receiver module, which it uses to generate and verify HMAC tags, enabling it to easily identify any anomalies indicative of cyberattacks. For mitigation of attacks, a Communication Error Counter (CEC) is calculated and embedded in the secondary control equation to reduce the communication weights. The analysis is done on an islanded cyber-physical microgrid embedded with a controller area network (CAN) protocol for real-time communication. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified in MATLAB simulation, and real-time evaluation is done in the OPALRT simulator, which shows our approach achieves high detection accuracy and robustness against various types of cyberattacks."

    "abstract": "With the development of frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar, its forward-looking imaging capability has gained prominence. However, traditional super-resolution methods based on direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation often fail to deliver satisfactory results in complex scenarios with many targets occupying multiple bins. This is because many DOA methods process individual range bins independently, ignoring target correlations and resulting in significant information loss. Additionally, some DOA estimation methods generate outputs that do not reflect the spatial spectrum of target intensity, thereby making them unsuitable for imaging tasks. Furthermore, these methods typically involve high computational complexity, limiting their applicability to scenarios with simple processing devices. In this study, we introduce a novel low-rank and sparse recovery forward-looking imaging (LSFI) approach for FMCW radar, establishing a new forward-looking imaging model. This method formulates an optimization problem that integrates both target and background features within an overall image perspective and resolves it using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), replacing the iterative operations along the range dimension required by most methods with matrix operations and thereby significantly reducing computational complexity. Moreover, the proposed method has been successfully implemented on field programmable gate array (FPGA) platform and has demonstrated excellent super-resolution imaging performance in extensive experiments, including complex intelligent driving scenarios."

Dynamic equivalents that consider high penetration levels of Renewable Sources (RES) and integration of Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) simultaneously, possess high probabilities of correlating the dynamic equivalent behavior to the real multi-machine network in key performance indicators such as clearing times, and computational efficiency. Simulated annealing algorithm blends well in solving the grouping of the coherent machines based on Metropolis Criterion indicated in this modeling of the equivalence process, thus guaranteeing optimal solution for arbitrary systems, especially, if slow cooling is achieved to enforce regularity. The test results demonstrate computational efficiency, faster, simple and ease of carrying out simulations based on the dynamic equivalents, when planning large network expansions."

This study investigates the foundational development of mental health chatbots for Indonesian university students by identifying key ethical considerations. Using reflective and exploratory design methodology focused on mapping ethical risks and developing a conceptual framework, data were gathered through expert interviews and focus group discussions involving AI developers, psychologists, and bioethics specialists. Results highlight four central challenges: ethically sourcing training data, defining nonclinical chatbot roles, ensuring cultural-linguistic sensitivity, and integrating a responsive safety keyword protocol. The chatbot’s role was refined to act as a peer-like first responder offering empathetic support and referral, not diagnosis. Interdisciplinary collaboration was critical to maintaining clinical boundaries and user protection. Ultimately, chatbot systems must be developed as ethically grounded, culturally responsive, and professionally supervised tools that complement, not replace, human mental health care and protect vulnerable users."

This article proposes an energy management strategy based on backstepping control, applied to a hybrid system combining multiple energy sources. The chosen architecture is based on a continuous bus, sized to meet the different load demands. The system utilizes the energy produced by photovoltaic modules, with a maximum power point tracking algorithm based on backstepping control, as well as the energy stored in a battery, in order to meet the variable energy needs. The developed control method allows an optimal distribution of power between the different sources, ensuring the stability of the overall system. The backstepping control scheme takes into account the physical constraints of the components as well as the variations in energy demand. A dynamic modeling of the system is first presented, followed by the development of the controller and the analysis of its stability using Lyapunov’s theory. Simulation results validate the proposed approach, showing a significant improvement in energy efficiency, dynamic response, and management of transitions between sources. Finally, the robustness of the control system in the face of uncertainties and disturbances is also evaluated."

This paper aims to compare and contrast various machine learning algorithms based on their performance prediction of human behaviour on a variety of datasets. K-nearest neighbours (KNN), decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and artificial neural networks are the kinds of algorithms that are examined in this article. To identify the optimal method for behavioural prediction, performance parameters like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed. Being able to predict human behaviour is a major focus for many fields where understanding and predicting the individual and group level behaviours of humans is of interest. Predicting things like customer purchases, internet behaviour or social interactions can enhance social welfare and drive corporate growth. Machine learning also gives us powerful techniques for exploring behaviour patterns in complex data sources. The field of intelligent environment development finds several uses for behaviour modelling. It has been used for a variety of tasks, including classifying various diseases, forecasting customer behaviour and operations, and illustrating energy consumption. Particularly, behaviour prediction helps to predict users' future development as well as to spot those actions that vary from the predicted behaviour. This work investigates and contrasts numerous behaviour prediction techniques and suggests the usage of embeddings to reflect the user activities. The objective of this paper is to compare the predicted capabilities and limitations of well-known algorithms."

This paper presents a front-end prototype of an AI-powered security dashboard, namely, CryptoGuard. Developed through a user-centered design process, the prototype was constructed as a high-fidelity, click-through model from Figma mockups to simulate key user interactions. It is designed to assist users in monitoring their login and transaction activity, identifying any suspicious behavior, and enabling them to take action directly within the wallet interface. The dashboard is designed for a general audience, prioritizing an intuitive user experience for non-technical individuals. Although its AI functionality is conceptual, the prototype demonstrates features like visual alerts and reporting. This work is positioned explicitly as a design concept, bridging cryptojacking detection research with human-centered interface design. This paper also demonstrates how usability heuristics can directly inform a tool’s ability to support rapid and confident decision-making under real-world threats. This paper argues that practical security tools require not only robust backend functionality but also a user-centric design that communicates risk and empowers users to take meaningful action."

This work proposes a framework for access layer design in 6G-based Smart Hospitals. The main focus of this framework is the APP problem. The framework either extends existing infrastructure or determines initial AP placement and types (known as the initialization block). Real-world factors are then integrated, and each AP is locally optimized to best serve the UEs within its serving set (known as the optimization block). In the initialization block, we present a weighted k-means clustering algorithm, optionally enhanced with a novel Node Adjustment mechanism to reduce dependence on weight heuristics and yield more realistic placement. We also introduce a rule-based AP type-assignment strategy, ensuring compliance with cluster requirements and budget limits. The optimization block defines a realistic model using a radius-based serving set. Experimental results show that both k-means and weighted k-means yield similar results in terms of cost and coverage metrics. However, the weighted method demonstrates superior performance in departmental coverage."

P2X is an important tool to achieve carbon neutrality such as EU’s Green Deal initiative that sets year 2050 to become climate neutral. To make P2X initiative successful it is important to develop methods, strategies and frameworks that ensure competitive energy prices while meeting growing energy demands of the industry. The current model of energy production, distribution and consumption dates back to the first Industrial Revolution. At that time coal, oil, and natural gas was the primary source of energy for the industry, however, in a P2X world, the industry needs major changes in the existing model of production, distribution and consumption of energy to be more sustainable but also commercially viable. This paper proposes strategies to develop a framework that is not only sustainable but also commercially viable for the industry to embrace P2X initiative and reduce their carbon footprint to achieve carbon neutrality goals."

    "abstract": "Green transport is increasingly replacing carbon- emitting vehicles worldwide. Electric energy is now more important as a result of the widespread use of electric vehicles (EVs), These vehicles are different from conventional fossil fuel-powered vehicles, particularly in terms of how long it takes to maintain them. Electric vehicle-charging service provider (EVSPs) must be requested to schedule charging time appropriate in advance. Well-organized management will demand for electric vehicle charging stations, which may increase as a result of energy trading between providers and consumers, which can reduce the cost compared to conventional power utility companies. Although relying on third-party platforms lacks security and exposes users to attacks and privacy leaks, the majority of EVSP services are based on them. In this paper, the system on renewable energy is proposed. So, it requires the friendly mobility app connect to the nearby charging station. It also eliminates third- party platforms through a blockchain database mechanism and create a multi-faceted security system between electric vehicles and Service Providers(SPs). In proposed work, by completing distributed Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) identity registration, digital certificates can be obtained. User registration is decoupled from verification, eliminating reliance on EVSP for information security. Smart contracts are used in the verification process to address issues with centralized verification and opaque services. There is a outline in system deployment's implementation details on the Ethereum blockchain platform. The users can pay the charging fee through an e-wallet. Furthermore, Cost calculations and develop an Android app, which makes users easily accessible is presented. The suggested system minimizes human interaction while fostering EV participant privacy, trust, and transparency."

    "abstract": "Point cloud semantic segmentation is crucial for perception in unknown environments and 3D scene understanding. However, the sparsity of point clouds and the information loss from projection methods limit the segmentation accuracy. This paper proposes a point cloud semantic segmentation framework that combines the visual large model Segment Anything Model(SAM) with a lightweight Refinement Module. Efficient segmentation is achieved through point cloud projection and an improved SAM encoder–decoder, while Refinement Module compensates for spatial information at the point level. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI dataset demonstrate that this method improves mIoU by 3.3% compared to current methods and shows advantages in categories such as buildings, fences, and vegetation, thereby validating the potential and application value of visual large models in point cloud semantic segmentation."

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of financial fraud in banking and e-commerce renders conventional detection techniques insufficient. This work presents a Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) framework, FraudGraph-CL, meant to improve fraud detection in financial transactions. The suggested method demonstrates complex interactions among consumers, transactions, stores, and gadgets by simulating financial operations as a heterogeneous graph. By using contrasting learning, depictions of nodes are enhanced, thereby enabling strong fraud classification even in low-data or hostile settings. Utilizing graph augmentation techniques such edge tampering and feature masking to improve anomaly identification, FraudGraph-CL combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with contrastive loss optimization. By 12.3% compared to state-of-the-art models, FraudGraph-CL increases fraud detection accuracy by 95.2%, 94.8% precision, and 96.1% AUC-ROC experimental outcomes on real-world financial datasets. Providing a scalable, real-time fraud protection system, the suggested framework is relevant in banking, digital payments, e-commerce platforms, and financial regulatory systems. FraudGraph-CL much improves fraud detection efficiency, interpretability, and adaptability against changing fraud techniques by using graph-based relational learning and self-supervised neural networks"

    "abstract": "Music is a fundamental aspect of generating emotions and creating engaging user experiences in different applications of digital media, such as film, gaming, and interactive narrative. Classical algorithmic composition techniques are incapable of producing contextually meaningful and emotion-aware music in real-time. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI), especially Transformer-based models, in recent years has demonstrated tremendous leaps in music generation. Though present models cannot dynamically modify music with respect to emotional cues, hence restricting their suitability in creating personal soundtracks, this study has the goal of creating an emotion-aware music generation system that learns to adapt based on user emotions through Transformer-based AI models. The suggested framework utilizes self-attention mechanisms in Transformers to create individualized soundtracks from emotional input signals. We train the model on large symbolic music datasets (e.g., MIDI, MAESTRO) and incorporate affective computing methods to translate user emotions into musical features like tempo, pitch, and harmony. Objective (perplexity, tonal coherence) and subjective (human listening tests) evaluations are performed. Experimental findings suggest that the Transformer model surpasses conventional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and GAN-based methods in preserving emotional coherence and musical structure. Subjective testing verifies that users find the produced soundtracks to be emotionally consistent with presented input cues. This study shows the potential of AI-based, real-time affective music generation, opening the door to individualized, adaptive soundtracks for multimedia applications. Future research will concentrate on the multimodal emotion recognition integration for enhanced accuracy."

    "abstract": "High-frequency stock trend forecasting is a critical component of financial decision-making that requires accurate and rapid prediction capabilities. Traditional optimization and prediction models often fall short in capturing the non-linear, volatile, and time-sensitive nature of high-frequency financial data. Existing swarm-based and deep learning techniques suffer from slow convergence, local optima entrapment, and lack of adaptability to dynamic market conditions. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Quantum-Inspired Swarm Forecasting Algorithm (QISFA) that integrates principles of quantum mechanics with particle swarm optimization (PSO) and deep learning to enhance forecasting performance. QISFA utilizes quantum-inspired behavior to improve population diversity and exploration capability while coupling with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based neural networks for capturing temporal dependencies in stock prices. The proposed method is tested on real high-frequency stock datasets and benchmarked against standard models. Experimental results demonstrate that QISFA significantly outperforms traditional PSO, LSTM, and hybrid models in terms of prediction accuracy, convergence speed, and robustness under varying market conditions. This approach presents a promising advancement for traders and analysts seeking intelligent tools for real-time market prediction."

The high volatility and non-linearity of CO data pose problems for traditional forecasting models. To address this issue, this paper presents the design, implementation, and analysis of a carbon monoxide concentration prediction system based on a hybrid methodology combining Fuzzy Time Series (FTS) and first-order Markov chains. This method is designed to address linguistic uncertainty and temporal dependence in environmental data. The methodology begins with the collection of high-frequency CO data from Semarang and pre-processing. Additionally, there are various modeling steps, such as Markov chain integration to create a probabilistic transition matrix; fuzzification to convert numerical data into qualitative states; and fuzzy time series modeling to identify transition patterns (FLRG). When the system was applied to a dataset consisting of 48 high-frequency data points, a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) value of 19.59% was obtained."

The algorithm aims to achieve high precision and high recall in foreign object detection while maintaining real-time performance. Specific improvements include: optimizing the backbone network structure by replacing the original C2PSA module with a Self-Calibrated Spatial Attention (SCSA) module; combining the RFA-Conv module with the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) module to enhance the extraction of local target features; and incorporating the Focaler-IOU loss function in the detection head to achieve adaptive fusion of multi-scale features and focus training on hard samples. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to a high-performance baseline model, the proposed improved model achieved further enhancements across key metrics. Specifically, Precision (P), Recall (R), mean Average Precision (mAP), and F1-score reached 0.910, 0.902, 0.895, and 0.906, respectively. Notably, there was a significant improvement in recall, successfully reducing the miss detection rate to below 9.8%. With a parameter count of 2.67M, the model effectively reduces false and missed detections with almost no increase in parameters, providing a more efficient, accurate, and lightweight technical solution for foreign object monitoring on mine coal conveyor belts."

    "abstract": "Wafer defect pattern classification is a key enabler of yield optimization in semiconductor manufacturing. Conventional supervised approaches, which rely heavily on manually labeled wafer maps, are increasingly constrained by scalability issues, labeling inconsistencies, and poor adaptability to novel or rare defect modes. This paper proposes a fully unsupervised framework that combines self-supervised representation learning with density-based clustering to analyze KLARF-format wafer maps without any ground-truth labels. Four state-of-the-art learning methods-SimCLR, BYOL, MoCo v2, and DINO-are used to extract high-dimensional embeddings that capture spatial and contextual characteristics of defect distributions. These embeddings are then reduced via PCA and clustered using KMeans and DBSCAN to uncover semantically meaningful defect groups. Clustering quality is quantitatively evaluated using Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, and Calinski-Harabasz Index, while UMAP and t-SNE visualizations aid in structural interpretation. The proposed pipeline addresses the critical challenges of class imbalance, evolving defect diversity, and the high cost of manual annotation, offering a scalable and label-free alternative for high-throughput wafer inspection."

    "abstract": "Intrusion Detection systems are essential for secure guarding digital infrastructures in opposition to an increasing number of sophisticated cyber threats. However, conventional IDS models regularly struggle with low detection accuracy, excessive fake alarm rates, and limited adaptability to evolving attack styles which challenges which are exacerbated with the aid of imbalanced datasets and confined function variety. To cope with those limitations, this paper proposes a hybrid intrusion detection framework that integrates a generative set of rules with a backpropagation-based neural network to decorate detection performance and machine robustness. The proposed model utilizes a Generative algorithm to synthesize sensible attack samples, in particular for underrepresented lessons within the KDD CUP 99. Those synthetic samples augment the training datsets and help mitigate class imbalance. A multilayer perceptron trained via backpropagation serves as the center detection engine, enabling effective category of each every day and malicious site visitors. The combination of artificial statistics complements the model’s generalization capability and improves its capability to detect both recognized and 0-day attacks. Experimental assessment on the KDD CUP 99 dataset benchmark demonstrates that the proposed hybrid version drastically outperforms conventional IDS strategies in terms of detection accuracy, fake superb rate, and adaptability. The outcomes affirm the effectiveness of mixing generative studying and supervised neural networks for clever, scalable, and real-time intrusion detection."

This condition stands as a predominant contributor to preventable visual impairment on a global scale. Identifying it early and taking action quickly are very important for preventing vision loss. However, current screening methods need experts and are often hard to access and costly, especially in areas that lack resources. New developments in artificial intelligence AI have shown great promise in automatically detecting DR, which can make screening more efficient and available to more people. This research looks at how AI models, especially deep learning methods, can be used to find diabetic retinopathy early. By using a convolutional neural network CNN model trained with large amounts of retinal images, the method we propose was very accurate in finding DR in its early stages. The findings indicate that AI-driven solutions can improve current screening procedures, shorten the time it takes to diagnose the condition, and lead to better results for patients."

Considerable modern planning and contemporary are needed in order to act proactively and decisively in each example of an incident: needing to have something beyond a conventional maintenance plan, it has developed into the need for a predictive strategy that leads to proactive identification of failure before significant depreciation of componentry results in total failure. The results of the benchmarking indicate, once again, that the hybrid method proposed in this paper outperforms benchmarks and traditional and single model based approaches, resulting in an F1-score of 94.3 % and an AUC-ROC of 95.4. The scheduling with respect to the PMI also resulted in a significant decrease in downtime, 28.6 %, and reduced inefficience, 17.4 %. The system provided not only performance gains, but also tolerated drift, and modeled for changing conditions when deployed in an edge-AI device test, with inference times under 2.1 seconds. Taken together, these results illustrate not only the efficiency of the model but also its practical viability for field deployment. The framework, by enhancing predictability and maintaining flexibility under uncertainty, contributes to the broader goal of sustainable energy management and positions hybrid machine learning as a credible enabler for smart maintenance in renewable infrastructures."

BlockFed uses Differential Privacy and Homomorphic Encryption to protect user data when training a model using a decentralized mechanism. To guarantee clarity and confidence between rival sales personnel, a Blockchain-based safe gathering is utilised. Experimental findings show that BlockFed records a high F1- score of 98.8 percent and zero privacy leakage, which provides a great privacy performance tradeoff. It is also modular and decentralized, which allows scaling easily with the participation of more vendors without either affecting performance.

This cutting-edge technology comprises three important layers, namely, SaaS (Software as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), and IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service). The SaaS layer provides different types of software applications for the end users, such as Google Workspace and Microsoft 365. The PaaS layer offers the development platform and tools, libraries, etc., for designing, developing, running, and managing applications on the cloud server, for instance, Google App Engine, Heroku, Microsoft Azure App Service, etc. The IaaS layer provides customizable infrastructure on demand. This layer manages the actual infrastructure using Infrastructure Management Software, which is called the Virtualization technique. It is observed that “Infrastructure” actually means a collection of the classical computers. Hence, the existing cloud computing applications finally run on the classical computers. The major limitations of the classical computers are that they can follow scaling style only horizontally and cannot significantly have upgraded the scaling style vertically. Due to its horizontal scale, it is more costly, the higher bandwidth rate consumes more energy, and has become complex in nature. To address this issue, this endeavor has proposed a new framework for cloud computing, where the IaaS will have only Quantum Computers and Neuromorphic Computers. Quantum and neuromorphic computers can easily scale-up vertically using their unique property, namely, superposition, entanglement, increasing the density of neural networks, Wafer-scale integration techniques, etc. In this way, the proposed framework for cloud computing will be more efficient in the context of energy consumption, bandwidth rate and computational power."

    "abstract": "Hybrid beamforming has emerged as an effective solution for high-frequency multi-antenna communication systems, enabling high spectral efficiency with reduced hardware cost. This work presents an AI-assisted hybrid beamforming framework that integrates traditional signal processing with deep learning for multi-user MIMO scenarios. The proposed system models a patch antenna array, enhanced channel conditions, and realistic line-of-sight/non-line-of-sight propagation to generate training datasets via optimal precoder computation. A neural network is designed to predict complex beamforming weights from estimated angles of arrival, using a correlation-based loss to align with optimal solutions. The framework also incorporates a direction-of-arrival estimator based on the MUSIC algorithm, enabling a hybrid approach where AI-predicted and classical beamforming weights can be compared or combined. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high beamforming accuracy and robustness to noise while significantly reducing the computational burden compared to purely optimization-based designs."

    "abstract": "The ICMPv6 \"Packet Too Big\" flooding attack is a significant threat to IPv6 network security, particularly when exploiting vulnerabilities in the automatic address configuration mechanism based on EUI-64 and the Privacy Extension feature. In this scenario, the attacker uses a fixed source address to send a large volume of malicious ICMPv6 packets to various destination addresses derived from the same address structure. This technique takes advantage of weaknesses in the handling of \"Packet Too Big\" messages and the deterministic nature of the EUI-64 format, potentially causing the target system to become overwhelmed and suffer from degraded network performance. This study utilizes a simulated dataset based on the described scenario to detect the attack using the decision tree algorithm. The evaluation results demonstrate that the algorithm effectively identifies attack patterns, achieving a test accuracy of 92.37%, with a precision of 100% for the Normal class and 86.76% for the Flood class. The recall for the Normal class is 84.73%, while the Flood class reaches 100%. The F1-score is 91.73% for the Normal class and 92.93% for the Flood class, indicating the model's strong ability to balance precision and recall across both classes."

Although traditional SEDDS development has predominantly relied on empirical methodologies, modern formulation science faces critical challenges, including limited experimental datasets, intricate formulation constraints, and the need for accurate predictive modeling of key quality attributes. In response to these limitations, this study proposes a novel Drug Formulation Agent (DFA) that integrates the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize realistic data, alongside a dual-task machine learning framework designed to concurrently predict nanoparticle size classification and drug release profiles. The proposed approach emphasizes both the quantitative evaluation of synthetic data quality and the predictive reliability of the machine learning models. Experimental results across three distinct testing scenarios reveal that Support Vector Machine (SVM) consistently outperforms other models, achieving the highest accuracy across all evaluated performance metrics. This study demonstrates the potential of LLM-guided synthetic data generation and predictive modeling to significantly enhance the efficiency and reliability of SEDDS development."

    "abstract": "At the most advanced stage, brain tumors are among the most fatal diseases, and resulting in a very short life expectancy. When brain tumors are misdiagnosed, patients get bad medical care that lowers their chances of surviving. Accurate classification of brain tumors is critical for planning treatment and improving the survival of people with brain tumors. In this manuscript, Brain Tumor Classification based on Optimized Jump-Gain Integral Recurrent Neural Network using MRI Images (BTC-JGIRNN- MRI) is proposed. Intially; input images are collected from Brain Tumor MRI Dataset. Then, the input data are preprocessed using Trainable SelfGuided Filter (TSGF) to remove noise and to improve image quality. Subsequently, the images that have been preprocessed are provided for feature extraction using SET to extract the statistical feature such as mean, standard division and variance. Then, the extracted features are provided to Sparse Reconstructive Multi-View Evidential Clustering Algorithm (SRMECA) for segmenting the regions of interest (ROI) from the pre-processed images. Then, the Jump-Gain Integral Recurrent Neural Network classifies the input as glioma, meningioma, no tumor and pituitary. Then it is given in to Federated Multi-Output Gaussian Processes (FMOGP) for post processing. The proposed BTC-JGIRNN-MRI method is implemented and assessed utilizing performance metrics like accuracy and recall. The suggested method attains 19.77%, 21.96% and 27.25% higher accuracy; 21.54%, 22.32% and 21.56% improved recall in comparison to current methods."

Active balancing transfers charge through converters with high energy efficiency, but its cost and complexity escalate in multi-thousand-cell system. Passive balancing relies on inexpensive resistors but dissipates substantial energy as heat. Therefore, energy consumption is high. This study proposes novel passive balancing method which enhances use of circulating current that naturally flows between parallel-connected strings with different SOC. The proposed method estimates the circulating currents using equivalent circuit, and an exhaustive search selects the string-disconnect switch pattern that produces the largest charging current into the string containing the battery with minimum SOC. Experiments on ninety batteries demonstrate that the proposed method dissipates 8.03 Wh-an energy-loss reduction of $39.6 \\%$ compared to a conventional method without considering circulating current. The proposed algorithm therefore enhances round-trip efficiency of battery system without adding any power-conversion hardware."

The new framework collects survey responses from a participant across varying levels that each have a different set of questions when they participate in a study over multiple sessions. The algorithm analyzes the data and predicts an individual's mental health status on the survey data from only a few levels, for the purpose of providing targeted intervention recommendations. We applied the Super Learner method to combine different machine learning Models, and the model uses a large data set to train and optimize the prediction system. The modified survey used for assessment increases accuracy adapted to the individual's questionnaire by asking about multiple sessions. The initial results provide an indication that there is a high level of accuracy predicting mental state, and the method has the potential for identifying early intervention needed and reducing limitations related to stigma for mental health."

These front-end systems represent the first and most critical stage in any ECG acquisition chain, as they must handle biopotential signals that are extremely low in amplitude, bandwidth-limited, and highly susceptible to environmental interference. After the description of general and innovative principles of ECG acquisition, some examples of sensor electrodes, as well as proposed solutions of ECG signal acquisition are given. Starting from electrode technologies, including wet, dry, and textile-based solutions, their impact on interface design is discussed in terms of impedance, motion artifacts, and patient comfort. The fundamental building blocks of ECG front-ends—instrumentation amplifiers, driven-right-leg (DRL) circuits, and filtering stages—are then investigated, highlighting design strategies and innovative proposals. In particular, the fundamental design requirements for amplifiers have been examined: the discussion will be centered on traditional voltage-mode architectures as well as emerging current-mode approaches, analyzing their advantages and limitations in terms of power efficiency, gain stability, and integration capability, as presented in recent literature for ECG interface design. Future perspectives are outlined, covering the role of advanced CMOS technologies in the development and design of analog systems for biosignal monitoring, as well as the needs of electrodes based on nanostructured and biocompatible maerials. Through an in-depth examination of recent literature, we have compared some state-of-the-art solutions and outlined future trends for the development of high-performance, low-power ECG analog acquisition systems, particularly in the context of portable and wearable medical devices."

Accurately modeling employee actions over time helps organizations detect anomalies and safeguard sensitive information. Existing methods often rely on static or rule-based approaches that fail to capture the dynamic and sequential nature of employee behavior, leading to poor prediction accuracy and delayed threat detection. To address these limitations, this study proposes a framework called Sequential Behavioral Data Modeling with Long Short-Term Memory Networks (SBDM-LSTM). This approach leverages the power of LSTM networks to analyze time-series employee activity data, such as access logs and system usage patterns. By learning temporal dependencies within behavioral sequences, the SBDM-LSTM model effectively predicts future actions and identifies deviations from standard patterns. The proposed method enhances real-time monitoring capabilities in government networks, enabling proactive detection of suspicious activities and insider threats. Experimental results demonstrate that the SBDM-LSTM framework outperforms traditional models in terms of prediction accuracy by 97.83%, early anomaly detection by 98.31%, precision by 97.64%, and latency by 98.27%, providing a robust solution for secure government network management."

The SmartBioBin is an automated system designed to classify and separate biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste at the source using embedded sensors and a microcontroller. The system employs an infrared (IR) sensor for object detection, a moisture sensor to identify organic content, and an inductive proximity sensor to detect metallic items. Based on sensor input, a servo motor directs the waste into the appropriate compartment, with LEDs providing visual indication. A 16x2 LCD displays real-time information, while a load cell measures the weight of deposited waste for capacity monitoring. By automating segregation, the SmartBioBin minimizes human intervention, improves sorting accuracy, and supports the generation of energy-rich by products from biodegradable waste. The novelty of SmartBioBin is that it not only segregates waste but also provides a simple user interface. LEDs indicate the type of waste, while the LCD shows methane levels and weight in real time. Unlike regular smart bins that stop at segregation, this system adds an extra layer of verification by detecting methane from decomposing organic matter, linking waste management with potential energy generation. Bringing segregation, monitoring, and feedback together in one compact unit makes SmartBioBin a practical and sustainable solution."

    "abstract": "Attacks on business email compromise (BEC) are becoming more complex and are causing primary data and financial losses. These attacks aim to affect users by sending them emails with incorrect information. Conventional rule-based detection systems fail to spot these attacks.BEC emails are identified in this paper using a machine learning-based approach, a Random Forest Classifier, and email header embeddings. The email headers are preprocessed and converted into vector embeddings to find hidden patterns unique to fraudulent emails. The model is trained on a labeled dataset, including authentic and BEC emails. The proposed method exhibited minimal false-positive outcomes and achieved a detection accuracy of 96.3%. Similar to other baseline machine learning models, it performs much better than rule-based models. It generalizes effectively to various assault variations overlooked previously, supporting the model's longevity. Utilizing embeddings in email header metadata greatly improves the identification of BEC attacks. The Random Forest-based approach provides a real-time, interpretable, scalable solution. This approach proves suitable for strengthening the email security systems of corporate enterprises."

    "abstract": "Precise mapping of forest vegetation, including both dominant tree species and other vegetation types, is essential for forest management and biodiversity conservation, yet traditional high-resolution imagery is limited in spatial coverage. The high revisit frequency of Sentinel-2 provides dense time-series observa tions that capture phenological differences among species across broad areas. In this study, we compiled all cloud-free Sentinel 2 images from 2023 for the Eastern Qilian Mountains, China. Twelve thematic classes were defined in this study, including six dominant tree taxa (five tree species and one Picea genus group), five vegetation-type classes (mixed forests, shrubland, and grassland), and one non-vegetation class. Vegetation phenology metrics were derived using two methods: a curve-fitting approach (TIMESAT) and a harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS). We integrated these phenological features with the original spectral bands, Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter, texture metrics, and topo graphic variables as inputs to multiple classifiers (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Convolutional Neural Network, Vision Transformer, and Extreme Gradient Boosting). We also applied Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to interpret model feature importance. Without phenological inputs, the best model achieved 92.5% overall accuracy. Incorporating phenological variables from TIMESAT increased accuracy to 96.1%—slightly higher than using HANTS-derived features (95.5%). SHAP analysis revealed that time-series phenological and spectral variables con tribute most to species discrimination, while SAR backscatter and topographic metrics provide crucial complementary information. These findings demonstrate that exploiting Sentinel-2's temporal dynamics alongside multi-source data markedly improves tree species classification in complex mountainous forests, and high light the added value of advanced phenology extraction methods and explainable machine learning techniques."

Herein, we take on the problem of relative navigation for the generalized version of the docking operation, which we address as proximity operations. Proximity operations typically involve only two actors, a chaser and a target. We leverage the similarities to proximity operations (prox-ops) from spacecraft robotic missions to frame the diverse docking scenarios with a set of phases the chaser undergoes on the way to its target. We emphasize the versatility on the use of factor graphs as a generalized representation to model the underlying simultaneous trajectory estimation and relative navigation problem that arises with any prox-ops scenario, regardless of the sensor suite or the agents’ dynamic constraints. To emphasize the flexibility of factor graphs as the modeling foundation for arbitrary underwater prox-ops, we compile a list of state-of-the-art research in the field and represent the different scenario using the same factor graph representation. We detail the procedure required to model, design, and implement factor graph-based estimators by addressing a long-distance acoustic homing scenario of an AUV to a moving mothership using data sets from simulated and real-world deployments; an analysis of these results is provided to shed light on the flexibility and limitations of the dynamic assumptions of the moving target. A description of our front- and back-end is also presented together with a timing breakdown of all processes to show its potential deployment on a real-time system."

We approach this problem by leveraging the mathematical foundations of 3D observer fields to explore and analyze 3D flows in reference frames that are more suitable to visual analysis than the input reference frame. We design novel interactive tools for determining, filtering, and combining reference frames for observer-aware 3D unsteady flow visualization. We represent the space of reference frame motions in a 3D spatial domain via a 6Dparameter space, in which every observer is a time-dependent curve. Our framework supports operations in this 6D observer space by separately focusing on two 3D subspaces, for 3D translations, and 3D rotations, respectively. We show that this approach facilitates a variety of interactions with 3D flow fields. Building on the interactive selection of observers, we furthermore introduce novel techniques such as observer-aware streamline- and pathline-filtering as well as observer-aware iso surface animations of scalar fluid properties for the enhanced visualization and analysis of 3D unsteady flows. We discuss the theoretical underpinnings as well as practical implementation considerations of our approach, and demonstrate the benefits of its 6+1D observer-based methodology on several 3D unsteady flow datasets."

    "abstract": "Synchronized and fresh communication of common information is vitally important in numerous multi-user network scenarios, whereby end-users must perform coordinated real-time action with the available information. However, developing efficient policies with performance guarantees is greatly complicated by the abruptly changing nature of related age and synchronization metrics. In particular, powerful approaches that are based on so-called drift-plus-penalty (DPP) methods could not be employed due to the non-traditional multiplicative update dynamics of age and synchronization. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by designing and analyzing a Lyapunov-drift-based algorithm under the non-traditional age and synchronization dynamics that is not only low-complexity and analyzable, but also performs better than all the prior designs in numerical investigations. By comparing our design with two alternatives using the DPP approach, we also shed some light on the key aspect of our design that enables the performance analysis, which may be useful in future studies in multiplicative update dynamics. Furthermore, we implement Feature-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods with reduced state spaces and RL with full-state observations. Fresh-Async performs very closely to feature-based RL method using a feature space consisting of average age, age asynchrony, and maximum age, and both algorithms exhibit competitive performance compared to full-state RL while maintaining superior computational efficiency. These investigations clarify the contrast between drift-based and RL-based designs, and also reveal how drift-based design can be beneficial for feature selection for RL operation."

But it suffers from the limitations of lossy secret recovery and binary image-oriented. PSIS can deal with grayscale/color images and offers lossless secret reconstruction. Whereas, the secret decoding is computationally intensive (i.e., <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O</i>(<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i> log<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>) for (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>) threshold) and the residual-image problem in PSIS compromises the security. In this paper, we are motivated to investigate a sharing technique that can preserve the advantages of both VCS and PSIS. Differing from existing VCS and PSIS, the proposed sharing method is accomplished based on the access structure partition (ASP) result. Essentially, an ASP guided image secret sharing approach is developed and three optimal ASP algorithms are designed. When compared with existing partition method, significant improvement is offered by our partition techniques especially for the (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>) threshold with a larger <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>. Take the (2; 15), (2; 18), and (4; 12) thresholds for example, the numbers of involved sub-access structures by our method are 4, 5, and 19, while the quantities by existing approach are 8, 10, and 45. The percentages of improvement are 100%, 100%, and 137%. Further, based on the partition result from ASP algorithms, we can employ (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>) probabilistic VCS (PVCS) to constitute a (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>) sharing method for encoding gray-level/color images.

    "abstract": "The integration of high-penetration renewable energy sources into multi-microgrids (MMGs) exacerbates the inherent limitations of the conventional frequency regulation framework, where decoupled load frequency control (LFC) and economic dispatch lead to suboptimal economic efficiency. To address this issue, this article formulates a real-time economic LFC problem for nonlinear MMGs and proposes a distributed optimal disturbance rejection control (DODRC) method. First, a comprehensive dynamic model of nonlinear MMGs is established, explicitly incorporating transmission losses-a critical yet often neglected factor in low/middle-voltage networks-along with operational constraints such as tie-line thermal limits and generation capacities. Second, the DODRC method is designed for nonlinear MMGs by deriving a supplementary compensating control loop that realizes the integration of the cascade extended state observer-based active disturbance rejection control with the partial primal–dual gradient algorithm. This development not only enables simultaneous real-time frequency regulation and economic optimization but also significantly enhances the antidisturbance capability against internal parameter uncertainties, external supply-demand imbalances, and measurement noises. Third, the stability of the proposed DODRC is rigorously proven from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. Experimental validation via an industrial control platform confirms its effectiveness and superiority. Comparative results demonstrate substantial improvements in disturbance rejection, noise suppression, and robustness to critical parameter variations, outperforming existing distributed optimal control methods."

    "abstract": "The pronounced nonlinearity of vehicle dynamics under extreme conditions presents a substantial challenge for motion control. The complexity of nonlinear modeling, parameter inaccuracies, and the high computational cost associated with high-order nonlinear control systems significantly hinder improvements in control stability and performance. To address these challenges, this article proposes an innovative data-driven model predictive control (DMPC) approach. A data-driven modeling (DM) technique is first introduced to construct a linear model based on step response input/output (I/O) data, with real-time compensation for model deviations using online data to more accurately capture the vehicle’s lateral and longitudinal dynamics. The stability of the model estimation error is rigorously analyzed, and a data-driven vehicle model with theoretical guarantees is established. A hierarchical stability control framework based on DM is then developed. The upper-level controller evaluates vehicle maneuverability and lateral stability to determine the required additional yaw moment, while the lower-level controller assesses longitudinal stability and traction, and incorporates lateral–longitudinal coupling to optimize motor torque distribution across the wheels. DM is validated using more than 25 000 s of low-adhesion road data, demonstrating significantly higher modeling accuracy than traditional nonlinear models (NLMs). Compared with the NLM-based controller, DMPC improves vehicle handling and lateral stability by 28.98% and 66.92%, respectively, while reducing driver workload by 33.72% in lateral tests. In longitudinal tests, the strategy increases vehicle acceleration by 58.65% and reduces yaw fluctuation by 79.5%. Finally, the robustness of DMPC is evaluated through parameter sensitivity analysis and variations in tire pressure."

    "abstract": "Online computation of energy-optimal trajectories is critically important for single-axis servo systems performing point-to-point positioning tasks. Indirect methods are widely adopted for this purpose due to their computational efficiency. However, existing methods are generally limited to systems with linear dynamics, while practical servo systems often exhibit nonlinear load torques that vary with load position. To address this, a novel online energy-optimal trajectory planning method is proposed to handle nonlinear load torques that is continuously differentiable and bounded. The method of variation of extremals is introduced to efficiently solve the resulting nonlinear two-point boundary value problems. Additionally, constraints on jerk, acceleration, and speed can also be considered. To verify its online computation performance, an orthogonal method is employed to design various positioning tasks. Numerical results show that the proposed method achieves computation times ranging from 7.2 to 55 ms on a Raspberry Pi and from 0.8 to 7.1 ms on a personal computer, outperforming MATLAB’s bvp4c solver by 11 to 29 times. Finally, the experimental results confirm that the energy-optimal trajectories significantly reduce energy consumption while maintaining comparable tracking performance to that of conventional trapezoidal speed trajectories and S-curve trajectories."

Deep learning techniques are used in the new approach for important events and key frame extraction, thus generating a coherent and meaningful summary. DSN uses feature abstraction, attention, and sequence modeling to effectively eliminate redundancy without losing representational fidelity.

    "abstract": "Background: The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) in low- and medium-voltage networks poses challenges to maintaining power quality. The DERs reduce grid inertia and increase harmonic distortion, which may interact with nonlinear loads and passive compensation elements. Objective: This paper investigates parallel resonance phenomena in shunt capacitor banks within feeders connected to photovoltaic (PV) converters and proposes a control-based damping solution. Method: The proposed strategy replaces the conventional current reference generation in the converter control with a theory-based approach to synthesize a resistive load, thereby emulating passive damping behavior. The technique is evaluated under both voltage-oriented control (VOC-PI) and finite control set (FCS) predictive control frameworks. Sensitivity analyses are carried out to examine the influence of grid and control parameters on the stability of shunt resonance. Results: Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed resistive-load synthesis method effectively mitigates resonance peaks without any hardware modification. The results indicate that the stability and safety of PV-VSC systems can be enhanced through minor adjustments in the converter control structure, offering a low-cost and easily implementable alternative to conventional passive or active filtering techniques."

This design addresses the issue of ionic liquid leakage in traditional graphene sandwich structures by integrating ionogel with graphene. By changing the resistance of the graphene sheet, the amplitude of the x-polarized wave can be modulated within the range of -3.9 dB to -40 dB, and the resonant frequency of the absorption spectrum of the y-polarized wave can be shifted from 13.8 GHz to 8.27 GHz. The equivalent transmission line model is constructed based on the induced electric field and surface current, and the dual-polarization tunable characteristics of the metasurface are analyzed. The results show that the experiments are in excellent agreement with the simulations, thereby validating the accuracy and feasibility of the proposed metasurface and enhancing the practicality and adaptability of tunable graphene-based metasurface."

    "abstract": "Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) networks face significant challenges in achieving optimal, reliable routing due to their large scale, high mobility, and rapidly changing topologies. Traditional routing approaches have been applied to address this highly dynamic behavior, but they often fail to deliver steady performance in dynamic environments. In this study, we introduce Quantum-Heuristic Routing for V2X (QHR-V2X), a novel paradigm that integrates the heuristic efficiency of the A* algorithm with quantum-inspired amplitude amplification. The proposed scheme is designed to enable rapid and optimal route discovery while reducing redundant exploration. This makes it particularly suitable for latency-sensitive vehicular environments. To validate its effectiveness, QHR-V2X was evaluated against two classical baselines, Dijkstra and A*, within grid-based simulation environments of increasing size and obstacle density. Experimental results show that QHR-V2X achieves significantly lower route-discovery time and reduced message overhead compared to classical algorithms, while maintaining path lengths nearly identical to those of the optimal routes produced by Dijkstra. These findings demonstrate the potential of QHR-V2X to improve scalability and responsiveness in next-generation V2X communications."

Herein, we contribute to: 1) by achieving decoupling through shifting the eigenvalues of the actuator matrix to avoid singularity, followed by the compensation of such shift through the integral action. To address; 2) we design a cascade-based control that formally proves convergence of the motion and stiffness tracking errors to zero. Finally, our contribution resolves; and 3) by ensuring robustness to uncertain dynamics parameters through adaptive approach. Notably, this methodology enables independent motion and stiffness control design, allowing the application of diverse control strategies. The proposed solution is validated in simulation and on an ASR hardware setup. The results prove that the method is capable of controlling motion and stiffness in a decoupled manner, while the adaptive strategy ensures improved tracking performance."

    "abstract": "This paper presents Discrete Event Simulator in Energy (DESTinE) Block, a blockchain-based data storage framework designed for power systems and optimized for resource-constrained environments, including grid-edge devices such as single-board computers. The proposed architecture leverages the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for storing large files while maintaining secure and traceable metadata on a custom blockchain named DESTinE Block. The metadata, comprising the IPFS Content Identifier (CID), uploader identity, administrator verification, and timestamp; is immutably recorded on-chain to ensure authenticity and integrity. DESTinE Block adopts a dual-blockchain abstraction, where the blockchain remains unaware of the IPFS storage layer to enhance security and limit the exposure of sensitive file data. The consensus mechanism is based on Proof of Authority (PoA), where both an administrator and an uploader with distinct cryptographic key pairs are required to create a block collaboratively. Each block contains verified signatures of both parties and is designed to be computationally efficient, enabling deployment on devices like the Raspberry Pi 5. The framework was tested on both an x86-based device and an ARM64-based Raspberry Pi, demonstrating its potential for secure, decentralized logging and measurement storage in smart grid applications. Moreover, DESTinE Block is compared with a similar framework based on Multichain. The results indicate that DESTinE Block provides a promising solution for tamper-evident data retention in distributed power system infrastructure while maintaining minimal hardware requirements."

As part of this system, a low-voltage folded-cascode (LV-FC) operational amplifier (OpAmp) with a class-AB output stage was designed and implemented using an LTPS thin film transistor (TFT) process on a 15μm-thick polyimide flexible substrate. The performance of 20 amplifier samples was thoroughly characterized under DC, AC, long-term bias-stress (up to 40,000 seconds), and temperature conditions (0∘C to 80∘C). The amplifier achieves a maximum DC gain of 64.2 dB and a gain-bandwidth product of 400 kHz, while operating reliably under a 6 V supply with a peak power consumption of 0.6 mW in a compact area of 1.38 mm2. Under bias stress, the gain degraded by only 2.5 dB and the offset shifted by 1.5 mV. Over the full temperature range, the average gain varied by less than 2 dB and the offset by under 6 mV. These results demonstrate strong robustness against PVT variations and prolonged stress, confirming the suitability of the proposed LV-FC amplifier for flexible, long-term, and large-area temperature sensing applications."

We focus on maximizing the secure computation rate by jointly optimizing artificial noise power, resource allocation, and offloading decisions for a multi-antenna scenario with wireless devices and a potential eavesdropper. We formulate this sum secure computation rate (SSCR) maximization problem as a mixed-integer programming problem and design an integrated deep reinforcement learning framework consisting of a discrete policy network module, a continuous policy network module, and an optimization module to derive binary offloading decisions, continuous time allocation, and an artificial noise covariance matrix. We evaluate the proposed approach through extensive simulations, and the results demonstrate that our approach can significantly enhance the security, energy efficiency, and computing capacity of wireless edge computing compared with existing works."

This complexity arises from determining the path of a character between platforms while considering various variables such as movement speed, gravity, and obstacles. To address these challenges, this study proposes the development of a pathfinding package specifically designed to address these issues. The package implements two main features: platform graph creation and platform navigation. The platform graph maps the game level in detail, while the platform navigation feature allows characters to move efficiently between platforms. The testing was carried out using two methods: execution time testing for the creation of the platform graph and prototype testing on two different platformer games. The results demonstrate that the package effectively provides a reliable navigation solution for platformer games, with platform graph creation execution times varying depending on the level size. Furthermore, the experiment results indicate that the pathfinding package has been successfully implemented and applied to other platformer games, showcasing its reusability. This package can help game developers create better character navigation and improve gameplay quality in platformer games."

    "abstract": "Cloud-based time-critical smart grid applications need to be able to efficiently schedule resources to maintain their performance and robustness in the presence of time varying loads and cyber intrusions. In fact, we find that simple heuristics as Round-Robin (RR) and Least-Loaded (LL) are not viable choices in adversarial settings and that single-layer DRL architectures cannot scale well and are not stable. To enable attack-aware and efficient performance scheduling, this work introduces a Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (HDRL) based structure along with a digital twin (DT) validation environment. In the HDRL model, local and global PPO agents work in sync to allocate resources at various levels and DT orchestrates redundancy of workloads and cyberattacks injection for resilience purposes. The assessment was performed on actual building load traces with normal, low attack, and high attack profiles. The results indicate that HDRL outperforms the baselines in terms of throughput, SLA violations and recovery time. Under high attack, HDRL also exhibited a reduction in SLA violations of more than 50% relative to LL and RR as well as $50 \\%$ decrease in the time needed for recovery. Using Wilcoxon signed-rank test, we statistically validate that the improvements by HDRL are indeed significant with adversarial workloads. These results conclude HDRL with DT validation to be a novel and viable approach to secure, resilient, and flexible scheduling in the cloud for smart grid applications."

Moreover, the integration of solar energy plays a pivotal role in further reducing energy costs, easing grid stress, and enhancing system efficiency. The findings demonstrate that incorporating solar energy reduces overall grid loading, improves system reliability, and prolongs the lifespan of grid infrastructure. By increasing solar energy utilization, the dependence on traditional energy sources is diminished, leading to a reduced carbon footprint and a more environmentally sustainable energy distribution system."

While traditional interventions such as the Graduated Licensing System (GLS) have made strides in mitigating this risk, substantial gaps remain in preparing novice drivers with the skills required for safe and independent driving. In response to these gaps, recent research has focused on developing more targeted and adaptive driver performance evaluation and advice systems. This review examines these developments, categorizing them into simulation-based, motion-based, and AIdriven approaches, including the emerging use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our analysis underscores several critical limitations in existing research, including the absence of real-world validation, a predominant reliance on single-modality data in field studies, inadequate emphasis on delivering explanatory and prioritized guidance in real-time systems, and a notable scarcity of efforts to adapt emerging AI models. MLLMs offer promising capabilities in multimodal perception and reasoning. Future research should focus on integrating lightweight, edge-compatible models, enhancing contextual advice through conversational AI, and developing robust prioritization frameworks for providing real-time advice. Addressing these gaps can contribute to the development of comprehensive systems that support novice drivers in improving their skills and reducing crash risks."

    "abstract": "An aspect that affects both the dependability and lifetime of wireless body area networks (WBANs), which are fundamental to modern continuous health monitoring systems, is the degree to which they use energy efficiently. Given that sensor nodes have limited battery capacity, improving energy use remains a significant issue of debate. This research examines a new method called Energy-Efficient and Enhanced Clustering with Routing (E3-CR), which is designed to make wireless body area networks (WBANs) last longer. Using factors such as remaining energy, communication distance, and density, the dynamic cluster head selection algorithm of E3-CR can maximize the energy efficiency of the whole network. On top of that, hybrid routing strategies improve connection inside and across clusters while lowering the amount of communication overhead and unnecessary transmissions. Research using simulated benchmark WBAN datasets showed that E3-CR is better than the best clustering algorithms in extending network life and reducing total energy use, cutting it by up to 28 percent. This approach guarantees a more consistent network connection and causes packets to be delivered more quickly. The study indicates that E3-CR is a great choice for long-term medical monitoring as it employs a more efficient and long-term strategy to lower the energy WBAN consumes."

    "abstract": "This research introduces a jurisdiction-aware, zk-SNARK-enhanced smart contract framework for scalable, cross-border intellectual property (IP) enforcement using blockchain infrastructure. By integrating Solidity-based contract logic, decentralized identifiers (DIDs), Layer-2 scaling, and real-time policy-aware oracles, the system supports legally compliant automation of patent licensing, copyright validation, and trademark dispute resolution. The framework consistently achieved enforcement accuracy above 97.6%, compliance robustness of 0.94, and throughput gains up to 3.4× relative to baseline architectures. It reduced contract execution latency by over 45%, and zk-SNARK proofs allowed secure, privacy-preserving ownership validation within 3.6 seconds proving time and sub-2 second verification. Formal verification and multichain interoperability further ensure logical integrity and cross-jurisdictional adaptability without centralized arbitration. Unlike high-latency or siloed systems, the proposed architecture maintains contract execution below 6.2 seconds and scales across 30+ jurisdictions, demonstrating readiness for deployment in next-generation, global IP management infrastructures."

    "abstract": "The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) systems has led to an exponential growth of operational data, much of which exists as unstructured, long-form text such as system logs and maintenance reports. This “textual exhaust” contains critical information for fault diagnosis, yet it remains largely untapped by traditional monitoring tools. Furthermore, standard Large Language Models (LLMs) are constrained by limited context windows, making them unsuitable for directly analyzing the lengthy data corpora from system-wide IoT incidents. This paper introduces a multi-stage NLP pipeline designed to overcome this limitation. Our method systematically segments vast streams of textual data, employs domain-specific summarization on each chunk, and aggregates these summaries to construct a coherent, human-readable narrative of system behavior. By applying this framework to a 350 MB simulated incident log, we demonstrate two key outcomes: a data reduction ratio of 85.8%, and an average quality score of 3.72 out of 5.0 as assessed by an LLM-as-a-Judge protocol. The generated summary accurately identifies the incident's root cause, indicating a clear path to reducing Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR) by transforming millions of log lines into actionable insights."

This analyzing principle based on fingerprint measurements comparison constitutes a challenge for the users since there are thousands of transformers equipped with OLTC in the field without any previous VAM traces data. This paper will describe the various aspects of practical use of this method and will demonstrate, through a case study, how signals obtained from sister transformers are comparable and could be taken as a comparison base method in case of non-availability of fingerprints measurements. By validating this approach, reliable OLTC’s online monitoring systems could be implemented based on direct real-time comparison between similar transformers on the same grid."

    "abstract": "In recent years, financial institutions have increasingly relied on artificial intelligence (AI) to evaluate credit ratings and economic risk. In the meantime, Many artificial intelligence-oriented models operate as black boxes, making decision-making difficult to understand. Lack of transparency raises doubts regarding regulatory compliance, justice, and responsibility. Explainable artificial intelligence (Xai) solves these challenges when one understands model predictions. The popular Xai method used to help grasp complex artificial intelligence models to ensure that their results are more dependable and understandable is Shapley's (SAPL) additive explanations. This paper investigates the application of the SHAP in evaluating financial risks and credit scores. Real-world financial data sets to train machine learning models, including gradient reinforcement techniques, neural networks, and decision-making trees. After that, the artificial intelligence decision-making process is investigated using the SHAP concerning several factors like income, credit history, and job status. This work evaluates SHAP's performance in improving interpretability and justice. Initial findings suggest that the SHAP provides unambiguous justifications for resource value and significantly increases the transparency of the model. Improved interpretability helps financial companies identify likely biases, enhancing ratings and regulatory compliance. According to the studies, AI financial models increase accountability and confidence. Including artificial intelligence-oriented credit scores into their operations would help most open financial companies improve decision-making processes, follow policies, and increase customer confidence."

Encryption provides better security, but it poses a significant challenge in identifying malicious behavior since conventional inspection methods do not allow for efficient analysis of encrypted data. This has led to the use of machine learning and particularly deep learning to provide solution to these multiple domains-as well as providing valuable methods for anomaly detection and analysis of encrypted traffic. The assertion is being made that when machine learning and deep learning are used without decrypting private information, these applications can provide security with intelligent recognition of patterns based on multiple analytic intersections without exposing sensitive private data during any possible learn process. However, challenges still exist such as the lack of data and adversarial attacks. Various techniques for anomaly detection in encrypted traffic using deep learning are presented in this paper.

Nevertheless, the massive and uncoordinated charging demand of EVs poses significant challenges to charging infrastructure, especially under dynamic electricity pricing and spatial constraints. To address this, we present a Green IoT-integrated intelligent scheduling framework that optimizes charging station (CS) allocation by incorporating the state of charge (SoC), distance, and pricing factors. Unlike conventional neural network-based approaches, our method leverages a hybrid deep learning architecture combining temporal sequence modeling with attention mechanisms, which enhances the accuracy of SoC prediction and facilitates more reliable scheduling decisions. Furthermore, we formulate multi-objective CS selection strategies that prioritize trade-offs among price, distance, and user preferences to ensure efficient utilization of resources. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the robustness of the proposed framework across multiple performance metrics, including prediction error (MAE), convergence efficiency, and SoC estimation accuracy. Results indicate that the integration of advanced optimization strategies significantly improves scheduling effectiveness compared to traditional AI models."

    "abstract": "Fake news's extensive proliferation on social media has become a major worldwide concern, undermining public trust in digital information and influencing elections, social movements, and health-related decisions. With the increasing reliance on online platforms for news consumption, studies reveal that false information spreads substantially faster-up to six times more quickly-than factual news on platforms like Twitter. This rapid propagation intensifies the need for robust, real-time misinformation detection mechanisms. Conventional methods for machine learning, like Logistic Regression and Random Forest has been used in this challenge but often struggle to understand the deeper contextual meanings embedded in short or ambiguous headlines. These models typically rely on surface-level features and are limited in capturing semantic nuances. The research offers a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)based method for detecting bogus news, a cutting-edge large language model (LLM) designed for deep Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, for the purpose of overcoming these limitations. Leveraging BERT's bidirectional encoding capabilities, the model captures complex linguistic patterns and contextual relationships, offering a more accurate classification of news headlines. In this work, a BERT-base-uncased model is finetuned using a labeled dataset of real and fake news headlines. After applying preprocessing techniques like normalization and subword tokenization, the dataset is strategically split into training, validation, and test sets. Model will be processed or trained over 5 epochs using the AdamW optimizer.

For prevalent C2 samples, the research method utilizes regression prediction methods based on static configuration decryption and symbolic regression. The experimental data for this paper is sourced from the multi-engine scanning and analysis platform VT. 139,998,761 VT samples were collected from June 2024 to June 2025, of which 22,153,930 had domain name hits. Based on the family classification criteria of the antivirus vendor ESET-NOD32, the analysis targets were selected by comprehensively considering the top backdoor malware rankings and C2 linking behavior. Based on VT dynamic data and manual analysis, a regression and prediction model for malicious C2s was developed based on static configuration decryption. Based on the model established above, a static configuration decryption engine is implemented on a computer using C and Lua programming languages to achieve regression of malicious C2 and output of related IOC information; and corresponding predictions are made based on the decrypted data stream generated by the engine using methods such as symbolic regression, ultimately realizing the application of cryptography and artificial intelligence in computer, information and network security."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the employment of machine learning (ML), especially the RL, in the adaptive beamforming in 6G mmWave networks. Key emphasis is put on improving the spectral efficiency, user mobility support and interference suppression through optimizing beamforming. The traditional, rule-based, and ML-based beamforming schemes are evaluated by spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, and SINR performance of the systems over different channels. Python and MATLAB-based simulations illustrate the benefits of ML-based beamforming for high-mobility and dense scenarios. The achievement indicates the capability of ML in real-time beamforming optimization, which may provide a promissory future direction for 6G networks. The results are useful for the development of future wireless communication systems."

This requires accurately forecasting complex renewable energy production, a task well-suited for deep neural networks due to their ability to model intricate temporal and spatial dynamics with low computational overhead compared to physics-based simulation. This work leverages a domain-specific normalization strategy and a modified Autoformer, a Transformer-like neural network architecture that uses the Cross-Correlation function for calculating time dependencies, to better capture signal periodicities and leverage future information. The resulting scheme was benchmarked against established forecasting architectures using real-world photovoltaic generation data, resulting in comparable accuracy with the added benefit of interpretable internal coefficients, which are shown to be a useful analytical tool."

    "abstract": "Transmission line towers are critical components of power transmission networks, and their structural health directly impacts the safe and stable operation of the power grid. Traditional manual inspection methods suffer from strong subjectivity, low efficiency, and high misjudgment rates, making them inadequate for large-scale and fine-grained maintenance tasks. To address these issues, an intelligent defect detection model for towers based on multi-scale feature fusion is proposed. First, 300 defect images collected by UAVs were annotated and augmented. Then, a feature pyramid network (FPN) structure was employed for feature extraction, with Convolutional Block Attention module incorporated to enhance defect recognition accuracy. Experimental results show that, compared to the baseline model, the proposed method improves accuracy, recall, and mAP@0.5 by 3.1%, 4.5%, and 3.3%, respectively. It also performs better in detecting small defects and in complex scenes, offering a practical solution for intelligent inspection of power facilities."

    "abstract": "Accurate weather forecasting is a complex task because atmospheric variables interact in highly nonlinear ways. In this study, the focus is on evaluating and comparing four machine learning algorithms for short-term weather prediction; namely, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB). The researchers used a publicly available dataset that has a record of 3000 weather readings (on a daily basis) including temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind speed, to train and assess each of the four algorithms. In order to ensure that an accurate evaluation occurs, the researcher clean the dataset, conducted feature scaling, and split the data into respective training and testing datasets. The performance is evaluated with respect to Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Average Error (MAE), and the coefficient of determination (R2). Those experiments show that the XGB algorithm achieves the lowest RMSE (7.9), and has the lowest MAE (6.0), the XGB algorithm also achieved the highest R2 <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(0.92)$</tex> compared to other algorithms. This suggests that ensemble-based boosting techniques are effective in predicting weather relative to distance- and margin-based methods. The study highlights XGB's potential for practical deployment in meteorological forecasting systems, while acknowledging dataset size and regional coverage as limitations for broader generalization."

    "abstract": "The global change toward digital governance has amplified the strategic importance of critical infrastructure (CI) and its regulation under various international digital sovereignty frameworks. Political regimes, including democratic, authoritarian, and hybrid ones, play a decisive role in shaping these infrastructure strategies based on ideological, security, and economic priorities. However, existing methods often adopt binary or linear models that fail to account for the complex, multi-causal nature of regime behavior and policy outcomes in digital sovereignty. These limitations restrict a nuanced understanding of how diverse political and contextual factors interact to shape CI governance. This paper proposes the use of Fuzzy Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) to overcome these issues by enabling the examination of causal configurations across multiple cases. fsQCA enables partial membership and assesses the interplay of political, economic, and technological factors that shape state strategies. Applying fsQCA to a cross-national sample, this research identifies multiple causal pathways through which different regime types adopt either high or low-intensity digital sovereignty strategies for CI protection. The findings reveal that no single factor determines strategy intensity; instead, regime type, cybersecurity threats, and foreign technology dependency interact in complex ways."
