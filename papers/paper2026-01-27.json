    "abstract": "Multidisciplinary tumour boards (MDTBs) play a central role in oncology decision-making but require manual processes and structuring large volumes of heterogeneous clinical information, resulting in a substantial documentation burden. In this work, we present ONCOTIMIA, a modular and secure clinical tool designed to integrate generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into oncology workflows and evaluate its application to the automatic completion of lung cancer tumour board forms using large language models (LLMs). The system combines a multi-layer data lake, hybrid relational and vector storage, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a rule-driven adaptive form model to transform unstructured clinical documentation into structured and standardised tumour board records. We assess the performance of six LLMs deployed through AWS Bedrock on ten lung cancer cases, measuring both completion form accuracy and end-to-end latency. The results demonstrate high performance across models, with the best performing configuration achieving an 80% of correct field completion and clinically acceptable response time for most LLMs. Larger and more recent models exhibit best accuracies without incurring prohibitive latency. These findings provide empirical evidence that LLM- assisted autocompletion form is technically feasible and operationally viable in multidisciplinary lung cancer workflows and support its potential to significantly reduce documentation burden while preserving data quality."

    "abstract": "Geometric frustration among competing spin exchanges can give rise to novel quantum phases by enhancing fluctuations that drive magnetic systems beyond the classical regime. We investigate the frustrated array of strongly correlated spin dimers in the bilayer triangular lattice antiferromagnet \\rcs{} under applied magnetic fields. A cascade of magnetization plateaus appears at \\(M/M_s = 1/3, 1/2, 2/3,\\) and \\(5/6\\), together with a weak anomalous feature near \\(M/M_s = 1/6\\), in fields up to 60 T. Concurrent changes in magneto-dielectric response follows the plateau boundaries. The finite slope of each plateau and the absence of a zero-field gap in our ultralow-temperature ac susceptibility down to 20 mK indicate broken \\(U(1)\\) spin-rotation symmetry. A minimal bilayer-dimer model treated with bond operator representation reproduces the low-field sequence only when \\(U(1)\\) symmetry is explicitly lifted by spin-orbit-driven, bond-dependent anisotropy. Near saturation, a projected triangular pseudospin model accounts for the high-field plateaus with modest further-neighbor interactions. These results demonstrate that anisotropic exchange arising from spin-orbit-coupled moments is essential for stabilizing the full plateau hierarchy in \\rcs{}, a mechanism overlooked in previous interpretations of Co-based triangular bilayers."

Chalykh, while eigenfunctions of the twisted Cherednik Hamiltonians are twisted non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials. Actually, the twisted Cherednik ground state is symmetric and coincides with a peculiar symmetric BAF. We lift this correspondence to excited states, and claim that both Cherednik eigenfunctions and BAF's can be combined to produce symmetric functions, which coincide with each other and are eigenfunctions of the both DIM Hamiltonians and power sums of the twisted Cherednik Hamiltonians at once. This reflects the correspondence between the DIM algebra and the spherical DAHA explicitly."

    "abstract": "Extensive studies suggested that fluid mechanical markers of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) derived from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can indicate disease progression risks, but to date this has not been translated clinically. This is because CFD requires specialized expertise and is time-consuming and low throughput, making it difficult to support clinical trials. A deep learning model that maps IA morphology to biomechanical markers can address this, enabling physicians to obtain these markers in real time without performing CFD. Here, we show that a Graph Transformer model that incorporates temporal information, which is supervised by large CFD data, can accurately predict Wall Shear Stress (WSS) across the cardiac cycle from IA surface meshes. The model effectively captures the temporal variations of the WSS pattern, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of up to 0.981 and a maximum-based relative L2 error of 2.8%. Ablation studies and SOTA comparison confirmed its optimality. Further, as pulsatile CFD data is computationally expensive to generate and sample sizes are limited, we engaged a strategy of injecting a large amount of steady-state CFD data, which are extremely low-cost to generate, as augmentation. This approach enhances network performance substantially when pulsatile CFD data sample size is small. Our study provides a proof of concept that temporal sequences cardiovascular fluid mechanical parameters can be computed in real time using a deep learning model from the geometric mesh, and this is achievable even with small pulsatile CFD sample size. Our approach is likely applicable to other cardiovascular scenarios."

An associated weighted centre of mass definition is also derived from this. The adjoint of the linearisation of this curvature map leads to a notion of weighted static metrics, which are natural candidates for weighted mass minimisers. This weighted curvature quantity is essentially the scalar curvature of a conformally related metric that Law, Lopez and Santiago used to considerably simplify the proof of the weighted positive mass theorem. We show an equivalence between static metrics and weighted static metrics via the conformal relationship, from which we show that a uniqueness theorem holds for weighted static manifolds with weighted minimal surface boundaries. Furthermore, we show that weighted manifolds satisfy a Riemannian Penrose inequality whose equality case holds precisely for these unique weighted static metrics."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "Low-resource languages such as isiZulu and isiXhosa face persistent challenges in machine translation due to limited parallel data and linguistic resources. Recent advances in large language models suggest that self-reflection, prompting a model to critique and revise its own outputs, can improve reasoning quality and factual consistency. Building on this idea, this paper introduces Reflective Translation, a prompt-based framework in which a model generates an initial translation, produces a structured self-critique, and then uses this reflection to generate a refined translation. The approach is evaluated on English-isiZulu and English-isiXhosa translation using OPUS-100 and NTREX-African, across multiple prompting strategies and confidence thresholds. Results show consistent improvements in both BLEU and COMET scores between first- and second-pass translations, with average gains of up to +0.22 BLEU and +0.18 COMET. Statistical significance testing using paired nonparametric tests confirms that these improvements are robust. The proposed method is model-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, and introduces a reflection-augmented dataset that can support future supervised or analysis-driven work. These findings demonstrate that structured self-reflection is a practical and effective mechanism for improving translation quality in low-resource settings."

    "abstract": "The transit method is currently one of our best means for the detection of potentially habitable \"Earth-like\" exoplanets. In principle, given sufficiently high photometric precision, cool Earth-sized exoplanets orbiting Sun-like stars could be discovered via single transit detections; however, this has not previously been achieved. In this work, we report a 10-hour long single transit event which occurred on the $V=10.1$ K-dwarf HD 137010 during K2 Campaign 15 in 2017. The transit is comparatively shallow ($225\\pm10$ ppm), but is detected at high signal-to-noise thanks to the exceptionally high photometric precision achieved for the target. Our analysis of the K2 photometry, historical and new imaging observations, and archival radial velocities and astrometry strongly indicate that the event was astrophysical, occurred on-target, and can be best explained by a transiting planet candidate, which we designate HD 137010 b. The single observed transit implies a radius of $1.06^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$ $R_\\oplus$, and assuming negligible orbital eccentricity we estimate an orbital period of $355^{+200}_{-59}$ days ($a=0.88^{+0.32}_{-0.10}$ AU), properties comparable to Earth. We project an incident flux of $0.29^{+0.11}_{-0.13}$ $I_\\oplus$, which would place HD 137010 b near the outer edge of the habitable zone. This is the first planet candidate with Earth-like radius and orbital properties that transits a Sun-like star bright enough for substantial follow-up observations."

Formed in the immediate vicinity of Sgr~A$^\\ast$, these stars are accelerated to velocities high enough to escape the GC and be observable in the Galactic halo. Using spectroscopy from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and astrometry from Gaia, we conducted a six-dimensional search for HVSs and identified a compelling candidate, hereafter DESI-312, whose bound trajectory can be confidently traced back to the GC. The star resides in the inner halo and exhibits supersolar metallicity ([Fe/H] $= 0.27\\pm 0.09$), distinct from other known stellar populations with radial orbits. Its inferred GC ejection velocity of $698^{+35}_{-27}$ is consistent with a Hills mechanism ejection, supporting an origin in the innermost regions of the Milky Way. We considered alternative origins for the star, including disk ejections from young clusters and globular clusters, but these scenarios fail to explain both its orbit and metallicity. Unlike previously identified A- and B-type HVSs, DESI-312 is a $\\sim 1\\,M_{\\odot}$ star on the main sequence or early subgiant branch, thus enabling a detailed chemical analysis of its atmosphere and offering a rare window - unobscured by dust and crowding - into the composition of the central regions of the Galaxy."

    "abstract": "Recent simulations have identified long-lived ``prompt cusps'' -- compact remnants of early density peaks with inner profiles $ρ\\propto r^{-3/2}$. They can survive hierarchical assembly and potentially enhance signals of dark matter annihilation. In this work, we incorporate prompt cusps into the semi-analytic substructure framework \\textsc{SASHIMI}, enabling a fully hierarchical, environment-dependent calculation of the annihilation luminosity that consistently tracks subhalos, sub-subhalos, and tidal stripping. We assign prompt cusps to first-generation microhalos and propagate their survival through the merger history, including an explicit treatment of cusps associated with stripped substructure. We find that the substructure hierarchy converges rapidly once a few levels are included, and that prompt cusps can raise the total annihilation boost of Milky-Way--size hosts at $z=0$ to $B\\sim O(10)$ for fiducial cusp-occupation assumptions, compared to a subhalo-only baseline of $B_{\\rm sh}\\sim\\mathrm{few}$. Across a wide range of host masses and redshifts, prompt cusps increase the normalization of $B(M_{\\rm host},z)$ while largely preserving its mass and redshift trends. Compared to universal-average, peak-based estimates, our fiducial boosts are lower by about an order of magnitude, primarily reflecting a correspondingly smaller inferred cusp abundance in host halos, highlighting the importance of unifying peak-based cusp formation with merger-tree evolution and environmental dependence."

Our framework guarantees a strict performance improvement under any proper loss. Our approach is based on a characterization of when strict improvement is possible: when the strong and reference models are not mutually calibrated. We formalize this condition, connect it to arbitrage and no-trade results from economics, and develop an efficient Bregman projection algorithm that guarantees worst-case loss reduction without labels. Experiments on representative LLMs across varying scales demonstrate that our label-free method significantly reduces proper losses and calibration errors, achieving performance competitive with supervised baselines."

We then introduce a generalized graph-based construction using a non-commutative two-qudit gate, denoted $GR$, which requires directed edges and an explicit vertex ordering. We show that complete directed graphs endowed with appropriate orientations, for an odd number of qudits generate fully antisymmetric multipartite states. Together, these results provide a unified graph-theoretic description of bosonic and fermionic exchange symmetry based on graph completeness and edge orientation."

Hyperbolic geometry provides a natural framework for representing such structures. Building on this property, this work introduces HexFormer, a hyperbolic vision transformer for image classification that incorporates exponential map aggregation within its attention mechanism. Two designs are explored: a hyperbolic ViT (HexFormer) and a hybrid variant (HexFormer-Hybrid) that combines a hyperbolic encoder with an Euclidean linear classification head. HexFormer incorporates a novel attention mechanism based on exponential map aggregation, which yields more accurate and stable aggregated representations than standard centroid based averaging, showing that simpler approaches retain competitive merit. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements over Euclidean baselines and prior hyperbolic ViTs, with the hybrid variant achieving the strongest overall results. Additionally, this study provides an analysis of gradient stability in hyperbolic transformers. The results reveal that hyperbolic models exhibit more stable gradients and reduced sensitivity to warmup strategies compared to Euclidean architectures, highlighting their robustness and efficiency in training. Overall, these findings indicate that hyperbolic geometry can enhance vision transformer architectures by improving gradient stability and accuracy. In addition, relatively simple mechanisms such as exponential map aggregation can provide strong practical benefits."

Based on this observation, we propose AdaRAS (Adaptive Reasoning Activation Steering), a lightweight test-time framework that improves reasoning reliability by selectively intervening on neuron activations. AdaRAS identifies Reasoning-Critical Neurons (RCNs) via a polarity-aware mean-difference criterion and adaptively steers their activations during inference, enhancing incorrect reasoning traces while avoiding degradation on already-correct cases. Experiments on 10 mathematics and coding benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements, including over 13% gains on AIME-24 and AIME-25. Moreover, AdaRAS exhibits strong transferability across datasets and scalability to stronger models, outperforming post-training methods without additional training or sampling cost."

We examine the width, the height, and the general morphological evolution of the central sheet; the numerical data is validated against prior experiments and used to guide the development of an energetic model for the maximum elevation of the central sheet. In particular, the rise of the central sheet resembles the spreading behaviour single-drop impacts, especially at high Weber and Reynolds numbers. This fact can be used to estimate scalings in the capillary- and viscous-dominated regimes, which can be used to collapse the trajectories. These insights provide a route for a more complete understanding of the dynamics for the central rising sheet, and anticipate the detailed study of its fragmentation characteristics"

    "abstract": "Humans construct internal world models and reason by manipulating the concepts within these models. Recent advances in AI, particularly chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, approximate such human cognitive abilities, where world models are believed to be embedded within large language models. Expert-level performance in formal and abstract domains such as mathematics and programming has been achieved in current systems by relying predominantly on verbal reasoning. However, they still lag far behind humans in domains like physical and spatial intelligence, which require richer representations and prior knowledge. The emergence of unified multimodal models (UMMs) capable of both verbal and visual generation has therefore sparked interest in more human-like reasoning grounded in complementary multimodal pathways, though their benefits remain unclear. From a world-model perspective, this paper presents the first principled study of when and how visual generation benefits reasoning. Our key position is the visual superiority hypothesis: for certain tasks--particularly those grounded in the physical world--visual generation more naturally serves as world models, whereas purely verbal world models encounter bottlenecks arising from representational limitations or insufficient prior knowledge. Theoretically, we formalize internal world modeling as a core component of CoT reasoning and analyze distinctions among different forms of world models. Empirically, we identify tasks that necessitate interleaved visual-verbal CoT reasoning, constructing a new evaluation suite, VisWorld-Eval. Controlled experiments on a state-of-the-art UMM show that interleaved CoT significantly outperforms purely verbal CoT on tasks that favor visual world modeling, but offers no clear advantage otherwise. Together, this work clarifies the potential of multimodal world modeling for more powerful, human-like multimodal AI."

We show that this framework encompasses Eringen's nonlocal elasticity model as a particular case, establishing an explicit connection between the two formulations.

Applying it to di-iodides enables atomic resolution characterisation of thin samples - down to the monolayer limit - for the first time. Our imaging, combined with complementary first-principles calculations, reveals an unusually small energy barrier between alternate stable stacking polytypes in few-layer films, enabling extrinsic control of the stacking phase. We also observe stable isolated iodine vacancies that do not aggregate to form extended structures, and identify and verify the stability of the various edge configurations of thin samples.

    "abstract": "Federated Continual Learning (FCL) leverages inter-client collaboration to balance new knowledge acquisition and prior knowledge retention in non-stationary data. However, existing batch-based FCL methods lack adaptability to streaming scenarios featuring category overlap between old and new data and absent task identifiers, leading to indistinguishability of old and new knowledge, uncertain task assignments for samples, and knowledge confusion.To address this, we propose streaming federated continual learning setting: per federated learning (FL) round, clients process streaming data with disjoint samples and potentially overlapping categories without task identifiers, necessitating sustained inference capability for all prior categories after each FL round.Next, we introduce FedKACE: 1) an adaptive inference model switching mechanism that enables unidirectional switching from local model to global model to achieve a trade-off between personalization and generalization; 2) a adaptive gradient-balanced replay scheme that reconciles new knowledge learning and old knowledge retention under overlapping-class scenarios; 3) a kernel spectral boundary buffer maintenance that preserves high-information and high-boundary-influence samples to optimize cross-round knowledge retention. Experiments across multiple scenarios and regret analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of FedKACE."

    "abstract": "Non-Hermitian systems display spectral and topological phenomena absent in Hermitian physics; yet, their geometric characterization can be hindered by an intrinsic ambiguity rooted in the eigenspace of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, which becomes especially pronounced in the pure quantum regime. Because left and right eigenvectors are not related by conjugation, their norms are not fixed, giving rise to a biorthogonal ${\\rm GL}(N,{\\mathbb C})$ gauge freedom. Consequently, the standard Berry connection admits four inequivalent definitions depending on how left and right eigenvectors are paired, giving rise to distinct Berry phases and generally complex-valued holonomies. Here we show that these ambiguities and the emergence of complex phases are fully resolved by introducing a covariant-derivative formalism built from the metric tensor of the Hilbert space of the underlying non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The resulting unique Berry connection remains real-valued under an arbitrary ${\\rm GL}(N,{\\mathbb C})$ frame change, and transforms as an affine gauge potential, while reducing to the conventional Berry (or Wilczek-Zee) connection in the Hermitian limit. This establishes an unambiguous and gauge-consistent geometric framework for Berry phases, non-Abelian holonomies, and topological invariants in quantum systems described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians."

This paper introduces PaW-ViT, Patch-based Warping Vision Transformer, a preprocessing approach rooted in anatomical knowledge that normalizes ear images to enhance the efficacy of ViT. By accurately aligning token boundaries to detected ear feature boundaries, PaW-ViT obtains greater robustness to shape, size, and pose variation. By aligning feature boundaries to natural ear curvature, it produces more consistent token representations for various morphologies. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of PaW-ViT on various ViT models (ViT-T, ViT-S, ViT-B, ViT-L) and yield reasonable alignment robustness to variation in shape, size, and pose. Our work aims to solve the disconnect between ear biometric morphological variation and transformer architecture positional sensitivity, presenting a possible avenue for authentication schemes."

Therefore, their aggregation requires a rigorous measurement-theoretic foundation to ensure mathematical validity, interpretability, and uniqueness. PFM establishes the principal axioms of unique preference aggregation, providing a rigorous basis on which aggregation can be demonstrated. In this paper, it is shown that commonly used aggregation approaches in MCDM - such as weighted arithmetic and geometric means, as well as weighted distance-based optimisation methods - often fail to produce consistent rankings and are therefore unsuitable for pure MCDM. In contrast, the unique preference aggregation presented here clarifies the mathematical limits of valid aggregation and provides a principled, implementable foundation for robust multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and multi-objective design optimisation (MODO) in multi-faceted problems."

We provide theoretical guarantees for statistical test power across our family of $f$-divergence estimates. While our test covers a variety of $f$-divergences, we bring particular focus to the Hockey-Stick divergence, motivated by its applications to differential privacy auditing and machine unlearning evaluation. For two-sample testing, experiments demonstrate that different $f$-divergences are sensitive to different localized differences, illustrating the importance of leveraging diverse statistics. For machine unlearning, we propose a relative test that distinguishes true unlearning failures from safe distributional variations."

    "abstract": "With the development of foundation model (FM), agentic AI systems are getting more attention, yet their inherent issues like hallucination and poor reasoning, coupled with the frequent ad-hoc nature of system design, lead to unreliable and brittle applications. Existing efforts to characterise agentic design patterns often lack a rigorous systems-theoretic foundation, resulting in high-level or convenience-based taxonomies that are difficult to implement. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a principled methodology for engineering robust AI agents. We propose two primary contributions: first, a novel system-theoretic framework that deconstructs an agentic AI system into five core, interacting functional subsystems: Reasoning & World Model, Perception & Grounding, Action Execution, Learning & Adaptation, and Inter-Agent Communication. Second, derived from this architecture and directly mapped to a comprehensive taxonomy of agentic challenges, we present a collection of 12 agentic design patterns. These patterns - categorised as Foundational, Cognitive & Decisional, Execution & Interaction, and Adaptive & Learning - offer reusable, structural solutions to recurring problems in agent design. The utility of the framework is demonstrated by a case study on the ReAct framework, showing how the proposed patterns can rectify systemic architectural deficiencies. This work provides a foundational language and a structured methodology to standardise agentic design communication among researchers and engineers, leading to more modular, understandable, and reliable autonomous systems."

The normal-mode structure is obtained analytically and the corresponding modal amplitudes determine the pattern of energy exchange between the two sectors. To bridge the discrete and semiclassical pictures, we introduce smooth envelope functions that provide a continuous effective description along the geometric variable. Numerical simulations in a truncated Fock space show that the two oscillators exchange quanta in an approximately out-of-phase manner, consistent with an effective conservation of $\\langle n_x\\rangle - \\langle n_y\\rangle$. The reduced entropy $S_x(t)$ exhibits periodic growth, indicating entanglement generation. These results demonstrate that even a minimal two-mode framework can capture key qualitative features of energy transfer and information flow during evaporation."

    "abstract": "Advances in quantum technologies are accelerating the demand for optical quantum state sensors that combine high precision, versatility, and scalability within a unified hardware platform. Quantum reservoir computing offers a powerful route toward this goal by exploiting the nonlinear dynamics of quantum systems to process and interpret quantum information efficiently. Photonic neural networks are particularly well suited for such implementations, owing to their intrinsic sensitivity to photon-encoded quantum information. However, the practical realisation of photonic quantum reservoirs remains constrained by the inherently weak optical nonlinearities of available materials and the technological challenges of fabricating densely coupled quantum networks. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical detection protocol that integrates the advantages of quantum reservoirs with the adaptive learning capabilities of analogue neural networks. This synergistic architecture substantially enhances information-extraction accuracy and robustness, enabling low-cost performance improvements of quantum light sensors. Based on the proposed approach, we achieved significant improvements in quantum state classification, tomography, and feature regression, even for reservoirs with a relatively small nonlinearity-to-losses ratio $U/γ\\approx 0.02$ in a network of only five nodes. By reducing reliance on material nonlinearity and reservoir size, the proposed approach facilitates the practical deployment of high-fidelity photonic quantum sensors on existing integrated platforms, paving the way toward chip-scale quantum processors and photonic sensing technologies."

This in turn forces operation in a regime where a (dressed) rotating-wave approximation (RWA) is valid, thereby restricting key aspects of their operation. Here, using only a single coupling axis in the laboratory frame, we introduce a dressed-qubit control protocol that optimally removes the CRT, eliminating the need for the RWA and delivering substantial improvements in multiple performance metrics, including single-qubit gate speed, two-qubit gate fidelity, spectroscopic range, clock stability, and coherence preservation. In addition, we provide a general parameterization together with a Floquet-based coherence-time expression, which elucidates the protocol's working principles and lowers the barrier to adoption. Collectively, these advances position our scheme as the state-of-the-art strategy for qubit control, paving the way for a wider class of quantum technologies to be realized using dressed-qubit architectures."

We show that this shortcoming can be addressed by using a distributional kernel, instead of the set-oriented criterion; and the resultant clusters achieve a new distribution-oriented objective to maximize the total similarity of all clusters (TSC). Our theoretical analysis shows that the resultant dendrogram guarantees a lower bound of TSC. The empirical evaluation shows the effectiveness of our proposed method on artificial and Spatial Transcriptomics (bioinformatics) datasets. Our proposed method successfully creates a dendrogram that is consistent with the biological regions in a Spatial Transcriptomics dataset, whereas other contenders fail."

Existing methods based on single-view or panoramic inputs improve spatial fidelity but fail to capture global geometry and semantic cues such as object layout and material properties. To address this, we propose Phys-NVAS, the first physics-aware NVAS framework that integrates spatial geometry modeling with vision-language semantic priors. A global 3D acoustic environment is reconstructed from multi-view images and depth maps to estimate room size and shape, enhancing spatial awareness of sound propagation. Meanwhile, a vision-language model extracts physics-aware priors of objects, layouts, and materials, capturing absorption and reflection beyond geometry. An acoustic feature fusion adapter unifies these cues into a physics-aware representation for binaural generation. Experiments on RWAVS demonstrate that Phys-NVAS yields binaural audio with improved realism and physical consistency."

    "abstract": "Generative recommendation provides a novel paradigm in which each item is represented by a discrete semantic ID (SID) learned from rich content. Most existing methods treat SIDs as predefined and train recommenders under static indexing. In practice, SIDs are typically optimized only for content reconstruction rather than recommendation accuracy. This leads to an objective mismatch: the system optimizes an indexing loss to learn the SID and a recommendation loss for interaction prediction, but because the tokenizer is trained independently, the recommendation loss cannot update it. A natural approach is to make semantic indexing differentiable so that recommendation gradients can directly influence SID learning, but this often causes codebook collapse, where only a few codes are used. We attribute this issue to early deterministic assignments that limit codebook exploration, resulting in imbalance and unstable optimization. In this paper, we propose DIGER (Differentiable Semantic ID for Generative Recommendation), a first step toward effective differentiable semantic IDs for generative recommendation. DIGER introduces Gumbel noise to explicitly encourage early-stage exploration over codes, mitigating codebook collapse and improving code utilization. To balance exploration and convergence, we further design two uncertainty decay strategies that gradually reduce the Gumbel noise, enabling a smooth transition from early exploration to exploitation of learned SIDs. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate consistent improvements from differentiable semantic IDs. These results confirm the effectiveness of aligning indexing and recommendation objectives through differentiable SIDs and highlight differentiable semantic indexing as a promising research direction."

The variation of the mass distribution of the LSS of the universe implies that observers residing in different locations may suffer bias in their measurements when they look at the images of distant galaxies. Here, we assess the influence of the local environment on weak gravitational lensing (WL) shear statistics in the context of relativistic $N$-body code, \\texttt{gevolution}. We derive numerical constraints on the cosmological parameters from the WL shear angular power spectrum and comment on the local environment's influence on WL shear. We find tighter constraints on the parameter $Ω_\\mathrm{m}$ above redshift $z$ = 0.2, which implies over this redshift the local environment's impact is minor. We also investigate the bispectrum and conclude that on average the impact of the local environment on $f_{\\rm NL}$ (a measure of non-Gaussianities) is minimal and consistent with zero effect. However, we find that within the assembly of all possible observers/locations, there will also be a few that could infer the parameter $f_{\\rm NL}$ of the order 10. These results could thus be used to estimate the uncertainty in the inference of cosmological parameters such as $f_{\\rm NL}$ based on WL shear bispectrum and thus may have implications for future surveys requiring precision at the percent level."

In this study, we established a comprehensive PMT optical model based on prior studies, taking into account the non-uniformity of photon detection efficiency (PDE) across the PMT surface and the variances in PDE as well as reflections among different PMTs. By collecting reflectance data from 669 PMTs and utilizing PDE data from mass testing systems, we estimated the thickness maps of the photocathode (PC) and the anti-reflective coating (ARC) for each PMT. We also determined the collection efficiency (CE) by decomposing PDE with consideration of the optical processes occurring within the PMTs. The refractive index and extinction coefficient of both the PC and ARC, along with the escape factor, were evaluated over a broad wavelength range of 300~nm to 700~nm, covering the entire spectrum of interest for JUNO. Compared to the prediction from a simplified PMT optical model, which assumes uniform PC and ARC across all PMTs of the same type, the further developed PMT optical model yields much more reflectance for HPK PMTs and less for NNVT PMTs, and the change in PDE is at the level of a few percent. This comprehensive PMT optical model also provides a valuable reference for other PMT-based applications."

Current research on PSFH segmentation predominantly relies on CNN and Transformer architectures, leaving the potential of more powerful models underexplored. In this work, we propose a Dual-Student and Teacher framework combining CNN and SAM (DSTCS), which integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into a dual student-teacher architecture. A cooperative learning mechanism between the CNN and SAM branches significantly improves segmentation accuracy. The proposed scheme also incorporates a specialized data augmentation strategy optimized for boundary processing and a novel loss function. Extensive experiments on the MICCAI 2023 and 2024 PSFH segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method exhibits superior robustness and significantly outperforms existing techniques, providing a reliable segmentation tool for clinical practice."

Combined with previous $^3$He measurements and improved theory, we obtain the most precise determination to date of the charge-radius difference between the alpha and helion particles of $r_{h}^2 -r_α^2$ of $1.0676(10)\\text{fm}^2$. This is consistent with other recent determinations and confirms that the current discrepancy between QED theory and experimentally observed ionization energies of excited states in helium is not apparent in the isotope shift."

Existing research primarily focuses on pedestrian-AV interactions, with limited attention given to other road users, such as cyclists and drivers of manually driven vehicles. So far, no studies have compared the effects of eHMIs across these three road user roles. Therefore, we conducted a within-subjects virtual reality experiment (N=40), evaluating the subjective and objective impact of an eHMI communicating the AV's intention to pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers under various levels of distraction (no distraction, visual noise, interference). eHMIs positively influenced safety perceptions, trust, perceived usefulness, and mental demand across all roles. While distraction and road user roles showed significant main effects, interaction effects were only observed in perceived usability. Thus, a unified eHMI design is effective, facilitating the standardization and broader adoption of eHMIs in diverse traffic."

    "abstract": "The automation of analog integrated circuit (IC) design remains a longstanding challenge, primarily due to the intricate interdependencies among physical layout, parasitic effects, and circuit-level performance. These interactions impose complex constraints that are difficult to accurately capture and optimize using conventional design methodologies. Although recent advances in machine learning (ML) have shown promise in automating specific stages of the analog design flow, the development of holistic, end-to-end frameworks that integrate these stages and iteratively refine layouts using post-layout, parasitic-aware performance feedback is still in its early stages. Furthermore, progress in this direction is hindered by the limited availability of open, high-quality datasets tailored to the analog domain, restricting both the benchmarking and the generalizability of ML-based techniques. To address these limitations, we present OSIRIS, a scalable dataset generation pipeline for analog IC design. OSIRIS systematically explores the design space of analog circuits while producing comprehensive performance metrics and metadata, thereby enabling ML-driven research in electronic design automation (EDA). In addition, we release a dataset consisting of 87,100 circuit variations generated with OSIRIS, accompanied by a reinforcement learning (RL)-based baseline method that exploits OSIRIS for analog design optimization."

    "abstract": "Current and upcoming large-scale structure surveys are pushing toward increasingly wide angular coverage, where wide-angle effects (arising from the varying line of sight across the curved sky) become critical for accurate modeling of the three-dimensional galaxy power spectrum. At the same time, these survey's broader redshift reach makes the effects of redshift evolution (beyond the effective-redshift approximation) non-negligible on large radial scales. Additional observational effects such as the survey window function and integral constraints also become significant on these large scales, necessitating a careful theoretical treatment to robustly constrain local primordial non-Gaussianities and relativistic effects. In this work, we present a consistent and accurate theoretical framework for modeling the commonly used power spectrum multipoles (PSM) on large scales using the discrete spherical Fourier-Bessel (dSFB) basis. This basis ensures numerical stability and allows an exact separation between angular and radial modes. Using the dSFB basis, we study the impact of wide-angle effects and redshift evolution on the PSM, and incorporate the effects of window function convolution and integral constraints. We validate our PSM modeling using lognormal mocks under radial integral constraints with realistic survey geometries, demonstrating the readiness of our framework for application to all-sky galaxy surveys."

To address this issue, we analyze the impact of different segments of the reasoning path on the correctness of the final result and, based on these insights, propose Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with Partial Reasoning Optimization (RPO), a plug-and-play reinforcement fine-tuning algorithm. Unlike traditional reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms that generate full reasoning paths, RPO trains the model by generating suffixes of the reasoning path using experience cache. During the rollout phase of training, RPO reduces token generation in this phase by approximately 95%, greatly lowering the theoretical time overhead. Compared with full-path reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms, RPO reduces the training time of the 1.5B model by 90% and the 7B model by 72%. At the same time, it can be integrated with typical algorithms such as GRPO and DAPO, enabling them to achieve training acceleration while maintaining performance comparable to the original algorithms.

When extended to fermions, CP4 leads to unusually tight correlations between the scalar and Yukawa sectors and induces tree-level flavor changing neutral couplings. Still, viable scenarios exist, in which quark flavor changing signals remain within experimental limits. In this work, we extend CP4 to the lepton sector and investigate whether the lepton-Higgs couplings and lepton flavor violating (LFV) signals can also be kept under control. We consider two classes of LFV processes: tree-level lepton decays of the 125 GeV Higgs boson and one-loop radiative decay $μ\\rightarrow eγ$. For each CP4-invariant lepton Yukawa scenario, we perform a focused Yukawa sector scan that uses physical lepton properties as input and suppresses LFV effects. We identify a promising CP4 3HDM scenario compatible with the present-day experimental constraints, show that it can accommodate the recent CMS hint of a 146 GeV scalar decaying to $eμ$, and argue that this interpretation can be tested at future colliders."

    "abstract": "Domain Generalization (DG) is a critical area that focuses on developing models capable of performing well on data from unseen distributions, which is essential for real-world applications. Existing approaches primarily concentrate on learning domain-invariant features, which assume that a model robust to variations in the source domains will generalize well to unseen target domains. However, these approaches neglect a deeper analysis at the parameter level, which makes the model hard to explicitly differentiate between parameters sensitive to domain shifts and those robust, potentially hindering its overall ability to generalize. In order to address these limitations, we first build a covariance-based parameter sensitivity analysis framework to quantify the sensitivity of each parameter in a model to domain shifts. By computing the covariance of parameter gradients across multiple source domains, we can identify parameters that are more susceptible to domain variations, which serves as our theoretical foundation. Based on this, we propose Domain-Sensitive Parameter Regularization (DSP-Reg), a principled framework that guides model optimization by a soft regularization technique that encourages the model to rely more on domain-invariant parameters while suppressing those that are domain-specific. This approach provides a more granular control over the model's learning process, leading to improved robustness and generalization to unseen domains. Extensive experiments on benchmarks, such as PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, and DomainNet, demonstrate that DSP-Reg outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an average accuracy of 66.7\\% and surpassing all baselines."

To address this, recent studies have applied natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques to classify comments according to developers' intentions. However, existing datasets for this task suffer from size limitations and class imbalance, as they rely on manual annotations and may not accurately represent the distribution of comments in real-world codebases.

We consider the low but finite Reynolds number regime, $Re = a U ρ_f / μ_f$, and the dilute limit of small droplet volume fraction $φ$. Here, $U$ denotes the magnitude of the relative velocity between the phases, $a$ the droplet radius, and $ρ_f$ and $μ_f$ the density and viscosity of the continuous phase, respectively. We show that the $O(Re)$ inertial corrections to the first and second moments of force scale as $O(ρ_f φU^2)$ and $O(aρ_fφU^2)$, respectively. Moreover, the ensemble average of the drag force and the higher-order force moments over the distribution of droplet velocities introduces additional contributions proportional to the velocity variance of the dispersed phase, both in the interphase momentum exchange and in the effective stress of the continuous phase. As a consequence, in dilute emulsions of buoyant droplets, the effective stress depends quadratically on the relative velocity between the phases, on the velocity variance of the dispersed phase, and on the spatial gradients of these quantities."

By utilizing bare Green's functions to map the quantum tunneling problem onto a scattering formalism, we demonstrate that the summation of infinite quantum paths recovers the exact tunneling coefficients, enabling an analytical solution of the Dyson equation where the strong nuclear force is modeled as a surface delta-shell impurity embedded within the Coulomb field. Applying this framework to the astrophysically relevant $p + {}^{7}\\text{Li}$, $p + {}^{14}\\text{N}$, and $p + {}^{23}\\text{Na}$ systems, we achieve precise agreement with experimental resonance energies while revealing a fundamental physical distinction in resonance formation. The heavier ${}^{23}\\text{Na}$ system is identified as a saturated state, residing on a geometric plateau where the resonance energy becomes insensitive to the interaction strength; our calculated value of $2.11$~MeV aligns remarkably well with the experimental level of $2.08$~MeV. In contrast, the lighter ${}^7\\text{Li}$ and ${}^{14}\\text{N}$ systems emerge as threshold states in a weak-coupling window, where the resonance energy is highly sensitive to the potential parameters and is sustained near the continuum edge. In this regime, our model yields energies of $0.489$~MeV and $1.067$~MeV, closely reproducing the experimental benchmarks of $0.441$~MeV and $1.058$~MeV, respectively.

However, as these architectures scale toward artificial Kitaev chains with phase-control loops, local accessibility becomes restricted, constraining conventional local parity control and detection. While Andreev molecules offer a platform for non-local intervention, deterministic protocols for parity manipulation have yet to be experimentally established. Here, we demonstrate deterministic non-local control over the parity configuration of a quantum dot (QD) by electrically modulating the coherent hybridization with a spatially adjacent QD within an Andreev molecule. By systematically investigating three distinct joint parity configuration regimes in the elastic co-tunneling limit, we experimentally uncover the operational conditions for this non-local control. In conjunction with theoretical simulations establishing a global phase diagram, we identify a set of universal selection rules governing parity transitions, dictated by the symmetry-imposed interplay between the joint parity configuration and the dominant inter-dot coupling mechanism (elastic co-tunneling vs. crossed Andreev reflection). Furthermore, we establish the supercurrent, directly signaled by zero-bias conductance peaks, as an intrinsic, sensor-free probe of the parity configuration, obviating the need for auxiliary charge sensors. Our results provide a validated physical framework for parity engineering, offering a key building block for scalable, multi-QD superconducting architectures."

Methodologically, we introduce a Pareto-consistent loss that balances trade-offs between regional uncertainties by adaptively reshaping the loss landscape and constraining convergence dynamics between interior and boundary regions; this guides the model toward Pareto-approximate solutions. To address boundary ambiguity, we further develop a fuzzy labeling mechanism that maintains binary confidence in non-boundary areas while enabling smooth transitions near boundaries, stabilizing gradients, and expanding flat regions in the loss surface.

However, the balanced workload assumption no longer holds in large language model (LLM) post-training due to the high variance in sequence lengths. Under imbalanced workloads, collective communication creates synchronization barriers, leading to under-utilization of devices with smaller workloads. This change in training dynamics calls for a revisit of the PS paradigm for its robustness to such imbalance. We propose \\textbf{On-Demand Communication (ODC)}, which adapts PS into Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) by replacing collective all-gather and reduce-scatter with direct point-to-point communication. Compared to FSDP, ODC reduces the synchronization barrier from once per layer to once per minibatch and decouples the workload on each device so that faster workers are not stalled. It also enables simpler and more effective load balancing at the minibatch level. Across diverse LLM post-training tasks, ODC consistently improves device utilization and training throughput, achieving up to a 36\\% speedup over standard FSDP. These results demonstrate that ODC is a superior fit for the prevalent imbalanced workloads in LLM post-training.

Its overall performance is significantly superior to all compared algorithms. In three-dimensional UAV path planning tasks, GeoSSA demonstrates excellent stability and superior path quality. In four categories of engineering design optimization problems, GeoSSA consistently attains the highest solution accuracy and strongest stability. GeoSSA not only exhibits outstanding global optimization performance on standard benchmark functions but also shows strong robustness and generalization ability in practical applications such as UAV path planning and engineering design. Therefore, GeoSSA provides an efficient and reliable solution framework for complex optimization problems."

    "abstract": "Estimating uncertainty in deep learning models is critical for reliable decision-making in high-stakes applications such as medical imaging. Prior research has established that the difference between an input sample and its reconstructed version produced by an auxiliary model can serve as a useful proxy for uncertainty. However, directly comparing reconstructions with the original input is degraded by information loss and sensitivity to superficial details, which limits its effectiveness. In this work, we propose Difference Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimation (DRUE), a method that mitigates this limitation by reconstructing inputs from two intermediate layers and measuring the discrepancy between their outputs as the uncertainty score. To evaluate uncertainty estimation in practice, we follow the widely used out-of-distribution (OOD) detection paradigm, where in-distribution (ID) training data are compared against datasets with increasing domain shift. Using glaucoma detection as the ID task, we demonstrate that DRUE consistently achieves superior AUC and AUPR across multiple OOD datasets, highlighting its robustness and reliability under distribution shift. This work provides a principled and effective framework for enhancing model reliability in uncertain environments."

However, inconsistent student participation and limited guidance can make this task challenging. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can provide structured content to streamline the process, their role in facilitating skill development and supporting medical education integration remains underexplored. To address this, we conducted a formative study with six medical educators and developed CaseMaster, an interactive probe that leverages LLM-generated content tailored to medical education to help users enhance their OCP skills. The controlled study suggests CaseMaster has the potential to both improve presentation quality and reduce workload compared to traditional methods, an implication reinforced by expert feedback. We propose guidelines for educators to develop adaptive, user-centered training methods using LLMs, while considering the implications of integrating advanced technologies into medical education."

The framework applies to any DSGE model through compositional pipelines where specifications are transformed, fixed points computed, and equilibria selected. We provide formal results and computational implementation for linear rational-expectations systems, reinterpreting Blanchard-Kahn conditions as a specific selection operator and verifying that standard solution methods (such as QZ decomposition and OccBin) realize this operation. We show that alternative selectors (minimal-variance, fiscal anchoring) become available under indeterminacy, revealing selection as a policy choice rather than a mathematical necessity. Our framework reveals the formal structure underlying DSGE solution methods, enabling programmatic verification and systematic comparison of selection rules."

In this paper, we consider a stationary RWMH chain ${\\bf X}$ taking values in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space and (subject only to the existence of densities with respect to Lebesgue measure) with general target distribution having finite second moment and general proposal random walk step-distribution. We prove, for any nonzero vector ${\\bf c}$, strict positivity of the autocorrelation function at unit lag for the stochastic process $\\langle{\\bf c},{\\bf X}\\rangle$, that is, \\[{\\operatorname{Corr}}(\\langle{\\bf c},{\\bf X}_0\\rangle,\\langle{\\bf c},{\\bf X}_1\\rangle)>0,\\] and we establish the same result, but with weak inequality (which can in some cases be equality) when the state space for ${\\bf X}$ is changed to the integer grid ${\\mathbb Z}^d$.

We study the autocorrelation indirectly, by considering the incremental variance function (or incremental second-moment function) at unit lag. The same approach allows us also for $r\\in[2,\\infty)$ to upper-bound the incremental $r$th-absolute-moment function at unit lag.

Using monthly data from 1999 to 2025, we develop a unified framework that integrates Time-Varying Parameter Structural VARs (TVP-SVAR) with advanced dependence structures, including DCC-GARCH, t-copulas, and mixed Clayton--Frank--Gumbel copulas. These models are empirically evaluated against leading machine learning techniques Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forests, and Support Vector Regression across seven macro-financial and energy variables, with Brent crude oil as the central asset. The findings reveal three major insights. First, TVP-SVAR consistently outperforms standard VAR models, confirming structural instability in energy transmission channels. Second, copula-based extensions capture non-linear and tail dependence more effectively than symmetric DCC models, particularly during periods of macroeconomic stress. Third, despite their methodological differences, copula-enhanced econometric models and GPR achieve statistically equivalent predictive accuracy (t-test p = 0.8444). However, only the econometric approach provides interpretable impulse responses, regime shifts, and tail-risk diagnostics. We conclude that machine learning can replicate predictive performance but cannot substitute the explanatory power of structural econometrics. This synthesis offers a pathway where AI accuracy and economic interpretability jointly inform energy policy and risk management."

    "abstract": "Accurate depth estimation is fundamental to 3D perception in autonomous driving, supporting tasks such as detection, tracking, and motion planning. However, monocular camera-based 3D detection suffers from depth ambiguity and reduced robustness under challenging conditions. Radar provides complementary advantages such as resilience to poor lighting and adverse weather, but its sparsity and low resolution limit its direct use in detection frameworks. This motivates the need for effective Radar-camera fusion with improved preprocessing and depth estimation strategies. We propose an end-to-end framework that enhances monocular 3D object detection through two key components. First, we introduce InstaRadar, an instance segmentation-guided expansion method that leverages pre-trained segmentation masks to enhance Radar density and semantic alignment, producing a more structured representation. InstaRadar achieves state-of-the-art results in Radar-guided depth estimation, showing its effectiveness in generating high-quality depth features. Second, we integrate the pre-trained RCDPT into the BEVDepth framework as a replacement for its depth module. With InstaRadar-enhanced inputs, the RCDPT integration consistently improves 3D detection performance. Overall, these components yield steady gains over the baseline BEVDepth model, demonstrating the effectiveness of InstaRadar and the advantage of explicit depth supervision in 3D object detection. Although the framework lags behind Radar-camera fusion models that directly extract BEV features, since Radar serves only as guidance rather than an independent feature stream, this limitation highlights potential for improvement. Future work will extend InstaRadar to point cloud-like representations and integrate a dedicated Radar branch with temporal cues for enhanced BEV fusion."

We derive a hydrodynamic limit when the number of immature compartments goes to infinity obtaining a partial differential equations system with boundary conditions, modelling hematopoiesis as a continuum. We assume that proliferation and differentiation are regulated and let the corresponding rates depend on the number of mature cells. This leads us to model the dynamics of the population by a Markov process in continuous time and discrete space, which does not satisfy the branching property. We prove the convergence in law of the stem and mature cells population size processes and of the empirical measures of the immature cells dynamics, conveniently rescaled, to the unique triplet involving coupled functions and a measure, which are solutions of a deterministic measure valued equation with boundary dynamics. The cell differentiation induces a transport term in space and the main difficulty comes from the boundary effects coming from stem and mature cells. We also prove that the limiting measure admits at each time a density with respect to Lebesgue measure and can be characterized as solution of a partial differential equation."

Findings confirm high demand across all groups, with notable gains in student speaking confidence. Our multi-stakeholder analysis surfaced a tension in long-term adoption vision: students favored open-ended conversational practice, while administrators emphasized curriculum-aligned assessment. We offer design recommendations for voice-enabled chatbots in low-resource multilingual contexts, highlighting the need for more intelligible speech output for non-native learners, one-tap interactions with simplified interfaces, and actionable analytics for educators.

In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study of code review dynamics in agent-generated PRs. Using a curated subset of the AIDev dataset, we analyze 19,450 inline review comments spanning 3,177 agent-authored PRs from real-world GitHub repositories. We first derive a taxonomy of 12 review comment themes using topic modeling combined with large language model (LLM)-assisted semantic clustering and consolidation. According to this taxonomy, we then investigate whether zero-shot prompts to LLM can reliably annotate review comments. Our evaluation against human annotations shows that open-source LLM achieves reasonably high exact match (78.63%), macro F1 score (0.78), and substantial agreement with human annotators at the review comment level. At the PR level, the LLM also correctly identifies the dominant review theme with 78% Top-1 accuracy and achieves an average Jaccard similarity of 0.76, indicating strong alignment with human judgments. Applying this annotation pipeline at scale, we find that apart from functional correctness and logical changes, reviews of agent-authored PRs predominantly focus on documentation gaps, refactoring needs, styling and formatting issues, with testing and security-related concerns. These findings suggest that while AI agents can accelerate code production, there remain gaps requiring targeted human review oversight."

For the first time, we derive this term from first principles in finite-temperature pure SU(3) Yang-Mills theory, incorporating a field-dependent renormalization factor--a calculation we also extend to theories with more colors. Employing this derived kinetic term alongside three commonly-used effective potentials (the Haar-measure, polynomial, and quasi-particle models), we demonstrate that it substantially modifies the predicted GW energy spectrum from confinement transitions by 1-2 orders of magnitude. Based on this, we provide the first complete analysis of the chiral transition within the Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) framework, described by the quark condensate. Our results reveal a clear dichotomy: while the Polyakov-loop kinetic term critically shapes GWs from confinement transitions, it has a negligible impact on the dynamics of the chiral transition, which is dominated by fermion condensation effects."

In this paper, we propose MSAM, a novel medication recommendation model that bridges the gap via multi-level medication abstraction. The model introduces a multi-head graph reasoning mechanism to organize flat daily medication sets into clinically meaningful semantic units, serving as intermediate abstraction results to propagate features from individual drugs to higher-level representations. Building on these units, MSAM performs two-stage abstraction over historical prescriptions and selected candidates via intra- and inter-level feature propagation across heterogeneous clinical structures, capturing collective therapeutic effects aligned with patient conditions. Experiments on two real-world clinical datasets show that MSAM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of structural medication abstraction for recommendation."

In studying GHD, we simulate multi-turn dialogues following LLMs initial response and observe an interesting phenomenon: hallucination-initiated multi-turn dialogues universally exhibit larger uncertainty fluctuations than factual ones across different domains. Based on the phenomenon, we propose a new score SpikeScore, which quantifies abrupt fluctuations in multi-turn dialogues. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that SpikeScore achieves strong cross-domain separability between hallucinated and non-hallucinated responses. Experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that the SpikeScore-based detection method outperforms representative baselines in cross-domain generalization and surpasses advanced generalization-oriented methods, verifying the effectiveness of our method in cross-domain hallucination detection."

    "abstract": "Traditional e-commerce recommender systems primarily optimize for user engagement and purchase likelihood, often neglecting the rigid physiological constraints required for human health. Standard collaborative filtering algorithms are structurally blind to these hard limits, frequently suggesting bundles that fail to meet specific total daily energy expenditure and macronutrient balance requirements. To address this disconnect, this paper introduces a Physics-Informed Neuro-Symbolic Recommender System that integrates nutritional science directly into the recommendation pipeline via a dual-layer architecture. The framework begins by constructing a semantic knowledge graph using sentence-level encoders to strictly align commercial products with authoritative nutritional data. During the training phase, an implicit physics regularizer applies a differentiable thermodynamic loss function, ensuring that learned latent embeddings reflect nutritional plausibility rather than simple popularity. Subsequently, during the inference phase, an explicit physics optimizer employs simulated annealing and elastic quantity optimization to generate discrete grocery bundles that strictly adhere to the user's protein and caloric targets."

    "abstract": "Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has been widely adopted in wearable devices; however, it has not been widely used in ingestible electronics, primarily due to concerns regarding severe tissue attenuation at the 2.4 GHz band. In this work, we systematically reevaluate the feasibility of BLE for ingestible applications by benchmarking its performance against representative sub-GHz communication schemes across power consumption, throughput, tissue-induced attenuation, latency, and system-level integration constraints. We demonstrate that incorporating an RF amplifier enables BLE to maintain robust communication links through tissue-mimicking media while preserving favorable energy efficiency. We further quantify the relationship between throughput and energy consumption over a wide operating range and demonstrate that, for the majority of ingestible sensing applications with throughput requirements below 100 kbps, BLE achieves substantially lower power consumption than sub-GHz alternatives. End-to-end latency measurements show that BLE offers significantly lower latency than sub-GHz solutions due to its native compatibility with modern computing infrastructure. Finally, we analyze antenna form factor and ecosystem integration, highlighting the mechanical and translational advantages of BLE in ingestible system design. Collectively, these results demonstrate that BLE, when appropriately configured, represents a compelling and scalable wireless communication solution for next-generation ingestible electronics."

    "abstract": "RNA inverse folding, designing sequences to form specific 3D structures, is critical for therapeutics, gene regulation, and synthetic biology. Current methods, focused on sequence recovery, struggle to address structural objectives like secondary structure consistency (SS), minimum free energy (MFE), and local distance difference test (LDDT), leading to suboptimal structural accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework integrated with a latent diffusion model (LDM). Drawing inspiration from the success of diffusion models in RNA inverse folding, which adeptly model complex sequence-structure interactions, we develop an LDM incorporating pre-trained RNA-FM embeddings from a large-scale RNA model. These embeddings capture co-evolutionary patterns, markedly improving sequence recovery accuracy. However, existing approaches, including diffusion-based methods, cannot effectively handle non-differentiable structural objectives. By contrast, RL excels in this task by using policy-driven reward optimization to navigate complex, non-gradient-based objectives, offering a significant advantage over traditional methods. In summary, we propose the Step-wise Optimization of Latent Diffusion Model (SOLD), a novel RL framework that optimizes single-step noise without sampling the full diffusion trajectory, achieving efficient refinement of multiple structural objectives. Experimental results demonstrate SOLD surpasses its LDM baseline and state-of-the-art methods across all metrics, establishing a robust framework for RNA inverse folding with profound implications for biotechnological and therapeutic applications."

However, the functions involved in the original form of this statement were not explicit. In an enormous effort Kawarabayashi, Thomas, and Wollan proved a similar statement with explicit (and single-exponential in $|V(H)|$) bounds. However, their proof replaces the statement \"a surface where $H$ does not embed'' with \"a surface of Euler-genus in $\\mathcal{O}(|H|^2)$''. In this paper we close this gap and prove that the bounds of Kawarabayashi, Thomas, and Wollan can be achieved with a tight bound on the Euler-genus. Moreover, we provide a more refined version of the GMST focussed exclusively on excluding, instead of a single graph, grid-like graphs that are minor-universal for a given set of surfaces. This allows us to give a description, in the style of Robertson and Seymour, of graphs excluding a graph of fixed Euler-genus as a minor, rather than focussing on the size of the graph."

To achieve high fidelity, we introduce a two-stage SF$\\to$RL training pipeline, where Reinforcement Learning with an IoU-based reward refines the point sequences to accurately match ground-truth contours. We find that the standard MLLM architecture possesses a strong, inherent capacity for low-level perception that can be unlocked without any specialized architecture. On segmentation benchmarks, SimpleSeg achieves performance that is comparable to, and often surpasses, methods relying on complex, task-specific designs. This work lays out that precise spatial understanding can emerge from simple point prediction, challenging the prevailing need for auxiliary components and paving the way for more unified and capable VLMs. Homepage: https://simpleseg.github.io/"

To bridge this gap, we establish nonlocal Kramers-Moyal formulas, rigorously generalizing the classical Kramers-Moyal relations to SDEs with multiplicative Lévy noise. These formulas provide a direct link between short-time transition probability densities (or sample path statistics) and the underlying SDE coefficients: the drift vector, diffusion matrix, Lévy jump measure kernel, and Lévy noise intensity functions. Leveraging these theoretical foundations, we develop novel data-driven algorithms capable of simultaneously identifying all governing components from data and establish convergence results and error analysis for the algorithms. We validate the framework through extensive numerical experiments on prototypical systems. This work provides a principled and practical toolbox for discovering interpretable SDE models governing complex systems influenced by discontinuous, heavy-tailed, state-dependent fluctuations, with broad applicability in climate science, neuroscience, epidemiology, finance, and biological physics."

PCB inspection poses unique challenges due to densely packed components, complex wiring structures, and subtle defect patterns that require specialized domain expertise. However, a high-quality, unified vision-language benchmark for quantitatively evaluating MLLMs across PCB inspection tasks remains absent, stemming not only from limited data availability but also from fragmented datasets and inconsistent standardization. To fill this gap, we propose UniPCB, the first unified vision-language benchmark for open-ended PCB quality inspection. UniPCB is built via a systematic pipeline that curates and standardizes data from disparate sources across three annotated scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce PCB-GPT, an MLLM trained on a new instruction dataset generated by this pipeline, utilizing a novel progressive curriculum that mimics the learning process of human experts. Evaluations on the UniPCB benchmark show that while existing MLLMs falter on domain-specific tasks, PCB-GPT establishes a new baseline. Notably, it more than doubles the performance on fine-grained defect localization compared to the strongest competitors, with significant advantages in localization and analysis. We will release the instruction data, benchmark, and model to facilitate future research."

While test-time defenses are promising, existing methods fail to provide sufficient robustness against strong attacks and are often hampered by high inference latency and task-specific applicability. To address these limitations, we start by investigating the intrinsic properties of AEs, which reveals that AEs exhibit severe feature inconsistency under progressive frequency attenuation. We further attribute this to the model's inherent spectral bias. Leveraging this insight, we propose an efficient test-time defense named Contrastive Spectral Rectification (CSR). CSR optimizes a rectification perturbation to realign the input with the natural manifold under a spectral-guided contrastive objective, which is applied input-adaptively. Extensive experiments across 16 classification benchmarks demonstrate that CSR outperforms the SOTA by an average of 18.1% against strong AutoAttack with modest inference overhead. Furthermore, CSR exhibits broad applicability across diverse visual tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Summu77/CSR."

Most existing trackers fail to adapt to such modality and temporal dynamics in a unified and effective manner, resulting in target representations that are neither discriminative nor temporally consistent. In this paper, we propose ProMoT, a novel tracking framework that jointly integrates cross-modal and temporal cues into a progressive prompting process, enabling continuous retrieval of target-aware representations. Specifically, we design an adaptive target query generator (QueryGen), which selectively aggregates informative spatio-temporal cues from diverse ghost representations through the dynamic sparse ghost fusion mechanism, thereby enabling the generation of target-aware queries. To further preserve fine-grained, temporally consistent target cues, we introduce a high-order contextual prompt updater (PromptUpdater), which encodes high-order cross-modal representations from current and previous frames. These prompts establish the compact and discriminative inter-frame context to not only refine the current frame’s features but also guide target localization in future frames. All components are built upon a parameter-shared backbone for RGB and TIR inputs, forming our complete ProMoT framework. Extensive experiments on both complete and missing modality RGB-T tracking benchmarks show that ProMoT consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance while balancing efficiency."

    "abstract": "With the explosive advancement of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the security of efficient UAV networks has become increasingly critical. Owing to the open nature of its communication environment, illegitimate malicious UAVs (MUs) can infer the position of the source UAV (SU) by analyzing received signals, thus compromising the SU location privacy. To protect the SU location privacy while ensuring efficient communication with legitimate receiving UAVs (RUs), we propose an Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (ARIS)-assisted covert communication scheme based on virtual partitioning and artificial noise (AN). Specifically, we design a novel ARIS architecture integrated with an AN module. This architecture dynamically partitions its reflecting elements into multiple sub-regions: one subset is optimized to enhance communication between the SU and RUs, while the other subset generates AN to interfere with the localization of the SU by MUs. We first derive the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for localization with received signal strength (RSS), based on which, we establish a joint optimization framework for communication enhancement and localization interference. Subsequently, we derive and validate the optimal ARIS partitioning and power allocation under average channel conditions. Finally, tailored optimization methods are proposed for the reflection precoding and AN design of the two partitions. Simulation results validate that, compared to baseline schemes, the proposed scheme significantly increases the localization error of MUs by approximately 37.65% with only a 3.69% reduction in the communication rate between the SU and RUs, thereby effectively protecting the SU location privacy."

In this paper, by setting specific random vectors and parameters to be estimated, we study the principles of Wiener filtering and its application in estimation problems. We ultimately derive results similar to CRLB and emphasize the conditions required to achieve this bound. This article helps students view CRLB from a different angle and gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between Wiener filtering and CRLB."

    "abstract": "Phishing emails are a common kind of cyberattack that aim to trick victims into giving over personal information, financial data, and login credentials. Traditional spam filters have a hard time detecting phishing emails because they often look like they came from a trusted source. The need for more sophisticated detection procedures to distinguish between legitimate and malicious emails is growing in response to the sophistication of phishing assaults. With the help of an Adaptive Reproductive Harris Hawks Optimisation (ARHHO) fine-tuner, to provide EfficientNet, a phishing email spam detector based on residual attention mechanisms (RAM). By zeroing in on important parts of the email's content, metadata, and embedded links, the RAC module improves feature extraction, which in turn improves classification accuracy and decreases false positives. At its core, EfficientNet guarantees scalable and efficient deep learning processing thanks to its optimised depth and breadth scaling. Furthermore, ARHHO optimises the model's hyperparameters in real-time to enhance generalisability and resilience through better classification performance. Extensive tests on benchmark phishing datasets are conducted to evaluate the proposed approach. Our model beats traditional deep learning methods like CNNs, LSTMs, and transformers in every metric to measured: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The use of attention-driven feature extraction in conjunction with adaptive optimisation techniques allows us to significantly improve phishing detection skills while simultaneously reducing the sum of false positives. By developing a sophisticated, effective, and scalable method for detecting phishing emails, this study makes a contribution to cybersecurity. Improvements based on transformer models, detection techniques that work in real-time, and strategies to withstand adversarial attacks are all part of the future. Enterprise email security solutions can effectively implement the suggested structure to reduce the risks of phishing attacks."

    "abstract": "Predictive decision-making has emerged in the dynamic retail landscape to maximize sales and enhance customer satisfaction. This study introduces an Advanced Dual-Layered Predictive Decision-Making Approach to address challenges in retail decision-making by leveraging analytics and machine learning techniques. The proposed model integrates Association Rule Mining (ARM) for uncovering hidden patterns, Feature Engineering to enrich data representation, and a Dual-Layered recommendation system. The first layer generates personalized recommendations and prioritizes the recommendations, while the second layer generates outliers. To ensure robust decision-making, the model incorporates Isolation Forest for outlier detection, enabling the identification and exclusion of anomalous data points. Precision, recall, F1 score, and mean absolute error (MAE) metrics evaluate the system’s performance. Experimental results in a retail dataset demonstrate significant improvements in predictive accuracy, with an F1 score of 0.92 and an MAE reduction of 15% compared to baseline models. This approach provides a scalable and adaptive framework for retail decision-making, enabling real-time optimization of inventory, promotions, and customer engagement strategies. Integrating ARM and machine learning ensures both interpretability and predictive power, making it a valuable tool for modern retail analytics."

During the imaging process, it produces a large number of defective pixels, i.e., bad pixels, and the imaging uniformity of the camera is poor, which greatly affects the quality of image output. To address the problem of poor image quality, the maximum inter-class variance method is first used to perform binarization processing on the image. On this basis, combined with the polarization distribution law, weight adaptive filtering is applied for denoising. The prior information entropy is extracted from the denoised image, which is then coupled with the atmospheric scattering model for equalization processing. Then, the complex wavelet is used to describe the image features, and the least squares support vector machine classifier is utilized to obtain the optimal decision criterion function. Finally, the optimally matched and enhanced target sub-image is output, and the image feature information is further enhanced. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves better subjective effects, and the objective evaluation parameters of the resulting image, such as peak signal-to-noise ratio, edge preservation index, equivalent number of looks, and Brownian random variance, are all improved compared with those of other commonly used algorithms."

We develop a model reference adaptive control framework that provably guarantees safety in two stages. In the first stage, we design a safe reference model to generate reference trajectories that satisfy CBF-based safety conditions. However, asymptotically tracking a safe reference trajectory does not automatically guarantee safety at every time step. Therefore, in the second stage, we formulate a chance-constrained optimization problem for the nonlinear system with dynamical uncertainties to track the reference model, while provably guaranteeing CBF-based safety constraint satisfaction at each time step up to a user-defined risk bound. We then provide a risk-tunable sampling-based scenario design approach to tune parameterized controllers that solve this optimization problem. In addition, for the special case of linear dynamics, we provide conditions on the uncertainty samples for the existence of controller parameters that can guarantee safe tracking. We illustrate the performance of our framework on a quadcopter navigation problem with obstacle avoidance constraints."

    "abstract": "The maximum likelihood attack strategy is known to be the optimal attack strategy for an eavesdropper in a wiretap channel scenario with additive white Gaussian noise channels under the distinguishing security criterion. The main drawback of this optimal attack is its high computational complexity. While this complexity doesn’t hinder the eavesdropper since he has unlimited computing power, it does present a significant challenge for legitimate parties. For them, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to estimate the outcome of the optimal attacker strategy to validate the secrecy of their communication system. In this paper, we introduce a low complexity method for generating upper and lower bounds on the attack performance of the eavesdropper to validate the security against the maximum likelihood attack strategy. We theoretically establish that the derived bounds represent valid constraints on the attack success probability under suitable constraints. The validation method is based on list generation and can be used for any linear block code. Furthermore, we propose a list generation algorithm for this validation method and show different ways to further reduce the complexity. We compare the proposed validation method with state-of-the-art attack strategies in numerical simulations for various error-correcting codes."

Different from traditional OS-CFAR, the proposed algorithm adopts the maximum between-class variance as a criterion to partition interference and background clutter regions, whereby interference signals are adaptively separated before clutter power estimation, thus avoiding the masking effect caused by fixed parameters. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted under various multi-target scenarios, and the results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhiits both superior performance and robust property, particularly in cases where OSCFAR fails."

    "abstract": "Attention is a fundamental cognitive process, and individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often experience challenges in both cognitive and emotional regulation. Although multiple object tracking (MOT) tasks are frequently used to assess attention impairments in ASD, most studies focus solely on behavioral responses and overlook physiological measures such as electroencephalogram (EEG). Moreover, the interaction between cognition and emotion during MOT tasks remains underexplored. This study addresses these gaps by examining cognitive load variations using the Theta/Alpha Ratio (TAR) in 31 ASD and 31 typically developing (TD) children, based on publicly available EEG data. Participants completed three tasks: neutral image viewing (IPAS), one-target 4-disc (MOT4), and one-target 8-disc (MOT8), representing low, intermediate, and high attentional loads, respectively, while listening to happiness and sadness prosodies. For each participant, TAR was calculated, and five EEG features were extracted: averaged TAR across all channels (allTAR) and TAR values from the frontal (fTAR), temporal (tTAR), parietal (pTAR), and central (cTAR) regions. A three-factor ANOVA (emotion types × attention levels × subject groups) was conducted, followed by post-hoc t-tests for multiple comparisons, and correlation analyses were performed between the five EEG features and clinical measures. Results revealed: (1) a significant interaction between attention level and emotional prosody for tTAR; (2) significant main effects of attention level in fTAR and cTAR, but no interaction with emotional prosody; (3) higher allTAR, fTAR, tTAR, cTAR, and pTAR in the ASD group compared to TD; and (4) stronger EEG clinical correlations in the ASD group during MOT-4. These findings confirm visual attention deficits and highlight the interplay between emotion and cognition in ASD, suggesting TAR as a potential biomarker for cognitive load and emotional modulation."

A chronic wound is a wound that does not heal within three months as these wounds are unresponsive to normal wound healing signals. Because these wounds are associated with conditions such as aging and diseases such as leprosy and diabetes, and because the number of cases of diabetes is increasing, the number of people with chronic wounds is also increasing. In recent times, using image processing and segmentation algorithms is necessary to make analysis on wounds images to effectively identify and detect wounds and highlight area in the image where the wound is present to determine its size in order to determine whether there is progress or not in the phase of wound healing. In this paper we will use different Yolo versions and UNet algorithm in detecting and segmenting the wounds images and determine their performance in terms of accuracy and speed. Chronic wounds dataset of 602 images taken from 69 leprosy patients which are RGB is used before applying data augmentation and 1562 RGB images are used after the upsampling to avoid the overfitting problem which leads to performance degradation."

    "abstract": "The water depth of very shallow water environment is much smaller than the that of a shallow water environment. The water depth of a typical very shallow water environment leads to a more severe interface scattering effect during the propagation of the sound wave, hence producing stronger sea-surface and bottom reverberation than those in shallow water environment. To address the reverberation suppression problem in the very shallow water environment, we propose advanced WISPR (Wagstaff’s Integration Silencing Processor) summation (AWSUM) filter aided alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The focus of this method is selecting feasible and reasonable approaches to suppress different reverberation components step by step. Firstly, we utilize ADMM to realize the low-rank and sparse matrix decomposition and then remove the low-rank matrix, and hence suppressing the bottom reverberation. Secondly, we employ the AWSUM filter to suppress the sea-surface reverberation, the volume reverberations and some residual of the bottom reverberation. Finally, we apply the hard thresholding operator to the output of AWSUM to suppress the weak reverberation around the target highlights. Compared to other robust principal component analysis (RPCA) methods and AWSUM Filter aided RPCA methods, the Bias of Integral Side Lobe Ratio (BISLR) of our method stabilizes at high value. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our method for reverberation suppression in the very shallow water environment."

Although methods based on traditional CNN do attain classification accuracies, they cannot achieve spatial localization. Conversely, our solution also provides localization in addition to detection by use of YOLOv8. Experimental data demonstrate that YOLOv8m overperforms YOLOv8n on mAP@0.5 (0.927 versus 0.896) as well as the accuracy on different classes (96.46% versus 90.98% meningioma, 93.22% versus 90.98% pituitary, 93.22% versus 90.98% no tumor, and 72.45% versus 63.5% glioma. The enhanced localization and lower rates of misclassification of YOLOv8m are verified by the qualitative assessment provided with the help of prediction images and confusion matrices. These findings show the potential of YOLOv8m as a stable and precise approach to tumor detection in real-time with the potential to be implemented within the clinical diagnostic systems."

Experimental validation against calibrated reference magnetometers demonstrates 99% accuracy for both DC and low-frequency AC measurements up to 8 kHz across all three orthogonal axes.

This survey provides a comprehensive examination of adversarial threats and corresponding defense mechanisms within the DRL paradigm. We begin with an in-depth background on DRL fundamentals, distinguishing between online and offline settings, and contrasting on-policy versus off-policy algorithms.

Traditional deep learning architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), ResNet50, Hybrid 3B Net with EfficientNetB2, EfficientNet-B0, as well as MobileNetV2 have gained widespread application for the same. Still, these models suffer from the limitation of capturing global spacial details, resulting in poor classification as well as segmentation accuracy for complex multiple-lesion cases. To overcome these issues, it is proposed to design an efficient Vision Transformer (ViT)-based model for multiple-lesion classification as well as segmentation of brain tumors. The said method makes effective utilization of the self-attention mechanism for capturing long-range dependencies within MRI images for identifying tumors with high precision. Extended experiments prove the ViT model achieved classification accuracy of 97.8%, precision of 97.3%, recall of 97.5%, F1-score of 97.4%, as well as Dice Similarity Coefficient of 94.6%, exhibiting the highest performance compared to all traditional methods. It is proven that the proposed ViT framework decreases validation loss by almost 2/3 as compared to baseline methods while boosting robustness tremendously. It is a strong candidate for clinical diagnostic options for neuro-oncology."

A distributed training approach using TensorFlow's TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) maximizes the model training process. The suggested CNN model is parallelized with TPU's numerous cloud-based instances, which allows for effective compute parallelization and drastically cuts down on model training durations. According to the experimental results, training the CNN model with the TPU significantly reduces model training times. The architecture of this CNN constitutes various layers, including Conv2D layers, which apply convolution operations, and conv_blocks, which typically consist of several Conv2D layers with activation functions like ReLU, often accompanied by batch normalization.

Finally, through these labels and manual correction, we constructed five grasping tasks to build a new continual learning dataset [kitchen waste grasp on continual learning (KWG-CL)] and proposed a novel continual learning method. By using this method, our algorithm achieves the highest average image-level grasp accuracy (77.28%) on the KWG-CL compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while exhibiting the least catastrophic forgetting.

    "abstract": "Aging of three types of 5-nF, 15-kV multisectioned metallized polypropylene (PP) capacitors was investigated under pulsed conditions, typically at 13.7 kV and 500 Hz, up to a hundred of millions of shots. Two of the types are built with regular PP specified up to <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$105~^{\\circ }$</tex-math> </inline-formula>C, and the third type, dubbed “HT,” uses a high-temperature PP film specified up to <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$130~^{\\circ }$</tex-math> </inline-formula>C. All parts were tested at room temperature (RT), <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$85~^{\\circ }$</tex-math> </inline-formula>C, and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$100~^{\\circ }$</tex-math> </inline-formula>C, and HT parts were tested at <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$130~^{\\circ }$</tex-math> </inline-formula>C. Control tests were done at dc at the same voltage, at <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$100~^{\\circ }$</tex-math> </inline-formula>C. In addition, selected parts were subjected to pure thermal aging at <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$100~^{\\circ }$</tex-math> </inline-formula>C. The rationale of pulsed testing was a highly accelerated aging compared to dc aging. Aging of the three capacitor types at different temperatures shows a tendency of aging being independent of temperature (in the specified ranges) at a large number of shots. Based on the results obtained with different discharge loads, it was concluded that the discharge current has no appreciable impact on aging at current levels typical for high voltage power supplies (HVPSs); voltage is the dominant factor. Pulsed aging results in capacitance loss (CL) of several percent at millions of pulses, whereas dc aging at the same and even higher voltages for more than 1000 hr yielded CL of fractions of a percent only. CL empirical fits using inverse power law are also offered. One regular PP type lost capacitance through self-healing, with the film exhibiting clearings’ pockmarks; the films of the other two types did not have the same pattern. The HT film was partially fused; the film of the other regular PP type that lost more than 10% of capacitance was largely indistinguishable from a fresh film, except for receding metallization edges. The edge recession, as evidenced by microphotography, caused by electrochemical corrosion, is responsible for CL."

    "abstract": "Emerging Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks, represented by Starlink, have developed a rapidly growing user base and increasing network traffic. Accurate and reliable satellite traffic prediction is essential for optimizing network performance and resource management. However, the high-speed motion of satellites and the uneven geographic distribution of users pose significant challenges to satellite network traffic prediction. Yet, empowered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and inter-satellite links (ISLs), new opportunities arise. This article proposes a Real-time Resilient Traffic Prediction (RRTP) framework via adjacent satellite collaboration. Unlike existing methods that rely solely on historical data and delayed ground updates, by exchanging real-time traffic data, the onboard collaborative prediction learns the spatiotemporal traffic correlations among adjacent satellites, updates the parameters of the neural network models, and timely corrects the predicted traffic volume. The base model can be pre-trained on the ground and uploaded to satellites to save computations. Since RRTP requires neither global nor continuous long-term data exchange, RRTP enhances resilience to abrupt traffic changes and unexpected events, such as link/satellite failures. The overhead, cost, and applicability of RRTP are further discussed and validated through comparative simulations of a series of mega-constellation case studies."

In accordance with common practice, the sample data can be modeled using Hermitian positive-definite (HPD) matrices, while the clutter covariance matrix is estimated as the geometric mean of the secondary HPD matrices. We define a projection that maps the HPD matrices to a submanifold with reduced clutter, aiming to increase the degree of separation of targets and clutter. Three MSP-MIG detectors corresponding to different geometric measures are proposed. Experimental results confirm the advantage of the MSP-MIG detectors compared with the conventional detectors as well as their counterparts without using MSP in sample-starved clutter."

To counter this attack, a misleading LADDER-based algorithm that misleads attackers with false register values and randomized passwords is proposed. To evaluate the attack and the proposed protocol, two attack scenarios and two password lengths have been leveraged on a PLC in a LAN environment. Results show that the misleading protocol causes each attacker to receive different passwords and data, disrupting brute-force attempts while enabling attacker identification. When tested with one thread and 20 Arduino kits, each kit found a different password and received different data when reading PLC registers. This approach not only prevents unauthorized access but also allows administrators to track attackers' IP addresses, highlighting the effectiveness of deception-based defenses in industrial security."

This paper puts forward a new blockchain-based paradigm for mobile payment systems that prioritizes privacy but retains high-security standards. This design leverages the essential capabilities of blockchain technology like decentralization, immutability, and cryptographic protection. It incorporates advanced privacy-protecting techniques such as zero-knowledge proofs and homomorphic encryption. The system design intended here is to mitigate common vulnerabilities present in centralized systems, reduce the risk of data breaches, and provide users with more control over their financial data. By comparative analysis and simulations, we show that our privacy-oriented blockchain solution strongly improves transaction security, minimizes fraud, and maintains user anonymity without sacrificing system performance or compliance with regulations.

    "abstract": "The principal component within the multi active bridge (MAB) topology is the high-frequency magnetic link (HFML) interconnecting multiple ports, thereby facilitating multidirectional power flow. However, a byproduct of this unifying AC magnetic link is the cross-coupled power flow induced by the inter-port phase shifts, subsequently preventing independent port-wise operation. Therefore, this work presents a time-domain analytical framework for the accurate estimation of the cross-coupled active power flow by applying a superposition-based approach to the MAB port-equivalent models. These port-equivalent models are derived from the full-order <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$n \\times n$</tex-math></inline-formula> inductance matrix (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathbf {L}$</tex-math></inline-formula>-matrix) extracted from an asymmetric integrated-leakage HFML via a single-port impedance measurement scheme. Furthermore, a control-integrated power decoupling (IPD) feedforward compensator is developed to suppress undesirable propagative voltage fluctuations during transient power flows, thereby ensuring port-wise decoupling of the converter. Steady-state experiments conducted on a 3.2 kW SiC-based four-port MAB prototype are used to validate the accuracy of the proposed time-domain model with respect to the terminal active powers. Whereas transient experiments with output-voltage step-changes are used to verify the improved decoupling performance of the proposed full-order <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathbf {L}$</tex-math></inline-formula>-matrix IPD scheme, in comparison with an uncompensated PI (Proportional-Integral) controller, and the existing <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$Y$</tex-math></inline-formula>-<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\Delta$</tex-math></inline-formula> (star-delta) decoupling method."

While integrating rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) enhances spectral efficiency, securing transmissions against unknown eavesdroppers with imperfect channel state information (CSI) remains a critical challenge. We propose a secure multi-user, multi-cluster RIS-assisted RSMA system for HAPs, jointly optimizing precoding, RIS beamforming, and cluster time allocation to maximize sum-rate under secrecy rate constraints. The non-convex problem is transformed into a tractable semidefinite program (SDP) via successive convex approximation, auxiliary variable bounding, and a rank-1 penalty method. Simulations demonstrate significant performance gains over benchmarks, robustness to practical RIS phase quantization, and scalability across varying numbers of users per cluster, validating the framework's efficacy."

While contemporary deep learning-based jamming recognition methods predominantly leverage time-frequency (TF) maps derived from Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) as primary features, this transformation inherently discards crucial fast transient information from the original time-domain signals. To address this limitation, we propose a novel time-frequency multi-representation jamming recognition algorithm. This algorithm synergistically integrates fine-grained time-domain features with the signal energy distribution from TF representations, thereby substantially enhancing recognition accuracy within intricate deceptive jamming scenarios. Furthermore, to capture global contextual dependencies often missed by local operations, a Transformer-based prediction framework is employed. This leverages its intrinsic self-attention mechanism, enhancing the model’s ability to discern complex patterns and thereby bolstering overall recognition robustness. Comprehensive experimental evaluations across diverse simulated complex deceptive jamming environments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently achieves a recognition accuracy surpassing 99%, unequivocally validating its superior performance and practical efficacy."

Our design comprises three core components: The Modeller, a gradient-free learning mechanism inherently capable of continual learning and structural adaptation; a planner for goal-directed action over learned models; and a behavior encapsulation mechanism that can decompose complex behaviors into a hierarchical structure. We demonstrate proof-of-principle operation in a simple test environment.

Traditional disaster assessment often lacks insight into public sentiment, a vital factor for effective response and recovery. This paper explores the application of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze public discourse on Twitter before, during, and after major disasters. The primary objective is to develop a robust sentiment analysis framework capable of accurately assessing and interpreting public sentiment using advanced NLP methods tailored for the characteristics of Twitter. This includes addressing challenges such as the real-time analysis requirements of Twitter’s rapid, short-form posting style, the noisy and ambiguous nature of tweet data, and the need to capture evolving public reactions as events unfold. By identifying sentiment trends and patterns on Twitter, this research aims to provide timely and actionable insights for disaster management agencies, policymakers, and humanitarian organizations to enhance disaster preparedness, response strategies, and communication efforts. This approach seeks to leverage the immediate feedback provided by Twitter to complement traditional disaster assessment methods, incorporating the crucial dimension of public emotional well-being during crises.

A collaborative agent architecture is introduced to enhance detection accuracy, threat correlation, and adaptive response effectiveness across distributed supply chain systems. The framework is evaluated using a Python-based NS-3 simulation with synthetic traffic, achieving 94% detection accuracy while maintaining low false positive rates. While synthetic data validates the initial design, future work will extend evaluation to real-world cloud environments and address explainability challenges. This integrated approach offers a scalable and resilient model for securing smart supply chains against evolving cyber threats."

    "abstract": "Banknotes are legally issued instruments that represent monetary value and are sanctioned by governmental authorities. However, their high value and widespread use have made them a frequent target for counterfeiting. Due to the striking similarity between genuine and counterfeit notes, accurately distinguishing between the two poses a considerable challenge. This study aims to evaluate the performance of various machine learning models using the Banknote Authentication dataset, with the objective of identifying the most effective model for classifying banknotes as genuine or counterfeit. The models employed include Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor, XGBoost Classifier, and Naive Bayes. Model robustness was validated using a Train-Test split methodology, with accuracy serving as the primary evaluation metric. Among the models tested, the XGBoost Classifier demonstrated the highest accuracy of 99.7273%, followed by K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes. The findings of this research provide valuable insights that may inform the development of more accurate and reliable predictive systems for banknote authentication."

The forged images, normally indistinguishable from real ones for the human eye, compromise security systems, media credibility, and the reliability of digital proof for forensics. To address the increasing demand for effective detection, this work presents a new approach that synergistically combines deep learning strategies with advanced feature analysis. The proposed approach is particularly designed for detecting the subtle artifacts and statistical anomalies inherent in the generation process of the GANs. The proposed approach is anticipated to obtain state of-the-art detection performance and improved generalizability across a large number of GAN architectures compared with the current detection strategies. The outcome of this work will be of great significance for the ongoing endeavors toward limiting the detrimental impact of fake images on security, media integrity, and the reliability of digital proof."

    "abstract": "Decentralized learning, which facilitates joint model training across geographically scattered agents, has gained significant attention in the field of signal and information processing in recent years. While the optimization errors of decentralized learning algorithms have been extensively studied, their generalization errors remain relatively under-explored. As the generalization error reflects the scalability of a trained model on unseen data and are crucial in determining the performance of a trained model in real-world applications, understanding the generalization error of decentralized learning is of paramount importance. In this paper, we present fine-grained generalization error analysis for both attack-free and Byzantine-resilient decentralized learning with heterogeneous data as well as under mild assumptions, in contrast to prior studies that consider homogeneous data and/or rely on a stringent bounded stochastic gradient assumption. Our results shed light on the impact of data heterogeneity, model initialization and stochastic gradient noise – factors that have not been closely investigated before – on the generalization error of decentralized learning. We also reveal that Byzantine attacks performed by malicious agents largely affect the generalization error, and their negative impact is inherently linked to the data heterogeneity while remaining independent on the sample size. Numerical experiments on both strongly convex and non-convex tasks are conducted to validate our theoretical findings."

    "abstract": "Ultra-lightweight authentication protocols are essential for resource-constrained environments such as RFID systems, where conventional cryptographic methods are impractical. The Cloud-based RFID Ultra-Lightweight Secure Authentication Protocol (CRUSAP) employs Bitwise Crossover rearrangement and Rotation-based primitives to achieve secure communication. This paper presents a comprehensive cryptanalytic evaluation, demonstrating that CRUSAP's reversible operations and deterministic design render it vulnerable to practical attacks. Full Disclosure, Desynchronization, and Time-Memory Trade-Off (TMTO) attacks compromise session secrecy and entity authenticity. Experimental analysis shows that 8-bit temporary identifiers (TIDS) are fully recoverable, while 96-bit TIDS can be partially recovered (60%) due to statistical leakage via a Full Disclosure attack. Time-Memory Trade-Off (TMTO) and Desynchronization attacks further allow the extraction of session keys and nonces. Although attacks on larger key sizes may demand significant computational resources, including GPUs and extensive memory, the protocol remains fundamentally vulnerable due to inherent structural weaknesses. Even with dynamic key updates, CRUSAP lacks adequate entropy isolation and structural robustness, highlighting the need for irreversible primitives, protocol redesign, or stronger lightweight authentication schemes."

Fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process, the proposed balun-LNA achieves a noise figure of 3.7–4.1 dB, a maximum voltage gain of 20 dB, and an input return loss (S₁₁) better than −10 dB across a 3-dB bandwidth of 2 GHz. The measured IIP3 ranges from 9.8 dBm to 13.5 dBm, corresponding to a peak OIP3 of 33.5 dBm. The LNA consumes 10.2 mA from a 1.2-V supply and occupies an active area of only 0.018 mm²."

In this paper, we argue for a solution consisting of a two-board design as an architecture for interconnected ML-enabled IoT nodes in a LoRa mesh network. A prototype of the architecture using the TTGO LoRa32 board as a network device and the Arduino Portenta H7 as an application device is implemented as a case study to show the feasibility. We analyze a federated learning protocol design to illustrate how distributed applications can interact within the proposed two-board node architecture. We position the architecture with regard to several performance aspects and observe that the design delivers a separation of concerns by one board hosting the ML-application and the other providing an advanced network service to the application."

    "abstract": "Adaptive filters, constrained by a linear filtering framework, often struggle with nonlinear modeling in complex processes. Kernel adaptive filters (KAFs) offer a promising solution by mapping input signals into diverse feature spaces. However, their computational efficiency and filtering accuracy may still not meet the demands of practical applications. To this end, based on Kolmogorov-Arnold (KA) representation theorem, this paper proposes a novel nonlinear filtering framework by treating filter weights as learnable functions. Specifically, the learnable functions are represented as a linear combination of multiple Gaussian basis functions with different centers. To determine the coefficients that define these learnable functions, the weight-learning-based least mean square (WL-LMS) and weight-learning-based recursive least squares (WL-RLS) algorithms are further proposed based on minimum mean square error (MMSE). In addition, to ensure convergence and assess the steady-state and transient performance of proposed algorithms, a thorough theoretical analysis of the convergence conditions and excess mean square error (EMSE) is provided. Finally, linear-in-parameters system identifications validate the correctness of theoretical analysis, while chaotic time-series prediction and nonlinear system identifications demonstrate the superiorities of the proposed WL-LMS and WL-RLS algorithms."

    "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) modulates cortical excitability to promote neuroplasticity, but single-target TMS has limited effects on multi-region synergy. Sequential dual-target TMS may enhance brain network reorganization through temporal stimulation, though its mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigates the immediate effects of single- and dual-target TMS on brain functional networks in stroke patients using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and dynamic functional connectivity (dFNC) analysis. Fifteen subacute stroke patients and fifteen healthy controls underwent three interventions: single-target SMA-rTMS, single-target LDLPFC-rTMS, and sequential dual-target stimulation (Dual-rTMS). fNIRS data were analyzed via dFNC to identify connectivity states (weak, moderate, strong) and evaluate time fraction, state transitions, global efficiency, and total signal power. Results revealed three dFNC states: State 1 (weak connectivity, 44.24%), State 2 (moderate, 39.44%), and State 3 (strong, 16.32%). Single-target TMS (especially SMA-rTMS) increased time fraction in State 1, indicating low-connectivity induction, while Dual-rTMS further prolonged State 1 and reduced inefficient transitions (e.g., State 1→2: p < 0.005). Stroke patients showed impaired transitions from State 2→3 (p = 0.024) versus controls. Time fraction in State 3 correlated positively with motor function scores (FMA-LE: r = 0.52, p = 0.045; BBS: r = 0.52, p = 0.047), while State 1 correlated negatively (FMA-LE: r = -0.52, p = 0.045). Sequential dual-target TMS optimizes network dynamics by sustaining low-energy states and suppressing maladaptive transitions, outperforming single-target approaches. dFNC temporal patterns may serve as biomarkers for post-stroke motor function, supporting sequential dual-target TMS as a promising rehabilitation tool."

Traditional cloud-based EHR systems, though, are afflicted with centralized control, privacy threats, restricted interoperability, and susceptibility to data breaches. To alleviate these challenges, this paper suggests a blockchain-based, patient-centered EHR management system that uses Ethereum smart contracts, Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for safe, distributed, and effective handling of health data.The system put forward puts patients at the forefront of EHR access and control, allowing them to grant or withdraw permissions to healthcare providers, insurers, or researchers using fine-grained, attribute-based policies executed through smart contracts. DIDs remove the need for third-party identity providers, providing secure and verifiable user authentication directly on the blockchain. IPFS, on the other hand, provides cost-effective, tamper-proof off-chain storage of medical records, with metadata and access logs stored on-chain to minimize gas usage.Extensive testing on the Ethereum Goerli testnet proves that the system provides greater security, lower storage costs, efficient access control, and better interoperability than conventional models. This method not only solves existing shortcomings in EHR systems but also opens the door to scalable, transparent, and patient-enabled healthcare data management."

Secondly, the matched MTD filters are designed according to the change of the clutter spectrum width of different pulse groups, then pulse compression and MTD are performed for each group. Finally, accumulating the data of the same velocity channel in each pulse group through the mapping relationship between doppler domin and velocity domin, then perform the CFAR detection. Simulation experiments shows that the proposed method has good detection performance and clutter suppression performance, and it has a certain superiority."

Therefore, we propose a hybrid ANN-SNN segmentation framework that leverages a Spiking Dynamics Encoding (SDE) module for temporal encoding of event streams and Artificial Neural Network (ANNs) for extracting spatial and semantic features from images. The SDE employs Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons to transform asynchronous event streams into spatiotemporal confidence maps, enabling adaptive capture of motion-sensitive cues. Besides, to effectively integrate heterogeneous features from both modalities, we design an Early Cross-Modal Fusion (ECMF) module that concatenates and fuses low-level features from both branches through a shared convolutional layer at the initial processing stage. Experimental results on the DSEC and DDD17 datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in enhancing temporal modeling and cross-modal feature integration for multimodal semantic segmentation."

Based on these results, we created a clinical assistant app with AI that significantly improves early detection with three key characteristics. The primary feature involves the real-time analysis of patient data, including symptoms, laboratory findings, and imaging, to accurately identify high-risk individuals for liver and kidney diseases with over 96% certainty. The second feature is monitoring disease progression markers, such as predicting kidney function decline with 96.33% accuracy using AdaBoost to allow for treatment before symptoms appear. Furthermore, the third feature is AI-driven decision support systems that speed up diagnosis, especially for tricky cases such as colon cancer and Wilson's disease. By integrating these models into clinical pipelines, the application fills crucial gaps in early detection, such as the asymptomatic progression of colon cancer or the genetic intricacies of Wilson's disease, enabling doctors to treat patients sooner, based on personal circumstances, and ultimately leading to improved patient survival rates while lowering healthcare costs."

A novel signal model is developed by representing the plane wave spectrum (PWS) corresponding to the measured signals as a Maclaurin series expansion. By performing the Fourier transform of each polynomial term in this expansion, the measured signals can be expressed as a linear combination of the derivatives of the free-space scalar Green’s function. The initial excitations and Maclaurin coefficients are jointly estimated through iterative minimization of an evaluation function, which is defined by measuring the difference between the measured signals and the virtual signals computed using the proposed signal model. An alternating optimization strategy is employed to ensure fast and efficient convergence of the minimization process. A 6 × 9 planar array composed of rectangular open-ended open waveguides was calibrated at a measurement distance of 0.5 m using the proposed method, achieving a calibration error range of ±0.58 dB and ±4.9°. The calibration was conducted using probe measurements over approximately one-quarter of the AUT aperture, with a 3 × 3 uniformly spaced rectangular sampling grid within this scanning region. The obtained results validate the effectiveness of the proposed calibration method."

    "abstract": "Escalating cybersecurity risks in communication networks pose severe challenges to the stability and reliability of microgrid control systems. This paper investigates the load frequency control problem of nonlinear networked wind-power microgrids under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and event-triggered communication. A data-driven prediction framework is first established to construct a control-oriented dynamic linearization data model for the underlying nonlinear system. Sub-sequently, a novel event-triggered model-free adaptive predictive control (ET-MFAPC) algorithm with time-varying parameters is proposed, which integrates multi-step adaptive prediction and receding-horizon optimization. The proposed algorithm features several key innovations: 1) An output-related auxiliary variable is designed to circumvent unavailable pseudo-partial derivatives (PPDs) and their sign constraints. 2) An adaptive predictive compensation module is developed to mitigate the impacts of DoS attacks by reconstructing hijacked data packets. 3) An attack-aware online optimization mechanism is formulated to adaptively tune controller gains for improved system performance. Furthermore, a comprehensive security analysis is conducted based on a model-independent data energy function, and explicit boundary conditions are derived for tolerable attack frequency and duration. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method are validated through simulation studies."

    "abstract": "Generating high-quality, collision-free trajectories in real time for multiagent systems is challenging due to uncertainties arising from robot localization, network disturbances, and sensor errors. Existing approaches typically address this problem either deterministically, relying on reliable and consistent communication networks, or through approximations that often lead to overly conservative trajectories. In this article, we propose a method for generating trajectories by accounting for collision probabilities involving uncertain neighboring agents and obstacles, which is designed for multiple ground vehicles operating in a communication-free environment with limited detection ranges and Gaussian noise. A receding horizon framework is developed and formulated as a joint spatial–temporal chance-constrained optimization problem using nonlinear model predictive control (JSTC-MPC). To ensure the reliability and computational efficiency of the trajectories, an analytical and tighter approximation of joint spatial–temporal collision probabilities is introduced, effectively handling constraints from neighboring vehicles and obstacles at different JSTC-MPC stages. Furthermore, we propose a real-time replanning strategy that leverages chance-constrained, time-aware Voronoi spaces to address safety concerns in the presence of infeasible solutions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through simulations and real-world experiments."

    "abstract": "Adaptive video streaming using Moving Picture Expert Group dynamic adaptive streaming over a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (MPEG-DASH) has become widely used on the internet recently. Various adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms have been proposed for video streaming. Buffer-based control-theoretic approaches for ABR control switch video bitrates in response to changing network conditions. However, the bitrate variations caused by frequent throughput variations can degrade the quality of experience (QoE). This study proposes a quantization scheme for buffer-based ABR control using a proportional-derivative controller for MPEG-DASH. The proposed scheme selects a quantized bitrate based on the output of the ABR controller, buffer level, its change, and throughput variation. In the quantization scheme, two kinds of algorithms are installed to detect throughput variation: Detection using one previous segment (PS1) and detection using three previous segments (PS3). The PS1 and PS3 algorithms are based on the variation in estimated throughput for a segment and three segments, respectively. Simulations confirm that the proposed scheme detects throughput variations earlier and more accurately than the conventional method and improves QoE."

    "abstract": "Split learning is a computing resource-friendly distributed learning framework that protects client training data by splitting the model between the client and server. Previous work has proved that split learning faces a severe risk of privacy leakage, as a malicious server can recover the client's private data by hijacking the training process. In this paper, we explore the vulnerability of split learning to server-side backdoor attacks, where our goal is to compromise the model's integrity. Since the server-side attacker cannot access the training data and client model in split learning, the traditional poisoning-based backdoor attack methods are no longer applicable. Therefore, constructing backdoor attacks in split learning poses significant challenges. Our strategy involves the attacker establishing a shadow model on the server side that can encode backdoor samples and guide the client model in learning from this model during the training process, thereby enabling the client to acquire the same capability. Based on these insights, we propose a backdoor attack framework named SFI. Our attack framework minimizes assumptions about the attacker's background knowledge and ensures that the attack remains imperceptible to the client. We implement SFI on various benchmark datasets, and extensive experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness and generality."

Firstly, to ensure the security and randomness of the keys in the scheme, a new 4D-YG hyperchaotic key generator is designed. Secondly, self-expanding fractal Sierpinski triangle permutating operation is performed on medical images to achieve image decentring effect. Utilize a custom Order-Preserving Encryption (OPE) algorithm to diffuse it, ensuring consistency in pixel order before and after encryption. Subsequently, mix-bit triple normalized diffusion is performed on the images that have completed preliminary diffusion to enhance the resistance of privacy data within the image to attacks. Finally, the decryption permission for encrypted shared medical data is restricted through smart contracts in the blockchain. While achieving secure transmission of medical data, it enables hospitals to perform medical image segmentation and organ recognition diagnostics on shared data in an encrypted state, which is more in line with practical needs. According to performance test data, the proposed encryption algorithm can effectively resist differential attacks and frequency attacks, and the Number of Pixels Change Rate (NPCR) test results can reach the ideal value of 99.6094%."

    "abstract": "Single Flux Quantum (SFQ) circuits provide ultrafast operation and low power consumption, making them attractive candidates for machine learning accelerators. The Tsetlin Machine (TM) is a low-complexity and highly interpretable architecture, organized as a voting system of propositional clauses. In the TM, an ensemble of finite-state automata (FSAs), called Tsetlin automata, independently decides whether to include or exclude specific literals. The chosen literals are assembled into propositional clauses that collectively form the voting system, while each FSA updates its state based on rewards or penalties determined by the prediction outcome. However, existing FSA designs for TM based on SFQ circuits still suffer from either a narrow margin or excessive circuit area. To achieve compact and stable state transitions using SFQ circuits, we designed High-Capacity Resettable D Flip-Flop (HC-RDFF) cells by cascading storage loops. The proposed FSA was implemented using two HC-RDFFs to store the include and exclude states, respectively. The FSA with 16 states requires only 395 Josephson junctions with a static power of approximately 128 μW, exhibiting a bias margin of −21% to +25% at low speed and a maximum operating frequency of 20 GHz in simulation. We fabricated the HC-RDFF and the FSA using a 10 kA/cm² Nb four-layer superconducting process and verified their correct operation through low-speed measurements. The number of FSA states can be increased simply by extending the cascaded storage loops in the HC-RDFFs. We expect the proposed FSA to be suitable for constructing stable TM systems based on SFQ circuits with reduced hardware costs."

The approach is illustrated by application to an administrative process in an academic institution, namely an assessment extension request process. The study combines data-driven and knowledge-based approaches to understanding and modeling the existing process. Preliminary data analysis is used to obtain high-level process insights. The paper shows how this lays the foundation for the use of domain knowledge to construct and verify a discrete event simulation model. By integrating process mining with simulation, research can provide actionable insights to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the current assessment extension request process. Observations are made on how this approach can be applied to other business processes with sparse event logs."

By using evolutionary algorithms, candidate solutions for nanorobots with specific functions are automatically designed with a computer, where the biological gradient field (BGF) induced by tumor lesions provides auxiliary knowledge for the design of the morphology, function, and adaptive behavior of nanorobots in complex biological environments. Traditional robot design methods separate the design of robotic structure and control system, leading to limitations in adaptability and scalability. To tackle this problem, we adopt a ‘de novo design’ research paradigm, discovering and optimizing efficient robot structures and behaviors by simulating the process of natural selection, and uses BGF to dynamically guide the evolutionary process by embedding environmental feedback into genetic coding as auxiliary information. Furthermore, to enhance the generalizability of BGF, we employ a multi-physics field model for simulation modeling. Computer simulation experimental results validate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method for nanorobotic design."

Early diagnosis is essential, offering the potential to extend life expectancy by over 50% and reduce healthcare costs by up to $150,000 per patient. Dual-task (DT) testing—evaluating motor performance under cognitive load—has emerged as a promising, non-invasive method for early ADRD detection. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of DT-based ADRD assessments from January 2010 to October 2025, integrating insights from engineering and clinical neuroscience. We explore a broad range of DT paradigms (e.g., gait, balance, upperlimb function), sensing technologies (e.g., wearable sensors, electronic walkways, infrared/depth cameras, video, tablets, and brain imaging tools like fMRI and fNIRS), and analytic approaches, from traditional statistics to deep learning. Emerging tools, including eye-tracking and AI-based video pose estimation, are also discussed. We critically examine methodological trends, highlight key findings, and identify current limitations. Emphasizing the need for equitable, scalable, and clinically viable DT systems, this review highlights the role of modern sensor and AI technologies in enhancing early ADRD detection. It serves as a key resource for engineers, data scientists, and clinicians developing technology-driven tools for early detection and monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases."

However, traditional AGV scheduling methods, often based on fixed rules or heuristic algorithms, struggle to adapt effectively to real-world scenarios involving multiple tasks and dynamically complex environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an improved AGV material distribution algorithm based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN). The proposed approach models the workshop environment as a graph structure and utilizes Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to deeply extract features from nodes and paths, enabling task node probability prediction and route smoothness scoring. Based on this, a multi-AGV collision-free path planning and conflict avoidance mechanism is designed, taking into account both static priorities and dynamic operational states. This allows for reasonable task sequencing and assignment, ensuring real-time path planning and efficient execution during multi-vehicle collaboration. Simulation experiments under various dynamic multi-task scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional approaches in task completion efficiency, providing a practical and scalable solution for intelligent workshop scheduling."

This paper addresses that need by providing a comprehensive benchmark of deep learning models for automated vehicle exterior damage identification, focusing on two critical tasks: vehicle region segmentation and damage detection. For segmentation, the following models were evaluated: YOLOv8, RTMDet, Mask-RCNN, Mask2Former, Mask-DINO, and QueryInst, assessing precision, recall, mAP, and inference time. The findings revealed that transformer-based models, Mask2Former (84.8% mAP50) and Mask-DINO (88.6% mAP50), achieved notable segmentation performance. However, YOLOv8 (up to 88.9% mAP50) demonstrated the best balance between performance metrics and speed. For damage detection, models from the YOLO family, RTMDet, RT-DETR, DINO, and YOLO-NAS were benchmarked. Performance in this more challenging task was notably lower, with RT-DETR (L) achieving the highest mAP50. These results highlight the challenges affecting model per-formance, including class imbalances and variability in damage representation. Thus, this study provides important insights into the limitations and potential of current deep learning models when applied to a publicly available dataset, supporting the development of next-generation solutions for vehicle damage assessment."

To improve robustness, midfrequency DCT coefficients are selected to embed multiwatermarks. For enhancing embedding capacity, randomly generated vectors are transformed into orthogonal unit vectors using Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. By projecting each interframe difference coefficient onto orthogonal vectors, multiwatermarks are embedded in parallel by adjusting the projections into a predefined range.

Specifically, first, we process the image with different convolution kernels to obtain multiscale features, and then fuse these features to acquire more abundant information. Subsequently, we design a median attention module to balance color and improve details, incorporating pixel attention and channel attention. To enhance feature extraction, we introduce median pooling within the median attention module.

Second, a cloud-hosted shared space aligns modalities and captures their interactions, leveraging pretrained models such as BERT, ClipCap, and VGG19. Third, a reliability-aware dynamic fusion mechanism adaptively reweights modalities according to calibrated predictive confidence and cross-modal agreement, suppressing unreliable or adversarial signals and allowing a single modality to dominate when required. This design enables efficient edge processing and high-accuracy cloud inference, making the framework both resource-friendly and robust for multimodal anomaly detection in large-scale sensor-cloud networks. We validate EC-MAD through comparative and ablation experiments on two large-scale public multimodal datasets. The results indicate superior or competitive accuracy and F1-scores relative to strong single-modal and multimodal baselines."

    "abstract": "Universities of Applied Sciences (UAS) are new to Ethiopia. On the Ethiopian Ministry of Education's initiative fifteen universities were transformed to U ASs. Neither the academic staff nor the administrative staff of these universities are prepared to fit into the requirements of an UAS. Therefore, up-skilling and re-skilling have become an important issue. Together with European partners the Ethiopian UASs are trying to learn what it means to be staff (academic or administrative) of an UAS. The research question works on “How to qualify lecturers for the future - the unknown?” It is of special interest, whether the ongoing up-skilling and re-skilling projects have a certain focus on the future as described by A. Toffler. This research checks in a first step A. Toffler's vision on ‘Education in the Future Tense’ against the two ongoing Erasmus+ capacity building higher education projects in order to find out whether the ongoing projects meet the requirements as set out in the book ‘Future Shock’ published in 1970. The literature review presents a brief summary of the book's chapter on education. Followed by an insight of the two projects and the clarification of the important terms of uncertainty-future-futureness. The discussion brings light on what has been or has not been considered in the ongoing projects. A comparison of Bloom's Taxonomy with the Ahvenainen's futureness approach will demonstrate how academic staff could/should be trained to gain interest in playing with uncertainty for the sake of preparing students for the unknown future."

    "abstract": "This paper presents Templse (Temperature and Pulse Rate), a unified IoT-based health monitoring system that combines a contactless infrared thermometer and a pulse rate monitor in a single compact device. Built around an ESP32 microcontroller with onboard Wi-Fi connectivity and powered by a rechargeable lithium-ion battery pack for portability, the system enables real-time vital sign acquisition and cloud integration. A GY-906 MLX90614ESF IR sensor measures body temperature without contact, while a SEN-11574 PPG sensor captures heart rate. To ensure reliable pulse detection in noisy conditions, the device firmware incorporates adaptive filtering and thresholding algorithms. Measured temperature and heart rate are displayed locally on an OLED display and simultaneously uploaded via Wi-Fi to the cloud services (Blynk and ThingSpeak) for remote monitoring. The device demonstrates temperature accuracy within ±0.3°C and heart rate accuracy within a few BPM compared to reference devices."

    "abstract": "Pansharpening, the process of fusing low-resolution multispectral (MS) images with high-resolution panchromatic (Pan) images, is crucial in enhancing the spatial and spectral quality of satellite imagery. This study evaluates three variations of the Intensity-Hue-Saturation (IHS) pansharpening technique: traditional IHS, Fast IHS with Spectral Adjustment (FIHS), and FIHS with Spectral Adjustment (FIHS-SA). Using satellite images from IKONOS, PLEIADES, QuickBird, and WorldView, we employ evaluation metrics including the Spatial Correlation Coefficient (SCC), Correlation Coefficient (CC), and Quality Noise Ratio (QNR) to assess the performance of each method. The results indicate that while traditional IHS provides acceptable spatial enhancement, it suffers from notable spectral distortions. In contrast, both FIHS and FIHS-SA demonstrate improved spectral fidelity, with FIHS-SA exhibiting superior performance across all tested images. This research underscores the significance of selecting appropriate pansharpening techniques to achieve optimal outcomes in various remote sensing applications, emphasizing the balance between spatial enhancement and spectral integrity."

In Jordan, AI is being investigated in many fields, such as healthcare, education, financial services, and government activities. However, the tendency to rapidly embrace AI technologies presents unique challenges, one of the most serious being failures within the system and the legal accountability of individuals and organizations operationally responsible for the systems within which the mistakes are made. The article intends to identify legal responsibility in case a person or administrative organization is to be blamed for AI application inaccuracies in Jordan, focusing intensely on the social and legal consequences. The analysis emphasizes the country's existing legal documents, the ethical aspects of the application of AI technology, and the comprehensive plan for administrative responsibility. The analysis of the components makes it possible to understand better how Jordan can cope with the problems of AI governance and bear the consequences of malfunctioning AI systems and ethical misconduct at the hands of powerful AI."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the design, implementation, and validation of a portable femtoampere-sensitive electronic readout system for a high-pressure argon-filled ionization chamber (IC) radiation detector. The system integrates a custom-built ionization tube with a low-noise analog front-end, precision digital processing, and a power-efficient embedded platform. At its core is a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) based on an electrometergrade op-amp (ADA4530-1), enabling accurate conversion of ionization currents in the femtoampere range. A dual-path amplification architecture ensures dynamic range adaptability across low and high dose rate conditions. The digital subsystem— featuring a 16-bit Sigma-Delta ADC-equipped STM32 microcontroller—handles real-time digitization, temperature compensation, and self-adjustment offset via integrated DACs. The device was calibrated and tested at the Secondary Standard Dosimetry Laboratory (SSDL) of the Turkish Nuclear Energy Research Institute (TENMAK), covering a wide radiation range from 3 μSv/h to 60 mSv/h using multiple <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">137</sup>Cs sources. The system demonstrated excellent linearity (R² > 0.998), with a minimum detectable dose rate of approximately 2 μSv/h, and maintained a total measurement error below 10%. These results affirm the device’s suitability for portable, high-precision radiation monitoring in field and safety applications. The novelty of this work lies in the integration of a high-pressure argon ionization chamber with a dual-path femtoampere readout front-end and a fully self-adjusting digital control unit, enabling portable, low-dose-rate detection below 3 μSv/h."

    "abstract": "Transformer-based object detectors have demonstrated substantial potential across a wide range of computer vision tasks, including object detection in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. However, these models are often plagued by high computational costs, rendering them impractical for realtime applications. To tackle this issue, knowledge distillation (KD) has been introduced to transfer knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge distillation framework for RT-DETR, a state-of-the-art object detector, and also tailored for SAR images. Our method involves layer-by-layer distillation between RT-DETR networks of varying parameter sizes and introduces two aspects of improvements: Adaptive Queries Alignment and Teacher Scoring Mechanism. The former is used to guide distillation matching more quickly, while the latter improves distillation performance without introducing additional parameters. We evaluated our approach on the OGSOD-1.0 SAR dataset using RT-DETR with ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and ResNet-101 as the backbones. The corresponding parameter sizes are $20.1 \\mathrm{M}, 42.7 \\mathrm{M}$, and 76.8 M, respectively. The results show that after distilling RT-DETR with ResNet-101 to that with ResNet-18 as the backbone, the student model achieves 1.8 mAP improvement compared to the original student model, with only 26.1% of the teacher model’s parameters. This distillation method reduces computational costs and parameter sizes while enhancing detection performance."

    "abstract": "Accurate segmentation in medical images remains a challenging task due to the intricate anatomical structures, ambiguous boundaries, and limited labeled data typically available in clinical scenarios. U-shaped encoder-decoder architectures, such as U-Net and its variants, have become the de facto standard in medical image segmentation owing to their ability to fuse multi-scale features through skip connections. However, conventional training strategies often rely solely on supervision at the final output layer, leaving rich intermediate representations underutilized and lacking explicit consistency constraints across different decoding stages. In this paper, we propose Structurally Consistent Multi-Stage Learning (SCMSL), a simple yet effective training framework designed to improve segmentation quality by enhancing supervision and structural coherence across multiple decoder stages. SCMSL incorporates two key components: (1) multi-stage supervision, which introduces segmentation losses at various decoder stages to guide hierarchical feature refinement throughout the network; and (2) a novel Gram Matrix Loss that measures the similarity between the structural representations of outputs from different stages. By capturing second-order feature correlations, this loss encourages the network to produce consistent and anatomically plausible predictions across scales. Our method is model-agnostic and introduces no additional inference-time complexity, making it easy to plug into existing segmentation architectures. We validate SCMSL on two widely used benchmarks-Synapse multi-organ CT dataset and ACDC cardiac MRI dataset. Experimental results show that SCMSL significantly improves segmentation accuracy and boundary smoothness over strong baselines, confirming the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach."

    "abstract": "IEEE 802.11ah is a promising technology that supports Internet of Things (IoT) applications by offering extended coverage, improved energy efficiency, and enhanced scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel Traffic-Aware Adaptive Restricted Access Window (TARA-RAW) slot allocation scheme tailored for IEEE 802.11ah networks. The proposed method employs fuzzy logic to intelligently classify devices into groups based on dynamic transmission parameters such as data volume, transmission frequency, and latency requirements. Each group is then allocated an adaptable number of RAW slots, which are dynamically adjusted according to real-time traffic patterns and network load. To validate the effectiveness of TARA, we develop both an analytical model and a simulation framework to evaluate key performance metrics including throughput and energy consumption. Results demonstrate that the TARA scheme outperforms traditional uniform grouping approaches, achieving higher throughput and lower energy expenditure, thereby making it highly suitable for large-scale and diverse IoT deployments."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a scalable Bayesian framework for tracking multiple extended targets based on a nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) and the Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filter. In the context of extended target tracking, the measurement-to-target association is unknown and evolves over time. To dynamically capture this evolution, an association-based NHPP (AbNHPP) Bayesian tracking framework integrating the target’s association variables and its Poisson measurement rate is derived. To more flexibly model the target’s Poisson measurement rate and ensure the closed-form solution for the PHD filter, this paper adopts the following models: the target’s measurement rate is modeled as a Generalized Inverse Gaussian (GIG) distribution, the target’s kinematic state is modeled as a Gaussian distribution, and the target’s extension is modeled as an inverse-Wishart (IW) distribution. Specifically, the GIG distribution for measurement rate of extended targets is modeled as Time Independent Poisson Rate (TIPR). Simulation results validate the superiority and scalability of the proposed algorithm."
