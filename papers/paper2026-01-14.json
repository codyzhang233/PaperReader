    "abstract": "Segment Anything 3 (SAM3) has established a powerful foundation that robustly detects, segments, and tracks specified targets in videos. However, in its original implementation, its group-level collective memory selection is suboptimal for complex multi-object scenarios, as it employs a synchronized decision across all concurrent targets conditioned on their average performance, often overlooking individual reliability. To this end, we propose SAM3-DMS, a training-free decoupled strategy that utilizes fine-grained memory selection on individual objects. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves robust identity preservation and tracking stability. Notably, our advantage becomes more pronounced with increased target density, establishing a solid foundation for simultaneous multi-target video segmentation in the wild."

    "abstract": "The graphical Lasso (GLASSO) is a widely used algorithm for learning high-dimensional undirected Gaussian graphical models (GGM). Given i.i.d. observations from a multivariate normal distribution, GLASSO estimates the precision matrix by maximizing the log-likelihood with an \\ell_1-penalty on the off-diagonal entries. However, selecting an optimal regularization parameter λin this unsupervised setting remains a significant challenge. A well-known issue is that existing methods, such as out-of-sample likelihood maximization, select a single global λand do not account for heterogeneity in variable scaling or partial variances. Standardizing the data to unit variances, although a common workaround, has been shown to negatively affect graph recovery. Addressing the problem of nodewise adaptive tuning in graph estimation is crucial for applications like computational neuroscience, where brain networks are constructed from highly heterogeneous, region-specific fMRI data. In this work, we develop Locally Adaptive Regularization for Graph Estimation (LARGE), an approach to adaptively learn nodewise tuning parameters to improve graph estimation and selection. In each block coordinate descent step of GLASSO, we augment the nodewise Lasso regression to jointly estimate the regression coefficients and error variance, which in turn guides the adaptive learning of nodewise penalties. In simulations, LARGE consistently outperforms benchmark methods in graph recovery, demonstrates greater stability across replications, and achieves the best estimation accuracy in the most difficult simulation settings. We demonstrate the practical utility of our method by estimating brain functional connectivity from a real fMRI data set."

    "abstract": "Recent analysis of 23 years of Hubble Space Telescope ACS/SBC data has shown that background levels can vary considerably between observations, with most filters showing over an order of magnitude variation. For the shorter-wavelength filters, the background is understood to be dominated by airglow; however, what precisely drives background variations is not well constrained for any filter. Here, we explore the causes of the background variation. Using over 8,000 archival SBC observations, we developed a machine learning model that can accurately predict the background for an observation, based upon a set of 23 observational parameters. This model indicates that, depending on filter, the SBC background is generally dominated by Solar elevation, Solar separation angle, Earth limb angle of observation, SBC temperature, and target Galactic latitude."

    "abstract": "Consider the following puzzle: a farmland consists of several fields, each occupied by either a farmer, a fox, a chicken, or a caterpillar. Creatures in neighboring fields can swap positions as long as the fox avoids the farmer, the chicken avoids the fox, and the caterpillar avoids the chicken. The objective is to decide whether there exists a sequence of swaps that rearranges the creatures into a desired final configuration, while avoiding any unwanted encounters. The above puzzle can be cast an instance of the \\emph{colored token swapping} problem with $k = 4$ colors (i.e., creature types), in which only certain pairs of colors can be swapped. We prove that such problem is $\\mathsf{PSPACE}$-hard even when the graph representing the farmland is planar and cubic. We also show that the problem is polynomial-time solvable when at most three creature types are involved. We do so by providing a more general algorithm deciding instances with arbitrary values of $k$, as long as the set of all admissible swaps between creature types induces a \\emph{spanning star}. Our results settle a problem explicitly left open in [Yang and Zhang, IPL 2025], which established $\\mathsf{PSPACE}$-completeness for eight creature types and left the complexity status unresolved when the number of creature types is between three and seven."

Considering the moderately harsh radiation environment expected in the dRICH detector, this study reports on proton irradiation tests performed on key components of the RDO card to assess their tolerance to cumulative Total Ionizing Dose (TID) and Single Event Effects (SEE). All tested components demonstrated radiation tolerance beyond the TID levels expected for the dRICH environment, with the exception of the ATtiny417 microcontroller, which showed destructive failure. Furthermore, as expected, the observed Single Event Upset (SEU) rates call for appropriate mitigation strategies in the final system design."

We report the experimental generation of large-amplitude squeezed coherent-state superpositions (squeezed cat states) on free-space optical pulses, reaching an amplitude of $α= 2.47$, which, to our knowledge, exceeds all previously reported values. Our protocol relies on the controlled mixing of the Fock states $|1\\rangle$ and $|2\\rangle$ through a tunable beam splitter, followed by heralding via homodyne detection. The resulting state displays three well-resolved negative regions in its Wigner function and achieves a fidelity of $0.53$ with the target state $\\propto \\hat{S}(z)(|α\\rangle - |-α\\rangle)$, with $α= 2.47$ and squeezing parameter $z = 0.56$.

However, multi-agent RL (MARL) training is resource-intensive and unstable: co-adapting teammates induce non-stationarity, and rewards are often sparse and high-variance. Therefore, we introduce \\textbf{Multi-Agent Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (MATTRL)}, a framework that injects structured textual experience into multi-agent deliberation at inference time. MATTRL forms a multi-expert team of specialists for multi-turn discussions, retrieves and integrates test-time experiences, and reaches consensus for final decision-making. We also study credit assignment for constructing a turn-level experience pool, then reinjecting it into the dialogue. Across challenging benchmarks in medicine, math, and education, MATTRL improves accuracy by an average of 3.67\\% over a multi-agent baseline, and by 8.67\\% over comparable single-agent baselines. Ablation studies examine different credit-assignment schemes and provide a detailed comparison of how they affect training outcomes. MATTRL offers a stable, effective and efficient path to distribution-shift-robust multi-agent reasoning without tuning."

Existing frame-to-frame methods achieve real-time performance through local optimization but accumulate scale drift due to the lack of global constraints among independent windows. To address this, we propose SCE-SLAM, an end-to-end SLAM system that maintains scale consistency through scene coordinate embeddings, which are learned patch-level representations encoding 3D geometric relationships under a canonical scale reference. The framework consists of two key modules: geometry-guided aggregation that leverages 3D spatial proximity to propagate scale information from historical observations through geometry-modulated attention, and scene coordinate bundle adjustment that anchors current estimates to the reference scale through explicit 3D coordinate constraints decoded from the scene coordinate embeddings. Experiments on KITTI, Waymo, and vKITTI demonstrate substantial improvements: our method reduces absolute trajectory error by 8.36m on KITTI compared to the best prior approach, while maintaining 36 FPS and achieving scale consistency across large-scale scenes."

Stellar occultations provide highly accurate size and shape measurements for TNOs, while photometry constrains their albedo and surface colours. (28978) Ixion is one of the largest TNOs and a prominent Plutino, making it a key target for comparative studies. We aim to constrain Ixion's projected size, shape, absolute magnitude, geometric albedo, and surface colours, and to search for evidence of an atmosphere or circum-object material. We analysed stellar occultation campaigns by Ixion conducted between 2020 and 2023 within the Lucky Star collaboration, comprising 51 observations from eight events, including 30 positive detections. Five multi-chord events enabled a global limb fit and an accurate reconstruction of Ixion's projected shape. The occultations reveal a slightly elongated limb well represented by a single projected ellipse, yielding an area-equivalent diameter of $D_{\\mathrm{equiv}} = 696.78^{+10.75}_{-8.87}$ km and an apparent oblateness $ε' = 0.081^{+0.004}_{-0.010}$.

    "abstract": "Taxonomies form the backbone of structured knowledge representation across diverse domains, enabling applications such as e-commerce catalogs, semantic search, and biomedical discovery. Yet, manual taxonomy expansion is labor-intensive and cannot keep pace with the emergence of new concepts. Existing automated methods rely on point-based vector embeddings, which model symmetric similarity and thus struggle with the asymmetric \"is-a\" relationships that are fundamental to taxonomies. Box embeddings offer a promising alternative by enabling containment and disjointness, but they face key issues: (i) unstable gradients at the intersection boundaries, (ii) no notion of semantic uncertainty, and (iii) limited capacity to represent polysemy or ambiguity. We address these shortcomings with TaxoBell, a Gaussian box embedding framework that translates between box geometries and multivariate Gaussian distributions, where means encode semantic location and covariances encode uncertainty. Energy-based optimization yields stable optimization, robust modeling of ambiguous concepts, and interpretable hierarchical reasoning. Extensive experimentation on five benchmark datasets demonstrates that TaxoBell significantly outperforms eight state-of-the-art taxonomy expansion baselines by 19% in MRR and around 25% in Recall@k. We further demonstrate the advantages and pitfalls of TaxoBell with error analysis and ablation studies."

The use of an all-silicon fabrication platform, in contrast to the more commonly used silicon nitride membranes, is compatible with monolithic fabrication of integrated TES and SQUID circuits. The all-silicon architecture additionally allows efficient use of focal plane area; the readout circuitry may be positioned out of the focal plane by bending a thinned portion of the chip. Compatibility with integrated fabrication and efficient use of focal plane area provide a path to an efficient soft X-ray spectrometer. This work is motivated by our goal to develop a 10,000-pixel TES spectrometer to overcome critical measurement limitations in catalysis research. The characterization of fragile, carbon-based intermediates via techniques like Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) is often precluded by the slow, high-flux nature of existing technologies.

Many industrial geometries feature repeating subdomains or contain sub-regions governed by distinct physical phenomena, making them well-suited to Domain Decomposition (DD) techniques. The integration of ROM and DD is promising to further reduce computational costs by constructing local ROMs and assembling them into global solutions. Due to the complexity and necessity of coupling ROMs, many approaches have been proposed in recent years. This review provides a concise overview of existing methodologies combining ROM and DD. We categorize existing methods into intrusive (projection-based) and non-intrusive (data-driven) frameworks. Various strategies for generating local reduced bases and coupling them across subdomains are illustrated. Particular emphasis is placed on intrusive techniques, including equations, numerical algorithms, and practical implementations. The non-intrusive framework is also discussed, highlighting its general procedures, basic formulations, and underlying principles. Finally, we summarise the state of the literature, identify open challenges, and present perspectives on future implementation from an engineering viewpoint."

    "abstract": "The Baum-Connes assembly map with coefficients $e_{\\ast}$ and the Mishchenko-Kasparov assembly map with coefficients $μ_{\\ast}$ are two homomorphisms from the equivariant $K$-homology of classifying spaces of groups to the $K$-theory of reduced crossed products. In this paper, we investigate these two assembly maps for group extensions $1\\rightarrow N \\rightarrow Γ\\xrightarrow{q} Γ/ N \\rightarrow 1$. Firstly, under the assumption that $e_{\\ast}$ is isomorphic for $q^{-1}(F)$ for any finite subgroup $F$ of $Γ/N$, we prove that $e_{\\ast}$ is injective, surjective and isomorphic for $Γ$ if they are also true for $Γ/N$, respectively. Secondly, under the assumption that $e_{\\ast}$ is rationally isomorphic for $N$, we verify that $μ_{\\ast}$ is rationally injective for $Γ$ if it is also rationally injective for $Γ/N$. Finally, when $Γ$ is an isometric semi-direct product $N\\rtimes G$, we confirm that $e_{\\ast}$ is injective, surjective and isomorphic for $Γ$ if they also hold for $G$ and $Γ$ satisfies three partial conjectures along $N$, respectively. As applications, we show that the strong Novikov conjecture, the surjective assembly conjecture and the Baum-Connes conjecture with coefficients are closed under direct products, central extensions of groups and extensions by finite groups. Meanwhile, we also show that the rational analytic Novikov conjecture with coefficients is preserved under extensions of finite groups. Besides, we employ these results to obtain some new examples for the rational analytic and the strong Novikov conjecture beyond the class of coarsely embeddable groups."

In this approach, the string is extended in the 5th, holographic direction and has a turning point either on a dynamical wall (DW) configuration or on the horizon configuration in the 5th direction. We obtain the magnetic catalysis behavior for a phase transition between DW and horizon configuration of the string. The structure of the phase diagram does not depend on the boundary conditions choice for the dilaton field. Inclusion of the external magnetic field and spatial anisotropy enhance the string tension in the horizon configuration, namely drag force. For the spatially isotropic case $ν= 1$ at different magnetic field values the string tension is proportional to $T^2$ and is qualitatively consistent with lattice results. However, for the anisotropic case, $ν= 4.5$, it deviates from the quadratic term."

This paper proposes an RL framework structured around a semi-structured long Chain-of-Thought (CoT), in which the generation process is decomposed into explicitly planned intermediate steps. We introduce a Diverse Planning Branching method that strategically introduces divergence at the planning phase based on diversity variation, alongside a group-aware diversity reward to encourage distinct trajectories. Experimental results on creative writing benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves output diversity without compromising generation quality, consistently outperforming existing baselines."

    "abstract": "Recent research suggests that looped Transformers have superior reasoning capabilities compared to standard deep architectures. Current approaches to training single-head looped architectures on benchmark tasks frequently fail or yield suboptimal performance due to a highly non-convex and irregular loss landscape. In these settings, optimization often stagnates in poor local minima and saddle points of the loss landscape, preventing the model from discovering the global minimum point. The internal mechanisms of these single-head looped transformer models remain poorly understood, and training them from scratch remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework that leverages Tsallis entropy and Hamiltonian dynamics to transform the geometry of the loss landscape. By treating the parameter updates as a physical flow, we successfully trained a single-head looped Transformer with model dimension $d = 8$ to solve induction head task with input sequence length of 1000 tokens. This success reveals the internal mechanism behind the superior reasoning capability."

These observations show the morphologies and kinematics of the collimated jets from three protostars, the low-mass Class 0 protostars B335 and HOPS 153, and the intermediate-mass protostar HOPS 370. These jets are traced by shock-ionized fine-structure line emission observed with the JWST NIRSpec and MIRI IFUs. We find that [Fe II] emission traces the full extent of the inner 1000 to 2000 au of the jets, depending on distance to the protostar, while other ions mostly trace isolated shocked knots. The jets show evidence of wiggling motion in the plane of the sky as well as asymmetries between blue and red-shifted lobes. The widths of the jets increase non-monotonically with distance from the central protostar, with opening angles ranging from 2.1 degrees to < 10.1 degrees for the three protostars in the sample. The jets have total velocities ranging from 147 to 184 km/s after correcting for disk inclination. For B335, an 8-month gap between NIRSpec and MIRI MRS observations enabled measurement of the tangential velocity of a shocked knot; in combination with the radial velocity, this shows that the jet has a different inclination than the outflow cavity. We find multiple knots before and during a recent outburst in B335, although the knots were more frequent during the burst. The asymmetries between blue- and red-shifted lobes strongly suggest complex interactions between the circumstellar disks and magnetic fields."

    "abstract": "Stiff forces, which bind objects together or otherwise confine motion, are found widely in soft-matter systems - colloids with short range attractions, ligand-receptor contacts, particles in optical traps, fibres that resist stretching, etc. To assess the long-term effect of these stiff forces on dynamics and structure, it is useful to consider the limit where they are treated as constraints, so the system evolves strictly within allowed configurations. Efforts to derive equations involving both constraints, and the stochastic motion appropriate at the scales of soft matter, began around 50 years ago, yet, we are still lacking a straightforward way to extract the projected equations and apply them in modern formulations of mesoscale dynamics. Here, we address this gap with two key contributions: (1) a practical summary of the constrained Brownian dynamics equations with ``soft'' constraints, i.e. constraints imposed by stiff forces, which is illustrated through several representative examples, taking care to highlight the nontrivial effects of the constraints; and (2) a novel derivation using singular perturbation theory, establishing the validity of these equations over timescales exceeding the relaxation of stiffly constrained degrees of freedom. We further extend our approach to ``soft soft'' constraints, where mobility varies on lengthscales comparable to the restraining forces - a scenario typical for particles in fluids experiencing hydrodynamic interactions. We hope our results will be useful for soft matter research, as a robust toolkit for studying tethered or confined systems."

PI-OHAM, based on classical HAM, employs a physics-informed residual loss to optimize convergence-control parameters systematically by combining data, boundary conditions, and governing equations in the manner similar to Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The combination of the flexibility of PINNs and the analytical transparency of HAM provides the approach with high numerical stability, rapid convergence, and high consistency with traditional numerical solutions. PI-OHAM has superior accuracy-time trade-offs and faster and more accurate convergence than standard HAM and PINNs when applied to the Blasius boundary-layer problem. It is also very close to numerical standards available in the literature. PI-OHAM ensures analytical transparency and interpretability by series-based solutions, unlike purely data-driven or data-free PINNs. Significant contributions are a conceptual bridge between decades of homotopy-based analysis and modern physics-inspired methods, and a numerically aided but analytically interpretable solver of nonlinear differential equations. PI-OHAM appears as a computationally efficient, accurate and understandable alternative to nonlinear fluid flow, heat transfer and other industrial problems in cases where robustness and interpretability are important."

If the NS injects an amount of energy comparable to the explosion energy of the accompanying supernova (SN) before the SN ejecta becomes transparent, the nascent NS wind bubble can overtake the outer ejecta and undergo a blowout driven by hydrodynamic instabilities. Based on multidimensional numerical studies, we construct a minimal semi-analytic framework to follow the post-blowout dynamics and radiative evolution, map the blowout conditions by scanning the ejecta and NS parameters, and compute survey-ready multi-band light curves. For stripped-envelope SNe with an ejecta mass of $M_\\mathrm{ej} \\sim 10\\,M_\\odot$ and an explosion energy of $E_\\mathrm{sn} \\sim 10^{51}\\,\\mathrm{erg}$, blowout occurs for NSs with magnetic field strengths of $B_{\\mathrm{dip}} \\gtrsim 10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{G}$ and spin periods of $P_\\mathrm{NS} \\lesssim \\mathrm{a\\ few}\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.

Depending on the discretization technique applied, we identify two primary distortion modes in discrete resonant controllers: frequency warping and resonance damping. We further provide a theoretical explanation for these distortion modes, and demonstrate that the performance of the method is superior to all typical methods. The proposed method is implemented to discretize a quasi-resonant (QR) controller on a control board, achieving 25\\% reduction in the root-mean-square error (RMSE) compared to the SOTA method. Finally, the approach is extended to discretizing a resonant controller of a grid-tied inverter. The efficacy of the proposed method is conclusively validated through favorable comparisons among the theory, simulation, and experiments."

Previous work has been able to study small EUV and SXR brightenings outside of active regions (i.e. the quiet Sun), but with HXRs this has mostly focused on active region transients/microflares due to the sensitivity of available telescopes. In this paper we present observations of the quiet Sun with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR), an X-ray imaging spectrometer with much greater sensitivity than previous instruments, allowing the observation of faint events. During the recent solar minimum, NuSTAR captured seven quiet Sun flares/impulsive brightenings, three on 21 February 2020, and four on 12-13 September 2020. From fitting their NuSTAR HXR spectra we find temperatures of 3.1-4.0 MK and emission measures between (0.75-17.0) $\\times 10^{43}$ cm$^{-3}$, which gives thermal energies between (2.5-8.9) $\\times 10^{26}$ erg. Only one event, a mini-filament eruption, showed evidence of slightly higher temperatures emission, confirmed through Differential Emission Measure analysis. None of the events showed evidence of non-thermal emission in their NuSTAR spectra, and we placed upper limits to the accelerated electron population. The thermal parameters for these quiet Sun events seem to scale differently to previously studied active region flares, suggesting a different energy release process might be dominating. However, this conclusion is affected by the different sensitivity and biases introduced by the various instruments and analysis approaches used."

Such gates arise from fusion with topological defect operators and remove a basic limitation of symmetry-based circuits: the inability to change superselection sectors, or in two-dimensional CFTs, conformal families. We realise fusion operations as completely positive, trace-preserving quantum channels acting between sectors, with consistency ensured by the fusion and associator data of an underlying unitary modular tensor category. In contrast to standard Nielsen circuits, non-invertible circuits lead to an optimisation problem that is no longer governed by geodesics on a continuous group manifold but instead reduces to a discrete shortest-path problem on the fusion graph of superselection sectors. We illustrate the framework in representative rational conformal field theories. Finally, we interpret fusion-induced transitions as discrete changes in boundary stress-tensor data, corresponding to shock-like defects in AdS$_3$ gravity."

Calculated results indicate that, for such an isomer, the excitation energy can be well reproduced and its oblate shape can be enhanced by the polarization effects of the two high-$K$ orbits. Comparing with experimental data, two sets of the widely used Woods-Saxon parameters, especially, the spin-orbit coupling one, are evaluated and argued. It is found that, considering the uncertainty of the spin-orbit coupling strength, the energy crossing or inversion of the $h_{9/2}$ and $f_{7/2}$ neutrons can occur, which may lead to three kinds of different evolution-trends of two-quasiparticle excitation energies with the changing quadrupole deformation $β_2$. With decreasing spin-orbit coupling interaction, the structure of the $K^π=8^+$ isomeric state will evolute from $νh_{9/2}f_{7/2}$ ($ν9/2^-[505] \\otimes 7/2^-[503]$) to the mixing of $νh_{9/2}f_{7/2}$ and $νh_{9/2}^2$ ($ν9/2^-[505] \\otimes 7/2^-[514]$) to $νh_{9/2}^2$, indicating that its structural probes is still of interest and an arbitrary assignment may be risky. The related theoretical calculations and experimental evidences e.g., the transition properties, are desirable. In addition, similar to that in superheavy nuclei, it is suggested that the stability inversion between high-$K$ isomeric states and ground states might occur in this proton drip-line mass region, e.g., in the hitherto unknown nucleus $^{162}_{78}$Pt$_{84}$."

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success across a variety of tasks, yet they often suffer from unreliable probability estimates. As a result, they can be overconfident in their predictions. Conformal Prediction (CP) offers a principled framework for uncertainty quantification, yielding prediction sets with rigorous coverage guarantees. Existing conformal training methods optimize for overall set size, but shaping the prediction sets in a class-conditional manner is not straightforward and typically requires prior knowledge of the data distribution. In this work, we introduce Class Adaptive Conformal Training (CaCT), which formulates conformal training as an augmented Lagrangian optimization problem that adaptively learns to shape prediction sets class-conditionally without making any distributional assumptions. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, including standard and long-tailed image recognition as well as text classification, demonstrate that CaCT consistently outperforms prior conformal training methods, producing significantly smaller and more informative prediction sets while maintaining the desired coverage guarantees."

The exponents (or bounds) are given for mismatched, and then particularised to matched and universal decoding metrics. Two regimes are studied: for fixed list size, we derive an ensemble-tight random-coding error exponent, and show that, for the matched metric, it does not improve the error exponent of ordinary decoding. For list sizes growing exponentially with the block-length, we provide a non-trivial lower bound to the error exponent that is tight at high rates under the matched metric."

    "abstract": "We investigated the spectral properties of squeezed light generated via parametric down-conversion in the high-gain regime, considering both unapodized and apodized dispersion-engineered waveguides. The gain-dependent evolution of these states is examined starting from the low-gain regime, which includes both highly correlated and nearly uncorrelated cases. For the unapodized configuration, we observe a monotonic increase in spectral purity with gain, whereas the apodized configuration exhibits a nonmonotonic dependence, initially decreasing and then recovering at higher gain. By combining Schmidt-mode analysis with a group-velocity-based interpretation, we explain why different dispersion conditions exhibit distinct gain-dependent behavior, specifically that rapid purification occurs when the pump group velocity lies between those of the signal and idler. Our study shows that the evolution of spectral purity is governed primarily by the underlying dispersion of the waveguide. These results demonstrate that dispersion engineering and parametric gain can be jointly exploited to tailor the spectral-mode structure of squeezed-light sources, enabling their optimization for a broad range of quantum applications."

Hence, a graph is recognized up to isomorphism by homomorphism counts over the class of all graphs. Restricting to a specific graph class yields some natural isomorphism relaxations and modulates recognition to particular graph properties. A notable restriction is to the classes of bounded treewidth, yielding the isomorphism relaxation of Weisfeiler--Leman refinement (WL), as shown by Dvořák [JGT 2010]. The properties recognized by WL are exactly those definable in fragments of first-order logic with counting quantifiers, as shown by Cai, Fürer, and Immerman [Comb. 1992]. We characterize the restriction to the classes of bounded pathwidth by numbers of simplicial walks, and formalize it into a refinement procedure (SW). The properties recognized by SW are exactly those definable in fragments of restricted-conjunction first-order logic with counting quantifiers, introduced by Montacute and Shah [LMCS 2024]. Unlike WL, computing SW directly is not polynomial-time in general. We address this by representing SW in terms of multiplicity automata. We equip these automata with an involution, simplifying the canonization to standard forward reduction and omitting the backward one. The resulting canonical form is computable in time $O(kn^{3k})$ for any graph on $n$ vertices and the restriction to pathwidth at most $k$."

We propose MVSS, a multi-view structured survey generation framework that jointly generates and aligns citation-grounded hierarchical trees, structured comparison tables, and survey text. MVSS follows a structure-first paradigm: it first constructs a conceptual tree of the research domain, then generates comparison tables constrained by the tree, and finally uses both as structural constraints for text generation. This enables complementary multi-view representations across structure, comparison, and narrative. We introduce an evaluation framework assessing structural quality, comparative completeness, and citation fidelity. Experiments on 76 computer science topics show MVSS outperforms existing methods in organization and evidence grounding, achieving performance comparable to expert surveys."

    "abstract": "With the emergence of massively parallel processing units, parallelization has become a desirable property for new sequence models. The ability to parallelize the processing of sequences with respect to the sequence length during training is one of the main factors behind the uprising of the Transformer architecture. However, Transformers lack efficiency at sequence generation, as they need to reprocess all past timesteps at every generation step. Recently, state-space models (SSMs) emerged as a more efficient alternative. These new kinds of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) keep the efficient update of the RNNs while gaining parallelization by getting rid of nonlinear dynamics (or recurrence). SSMs can reach state-of-the art performance through the efficient training of potentially very large networks, but still suffer from limited representation capabilities. In particular, SSMs cannot exhibit persistent memory, or the capacity of retaining information for an infinite duration, because of their monostability. In this paper, we introduce a new family of RNNs, the memory recurrent units (MRUs), that combine the persistent memory capabilities of nonlinear RNNs with the parallelizable computations of SSMs. These units leverage multistability as a source of persistent memory, while getting rid of transient dynamics for efficient computations. We then derive a specific implementation as proof-of-concept: the bistable memory recurrent unit (BMRU). This new RNN is compatible with the parallel scan algorithm. We show that BMRU achieves good results in tasks with long-term dependencies, and can be combined with state-space models to create hybrid networks that are parallelizable and have transient dynamics as well as persistent memory."

In this paper, we introduce SlidesGen-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate slide generation through a lens of three core principles: universality, quantification, and reliability. First, to establish a unified evaluation framework, we ground our analysis in the visual domain, treating terminal outputs as renderings to remain agnostic to the underlying generation method. Second, we propose a computational approach that quantitatively assesses slides across three distinct dimensions - Content, Aesthetics, and Editability - offering reproducible metrics where prior works relied on subjective or reference-dependent proxies. Finally, to ensure high correlation with human preference, we construct the Slides-Align1.5k dataset, a human preference aligned dataset covering slides from nine mainstream generation systems across seven scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that SlidesGen-Bench achieves a higher degree of alignment with human judgment than existing evaluation pipelines.

To approximate the model numerically, we implement the L1 finite difference scheme for the Caputo derivative and solve the resulting nonlinear system using the Newton-Raphson technique. A detailed error analysis is provided, demonstrating that the scheme achieves algebraic convergence. Comparative results with the Fractional Modified Euler method (FMEM) confirm the superior accuracy and stability of the proposed approach. Numerical simulations under biologically relevant parameters illustrate the impact of the non-integer order and vaccination rate on disease progression.

    "abstract": "Semantic understanding of popularity bias is a crucial yet underexplored challenge in recommender systems, where popular items are often favored at the expense of niche content. Most existing debiasing methods treat the semantic understanding of popularity bias as a matter of diversity enhancement or long-tail coverage, neglecting the deeper semantic layer that embodies the causal origins of the bias itself. Consequently, such shallow interpretations limit both their debiasing effectiveness and recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we propose FairLRM, a novel framework that bridges the gap in the semantic understanding of popularity bias with Recommendation via Large Language Model (RecLLM). FairLRM decomposes popularity bias into item-side and user-side components, using structured instruction-based prompts to enhance the model's comprehension of both global item distributions and individual user preferences. Unlike traditional methods that rely on surface-level features such as \"diversity\" or \"debiasing\", FairLRM improves the model's ability to semantically interpret and address the underlying bias. Through empirical evaluation, we show that FairLRM significantly enhances both fairness and recommendation accuracy, providing a more semantically aware and trustworthy approach to enhance the semantic understanding of popularity bias. The implementation is available at https://github.com/LuoRenqiang/FairLRM."

Previous work has already demonstrated that fs-lasers are uniquely suited for the fabrication of piezoelectric actuators based on PMN-PT, which are required for multiaxial strain-tuning of quantum dots (QDs) to enable, e.g. the generation of highly entangled photon pairs. Building on these foundations, the present work advances actuator performance and capabilities by introducing a local thinning strategy. This approach allows the realization of smaller devices, which in turn enables lower operating voltages, while simultaneously offering the possibility of integrating multiple quantum light sources on a single chip. The article provides a detailed description of the full fabrication chain, entirely based on fs-laser processing steps, from substrate thinning to metal layer structuring and final device definition. A particular focus is placed on the final cutting process, where the implementation of a third-harmonic ultraviolet (UV) fs-laser wavelength significantly improves edge quality and shape definition compared to the second harmonic (SH) wavelength used in previous work. The device fabricated through the combination of local thinning and UV-based cutting promises not only to enhance the efficiency of strain transfer but also to ensure the mechanical stability required for practical applications. These results establish fs-laser-based fabrication as a versatile and scalable method for next-generation piezoelectric actuators, paving the way for advanced strain-engineering approaches in semiconductor quantum optics and integrated quantum photonics."

An analogous statement holds under an a priori area bound below that of two spheres.The proof relies on a linearized analysis around the sphere.

However, when these libraries introduce defects, ranging from silent computation errors to subtle performance regressions, it is often challenging for downstream users to assess whether their own programs are affected. Such impact analysis requires not only understanding the defect semantics but also checking whether the client code satisfies complex triggering conditions involving configuration flags, runtime environments, and indirect API usage. We present DepRadar, an agent coordination framework for fine grained defect and impact analysis in DL library updates. DepRadar coordinates four specialized agents across three steps: 1. the PR Miner and Code Diff Analyzer extract structured defect semantics from commits or pull requests, 2. the Orchestrator Agent synthesizes these signals into a unified defect pattern with trigger conditions, and 3. the Impact Analyzer checks downstream programs to determine whether the defect can be triggered. To improve accuracy and explainability, DepRadar integrates static analysis with DL-specific domain rules for defect reasoning and client side tracing. We evaluate DepRadar on 157 PRs and 70 commits across two representative DL libraries. It achieves 90% precision in defect identification and generates high quality structured fields (average field score 1.6). On 122 client programs, DepRadar identifies affected cases with 90% recall and 80% precision, substantially outperforming other baselines."

We confront the model with current observational data, including Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements from Planck, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from DESI DR2, and recent Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) compilations. Our analysis shows that Nash gravity provides a good fit to the data, yielding a slightly higher value for the Hubble constant, $H_0 = 69.32 \\pm 0.72$ km/s/Mpc, compared to the $Λ$CDM model, thus offering a potential alleviation of the $H_0$ tension. Furthermore, the model naturally predicts a suppressed growth of structure, with $S_8 \\approx 0.76$ across various joint analyses, potentially alleviating the so-called $S_8$ tension, assuming that this discrepancy is not solely due to systematic effects in other independent measurements. In some cases, Nash gravity achieves a better fit to the data than the $Λ$CDM paradigm at the $2σ$ level."

    "abstract": "Pre-trained language models (LMs) have, over the last few years, grown substantially in both societal adoption and training costs. This rapid growth in size has constrained progress in understanding and mitigating their biases. Since re-training LMs is prohibitively expensive, most debiasing work has focused on post-hoc or masking-based strategies, which often fail to address the underlying causes of bias. In this work, we seek to democratise pre-model debiasing research by using low-cost proxy models. Specifically, we investigate BabyLMs, compact BERT-like models trained on small and mutable corpora that can approximate bias acquisition and learning dynamics of larger models. We show that BabyLMs display closely aligned patterns of intrinsic bias formation and performance development compared to standard BERT models, despite their drastically reduced size. Furthermore, correlations between BabyLMs and BERT hold across multiple intra-model and post-model debiasing methods. Leveraging these similarities, we conduct pre-model debiasing experiments with BabyLMs, replicating prior findings and presenting new insights regarding the influence of gender imbalance and toxicity on bias formation. Our results demonstrate that BabyLMs can serve as an effective sandbox for large-scale LMs, reducing pre-training costs from over 500 GPU-hours to under 30 GPU-hours. This provides a way to democratise pre-model debiasing research and enables faster, more accessible exploration of methods for building fairer LMs."

To address this, our framework, Speech-Hands, recasts the problem as an explicit self-reflection decision. This learnable reflection primitive proves effective in preventing the model from being derailed by flawed external candidates. We show that this agentic action mechanism generalizes naturally from speech recognition to complex, multiple-choice audio reasoning. Across the OpenASR leaderboard, Speech-Hands consistently outperforms strong baselines by 12.1% WER on seven benchmarks. The model also achieves 77.37% accuracy and high F1 on audio QA decisions, showing robust generalization and reliability across diverse audio question answering datasets.

This UV field is a major agent of ionization and dissociation in the inner regions of molecular clouds that are shielded from the effects of the interstellar radiation field. In particular, the dissociation of $\\rm H_2$, by far the most abundant molecule in interstellar clouds, leads to the production of atomic hydrogen which then takes part in the production of a multitude of molecules, in particular complex organics on the surfaces of interstellar dust grains. Precise knowledge of the rates of CR-induced dissociation processes is thus crucial for constructing reliable chemical models. For the present paper, we have derived a new value of $k_{\\rm diss, CR}(\\mbox{$\\rm H_2$})=0.831ζ$ for the rate of $\\rm H_2$ dissociation, where $ζ$ is the CR ionization rate of $\\rm H_2$. This prediction contrasts a previous value from the Leiden database which overestimated the rate due to an inconsistent treatment of the $\\rm H_2$ abundances and photodissociation cross sections. By running a series of chemical models, we show that the overestimated dissociation rate has a large effect on the results of chemical simulations, with the abundance of methanol being overestimated by over one order of magnitude. Hence, we strongly recommend the adoption of our new estimate $k_{\\rm diss, CR}(\\mbox{$\\rm H_2$})=0.831ζ$ in all chemical models that include this process. Our newly derived value corresponds to $\\rm H_2$ being purely in the para form ($J^{\\prime\\prime} = 0$). However, in the interiors of molecular clouds the $\\rm H_2$ ortho-to-para ratio is low and using the rate for para-$\\rm H_2$ is an adequate approximation."

    "abstract": "Large-scale LED lighting systems degrade through gradual package degradation and abrupt driver outages, while acceptability is determined by spatio-temporal illuminance compliance rather than component reliability alone. This paper proposes a performance-driven, simulation-in-the-loop framework for opportunistic maintenance optimization of LED lighting systems. LED package degradation is modeled by a semi-physical non-homogeneous Gamma process whose mean follows an exponential lumen-maintenance trend, and driver outages are described by a Weibull lifetime model. Parameters are calibrated from LM-80 accelerated degradation data via Bayesian inference, enabling uncertainty propagation to operating conditions. System performance is evaluated using ray-tracing-based illuminance mapping, and static indices (average illuminance and uniformity) are converted into a long-term dynamic deficiency-ratio metric via performance-deficiency durations over event intervals. To enable scalable Monte Carlo policy evaluation and search, a surrogate-based performance mapping replaces repeated ray-tracing with negligible loss of fidelity. An opportunistic policy is optimized in a multi-objective setting to balance performance deficiency, site visits, and replacements. A case study demonstrates the practicality of the framework and the resulting Pareto trade-offs for maintenance decision support."

    "abstract": "Generating safe and reliable trajectories for autonomous vehicles in long-tail scenarios remains a significant challenge, particularly for high-lateral-acceleration maneuvers such as sharp turns, which represent critical safety situations. Existing trajectory planners exhibit systematic failures in these scenarios due to data imbalance. This results in insufficient modelling of vehicle dynamics, road geometry, and environmental constraints in high-risk situations, leading to suboptimal or unsafe trajectory prediction when vehicles operate near their physical limits. In this paper, we introduce ReflexDiffusion, a novel inference-stage framework that enhances diffusion-based trajectory planners through reflective adjustment. Our method introduces a gradient-based adjustment mechanism during the iterative denoising process: after each standard trajectory update, we compute the gradient between the conditional and unconditional noise predictions to explicitly amplify critical conditioning signals, including road curvature and lateral vehicle dynamics. This amplification enforces strict adherence to physical constraints, particularly improving stability during high-lateral-acceleration maneuvers where precise vehicle-road interaction is paramount. Evaluated on the nuPlan Test14-hard benchmark, ReflexDiffusion achieves a 14.1% improvement in driving score for high-lateral-acceleration scenarios over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. This demonstrates that inference-time trajectory optimization can effectively compensate for training data sparsity by dynamically reinforcing safety-critical constraints near handling limits. The framework's architecture-agnostic design enables direct deployment to existing diffusion-based planners, offering a practical solution for improving autonomous vehicle safety in challenging driving conditions."

As such, we have a distinct and more challenging setting for autonomous driving. In this work, we consider a Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planning approach for single-agent autonomous driving in lane-free traffic, where the associated Markov Decision Process we formulate is influenced from existing approaches tied to reinforcement learning frameworks. In addition, MCTS is equipped with a pre-trained neural network (NN) that guides the selection phase. This procedure incorporates the predictive capabilities of NNs for a more informed tree search process under computational constraints. In our experimental evaluation, we consider metrics that address both safety (through collision rates) and efficacy (through measured speed). Then, we examine: (a) the influence of isotropic state information for vehicles in a lane-free environment, resulting in nudging behaviour--vehicles' policy reacts due to the presence of faster tailing ones, (b) the acceleration of performance for the NN-guided variant of MCTS, and (c) the trade-off between computational resources and solution quality."

    "abstract": "We propose Spectral Complex Autoencoder Pruning (SCAP), a reconstruction-based criterion that measures functional redundancy at the level of individual output channels. For each convolutional layer, we construct a complex interaction field by pairing the full multi-channel input activation as the real part with a single output-channel activation (spatially aligned and broadcast across input channels) as the imaginary part. We transform this complex field to the frequency domain and train a low-capacity autoencoder to reconstruct normalized spectra. Channels whose spectra are reconstructed with high fidelity are interpreted as lying close to a low-dimensional manifold captured by the autoencoder and are therefore more compressible; conversely, channels with low fidelity are retained as they encode information that cannot be compactly represented by the learned manifold. This yields an importance score (optionally fused with the filter L1 norm) that supports simple threshold-based pruning and produces a structurally consistent pruned network. On VGG16 trained on CIFAR-10, at a fixed threshold of 0.6, we obtain 90.11% FLOP reduction and 96.30% parameter reduction with an absolute Top-1 accuracy drop of 1.67% from a 93.44% baseline after fine-tuning, demonstrating that spectral reconstruction fidelity of complex interaction fields is an effective proxy for channel-level redundancy under aggressive compression."

This enables efficient video understanding without exceeding memory budgets.

This FR dichotomy may arise due to variation in the ambient medium and/or the properties of the jet itself, such as injection speed, temperature, composition, magnetization, etc. To investigate this, we perform large-scale three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (3D-MHD) simulations of low-power, supersonic jets extending to kiloparsec scales. We inject a jet beam carrying an initially toroidal magnetic field into a denser, unmagnetized, and stratified ambient medium through a cylindrical nozzle. Our simulations explore jets with varying injection parameters to investigate their impact on morphology and emission properties. Furthermore, we examine jets with significantly different plasma compositions, such as hadronic and mixed electron-positron-proton configurations, to study the conditions that may drive transitions between FR I and FR II morphologies. We find that, under the same injection parameters, mixed plasma composition jets tend to evolve into FR I structures. In contrast, electron-proton jets exhibit a transition between FR I and FR II morphologies at different stages of their evolution."

From the combined consideration of $D_\\mathrm{Ba}^\\ast$ and $D_\\mathrm{v_{Ba}}$, we conclude that Ba diffusion in these samples occurred most probably by the migration of defect associates, and not by the migration of isolated barium vacancies.

    "abstract": "Geological earthquake records are important for probabilistic seismic risk assessment. Such records can be obtained from studies of turbidites triggered by seismic activity in marine and lake basins. The Sea of Marmara (SoM), located on the North Anatolian Fault (NAF), serves as an important laboratory for subaqueous palaeoseismological research. This is because it has 2500 yrs. of historical earthquake records that can be correlated with radiometrically dated sedimentary earthquake records. Additionally, the relatively high sedimentation rate ($\\sim$3 mm/yr) in the deep subbasins allows the recognition of individual events. Following the destructive 1912 Mw 7.4 Şarköy-Mürefte and 1999 Mw 7.4 Izmit and Mw 7.2 Düzce earthquakes, the main submerged part of the NAF in the SoM represents a seismic gap, where the long-term earthquake history is of crucial importance for earthquake risk assessment. We have studied nine cores recovered along the most active northern strand of the NAF (i.e. the Main Marmara Fault: MMF), using high resolution digital X-ray radiography, $μ$-XRF core scanning, MSCL physical properties and grain-size analyses. The chronology was determined using accelerated mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon and radionuclide methods. In the cores, coseismic turbidites commonly consist of a basal part with multiple sand-silt laminae above a sharp and often erosional base and an overlying graded mud part (homogenite). The basal parts exhibit high gamma density and MS, and are often enriched in one or more elements, such as Si, K, Fe, Ti, Zr, Ca and Sr, indicative of coarse siliciclastic and carbonate shell fragments. Radionuclide- and radiocarbon-dated coseismic turbidites in different SoM subbasins extending back to more than 5000 yrs. indicate an average earthquake recurrence time between 220 and 300 yrs. along the different segments of the MMF. These results are compatible with the GPS velocities and geological slip rates. However, the intervals between two consecutive events vary widely between 50 and 695 yrs. for the different northern NAF segments. Integration of our results with previous studies indicates that the M > 7 events recorded are the 1999, 1509, 1296 and 740 earthquakes on the __zmit Gulf segment; the 1894, 1509, 1343, 1090 and 740 earthquakes on the Prince Islands segment in the Çınarcık Basin; the 1894, 1766, 1509, 989, 869 or 862, 740 and 447 earthquakes on the Central High segment and in the Central Basin; and the 1912, 1766, 1344, 989 and 447 earthquakes on the western Marmara segment. The 1912 Şarköy-Mürefte earthquake record is absent in the Central Basin, which suggests that the earthquake rupture did not extend beyond the western end of the Western High. The distribution of the 2500 yr-long sedimentary earthquake records matched with the historical earthquakes along the MMF indicates the common occurrence of multiple-segment ruptures, and suggests that presently, the most earthquake-prone part of the MMF is the Central High segment, located SW of Istanbul."

By construction,the code can also be used to select objects that contaminate the high-z quasar population, i.e. brown dwarfs and early-type galaxies at intermediate redshifts. The code can be adapted for the selection of high-z galaxies, and although it has been tuned to the Euclid Wide Survey, it can be easily adapted to other photometric surveys. The code input data are the object's photometric data and its galactic longitude and latitude, and the code output data are the probabilities of the modelled populations of high-z quasars, brown dwarfs and early-type galaxies at intermediate redshift. As part of the validation, Owl-z could re-identify all spectroscopically confirmed quasars at z \\geq 7, demonstrating the code's versatility in applying to different photometric catalogues. The performance of Owl-z, based on a metric combining completeness and purity called F-measure, is analysed in the case of Euclid using simulated data in a wide range of redshifts (7 \\leq z \\leq 12) and H-band Euclid magnitudes (18 \\leq H_E \\leq 24.5). The results show that Owl-z reaches full performance for bright sources (H_E \\lesssim 22), independently of the redshift. We show that the probability threshold used to select promising quasar candidates can be adjusted after processing to fine-tune the F-measure value of candidates depending on their magnitude and redshift estimates. We show that for objects brighter than about two magnitudes above the survey detection limit, Owl-z provides a classification that will facilitate the optimisation of photometric and spectroscopic confirmation campaigns. In conclusion, Owl-z is a powerful public tool to help select high-z quasars, brown dwarfs or early-type galaxies at intermediate redshifts in Euclid or other wide-field surveys."

Linear probing, which freezes the backbone and trains a lightweight head, is computationally efficient but often restricted to last-layer representations. We show that task-relevant information is distributed across the network hierarchy rather than solely encoded in any of the last layers. To leverage this distribution of information, we apply an attentive probing mechanism that dynamically fuses representations from all layers of a Vision Transformer. This mechanism learns to identify the most relevant layers for a target task and combines low-level structural cues with high-level semantic abstractions. Across 20 diverse datasets and multiple pretrained foundation models, our method achieves consistent, substantial gains over standard linear probes. Attention heatmaps further reveal that tasks different from the pre-training domain benefit most from intermediate representations. Overall, our findings underscore the value of intermediate layer information and demonstrate a principled, task aware approach for unlocking their potential in probing-based adaptation."

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a vital role in clinical diagnostics, yet it remains hindered by long acquisition times and motion artifacts. Multi-contrast MRI reconstruction has emerged as a promising direction by leveraging complementary information from fully-sampled reference scans. However, existing approaches suffer from three major limitations: (1) superficial reference fusion strategies, such as simple concatenation, (2) insufficient utilization of the complementary information provided by the reference contrast, and (3) fixed under-sampling patterns. We propose an efficient and interpretable frequency error-guided reconstruction framework to tackle these issues. We first employ a conditional diffusion model to learn a Frequency Error Prior (FEP), which is then incorporated into a unified framework for jointly optimizing both the under-sampling pattern and the reconstruction network. The proposed reconstruction model employs a model-driven deep unfolding framework that jointly exploits frequency- and image-domain information. In addition, a spatial alignment module and a reference feature decomposition strategy are incorporated to improve reconstruction quality and bridge model-based optimization with data-driven learning for improved physical interpretability. Comprehensive validation across multiple imaging modalities, acceleration rates (4-30x), and sampling schemes demonstrates consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.

    "abstract": "On-device recommendation is critical for a number of real-world applications, especially in scenarios that have agreements on execution latency, user privacy, and robust functionality when internet connectivity is unstable or even impossible. While large language models (LLMs) can now provide exceptional capabilities that model user behavior for sequential recommendation tasks, their substantial memory footprint and computational overhead make the deployment on resource-constrained devices a high risk proposition. In this paper, we propose OD-LLM, the first task-adaptive compression framework explicitly designed to provide efficient and accurate on-device deployment of LLMs for sequential recommendation tasks. OD-LLM uniquely integrates two complementary compression strategies: a low-rank structural compression algorithm which uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to significantly reduce parameter redundancy in the model, and a novel tokenization normalization technique that better complements the low-rank decomposition process being used. Additionally, to minimize any potential performance degradation when using higher compression ratios, a novel progressive alignment algorithm is used to iteratively refine the parameters required layerwise in the target model. Empirical evaluations conducted on sequential recommendation benchmarks show that OD-LLM exhibits no loss in effectiveness when compared to the original recommendation model, when the deployed model size is halved. These promising results demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of OD-LLM, making this novel solution a practical alternative for real-time, on-device solutions wishing to replace expensive, remotely executed LLMs."

When statistical heterogeneity across clients is severe, Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) can improve performance by grouping similar clients and training cluster-wise models.

We propose Data Collaboration-based Clustered Federated Learning (DC-CFL), a single-round framework that completes both client clustering and cluster-wise learning, using only the information shared in DC analysis. DC-CFL quantifies inter-client similarity via total variation distance between label distributions, estimates clusters using hierarchical clustering, and performs cluster-wise learning via DC analysis. Experiments on multiple open datasets under representative non-IID conditions show that DC-CFL achieves accuracy comparable to multi-round baselines while requiring only one communication round. These results indicate that DC-CFL is a practical alternative for collaborative AI model development when multiple communication rounds are impractical."

The core idea is to model the 3D point cloud as a dynamic system, where the points are represented as an undirected graph and interact via attractive and repulsive forces. The energy distribution induced by these forces can reveal surface anomalies. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior anomaly detection performance in both open surface and closed surface without training.

A key benefit of our approach is that it functions as a lightweight plugin for the standard 3DGS pipeline, requiring no major architectural changes and adding minimal overhead to the training process. The core of our method is a floater pruning algorithm--TIDI--that identifies and removes floaters based on several criteria: their consistency across multiple viewpoints, their spatial relationship to other elements, and an importance score learned during training. The framework includes a mechanism to preserve fine details, ensuring that important high-frequency elements are not mistakenly removed. This targeted cleanup is supported by a monocular depth-based loss function that helps improve the overall geometric structure of the scene. Our experiments demonstrate that TIDI-GS improves both the perceptual quality and geometric integrity of reconstructions, transforming them into robust digital assets, suitable for high-fidelity applications."

    "abstract": "Scientific reasoning relies not only on logical inference but also on activating prior knowledge and experiential structures. Memory can efficiently reuse knowledge and enhance reasoning consistency and stability. However, existing benchmarks mainly evaluate final answers or step-by-step coherence, overlooking the \\textit{memory-driven} mechanisms that underlie human reasoning, which involves activating anchors and attractors, then integrating them into multi-step inference. To address this gap, we propose $A^3$-Bench~ https://a3-bench.github.io, a benchmark designed to evaluate scientific reasoning through dual-scale memory-driven activation, grounded in Anchor and Attractor Activation. First, we annotate 2,198 science reasoning problems across domains using the SAPM process(subject, anchor & attractor, problem, and memory developing). Second, we introduce a dual-scale memory evaluation framework utilizing anchors and attractors, along with the AAUI(Anchor--Attractor Utilization Index) metric to measure memory activation rates. Finally, through experiments with various base models and paradigms, we validate $A^3$-Bench and analyze how memory activation impacts reasoning performance, providing insights into memory-driven scientific reasoning."

Therefore, the Frenkel regime of excitons localized within a few unit cells is readily reached and traditional Wannier exciton models become inadequate. In the presence of strong electric fields, excitons are polarized and, in extreme cases, ionized. Such strong-field effects have previously been described analytically for Wannier excitons. In the present work, we show that analytical results can be extended to the more involved Frenkel case as well. Hence, by analytically solving the difference equation describing Frenkel excitons in electric fields, we derive close-form expressions for resonances providing Stark shifts and ionization rates. Moreover, closed-form results for exciton electroabsorption spectra and dynamic polarizability are obtained."

By establishing all geometric and spectral results internally, the work provides a unified framework for triadic symmetry and spectral analysis. The central thesis is that a triadic $Γ$-algebra canonically induces two primary structures: (i) an intrinsic triadic symmetry in the sense of a Nambu--Filippov-type fundamental identity on the structure sheaf, and (ii) a canonical Laplacian on the finite $Γ$-spectrum whose spectral decomposition detects the clopen (connected-component) decomposition of the underlying space. We define $Γ$-ideals and prime $Γ$-ideals, endow $\\SpecG(T)$ with a $Γ$-Zariski topology, construct localizations and the structure sheaf on the basis of principal opens, and prove the affine anti-equivalence between commutative ternary $Γ$-semirings and affine $Γ$-schemes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the triadic bracket on sections is invariant under $Γ$-automorphisms and compatible with localization. The main spectral theorem establishes the block-diagonalization of the Laplacian under topological decompositions and provides an algebraic-connectivity criterion. The theory is verified through explicit computations of finite $Γ$-spectra and their corresponding Laplacian spectra"

However, during agent inference, existing methods often suffer from (i) locally myopic generation, due to the absence of lookahead, and (ii) trajectory instability, where minor early errors can escalate into divergent reasoning paths. These issues make it difficult to balance global effectiveness and computational efficiency. To address these two issues, we propose meta-adaptive exploration with LLM agents https://github.com/exoskeletonzj/MAXS, a meta-adaptive reasoning framework based on LLM Agents that flexibly integrates tool execution and reasoning planning. MAXS employs a lookahead strategy to extend reasoning paths a few steps ahead, estimating the advantage value of tool usage, and combines step consistency variance and inter-step trend slopes to jointly select stable, consistent, and high-value reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce a trajectory convergence mechanism that controls computational cost by halting further rollouts once path consistency is achieved, enabling a balance between resource efficiency and global effectiveness in multi-tool reasoning. We conduct extensive empirical studies across three base models (MiMo-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-32B) and five datasets, demonstrating that MAXS consistently outperforms existing methods in both performance and inference efficiency. Further analysis confirms the effectiveness of our lookahead strategy and tool usage."

By combining time--frequency analysis of HHG spectra obtained from full time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) simulations with classical three-step-model (TSM) trajectories, we extract an effective tunneling delay associated with electron motion through the laser-suppressed Coulomb barrier. The analysis is carried out for Hydrogen, Helium, and Argon atoms over a range of laser wavelengths and peak intensities within the tunneling regime. The extracted delay exhibits a systematic dependence on the instantaneous field strength and barrier width at the ionization time, and follows the expected $τ_d \\propto 1/\\sqrt{I_0}$ scaling consistent with Keldysh--Rutherford-type models and attoclock observations. When recast in terms of the Keldysh parameter, the tunneling delay collapses onto a near-universal trend across different atomic species. While HHG does not provide a direct measurement of tunneling time, the present results demonstrate that it can serve as a robust, internally consistent diagnostic of tunneling dynamics, offering an independent and complementary perspective to established attoclock techniques."

However, LLMs often produce inconsistent toxicity judgements for subtle expressions, particularly those involving implicit hate speech, revealing underlying biases that are difficult to correct through standard training. This raises a key question that existing approaches often overlook: when should corrective mechanisms be invoked to ensure fair and reliable assessments? To address this, we propose FairToT, an inference-time framework that enhances LLM fairness through prompt-guided toxicity assessment. FairToT identifies cases where demographic-related variation is likely to occur and determines when additional assessment should be applied. In addition, we introduce two interpretable fairness indicators that detect such cases and improve inference consistency without modifying model parameters. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that FairToT reduces group-level disparities while maintaining stable and reliable toxicity predictions, demonstrating that inference-time refinement offers an effective and practical approach for fairness improvement in LLM-based toxicity assessment systems.

To address this problem, we propose DeTracker, a joint detection-and-tracking framework tailored for unstabilized satellite videos. DeTracker introduces a Global--Local Motion Decoupling (GLMD) module that explicitly separates satellite platform motion from true object motion through global alignment and local refinement, leading to improved trajectory stability and motion estimation accuracy. In addition, a Temporal Dependency Feature Pyramid (TDFP) module is developed to perform cross-frame temporal feature fusion, enhancing the continuity and discriminability of tiny-object representations. We further construct a new benchmark dataset, SDM-Car-SU, which simulates multi-directional and multi-speed platform motions to enable systematic evaluation of tracking robustness under varying motion perturbations. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real unstabilized satellite videos demonstrate that DeTracker significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 61.1% MOTA on SDM-Car-SU and 47.3% MOTA on real satellite video data."

To achieve better disentanglement, we propose DSA-Tokenizer, which explicitly disentangles speech into discrete semantic and acoustic tokens via distinct optimization constraints. Specifically, semantic tokens are supervised by ASR to capture linguistic content, while acoustic tokens focus on mel-spectrograms restoration to encode style. To eliminate rigid length constraints between the two sequences, we introduce a hierarchical Flow-Matching decoder that further improve speech generation quality.Furthermore, We employ a joint reconstruction-recombination training strategy to enforce this separation. DSA-Tokenizer enables high fidelity reconstruction and flexible recombination through robust disentanglement, facilitating controllable generation in speech LLMs. Our analysis highlights disentangled tokenization as a pivotal paradigm for future speech modeling.

    "abstract": "Digital service providers often prioritize a frictionless user experience by adopting technologies that simplify access to their services. One widely used mechanism is the Short Message Service (SMS) to deliver links (URLs) that enable single-click access to online services with little to no resistance. However, SMS is inherently insecure, and numerous reports have documented message interception and data leaks. Thus, attributing excessive trust in such an insecure channel opens avenues for unintended access and exploitation by adversaries. In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation of the implications of SMS-delivered URLs from the lens of public SMS gateways. We conduct the study on more than 322K unique SMS-delivered URLs extracted from more than 33 million messages across more than 30K phone numbers, revealing critical security and privacy vulnerabilities. We identify and validate critical Personally Identifiable Information (PII) exposure in 701 endpoints affecting 177 services. Our manual investigation of the root cause of the exposure reveals a weak authentication model which hinges upon tokenized bearer links as sufficient authorization proofs, thereby allowing anyone with the URL to access private user information, including social security number, date of birth, bank account number, and credit score. Additionally, we identify 125 services allowing mass enumeration of valid URLs due to low entropy within tokens, thereby cascading the privacy risks beyond the initially compromised users. Furthermore, we identify mismatches between the GUI and data fetched by the client, extending the scale of privacy leakages. Particularly, we identify 76 services that perform data overfetching. Finally, 18 services have acknowledged and addressed the weaknesses in their services, thereby enhancing the privacy of at least 120M users."

In this paper, we introduce a SPOT-Face, a superpixel graph-based framework designed for cross-domain forensic face identification of victims using their skeleton and sketch images. Our unified framework involves constructing a superpixel-based graph from an image and then using different graph neural networks(GNNs) backbones to extract the embeddings of these graphs, while cross-domain correspondence is established through attention-guided optimal transport mechanism. We have evaluated our proposed framework on two publicly available dataset: IIT\\_Mandi\\_S2F (S2F) and CUFS. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate our proposed framework. The experimental results show significant improvement in identification metrics ( i.e., Recall, mAP) over existing graph-based baselines. Furthermore, our framework demonstrates to be highly effective for matching skulls and sketches to faces in forensic investigations."

The observer combines a finite-dimensional parameter estimator with an infinite-dimensional description of the state error dynamics, and achieves exponential convergence under persistent excitation. The effectiveness of the proposed design is demonstrated in simulation by considering a relevant example borrowed from road vehicle dynamics."

    "abstract": "Purpose: Myocardium segmentation in echocardiography videos is a challenging task due to low contrast, noise, and anatomical variability. Traditional deep learning models either process frames independently, ignoring temporal information, or rely on memory-based feature propagation, which accumulates error over time. Methods: We propose Point-Seg, a transformer-based segmentation framework that integrates point tracking as a temporal cue to ensure stable and consistent segmentation of myocardium across frames. Our method leverages a point-tracking module trained on a synthetic echocardiography dataset to track key anatomical landmarks across video sequences. These tracked trajectories provide an explicit motion-aware signal that guides segmentation, reducing drift and eliminating the need for memory-based feature accumulation. Additionally, we incorporate a temporal smoothing loss to further enhance temporal consistency across frames. Results: We evaluate our approach on both public and private echocardiography datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that Point-Seg has statistically similar accuracy in terms of Dice to state-of-the-art segmentation models in high quality echo data, while it achieves better segmentation accuracy in lower quality echo with improved temporal stability. Furthermore, Point-Seg has the key advantage of pixel-level myocardium motion information as opposed to other segmentation methods. Such information is essential in the computation of other downstream tasks such as myocardial strain measurement and regional wall motion abnormality detection. Conclusion: Point-Seg demonstrates that point tracking can serve as an effective temporal cue for consistent video segmentation, offering a reliable and generalizable approach for myocardium segmentation in echocardiography videos.

The Gutman test for this problem compares the empirical distributions of the observed sequences and decides on the null hypothesis if the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence between these empirical distributions is below a given threshold. This paper proposes a generalization of the Gutman test, termed \\emph{divergence test}, which replaces the JS divergence by an arbitrary divergence. For this test, the exponential decay of the type-II error probability for a fixed type-I error probability is studied. First, it is shown that the divergence test achieves the optimal first-order exponent, irrespective of the choice of divergence. Second, it is demonstrated that the divergence test with an invariant divergence achieves the same second-order asymptotics as the Gutman test. In addition, it is shown that the Gutman test is the GLRT for the two-sample testing problem, and a connection between two-sample testing and robust goodness-of-fit testing is established."

BalDRO formulates unlearning as a min-sup process: an inner step identifies a worst-case data distribution that emphasizes hard-to-unlearn samples, while an outer step updates model parameters under this distribution. We instantiate BalDRO via two efficient variants: BalDRO-G, a discrete GroupDRO-based approximation focusing on high-loss subsets, and BalDRO-DV, a continuous Donsker-Varadhan dual method enabling smooth adaptive weighting within standard training pipelines. Experiments on TOFU and MUSE show that BalDRO significantly improves both forgetting quality and model utility over existing methods, and we release code for reproducibility."

    "abstract": "In this work, we present SafePlanner, a systematic testing framework for identifying safety-critical flaws in the Plan model of Automated Driving Systems (ADS). SafePlanner targets two core challenges: generating structurally meaningful test scenarios and detecting hazardous planning behaviors. To maximize coverage, SafePlanner performs a structural analysis of the Plan model implementation - specifically, its scene-transition logic and hierarchical control flow - and uses this insight to extract feasible scene transitions from code. It then composes test scenarios by combining these transitions with non-player vehicle (NPC) behaviors. Guided fuzzing is applied to explore the behavioral space of the Plan model under these scenarios. We evaluate SafePlanner on Baidu Apollo, a production-grade level 4 ADS. It generates 20635 test cases and detects 520 hazardous behaviors, grouped into 15 root causes through manual analysis. For four of these, we applied patches based on our analysis; the issues disappeared, and no apparent side effects were observed. SafePlanner achieves 83.63 percent function and 63.22 percent decision coverage on the Plan model, outperforming baselines in both bug discovery and efficiency."

Then it aligns robot trajectories through gradient-based optimization, followed by synthesizing observations and actions for unseen robot arms and end-effectors. In experiments, \\CEI transfers data and policies from a Franka Panda robot to \\textbf{16} different embodiments across \\textbf{3} tasks in simulation, and supports bidirectional transfer between a UR5+AG95 gripper robot and a UR5+Xhand robot across \\textbf{6} real-world tasks, achieving an average transfer ratio of 82.4\\%.

    "abstract": "We study the Bandit Clustering (BC) problem under the fixed confidence setting, where the objective is to group a collection of data sequences (arms) into clusters through sequential sampling from adaptively selected arms at each time step while ensuring a fixed error probability at the stopping time. We consider a setting where arms in a cluster may have different distributions. Unlike existing results in this setting, which assume Gaussian-distributed arms, we study a broader class of vector-parametric distributions that satisfy mild regularity conditions. Existing asymptotically optimal BC algorithms require solving an optimization problem as part of their sampling rule at each step, which is computationally costly. We propose an Efficient Bandit Clustering algorithm (EBC), which, instead of solving the full optimization problem, takes a single step toward the optimal value at each time step, making it computationally efficient while remaining asymptotically optimal. We also propose a heuristic variant of EBC, called EBC-H, which further simplifies the sampling rule, with arm selection based on quantities computed as part of the stopping rule. We highlight the computational efficiency of EBC and EBC-H by comparing their per-sample run time with that of existing algorithms. The asymptotic optimality of EBC is supported through simulations on the synthetic datasets. Through simulations on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we show the performance gain of EBC and EBC-H over existing approaches."

In this paper, we introduce World Craft, an agentic world creation framework to create an executable and visualizable AI Town via user textual descriptions. It consists of two main modules, World Scaffold and World Guild. World Scaffold is a structured and concise standardization to develop interactive game scenes, serving as an efficient scaffolding for LLMs to customize an executable AI Town-like environment. World Guild is a multi-agent framework to progressively analyze users' intents from rough descriptions, and synthesizes required structured contents (\\eg environment layout and assets) for World Scaffold . Moreover, we construct a high-quality error-correction dataset via reverse engineering to enhance spatial knowledge and improve the stability and controllability of layout generation, while reporting multi-dimensional evaluation metrics for further analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing commercial code agents (Cursor and Antigravity) and LLMs (Qwen3 and Gemini-3-Pro). in scene construction and narrative intent conveyance, providing a scalable solution for the democratization of environment creation."

    "abstract": "We develop a new algorithmic framework for designing approximation algorithms for cut-based optimization problems on capacitated undirected graphs that undergo edge insertions and deletions. Specifically, our framework dynamically maintains a variant of the hierarchical $j$-tree decomposition of [Madry FOCS'10], achieving a poly-logarithmic approximation factor to the graph's cut structure and supporting edge updates in $O(n^ε)$ amortized update time, for any arbitrarily small constant $ε\\in (0,1)$. Consequently, we obtain new trade-offs between approximation and update/query time for fundamental cut-based optimization problems in the fully dynamic setting, including all-pairs minimum cuts, sparsest cut, multi-way cut, and multi-cut. For the last three problems, these trade-offs give the first fully-dynamic algorithms achieving poly-logarithmic approximation in sub-linear time per operation. The main technical ingredient behind our dynamic hierarchy is a dynamic cut-sparsifier algorithm that can handle vertex splits with low recourse. This is achieved by white-boxing the dynamic cut sparsifier construction of [Abraham et al. FOCS'16], based on forest packing, together with new structural insights about the maintenance of these forests under vertex splits. Given the versatility of cut sparsification in both the static and dynamic graph algorithms literature, we believe this construction may be of independent interest."

Recent pathology-specific foundation models have further advanced performance by leveraging large-scale pretraining. However, standard ViTs remain inherently non-equivariant to transformations such as rotations and reflections, which are ubiquitous variations in histopathology imaging. To address this limitation, we propose Equi-ViT, which integrates an equivariant convolution kernel into the patch embedding stage of a ViT architecture, imparting built-in rotational equivariance to learned representations. Equi-ViT achieves superior rotation-consistent patch embeddings and stable classification performance across image orientations. Our results on a public colorectal cancer dataset demonstrate that incorporating equivariant patch embedding enhances data efficiency and robustness, suggesting that equivariant transformers could potentially serve as more generalizable backbones for the application of ViT in histopathology, such as digital pathology foundation models."

    "abstract": "Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competitions play a central role in modern cybersecurity as a platform for training practitioners and evaluating offensive and defensive techniques derived from real-world vulnerabilities. Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs), existing LLM-based agents remain ineffective on high-difficulty cryptographic CTF challenges, which require precise cryptanalytic knowledge, stable long-horizon reasoning, and disciplined interaction with specialized toolchains. Through a systematic exploratory study, we show that insufficient knowledge granularity, rather than model reasoning capacity, is a primary factor limiting successful cryptographic exploitation: coarse or abstracted external knowledge often fails to support correct attack modeling and implementation. Motivated by this observation, we propose KryptoPilot, an open-world knowledge-augmented LLM agent for automated cryptographic exploitation. KryptoPilot integrates dynamic open-world knowledge acquisition via a Deep Research pipeline, a persistent workspace for structured knowledge reuse, and a governance subsystem that stabilizes reasoning through behavioral constraints and cost-aware model routing. This design enables precise knowledge alignment while maintaining efficient reasoning across heterogeneous subtasks. We evaluate KryptoPilot on two established CTF benchmarks and in six real-world CTF competitions. KryptoPilot achieves a complete solve rate on InterCode-CTF, solves between 56 and 60 percent of cryptographic challenges on the NYU-CTF benchmark, and successfully solves 26 out of 33 cryptographic challenges in live competitions, including multiple earliest-solved and uniquely-solved instances. These results demonstrate the necessity of open-world, fine-grained knowledge augmentation and governed reasoning for scaling LLM-based agents to real-world cryptographic exploitation."

Our approach combines a Hidden Markov Model with Black-Litterman (BL) methodology to forecast asset returns and covariances, and incorporates practically important constraints, including turnover limits, transaction costs, and target portfolio allocations. We study two predominant optimality criteria in wealth management: dynamic mean-variance (MV) and dynamic risk-budgeting (MRB). Numerical experiments demonstrate that MPC-based strategies consistently outperform myopic approaches, with MV providing flexible and diversified portfolios, while MRB delivers smoother allocations less sensitive to key parameters.

Here, we present a scalable computational framework that combines machine learning interatomic potentials, anharmonic lattice dynamics, and high-throughput calculations to investigate temperature-dependent phonons across thousands of materials. By fine-tuning the universal M3GNet interatomic potential using high-quality phonon data, we improve phonon prediction accuracy by a factor of four while preserving computational efficiency. Integrating this refined model into a high-throughput implementation of the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation, we compute temperature-dependent phonons for 4,669 inorganic compounds. Our analysis identifies systematic elemental and structural trends governing anharmonic phonon renormalization, with particularly strong manifestations in alkali metals, perovskite-derived frameworks, and related systems. Machine learning models trained on this dataset identify key atomic-scale features driving strong anharmonicity, including weak bonding, large atomic radii, and specific coordination motifs. First-principles validation confirms that anharmonic effects can dramatically alter lattice thermal conductivity by factors of two to four in some materials. This work establishes a robust and efficient data-driven approach for predicting finite-temperature phonon behavior, offering new pathways for the design and discovery of materials with tailored thermal and vibrational properties."

This survey presents a comprehensive and structured synthesis of memory in LLMs and MLLMs, organizing the literature into a cohesive taxonomy comprising implicit, explicit, and agentic memory paradigms. Specifically, the survey delineates three primary memory frameworks. Implicit memory refers to the knowledge embedded within the internal parameters of pre-trained transformers, encompassing their capacity for memorization, associative retrieval, and contextual reasoning. Recent work has explored methods to interpret, manipulate, and reconfigure this latent memory. Explicit memory involves external storage and retrieval components designed to augment model outputs with dynamic, queryable knowledge representations, such as textual corpora, dense vectors, and graph-based structures, thereby enabling scalable and updatable interaction with information sources. Agentic memory introduces persistent, temporally extended memory structures within autonomous agents, facilitating long-term planning, self-consistency, and collaborative behavior in multi-agent systems, with relevance to embodied and interactive AI. Extending beyond text, the survey examines the integration of memory within multi-modal settings, where coherence across vision, language, audio, and action modalities is essential. Key architectural advances, benchmark tasks, and open challenges are discussed, including issues related to memory capacity, alignment, factual consistency, and cross-system interoperability."

Yet conventional Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions in aviation remain siloed and narrow, focusing on isolated tasks or single modalities.

This paper introduces the vision of AviationLMM, a Large Multimodal foundation Model for civil aviation, designed to unify the heterogeneous data streams of civil aviation and enable understanding, reasoning, generation and agentic applications. We firstly identify the gaps between existing AI solutions and requirements. Secondly, we describe the model architecture that ingests multimodal inputs such as air-ground voice, surveillance, on-board telemetry, video and structured texts, and performs cross-modal alignment and fusion, and produces flexible outputs ranging from situation summaries and risk alerts to predictive diagnostics and multimodal incident reconstructions. In order to fully realize this vision, we identify key research opportunities to address, including data acquisition, alignment and fusion, pretraining, reasoning, trustworthiness, privacy, robustness to missing modalities, and synthetic scenario generation.

Notably, certain cardiac conditions that are infrequently encountered are disproportionately underrepresented in these datasets. Although algorithmic generation and oversampling of specific ECG signal types can mitigate class skew, there is a lack of consensus regarding the effectiveness of such techniques in ECG classification. Furthermore, the methodologies and scenarios of ECG acquisition introduce noise, further complicating the processing of ECG data. This paper presents a significantly enhanced ECG classifier that simultaneously addresses both class imbalance and noise-related challenges in ECG analysis, as observed in the CPSC 2018 dataset. Specifically, we propose the application of feature fusion based on the wavelet transform, with a focus on wavelet transform-based interclass fusion, to generate the training feature library and the test set feature library. Subsequently, the original training and test data are amalgamated with their respective feature databases, resulting in more balanced training and test datasets. Employing this approach, our ECG model achieves recognition accuracies of up to 99%, 98%, 97%, 98%, 96%, 92%, and 93% for Normal, AF, I-AVB, LBBB, RBBB, PAC, PVC, STD, and STE, respectively.

With the assistance of auxiliary networks, ZO updates enable clients to approximate local gradients using perturbed forward-only evaluations per step, eliminating memory-intensive activation caching and avoiding explicit gradient computation in the traditional training process. Leveraging the low effective rank assumption, we theoretically prove that HERON-SFL's convergence rate is independent of model dimensionality, addressing a key scalability concern common to ZO algorithms. Empirically, on ResNet training and language model (LM) fine-tuning tasks, HERON-SFL matches benchmark accuracy while reducing client peak memory by up to 64% and client-side compute cost by up to 33% per step, substantially expanding the range of models that can be trained or adapted on resource-limited devices."

Recent work shows that if the bosonic theory also has non-anomalous time-reversal symmetry, fermionization extends to non-orientable surfaces and yields a fermionic theory that depends on a $\\mathrm{Pin}^-$ structure. Besides fermionization, one can define various topological manipulations, such as gauging and stacking invertible phases, which together generate a web of dualities. We prove that their group structure is the dihedral group $D_8$ of order 16. Furthermore, we systematically investigate the web from two perspectives: Symmetry TFT and actions on sectors of the $S^1$ Hilbert space."

While early approaches treated disagreement as noise to be removed, recent work increasingly models it as a meaningful signal reflecting variation in interpretation and perspective. This survey provides a unified view of disagreement-aware NLP methods. We first present a domain-agnostic taxonomy of the sources of disagreement spanning data, task, and annotator factors. We then synthesize modeling approaches using a common framework defined by prediction targets and pooling structure, highlighting a shift from consensus learning toward explicitly modeling disagreement, and toward capturing structured relationships among annotators. We review evaluation metrics for both predictive performance and annotator behavior, and noting that most fairness evaluations remain descriptive rather than normative. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future directions, including integrating multiple sources of variation, developing disagreement-aware interpretability frameworks, and grappling with the practical tradeoffs of perspectivist modeling."

    "abstract": "Medical imaging datasets often suffer from class imbalance and limited availability of pathology-rich cases, which constrains the performance of machine learning models for segmentation, classification, and vision-language tasks. To address this challenge, we propose POWDR, a pathology-preserving outpainting framework for 3D MRI based on a conditioned wavelet diffusion model. Unlike conventional augmentation or unconditional synthesis, POWDR retains real pathological regions while generating anatomically plausible surrounding tissue, enabling diversity without fabricating lesions. Our approach leverages wavelet-domain conditioning to enhance high-frequency detail and mitigate blurring common in latent diffusion models. We introduce a random connected mask training strategy to overcome conditioning-induced collapse and improve diversity outside the lesion. POWDR is evaluated on brain MRI using BraTS datasets and extended to knee MRI to demonstrate tissue-agnostic applicability. Quantitative metrics (FID, SSIM, LPIPS) confirm image realism, while diversity analysis shows significant improvement with random-mask training (cosine similarity reduced from 0.9947 to 0.9580; KL divergence increased from 0.00026 to 0.01494). Clinically relevant assessments reveal gains in tumor segmentation performance using nnU-Net, with Dice scores improving from 0.6992 to 0.7137 when adding 50 synthetic cases. Tissue volume analysis indicates no significant differences for CSF and GM compared to real images. These findings highlight POWDR as a practical solution for addressing data scarcity and class imbalance in medical imaging. The method is extensible to multiple anatomies and offers a controllable framework for generating diverse, pathology-preserving synthetic data to support robust model development."

This further allowed the utilization of the property of the anomalous enhancement of the autocorrelation function when a system is on the Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB), for improving the quantity of the demonstrated memory, while simultaneously maintaining a very good quality, as this is expressed by the stability of the autocorrelation function. In this proof-of-concept case, the morphology of the signal allowed us to impose the appropriate modifications on the signal so that we finally show how to get very close to the characteristics of the SSB and thus achieve our goal to get as close as possible to the ideal behavior of a Memristor that yields deep memory. Finally, we provide proof of the stability of memristor's operation by showing that solitons \"follow\" as a skeleton structure the experimentally derived time series."

Although federal courts follow the 1976 Copyright Act, their interpretations and factor weightings vary widely across jurisdictions.

This research introduces a novel discourse-based Large Language Model (LLM) methodology that integrates Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) with an agentic workflow to extract and quantify previously opaque reasoning patterns from judicial opinions. Our framework addresses a major gap in empirical legal scholarship by parsing opinions into hierarchical discourse structures and using a three-stage pipeline, i.e., Dataset Construction, Discourse Analysis, and Agentic Feature Extraction. This pipeline identifies reasoning components and extract feature labels with corresponding discourse subtrees. In analyzing copyright damage rulings, we show that discourse-augmented LLM analysis outperforms traditional methods while uncovering unquantified variations in factor weighting across circuits. These findings offer both methodological advances in computational legal analysis and practical insights into judicial reasoning, with implications for legal practitioners seeking predictive tools, scholars studying legal principle application, and policymakers confronting inconsistencies in copyright law."

LiteEmbed performs subspace-guided optimization of text embeddings within CLIP's vocabulary, leveraging a PCA-based decomposition that disentangles coarse semantic directions from fine-grained variations. Two complementary objectives, coarse alignment and fine separation, jointly preserve global semantic consistency while enhancing discriminability among visually similar classes. Once optimized, the embeddings are plug-and-play, seamlessly substituting CLIP's original text features across classification, retrieval, segmentation, and detection tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial gains over prior methods, establishing LiteEmbed as an effective approach for adapting CLIP to underrepresented, rare, or unseen classes."

We consider two effective field theory approaches in the literature, relate them to the TATT model parameters and an extension to TATT that includes the velocity-shear (VS) parameter. We compare the impact of changing between NLA, TATT, and TATT+VS on the theoretical computation of the 3PCF using the best fit parameters and tomographic redshift distributions from Dark Energy Survey Year 3. We find that the TATT model significantly impacts the skewed triangle configurations of the 3PCF. Additionally, including the higher-order effects from TATT can introduce opposite effects on the two-point function and on the mass aperture skewness, damping the signal of the former while boosting the signal of the latter. We argue that a joint 2PCF+3PCF analysis with the TATT model can help break the degeneracy between its model parameters and provide more robust constraints on both cosmology and intrinsic alignment amplitude parameters. We show that typical values of order unity for the intrinsic alignment parameters introduce differences of around $10\\%$ between NLA and TATT predictions."

    "abstract": "The generalized quantum Arimoto--Blahut (QAB) algorithm is a powerful derivative-free iterative method in quantum information theory. A key obstacle to its broader use is that existing convergence guarantees typically rely on analytical conditions that are either overly restrictive or difficult to verify for concrete problems. We address this issue by introducing an a posteriori certification viewpoint: instead of requiring fully a priori verifiable assumptions, we provide convergence and error guarantees that can be validated directly from the iterates produced by the algorithm. Specifically, we prove a generalized global convergence theorem showing that, under convexity and a substantially weaker numerically verifiable condition, the QAB iteration converges to the global minimizer. This theorem yields a practical certification procedure: by checking explicit inequalities along the computed trajectory, one can certify global optimality and bound the suboptimality of the obtained value. As an application, we develop a certified iterative scheme for computing the quantum relative entropy of channels, a fundamental measure of distinguishability in quantum dynamics. This quantity is notoriously challenging to evaluate numerically: gradient-based methods are impeded by the complexity of matrix functions such as square roots and logarithms, while recent semidefinite programming approaches can become computationally and memory intensive at high precision. Our method avoids these bottlenecks by combining the QAB iteration with a posteriori certification, yielding an efficient and scalable algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate rapid convergence and improved scalability and adaptivity compared with SDP-based approaches."

Some novel strategies to realize the paradigm are introduced and discussed, including AI-native and AI-hybrid inference approaches. This paper also investigates how to enhance model generalization through transfer learning and improve interpretability via explainable AI techniques.

Although our empirical analysis suggests that introducing multiple reference answers can mitigate this issue, the prohibitive data and computational costs necessitate a strategic shift: prioritizing the mitigation of single-reference overfitting over the costly pursuit of answer diversity. To achieve this, we reveal the intrinsic connection between token probability and semantic importance: high-probability tokens carry the core logical framework, while low-probability tokens are mostly replaceable expressions. Based on this insight, we propose ProFit, which selectively masks low-probability tokens to prevent surface-level overfitting. Extensive experiments confirm that ProFit consistently outperforms traditional SFT baselines on general reasoning and mathematical benchmarks."

We present a deployment-oriented framework that leverages knowledge distillation to translate a high-performing segmentation model into a scalable family of compact student models, without modifying the inference pipeline. The proposed approach preserves architectural compatibility with existing clinical systems while enabling systematic capacity reduction. The framework is evaluated on a multi-site brain MRI dataset comprising 1,104 3D volumes, with independent testing on 101 curated cases, and is further examined on abdominal CT to assess cross-modality generalizability. Under aggressive parameter reduction (94%), the distilled student model preserves nearly all of the teacher's segmentation accuracy (98.7%), while achieving substantial efficiency gains, including up to a 67% reduction in CPU inference latency without additional deployment overhead. These results demonstrate that knowledge distillation provides a practical and reliable pathway for converting research-grade segmentation models into maintainable, deployment-ready components for on-premises clinical workflows in real-world health systems."

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), especially Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reduces this cost by updating only a small number of parameters. We show that the standard LoRA update $ΔW = BA^\\top$ has geometric drawbacks: gauge freedom, scale ambiguity, and a tendency toward rank collapse. We introduce OrthoGeoLoRA, which enforces an SVD-like form $ΔW = BΣA^\\top$ by constraining the low-rank factors to be orthogonal (Stiefel manifold). A geometric reparameterization implements this constraint while remaining compatible with standard optimizers such as Adam and existing fine-tuning pipelines. We also propose a benchmark for hierarchical concept retrieval over the European Language Social Science Thesaurus (ELSST), widely used to organize social science resources in digital repositories. Experiments with a multilingual sentence encoder show that OrthoGeoLoRA outperforms standard LoRA and several strong PEFT variants on ranking metrics under the same low-rank budget, offering a more compute- and parameter-efficient path to adapt foundation models in resource-constrained settings."

To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel pruning method, $D^2Prune$. First, we propose a dual Taylor expansion-based method that jointly models weight and activation perturbations for precise error estimation, leading to precise pruning mask selection and weight updating and facilitating error minimization during pruning. % Second, we propose an attention-aware dynamic update strategy that preserves the long-tail attention pattern by jointly minimizing the KL divergence of attention distributions and the reconstruction error. Extensive experiments show that $D^2Prune$ consistently outperforms SOTA methods across various LLMs (e.g., OPT-125M, LLaMA2/3, and Qwen3).

Across 2,463 configurations in seven domains, we show that stability and similarity are empirically uncorrelated ($ρ\\approx 0.01$) and mechanistically distinct: similarity metrics collapse after removing the top principal components, while stability retains sensitivity to fine-grained manifold structure. This distinction yields actionable insights: for safety monitoring, stability acts as a functional geometric canary, detecting structural drift nearly 2$\\times$ more sensitively than CKA while filtering out the non-functional noise that triggers false alarms in rigid distance metrics; for controllability, supervised stability predicts linear steerability ($ρ= 0.89$-$0.96$); for model selection, stability dissociates from transferability, revealing a geometric tax that transfer optimization incurs. Beyond machine learning, stability predicts CRISPR perturbation coherence and neural-behavioral coupling.

Using a spatially covariant action written in terms of the ADM variables, we impose degeneracy and consistency conditions that ensure the propagation of only one scalar and two tensor degrees of freedom. The resultant theories extend the generalized disformal Horndeski and U-DHOST theories. We discuss the transformation properties of these theories under generalized disformal transformations."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate potential to estimate the probability of uncertain events, by leveraging their extensive knowledge and reasoning capabilities. This ability can be applied to support intelligent decision-making across diverse fields, such as financial forecasting and preventive healthcare. However, directly prompting LLMs for probability estimation faces significant challenges: their outputs are often noisy, and the underlying predicting process is opaque. In this paper, we propose PRISM: Probability Reconstruction via Shapley Measures, a framework that brings transparency and precision to LLM-based probability estimation. PRISM decomposes an LLM's prediction by quantifying the marginal contribution of each input factor using Shapley values. These factor-level contributions are then aggregated to reconstruct a calibrated final estimate. In our experiments, we demonstrate PRISM improves predictive accuracy over direct prompting and other baselines, across multiple domains including finance, healthcare, and agriculture. Beyond performance, PRISM provides a transparent prediction pipeline: our case studies visualize how individual factors shape the final estimate, helping build trust in LLM-based decision support systems."

Unlike prior work on stereotypical or representational bias, this paper studies identity-dependent degradation of core response quality. We show empirically that such degradation arises from biased generation behavior, despite factual knowledge being robustly encoded across identities. Motivated by this mismatch, we propose a lightweight, training-free framework for identity-robust generation that selectively neutralizes non-critical identity information while preserving semantically essential attributes, thus maintaining output content integrity. Experiments across four benchmarks and 18 sociodemographic identities demonstrate an average 77% reduction in identity-dependent bias compared to vanilla prompting and a 45% reduction relative to prompt-based defenses. Our work addresses a critical gap in mitigating the impact of user identity cues in prompts on core generation quality."

    "abstract": "Superconductivity in three dimensions is almost universally governed by Ginzburg-Landau mean field theory, with critical fluctuations typically confined to within a few percent of the transition temperature ($T_{\\rm c}$). We report that the heavy-Fermion superconductor UTe$_2$ exhibits a fluctuation regime that extends over a temperature range as wide as $T_{\\rm c}$ itself -- the largest observed for any three-dimensional superconductor. Through ultrasound measurements of the elastic moduli and sound attenuation, we find that UTe$_2$ transitions from a mean-field-like state at ambient pressure to a fluctuation dominated state at higher pressures. This regime is marked by elastic softening and an increase in sound attenuation that onsets well above $T_{\\rm c}$, with the attenuation remaining anomalously high deep in the superconducting state. Our analysis shows that these features stem from an extremely low superfluid phase stiffness. This results in a kinetic inductance as high as that of granular aluminum, but achieved in the clean limit. We propose that this exotic state is driven by dominant inter-band pairing mediated by ferromagnetic fluctuations, leading to \"local\" cooper pairs with a coherence length of only a few lattice constants."

    "abstract": "Over-the-air computation (AirComp) is a key enabler for distributed optimization, since it leverages analog waveform superposition to perform aggregation and thereby mitigates the communication bottleneck caused by iterative information exchange. However, AirComp is sensitive to wireless environment and conventional systems with fixed single-polarized base-station arrays cannot fully exploit spatial degrees of freedom while also suffering from polarization mismatch. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-cell cooperative air-computation framework assisted by dual-polarized movable antennas (D-PMA), and formulates a mean squared error (MSE) minimization problem by jointly optimizing the combining matrix, polarization vectors, antenna positions, and user transmit coefficients. The resulting problem is highly nonconvex, so an alternating algorithm is developed in which closed-form updates are obtained for the combining matrix and transmit coefficients. Then a method based on successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) is proposed to refine polarization vectors, and the antenna positions are updated using a gradient-based method. In addition, we develop a statistical-channel-based scheme for optimizing the antenna locations, and we further present the corresponding algorithm to efficiently obtain the solution. Numerical results show that the proposed movable dual-polarized scheme consistently outperforms movable single-polarized and fixed-antenna baselines under both instantaneous and statistical channels."

We introduce SkinFlow, a framework that treats diagnosis as an optimization of visual information transmission efficiency. Our approach utilizes a Virtual-Width Dynamic Vision Encoder (DVE) to \"unfold\" complex pathological manifolds without physical parameter expansion, coupled with a two-stage Reinforcement Learning strategy. This strategy sequentially aligns explicit medical descriptions (Stage I) and reconstructs implicit diagnostic textures (Stage II) within a constrained semantic space. Furthermore, we propose a clinically grounded evaluation protocol that prioritizes diagnostic safety and hierarchical relevance over rigid label matching. Empirical results are compelling: our 7B model establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Fitzpatrick17k benchmark, achieving a +12.06% gain in Top-1 accuracy and a +28.57% boost in Top-6 accuracy over the massive general-purpose models (e.g., Qwen3VL-235B and GPT-5.2). These findings demonstrate that optimizing geometric capacity and information flow yields superior diagnostic reasoning compared to raw parameter scaling."

Various Gaussian envelope pulses are considered in regimes where the incident angle is below that needed for total internal reflection. While the reflected pulse retains its overall Gaussian shape, the transmitted pulse exhibits a combination of a Gaussian envelope along with Huygen-like emitted wave fronts from the collision point of the initial pulse with the infinite dielectric interface. The strength of these Huygen wavefronts depends on the width of the incident pulse."

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) infrastructure faces two compounding crises. Compute payload - the unsustainable energy and capital costs of training and inference - threatens to outpace grid capacity and concentrate capability among a handful of organizations. Data chaos - the 80% of project effort consumed by preparation, conversion, and preprocessing - strangles development velocity and locks datasets to single model architectures. Current approaches treat these as separate problems, managing each with incremental optimization while increasing ecosystem complexity. This paper presents ServaStack: a universal data format (.serva) paired with a universal AI compute engine (Chimera). The .serva format achieves lossless compression by encoding information using laser holography principles, while Chimera converts compute operations into a representational space where computation occurs directly on .serva files without decompression. The result is automatic data preprocessing. The Chimera engine enables any existing model to operate on .serva data without retraining, preserving infrastructure investments while revamping efficiency. Internal benchmarks demonstrate 30-374x energy efficiency improvements (96-99% reduction), 4x-34x lossless storage compression, and 68x compute payload reduction without accuracy loss when compared to RNN, CNN, and MLP models on FashionMNIST and MNIST datasets. At hyperscale with one billion daily iterations, these gains translate to $4.85M savings per petabyte per training cycle. When any data flows to any model on any hardware, the AI development paradigm shifts. The bottleneck moves from infrastructure to imagination."

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Navigation aims to enable agents to navigate to a target location based on language instructions. Traditional VLN often follows a close-set assumption, i.e., training and test data share the same style of the input images and instructions. However, the real world is open and filled with various unseen environments, posing enormous difficulties for close-set methods. To this end, we focus on the General Scene Adaptation (GSA-VLN) task, aiming to learn generalized navigation ability by introducing diverse environments and inconsistent intructions.Towards this task, when facing unseen environments and instructions, the challenge mainly lies in how to enable the agent to dynamically produce generalized strategies during the navigation process. Recent research indicates that by means of fast and slow cognition systems, human beings could generate stable policies, which strengthen their adaptation for open world. Inspired by this idea, we propose the slow4fast-VLN, establishing a dynamic interactive fast-slow reasoning framework. The fast-reasoning module, an end-to-end strategy network, outputs actions via real-time input. It accumulates execution records in a history repository to build memory. The slow-reasoning module analyze the memories generated by the fast-reasoning module. Through deep reflection, it extracts experiences that enhance the generalization ability of decision-making. These experiences are structurally stored and used to continuously optimize the fast-reasoning module. Unlike traditional methods that treat fast-slow reasoning as independent mechanisms, our framework enables fast-slow interaction. By leveraging the experiences from slow reasoning. This interaction allows the system to continuously adapt and efficiently execute navigation tasks when facing unseen scenarios."

Our main result shows that complexity-theoretic lower bounds have dynamical consequences: if a system admits a telic problem for which every decider runs in time $2^{Ω(n)}$, then it must have positive topological entropy. This result and others lead to methods for classifying dynamical systems through proving bounds on the runtime of algorithms solving their associated telic problems, or by constructing polynomial-time reductions between telic problems coming from distinct dynamical systems."

    "abstract": "Accurately localizing and segmenting relevant objects from optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) is critical for advancing remote sensing applications. Existing methods are typically built upon moderate-scale pre-trained models and employ diverse optimization strategies to achieve promising performance under full-parameter fine-tuning. In fact, deeper and larger-scale foundation models can provide stronger support for performance improvement. However, due to their massive number of parameters, directly adopting full-parameter fine-tuning leads to pronounced training difficulties, such as excessive GPU memory consumption and high computational costs, which result in extremely limited exploration of large-scale models in existing works. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic wavelet expert-guided fine-tuning paradigm with fewer trainable parameters, dubbed WEFT, which efficiently adapts large-scale foundation models to ORSIs segmentation tasks by leveraging the guidance of wavelet experts. Specifically, we introduce a task-specific wavelet expert extractor to model wavelet experts from different perspectives and dynamically regulate their outputs, thereby generating trainable features enriched with task-specific information for subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we construct an expert-guided conditional adapter that first enhances the fine-grained perception of frozen features for specific tasks by injecting trainable features, and then iteratively updates the information of both types of feature, allowing for efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that our WEFT not only outperforms 21 state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three ORSIs datasets, but also achieves optimal results in camouflage, natural, and medical scenarios.

While proton emission has been relatively well studied, experimental data on composite charged particles remain limited, especially in the low-energy region for alpha particles. Purpose: This work aims to measure comprehensive energy spectra of charged particles emitted following muNC on silicon and to provide experimental constraints on theoretical models of charged-particle emission. Method: An experiment was performed at the RIKEN-RAL Muon Facility. Charged particles were identified using DeltaE-E telescopes and digital pulse-shape analysis with nTD-Si detectors. The initial energy spectra were reconstructed through an unfolding procedure and compared with calculations based on the microscopic and evaporation model (MEM) and the PHITS code with surface coalescence and meson-exchange-current extensions. Results: Energy spectra of protons, deuterons, tritons, and alpha particles were extracted over a broad energy range. In particular, the low-energy alpha-particle spectrum was measured for the first time. Proton spectra are reasonably reproduced by both MEM and PHITS. For alpha particles, the low-energy evaporation component is described by both models, while discrepancies remain at higher energies. For deuterons and tritons, MEM reproduces the spectral shapes well, whereas PHITS significantly underestimates the yields, especially at high energies. Conclusion: The results demonstrate clear particle-species-dependent differences in charged-particle emission following muNC. The measured energy spectra provide important constraints on preequilibrium and evaporation processes and indicate the need for improved modeling of composite-particle emission."

Conventional approaches typically rely on event-specific models and explicit analytical formulations, which limits their adaptability and generalization across previously unseen disturbances. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes DScheLLM, a dynamic scheduling approach that leverages fine-tuned large language models within a dual-system (fast-slow) reasoning architecture to address disturbances of different scales. A unified large language model-based framework is constructed to handle dynamic events, where training datasets for both fast and slow reasoning modes are generated using exact schedules obtained from an operations research solver. The Huawei OpenPangu Embedded-7B model is subsequently fine-tuned under the hybrid reasoning paradigms using LoRA. Experimental evaluations on standard job shop scheduling benchmarks demonstrate that the fast-thinking mode can efficiently generate high-quality schedules and the slow-thinking mode can produce solver-compatible and well-formatted decision inputs. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents one of the earliest studies applying large language models to job shop scheduling in dynamic environments, highlighting their considerable potential for intelligent and adaptive scheduling optimization."

It achieves SOTA performance among open-source models of comparable scale across challenging benchmarks in mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation -- even outperforming several larger models. We begin by critically reexamining a widely adopted distillation paradigm in the community: SFT on teacher-generated responses, also known as sequence-level distillation. Although a series of recent works following this scheme have demonstrated remarkable efficiency and strong empirical performance, they are primarily grounded in the SFT perspective. Consequently, these approaches focus predominantly on designing heuristic rules for SFT data filtering, while largely overlooking the core principle of distillation itself -- enabling the student model to learn the teacher's full output distribution so as to inherit its generalization capability. Specifically, we identify three critical limitations in current practice: i) Inadequate representation of the teacher's sequence-level distribution; ii) Misalignment between the teacher's output distribution and the student's learning capacity; and iii) Exposure bias arising from teacher-forced training versus autoregressive inference. In summary, these shortcomings reflect a systemic absence of explicit teacher-student interaction throughout the distillation process, leaving the essence of distillation underexploited. To address these issues, we propose several methodological innovations that collectively form an enhanced sequence-level distillation training pipeline. Remarkably, DASD-4B-Thinking obtains competitive results using only 448K training samples -- an order of magnitude fewer than those employed by most existing open-source efforts.

This \"quasi-snapshot\" of the star's nature almost immediately prior to explosion is unprecedented. The RSG varied in brightness, and we posit that it could have been a pulsating variable, possibly with a long period of ~660 days. The largest uncertainty is the host-galaxy distance, which we establish to be 10.73+/-1.76 Mpc. The star was also heavily extinguished by interstellar dust internal to the host, with visual extinction A_V(host)~1.7 mag (total A_V(tot)~1.8 mag). Dust radiative-transfer modeling reveals the star's circumstellar medium to be quite dusty and silicate-rich, yielding a bolometric luminosity log(L_bol/L_Sun)=5.08+/-0.16 and a cool effective temperature T_eff=2100--2500 K. The available HST optical data had no bearing on the shape of the candidate's observed spectral energy distribution -- for the first time, without the archival JWST observations we would not have been able to detect and characterize the candidate at all.

Empirical analysis of large-scale human preference datasets shows that most comparisons fall into this diffuse regime, exhibiting small preference margins that require far more judgments than typically collected, even in well-sampled comparisons. These limits persist across evaluation protocols and modalities, including chat, image generation, and code generation with execution feedback. In contrast, curated benchmarks that reduce prompt induced variability systematically induce larger margins and improve detectability through a $1.5\\times$ reduction in prompt-level variance. Our results show that inconclusive or negative human evaluation outcomes frequently reflect underpowered evaluation rather than model equivalence, underscoring the need to account explicitly for effect size, budget, and protocol design."

Our approach implements dense video sampling to maximize spatiotemporal information utilization. We introduce a temporally propagating spatiotemporal token to guide per-frame feature extraction. To ensure comprehensive target state representation, we disign the Multi-frame Information Fusion Module (MFIFM), which augments current dependencies using historical context. The MFIFM operates on features stored in our constructed Spatiotemporal Token Maintainer (STM), where a quality-based update mechanism ensures information reliability. Considering the scale variation among tracking targets, we develop a multi-scale prediction head to dynamically adapt to objects of different sizes. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results across six benchmarks. Notably, on GOT-10k, STDTrack rivals certain high-performance non-real-time trackers (e.g., MixFormer) while operating at 192 FPS(GPU) and 41 FPS(CPU)."

We establish the convergence of the trigonometric polynomial to the volatility's path in a setting that includes the following aspects. First, the volatility is required to satisfy a mild integrability condition, but otherwise allowed to be unbounded. Second, the price process is assumed to have cadlag paths, not necessarily continuous. We obtain convergence rates for the probability of a bad approximation in estimated coefficients, with a speed that allow to obtain an almost sure convergence and not just in probability in the estimated reconstruction of the volatility's path. This is a new result even in the setting of continuous paths. We prove that a rescaled trigonometric polynomial approximate the quadratic jump process."

In this paper, we applied PRIISM imaging to ALMA archival Band 6 continuum data of the circumstellar disk around the Class I protostar CrA IRS 2, located in the Corona Australis molecular cloud, which is associated with an extended gas ring attributed to magnetic flux advection driven by interchange instability. The dust continuum image with 1.5 times higher spatial resolution than conventional imaging revealed, for the first time, the early-phase circumstellar disk with both inner central hole and outer ring-gap structures, making CrA IRS 2 the youngest system exhibiting such features based on the bolometric temperature of $T_{\\rm bol}$=235 K. To examine planet-disk interaction as one possible origin of the outer ring-gap structure, we found the measured depth and width to be consistent with planet-disk interaction models, suggesting the existence of a giant planet with a mass of 0.1-1.8 $M_{\\rm Jup}$. The additional mechanism required for rapid planet formation could be the magnetic flux dissipation driven by the interchange instability, which suppresses MRI-driven turbulence and extends the dead zone, allowing efficient dust growth and the early formation of planets. This system thus provides new insight into how substructures and planet formation can emerge during the early, accreting phase of disk evolution."

    "abstract": "Exciton-polaritons are light-matter hybrid quasi-particles that have emerged as a flexible platform for developing quantum technologies and engineering material properties. However, the fundamental mechanistic principles that govern their dynamics and relaxation remain elusive. In this work, we provide the microscopic mechanistic understanding of the exciton-polariton relaxation process that follows from an excitation in the upper polariton. Using both mixed quantum-classical simulations and analytical analysis, we reveal that phonon-induced upper-to-lower polariton relaxation proceeds via two steps: the first step is a vertical inter-band transition from the upper to the lower polariton, which is followed by a second step that is a phonon-induced Fröhlich scattering within the lower polariton. We find that in materials of finite thickness (which include filled cavities), phonon-induced polaritonic intraband Fröhlich scattering is significantly suppressed. We show that the microscopic origin of this suppression is phonon-fluctuations synchronization (or self-averaging) due to the polaritonic spatial delocalization in the quantization direction. Finally, we show that the same phonon fluctuation-synchronization effect plays a central role across polaritonic relaxation pathways, and we derive simple analytical expressions that relate a material's finite thickness to the corresponding relaxation rate constants."

We investigate such pre-SN eruptions using \\texttt{SNEC} hydrodynamic simulations and realistic stellar models, parameterizing the nuclear energy deposition as a fraction of the binding energy of the combined He layer and H-rich envelope. For the lowest-mass model (9 $M_\\odot$), the ejecta mass ($M_{\\rm ej}$) scales with the energy gained by the H-rich envelope via a power law (index$\\sim$3.5). Across 9-10 $M_\\odot$, this relation shows limited scatter within a factor of $\\sim$2.6, enabling an estimation of the gained energy from $M_{\\rm ej}$. The shock passage also flattens the bound envelope, which can affect the SN light curve morphology and provide another diagnostic for the eruption. Then, we compute the associated precursor light curves for the 9 $M_\\odot$ model with the multi-group radiative-transfer code \\texttt{STELLA}. These signals are typically faint, with bolometric luminosities of $\\sim10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ lasting hundreds of days. Their cool black-body spectra make them brighter in the infrared, yet several magnitudes fainter than observed pre-SN precursors at the threshold for full envelope ejection. To aid future studies, we make our post-eruption stellar profiles and precursor light curves publicly available."

This proposes a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS)-aided E2E multi-path uplink(UL) transmission architecture that explicitly accounts for both radio link latency and N3 backhaul latency, via the coupled designs of the UL traffic-splitting ratio, transmit power, receive combining, and RIS phase shift under practical constraints to achieve the minimum average E2E latency. We develop an alternating optimization framework that updates the above target parameters to be optimized.

    "abstract": "Relativistic magnetic reconnection is a key mechanism for dissipating magnetic energy and accelerating particles in astrophysics. In the absence of radiative cooling, recent particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations have shown that high-energy particles gain most of their energy in the upstream region, during a short-lived \"free phase\" where they meander between the two sides of the layer; when they get captured/trapped by the downstream flux ropes, they undergo a \"trapped phase\", where no significant energization occurs. Here, we perform a suite of 3D PIC simulations of relativistic reconnection including inverse Compton (IC) losses in the weakly cooled regime in which the radiation-reaction-limited Lorentz factor $γ_{\\rm rad}$ exceeds the magnetization $σ$. We show that electron cooling losses do not appreciably alter the reconnection rate, the structure of the layer, and the physics of particle acceleration in the free phase, so the spectrum of free electrons is $dN_{\\rm free}/dγ\\propto γ^{-1}$, as in the uncooled case. The spectrum of trapped electrons above the cooling break $γ_{\\rm cool}$ (in the range $γ_{\\rm cool}<γ<γ_{\\rm rad}$) is $dN/dγ\\propto γ^{-3}$, steeper than the scaling $dN/dγ\\propto γ^{-2}$ of uncooled simulations. This confirms that no significant particle energization occurs during the trapped phase. Our results validate the model by arXiv:2302.12269 for particle acceleration in 3D relativistic reconnection, and imply that radiative emission models of reconnection-powered astrophysical sources should employ a two-zone structure, that differentiates between free, rapidly accelerating particles and trapped, passively cooling particles."

A key challenge is learning representations that are robust to nuisance variation such as gender while remaining tone-aware for different lexical meanings. To address this, we propose SITA, a lightweight adaptation recipe that enforces Speaker-Invariance and Tone-Awareness for pretrained wav2vec-style encoders. SITA uses staged multi-objective training: (i) a cross-gender contrastive objective encourages lexical consistency across speakers, while a tone-repulsive loss prevents tone collapse by explicitly separating same-word different-tone realizations; and (ii) an auxiliary Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based ASR objective with distillation stabilizes recognition-relevant structure. We evaluate primarily on Hmong, a highly tonal and severely under-resourced language where off-the-shelf multilingual encoders fail to represent tone effectively. On a curated Hmong word corpus, SITA improves cross-gender lexical retrieval accuracy, while maintaining usable ASR accuracy relative to an ASR-adapted XLS-R teacher. We further observe similar gains when transferring the same recipe to Mandarin, suggesting SITA is a general, plug-in approach for adapting multilingual speech encoders to tonal languages."

Organizations successfully implement XR in isolated pilots, yet struggle to scale these into sustained operational deployment, a phenomenon we characterize as the ``Pilot Trap.'' This study examines this phenomenon through a qualitative ecosystem analysis of 17 expert interviews across technology providers, solution integrators, and industrial adopters. We identify a ``Great Inversion'' in adoption barriers: critical constraints have shifted from technological maturity to organizational readiness (e.g., change management, key performance indicator alignment, and political resistance). While hardware ergonomics and usability remain relevant, our findings indicate that systemic misalignments between stakeholder incentives are the primary cause of friction preventing enterprise integration. We conclude that successful industrial XR adoption requires a shift from technology-centric piloting to a problem-first, organizational transformation approach, necessitating explicit ecosystem-level coordination."

Each of the 240 sentences was paired with 40 interpretive questions, and both humans and LLMs rated these sentences on a 10-point Likert scale. Results indicated that humans and LLMs aligned at the surface level with humans, but diverged significantly at the representational level, especially in interpreting figurative sentences involving idioms and Gen Z slang. GPT-4 most closely approximates human representational patterns, while all models struggle with context-dependent and socio-pragmatic expressions like sarcasm, slang, and idiomacy."

Using general constraints and matching to numerical data, we formulate a bootstrap problem that determines their multiplicities. This procedure yields a precise asymptotic expansion of the one-loop amplitude at high energies. The resulting oscillatory contributions lead to a much richer high-energy behavior than that predicted by the original Gross-Mende analysis."

A central limitation is that numbers are processed as symbolic tokens whose embeddings do not explicitly encode numerical value, leading to systematic errors. We introduce a value-aware numerical representation that augments standard tokenized inputs with a dedicated prefix token whose embedding is explicitly conditioned on the underlying numerical value. This mechanism injects magnitude information directly into the model's input space while remaining compatible with existing tokenizers and decoder-only Transformer architectures. Evaluation on arithmetic tasks shows that the proposed approach outperforms baselines across numerical formats, tasks, and operand lengths. These results indicate that explicitly encoding numerical value is an effective and efficient way to improve fundamental numerical robustness in language models."

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced code generation, though their efficiency is still impacted by certain inherent architectural constraints. Each token generation necessitates a complete inference pass, requiring persistent retention of contextual information in memory and escalating resource consumption. While existing research prioritizes inference-phase optimizations such as prompt compression and model quantization, the generation phase remains underexplored. To tackle these challenges, we propose a knowledge-infused framework named ShortCoder, which optimizes code generation efficiency while preserving semantic equivalence and readability. In particular, we introduce: (1) ten syntax-level simplification rules for Python, derived from AST-preserving transformations, achieving 18.1% token reduction without functional compromise; (2) a hybrid data synthesis pipeline integrating rule-based rewriting with LLM-guided refinement, producing ShorterCodeBench, a corpus of validated tuples of original code and simplified code with semantic consistency; (3) a fine-tuning strategy that injects conciseness awareness into the base LLMs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ShortCoder consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on HumanEval, achieving an improvement of 18.1%-37.8% in generation efficiency over previous methods while ensuring the performance of code generation."

    "abstract": "Modern video generative models based on diffusion models can produce very realistic clips, but they are computationally inefficient, often requiring minutes of GPU time for just a few seconds of video. This inefficiency poses a critical barrier to deploying generative video in applications that require real-time interactions, such as embodied AI and VR/AR. This paper explores a new strategy for camera-conditioned video generation of static scenes: using diffusion-based generative models to generate a sparse set of keyframes, and then synthesizing the full video through 3D reconstruction and rendering. By lifting keyframes into a 3D representation and rendering intermediate views, our approach amortizes the generation cost across hundreds of frames while enforcing geometric consistency. We further introduce a model that predicts the optimal number of keyframes for a given camera trajectory, allowing the system to adaptively allocate computation. Our final method, SRENDER, uses very sparse keyframes for simple trajectories and denser ones for complex camera motion. This results in video generation that is more than 40 times faster than the diffusion-based baseline in generating 20 seconds of video, while maintaining high visual fidelity and temporal stability, offering a practical path toward efficient and controllable video synthesis."

We introduce the Empathy Applicability Framework (EAF), a theory-driven approach that classifies patient queries in terms of the applicability of emotional reactions and interpretations, based on clinical, contextual, and linguistic cues. We release a benchmark of real patient queries, dual-annotated by Humans and GPT-4o. In the subset with human consensus, we also observe substantial human-GPT alignment. To validate EAF, we train classifiers on human-labeled and GPT-only annotations to predict empathy applicability, achieving strong performance and outperforming the heuristic and zero-shot LLM baselines. Error analysis highlights persistent challenges: implicit distress, clinical-severity ambiguity, and contextual hardship, underscoring the need for multi-annotator modeling, clinician-in-the-loop calibration, and culturally diverse annotation. EAF provides a framework for identifying empathy needs before response generation, establishes a benchmark for anticipatory empathy modeling, and enables supporting empathetic communication in asynchronous healthcare."

This indicates that cross-correlations between the two types of disorder play no important role in the scaling behavior of $κ$. Consequently, by tuning the self-correlations, it is possible to control how the thermal conductivity scales with the system size. Such control could have potential applications in thermoelectric devices and thermal insulation technologies."

We implemented an approach to model inference that we refer to as variational system identification (VSI) to solve the weak form of the stress equilibrium equation using these full volume displacements. Three constitutive models were used for parameter inference: a neo-Hookean model, a modified Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden (HGO) model with higher-order terms in the first and second invariants, and a reduced polynomial model consisting of terms based on the first, second, and fiber-related invariants. Inferred parameters were further refined using an adjoint-based partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization framework. Our results show that the modified HGO model captures the tendon's deformation mechanisms with reasonable accuracy, while the neo-Hookean model fails to reproduce key internal features, particularly the shear behavior in the injured tendon. Surprisingly, the simplified polynomial model performed comparably to the modified HGO formulation using only three terms. These findings suggest that while current constitutive models do not fully replicate the complex internal mechanics of the tendon, they are capable of capturing key trends in both intact and damaged tissue, using a homogeneous modeling approach. Continued model development is needed to bridge this gap and enable clinical-grade, predictive simulations of tendon injury and repair."

This framework yields a well-defined functional form encompassing the arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic means, among others. In this article, we uncover an elegant connection between two key results of Kolmogorov by showing that the class of regular means can be derived directly from the Kolmogorov superposition theorem. This connection is conceptually appealing and illustrates that the superposition theorem deserves wider recognition in Statistics -- not only because of its link to regular means as shown here, but also due to its influence on the development of neural models and its potential connections with other statistical frameworks. In addition, we establish a stability property of regular means, showing that they vary smoothly under small perturbations of the generator. Finally, we provide insights into a recent universal central limit theorem that applies to the broad class of regular means."

We propose a feed-forward framework that sidesteps these limitations by first fine-tuning a vision-language model to infer material composition and fabric attributes from real images, and then training a lightweight predictor that maps these attributes to the corresponding physical fabric parameters using a small dataset of material-physics measurements. Our approach introduces two new datasets (FTAG and T2P) and delivers simulation-ready garments from a single image without iterative optimization. Experiments show that our estimator achieves superior accuracy in material composition estimation and fabric attribute prediction, and by passing them through our physics parameter estimator, we further achieve higher-fidelity simulations compared to state-of-the-art image-to-garment methods."

It was later extended by Shlossberg to torsion nilpotent groups of class 2. As our main result, we prove the Addition Theorem for endomorphisms of torsion nilpotent groups of arbitrary nilpotency class. As an application, we show that if $G$ is a torsion nilpotent group, then for every $φ\\in \\mathrm{End}(G)$ either the entropy $h(φ)$ is infinite or $h(φ)=\\log(α)$ for some $α\\in\\mathbb N$. We further obtain, for automorphisms of locally finite groups, the Addition Theorem with respect to all terms of the upper central series; in particular, the Addition Theorem holds for automorphisms of $ω$-hypercentral groups. Finally, we establish a reduction principle: if $\\mathfrak X$ is a variety of locally finite groups, then the Addition Theorem for endomorphisms holds in $\\mathfrak X$ if and only if it holds for locally finite groups generated by bounded sets."

    "abstract": "Dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) among multi-operator low Earth orbit (LEO) mega-constellations is essential for coexistence, yet prevailing policies focus almost exclusively on interference mitigation, leaving geographic equity largely unaddressed. This work investigates whether conventional DSS approaches inadvertently exacerbate the rural digital divide. Through large-scale, 3GPP-compliant non-terrestrial network (NTN) simulations with geographically distributed users, we systematically evaluate standard allocation policies. The results uncover a stark and persistent structural bias: SNR-priority scheduling induces a 1.65x urban-rural access disparity, privileging users with favorable satellite geometry. Counter-intuitively, increasing system bandwidth amplifies rather than alleviates this gap, with disparity rising from 1.0x to 1.65x as resources expand. To remedy this, we propose FairShare, a lightweight, quota-based framework that enforces geographic fairness. FairShare not only reverses the bias, achieving an affirmative disparity ratio of Delta_geo = 0.72x, but also reduces scheduler runtime by 3.3%. This demonstrates that algorithmic fairness can be achieved without trading off efficiency or complexity. Our work provides regulators with both a diagnostic metric for auditing fairness and a practical, enforceable mechanism for equitable spectrum governance in next-generation satellite networks."

Nonetheless, challenges remain, especially in the area of ancestry inference. This paper is a comprehensive review of ARG samplers that have emerged in the past three decades to meet the need for scalable and flexible ancestry simulation and inference solutions. It specifically focuses on their performance, usability, and the biological realism of the underlying algorithm, and aims primarily to provide a technical overview of the field for researchers seeking to write their own coalescent-with-recombination sampler.

    "abstract": "Quantum Field Theory (QFT) introduced us to the notion that a causal diamond in space-time corresponded to a subsystem of a quantum mechanical system defined on the global space-time. Work by Jacobson, Fischler and Susskind, and particularly Bousso suggested that, in the quantum theory of gravity, this subsystem should have a density matrix of finite entropy. These authors formalized older intuitive arguments based on black hole physics. Although mathematically, Type II von Neumann algebras admit finite entropy density matrices, the black hole arguments suggest that the number of physical states in these subsystems is finite. The conjecture that de Sitter (dS) space has a finite number of physical states was first made by Fischler and one of the present authors. Leutheusser and Liu showed that, in the $N = \\infty$ limit, causal diamonds with finite area in AdS radius units had Type $III_1$ von Neumann sub-algebras of the full operator algebra. They claimed that this was true for finite values of the UV cutoff, and that the algebra was the algebra of bulk local fields in the diamond. We will argue that the second part of this conjecture is incorrect and that the bulk field algebra emerges only in a double scaled limit, where the boundary UV cutoff is taken to infinity as $N$ is taken to infinity. There is never a bulk field theory description that resolves distances smaller than the AdS radius."

    "abstract": "Accurate and early perception of potential intrusion targets is essential for ensuring the safety of railway transportation systems. However, most existing systems focus narrowly on object classification within fixed visual scopes and apply rule-based heuristics to determine intrusion status, often overlooking targets that pose latent intrusion risks. Anticipating such risks requires the cognition of spatial context and temporal dynamics for the object of interest (OOI), which presents challenges for conventional visual models. To facilitate deep intrusion perception, we introduce a novel benchmark, CogRail, which integrates curated open-source datasets with cognitively driven question-answer annotations to support spatio-temporal reasoning and prediction. Building upon this benchmark, we conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art visual-language models (VLMs) using multimodal prompts to identify their strengths and limitations in this domain. Furthermore, we fine-tune VLMs for better performance and propose a joint fine-tuning framework that integrates three core tasks, position perception, movement prediction, and threat analysis, facilitating effective adaptation of general-purpose foundation models into specialized models tailored for cognitive intrusion perception. Extensive experiments reveal that current large-scale multimodal models struggle with the complex spatial-temporal reasoning required by the cognitive intrusion perception task, underscoring the limitations of existing foundation models in this safety-critical domain. In contrast, our proposed joint fine-tuning framework significantly enhances model performance by enabling targeted adaptation to domain-specific reasoning demands, highlighting the advantages of structured multi-task learning in improving both accuracy and interpretability.

In this study, we assess the accuracy of the eikonal and post-Kerr approximations in predicting the quasinormal mode spectrum of a scalar field on a deformed Kerr spacetime. To obtain benchmark results and to analyze the ringdown dynamics from generic perturbations, we further employ a 2+1-dimensional numerical time-evolution framework. This approach enables a systematic quantification of theoretical uncertainties across multiple angular harmonics, a broad range of spin parameters, and progressively stronger deviations from the Kerr geometry. We then confront these modeling errors with simple projections of statistical uncertainties in quasinormal mode frequencies as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio, thereby exploring the domain of validity of approximate methods for prospective high-precision black-hole spectroscopy. We also report that near-horizon deformations can affect prograde and retrograde modes differently and provide a geometrical explanation."

    "abstract": "Point cloud registration is a central theme in computer vision, with alignment algorithms continuously improving for greater robustness. Commonly used methods evaluate Euclidean distances between point clouds and minimize an objective function, such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). However, these approaches are most effective when the point clouds are well-prealigned and issues such as differences in density, noise, holes, and limited overlap can compromise the results. Traditional methods, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP), require choosing one point cloud as fixed, since Euclidean distances lack commutativity. When only one point cloud has issues, adjustments can be made, but in real scenarios, both point clouds may be affected, often necessitating preprocessing. The authors introduce a novel differential entropy-based metric, designed to serve as the objective function within an optimization framework for fine rigid pairwise 3D point cloud registration, denoted as Iterative Differential Entropy Minimization (IDEM). This metric does not depend on the choice of a fixed point cloud and, during transformations, reveals a clear minimum corresponding to the best alignment. Multiple case studies are conducted, and the results are compared with those obtained using RMSE, Chamfer distance, and Hausdorff distance. The proposed metric proves effective even with density differences, noise, holes, and partial overlap, where RMSE does not always yield optimal alignment."

Given a pattern P of length m and a text T of length n, the classical task is to decide whether T contains a length-m substring whose Parikh vector equals that of P . While this existence problem admits a linear-time sliding-window solution, many practical applications require optimization and packing variants beyond mere detection. We present a unified sliding-window framework based on maintaining the Parikh-vector difference between P and the current window of T , enabling permutation matching in O(n + σ) time and O(σ) space, where σ = |Σ|. Building on this foundation, we introduce a combinatorial-optimization variant that we call Maximum Feasible Substring under Pattern Supply (MFSP): find the longest substring S of T whose symbol counts are component-wise bounded by those of P . We show that MFSP can also be solved in O(n + σ) time via a two-pointer feasibility maintenance algorithm, providing an exact packing interpretation of P as a resource budget. Finally, we address non-overlapping occurrence selection by modeling each permutation match as an equal-length interval and proving that a greedy earliest-finishing strategy yields a maximum-cardinality set of disjoint matches, computable in linear time once all matches are enumerated. Our results provide concise, provably correct algorithms with tight bounds, and connect frequency-based string matching to packing-style optimization primitives."

However, when time-dependent perturbations, such as crabbing kicks in colliders, are present, a comprehensive 6-D analysis becomes essential to accurately capture the coupling between transverse and longitudinal motions. In this work, we extend the CM method to the full 6-D phase space by employing an eigen-decomposition-based formulation of the square matrix combined with iterative procedures. The proposed 6-D CM approach is first validated using a simplified crabbing map. We demonstrate that the 6-D CM preserves computational efficiency by using only one-turn map, while successfully resolving high-order resonance structures that remain unresolved by conventional frequency map analysis (FMA). This method is subsequently applied to the dynamic aperture (DA) study of the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). The results obtained from the CM analysis exhibit close agreement with those derived from FMA, demonstrating its potential as a powerful tool for nonlinear beam dynamics analysis and DA evaluation, as well as for broader applications in other nonlinear dynamical systems."

This paper develops a tractable non-cooperative model in which artists can purchase fraud activity that generates undetectable fake streams up to a technological limit. We show that pro-rata can be fraud-robust: when fraud technology is weak, honesty is a strict dominant strategy, and an efficient fraud-free equilibrium obtains. When fraud technology is strong, a unique fraud equilibrium arises, yet aggregate fake streams remain bounded. Although fraud is inefficient, the resulting redistribution may improve fairness in some cases. To mitigate fraud without abandoning pro-rata, we introduce a parametric weighted rule that interpolates between pro-rata and user-centric, and characterize parameter ranges that restore a fraud-free equilibrium under technology constraint. We also discuss implications of Spotify's modernized royalty system for fraud incentives."

This is concerning, not least due to the ubiquity of hazard ratios in analyses of time-to-event data.

Nevertheless, alternative measures may be preferable to describe effects of exposures or treatments on time-to-event outcomes."

The magnetic analog of such dynamical stabilization corresponds to saturation of the magnetization against an external field. Here we report dynamical stabilization of the magnetization in thin film bismuth-substituted yttrium iron garnet by spin current injection from an adjacent Pt layer. Magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements demonstrate magnetization reversal against magnetic fields up to 3000 times larger than the film's coercivity once the spin injection surpasses a critical threshold associated with negative damping. Micromagnetic simulations reveal that this process is mediated by the excitation of a large population of incoherent magnons with non-zero wave vector, leading to a transient shortening and subsequent stabilization of the inverted magnetization. The elementary excitations of the high-energy inverted magnetization state are shown to be antimagnons, quasi-particles carrying opposite energy and spin relative to magnons. Our results further reveal how the system's size and minimization of nonlinear magnon scattering processes play a key role in dynamical stabilization, opening new avenues for magnetic state control beyond conventional magnetization switching. Dissipation-driven phase transitions in large-area magnetic systems provide a solid-state platform to study magnonic analogs of relativistic phenomena, such as Klein tunneling and black holes, as well as spin-wave amplification and lasing."

We discuss some general properties of scalar potentials after the scale transformation from the Jordan frame to the Einstein frame. We find that the shape of the resulting scalar potential in the Einstein frame is quite different from that of ordinary single modulus stabilization mechanism.

    "abstract": "The energy transition challenges operational tasks based on simulations and optimisation. These computations need to be fast and flexible as the grid is ever-expanding, and renewables' uncertainty requires a flexible operational environment. Learned approximations, proxies or surrogates -- we refer to them as Neural Solvers -- excel in terms of evaluation speed, but are inflexible with respect to adjusting to changing tasks. Hence, neural solvers are usually applicable to highly specific tasks, which limits their usefulness in practice; a widely reusable, foundational neural solver is required. Therefore, this work proposes the Residual Power Flow (RPF) formulation. RPF formulates residual functions based on Kirchhoff's laws to quantify the infeasibility of an operating condition. The minimisation of the residuals determines the voltage solution; an additional slack variable is needed to achieve AC-feasibility. RPF forms a natural, foundational subtask of tasks subject to power flow constraints. We propose to learn RPF with neural solvers to exploit their speed. Furthermore, RPF improves learning performance compared to common power flow formulations. To solve operational tasks, we integrate the neural solver in a Predict-then-Optimise (PO) approach to combine speed and flexibility. The case study investigates the IEEE 9-bus system and three tasks (AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF), power-flow and quasi-steady state power flow) solved by PO. The results demonstrate the accuracy and flexibility of learning with RPF."

We use the LORENE library to compute the structural parameters at different rotational frequencies in the range of 1100-1300~Hz for a non-magnetized SQS. While there is no minimum limit for the mass of slowly rotating self-bound stars, by computing the maximum rotational frequency, known as the mass-shedding limit, we show that SQS must have a minimum mass to sustain high rotational frequencies. The mass-shedding frequency in our EOS model is lower than that estimated from the MIT bag model EOS with a fixed bag constant. The Keplerian frequency in our model depends linearly on the gravitational mass at the mass-shedding limit (and similarly on the minimum mass) with the slope of 0.08~${\\rm kHz}/M_\\odot$. We obtain mass limits aligned with the observational data for both the heaviest and the lightest observed pulsars."

Treating the DQD not as a spectroscopic element but as a tunable engineered reservoir, we show how gate control of populations, coherences, linewidths, and detuning defines an effective photon birth-death process with predictable detailed balance. This framework yields closed-form expressions for the cavity steady state, identifies cooling bounds and detuning-dependent refrigeration valleys, and clarifies when refrigeration can drive the cavity below both the bath temperature and the DQD setpoint. By distinguishing refreshed (collision-like) and persistent reservoir regimes, we show how memory effects, saturation, and dark-state formation constrain cooling in realistic devices, while collective bright-mode coupling in a two-dot configuration can enhance refrigeration subject to mismatch and dephasing, as confirmed by numerical Lindblad simulations demonstrating targeted millikelvin cavity cooling relevant for cryogenic circuit-QED architectures."

A sophisticated solution is self-evolution techniques. However, in large-scale industrial settings with massive query streams, this technique faces two challenges: (1) informative samples are often sparse and difficult to identify, and (2) pseudo-labels generated by the current model could be unreliable. To address these challenges, in this work, we propose a Self-Evolving Relevance Model approach (SERM), which comprises two complementary multi-agent modules: a multi-agent sample miner, designed to detect distributional shifts and identify informative training samples, and a multi-agent relevance annotator, which provides reliable labels through a two-level agreement framework. We evaluate SERM in a large-scale industrial setting, which serves billions of user requests daily. Experimental results demonstrate that SERM can achieve significant performance gains through iterative self-evolution, as validated by extensive offline multilingual evaluations and online testing."

    "abstract": "To teach robots complex manipulation tasks, it is now a common practice to fine-tune a pre-trained vision-language-action model (VLA) on task-specific data. However, since this recipe updates existing representations, it is unsuitable for long-term operation in the real world, where robots must continually adapt to new tasks and environments while retaining the knowledge they have already acquired. Existing continual learning methods for robotics commonly require storing previous data (exemplars), struggle with long task sequences, or rely on task identifiers for deployment. To address these limitations, we propose CLARE, a general, parameter-efficient framework for exemplar-free continual learning with VLAs. CLARE introduces lightweight modular adapters into selected feedforward layers and autonomously expands the model only where necessary when learning a new task, guided by layer-wise feature similarity. During deployment, an autoencoder-based routing mechanism dynamically activates the most relevant adapters without requiring task labels. Through extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark, we show that CLARE achieves high performance on new tasks without catastrophic forgetting of earlier tasks, significantly outperforming even exemplar-based methods.

In this paper, we extend this framework to Nakajima's $n$-fold affine graded tensor product varieties, which allow one to geometrically realize $n$-fold tensor products of standard modules over the quantum affine algebra. We introduce a category of filtrations with splitting of length $n$ of modules over a category and show that it is equivalent to the module category of a triangular matrix category. Applied to the singular Nakajima category, this yields a category $\\mathcal{S}^{n\\operatorname{-filt}}$ whose modules are parametrized by the points of the $n$-fold tensor product varieties. Generalizing the results of Keller-Scherotzke from $\\mathcal{S}$ to $\\mathcal{S}^{n\\operatorname{-filt}}$, we prove that the stable category of finitely generated Gorenstein projective $\\mathcal{S}^{n\\operatorname{-filt}}$-modules is triangle equivalent to the derived category of the algebra of $n \\times n$ upper triangular matrices over the path algebra of $Q$, and we obtain a corresponding stratification functor."

Our design uses multiple waveguide transverse modes in one resonator, providing flexibility to engineer complex interactions without typical coupling constraints. We demonstrate arbitrary inter-mode coupling through transmissive mode converters, allowing precise tuning of resonance splitting and intrinsic losses. This approach enables selective bright-dark mode pair generation and the exploration of novel photonic phenomena such as exceptional points. This multimode photonic molecule overcomes traditional limitations and offers new possibilities for integrated photonic circuits, optical processing, and studies in non-Hermitian and nonlinear photonics."

In our new model structure, the fibrant objects are the dendroidal Segal spaces, while the cofibrations form a subclass of those in the Segal space model structure. The weak equivalences between fibrant objects are precisely the Dwyer--Kan equivalences, and the fibrations between them are the isofibrations. We prove that this model structure is Quillen equivalent to the Cisinski--Moerdijk model structures on dendroidal sets and dendroidal spaces, thereby establishing a compatible extension of the theory of $\\infty$-categories to the operadic setting."

    "abstract": "Search and recommendation (S&R) are core to online platforms, addressing explicit intent through queries and modeling implicit intent from behaviors, respectively. Their complementary roles motivate a unified modeling paradigm. Early studies to unify S&R adopt shared encoders with task-specific heads, while recent efforts reframe item ranking in both S&R as conditional generation. The latter holds particular promise, enabling end-to-end optimization and leveraging the semantic understanding of LLMs. However, existing methods rely on full fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and limits scalability. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) offers a more practical alternative but faces two critical challenges in unifying S&R: (1) gradient conflicts across tasks due to divergent optimization objectives, and (2) shifts in user intent understanding caused by overfitting to fine-tuning data, which distort general-domain knowledge and weaken LLM reasoning. To address the above issues, we propose Gradient Multi-Subspace Tuning (GEMS), a novel framework that unifies S&R with LLMs while alleviating gradient conflicts and preserving general-domain knowledge. GEMS introduces (1) \\textbf{Multi-Subspace Decomposition}, which disentangles shared and task-specific optimization signals into complementary low-rank subspaces, thereby reducing destructive gradient interference, and (2) \\textbf{Null-Space Projection}, which constrains parameter updates to a subspace orthogonal to the general-domain knowledge space, mitigating shifts in user intent understanding. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that GEMS consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines across both search and recommendation tasks, achieving superior effectiveness."

We present several exact and approximate data structures for supporting counting long aggregated visits, as well as conditional and unconditional lower bounds. First, we describe an exact data structure that exhibits a space-time tradeoff, as well as efficient approximate solutions based on sampling and sketching techniques.

    "abstract": "Model merging enables multiple large language models (LLMs) to be combined into a single model while preserving performance. This makes it a valuable tool in LLM development, offering a competitive alternative to multi-task training. However, merging can be difficult at scale, as successful merging requires choosing the right merge operator, selecting the right models, and merging them in the right order. This often leads researchers to run expensive merge-and-evaluate searches to select the best merge. In this work, we provide an alternative by introducing \\simmerge{}, \\emph{a predictive merge-selection method} that selects the best merge using inexpensive, task-agnostic similarity signals between models. From a small set of unlabeled probes, we compute functional and structural features and use them to predict the performance of a given 2-way merge. Using these predictions, \\simmerge{} selects the best merge operator, the subset of models to merge, and the merge order, eliminating the expensive merge-and-evaluate loop. We demonstrate that we surpass standard merge-operator performance on 2-way merges of 7B-parameter LLMs, and that \\simmerge{} generalizes to multi-way merges and 111B-parameter LLM merges without retraining. Additionally, we present a bandit variant that supports adding new tasks, models, and operators on the fly. Our results suggest that learning how to merge is a practical route to scalable model composition when checkpoint catalogs are large and evaluation budgets are tight."

Linear mixed-effects models and strategy-cluster analyses (ANCOVA-adjusted comparisons) tested associations between feedback use and post-test performance and moderation by representational competence. Elaborated multirepresentational feedback showed a small but consistent positive association with post-test scores independent of prior knowledge and confidence. Learners adopted distinct representation-selection strategies; among students with lower representational competence, using a diverse set of representations related to higher learning, whereas this advantage diminished as competence increased. These findings motivate adaptive feedback designs and inform intelligent tutoring systems capable of tailoring feedback elaboration and representational format to learner profiles, advancing personalized instruction in physics education."

To address this gap, we introduce FairGU, a fairness-aware graph unlearning framework designed to preserve both utility and fairness during the unlearning process. FairGU integrates a dedicated fairness-aware module with effective data protection strategies, ensuring that sensitive attributes are neither inadvertently amplified nor structurally exposed when nodes are removed. Through extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets, we demonstrate that FairGU consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph unlearning methods and fairness-enhanced graph learning baselines in terms of both accuracy and fairness metrics.

    "abstract": "Recent video diffusion models generate photorealistic, temporally coherent videos, yet they fall short as reliable world models for autonomous driving, where structured motion and physically consistent interactions are essential. Adapting these generalist video models to driving domains has shown promise but typically requires massive domain-specific data and costly fine-tuning. We propose an efficient adaptation framework that converts generalist video diffusion models into controllable driving world models with minimal supervision. The key idea is to decouple motion learning from appearance synthesis. First, the model is adapted to predict structured motion in a simplified form: videos of skeletonized agents and scene elements, focusing learning on physical and social plausibility. Then, the same backbone is reused to synthesize realistic RGB videos conditioned on these motion sequences, effectively \"dressing\" the motion with texture and lighting. This two-stage process mirrors a reasoning-rendering paradigm: first infer dynamics, then render appearance. Our experiments show this decoupled approach is exceptionally efficient: adapting SVD, we match prior SOTA models with less than 6% of their compute. Scaling to LTX, our MAD-LTX model outperforms all open-source competitors, and supports a comprehensive suite of text, ego, and object controls.

    "abstract": "Real-time visualization of large-scale volumetric data remains challenging, as direct volume rendering and voxel-based methods suffer from prohibitively high computational cost. We propose Variable Basis Mapping (VBM), a framework that transforms volumetric fields into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations through wavelet-domain analysis. First, we precompute a compact Wavelet-to-Gaussian Transition Bank that provides optimal Gaussian surrogates for canonical wavelet atoms across multiple scales. Second, we perform analytical Gaussian construction that maps discrete wavelet coefficients directly to 3DGS parameters using a closed-form, mathematically principled rule. Finally, a lightweight image-space fine-tuning stage further refines the representation to improve rendering fidelity. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that VBM significantly accelerates convergence and enhances rendering quality, enabling real-time volumetric visualization."

    "abstract": "Osteosarcoma (OS) is an aggressive primary bone malignancy. Accurate histopathological assessment of viable versus non-viable tumor regions after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is critical for prognosis and treatment planning, yet manual evaluation remains labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to inter-observer variability. Recent advances in digital pathology have enabled automated necrosis quantification. Evaluating on test data, independently sampled on patient-level, revealed that the deep learning model performance dropped significantly from the tile-level generalization ability reported in previous studies. First, this work proposes the use of radiomic features as additional input in model training. We show that, despite that they are derived from the images, such a multimodal input effectively improved the classification performance, in addition to its added benefits in interpretability. Second, this work proposes to optimize two binary classification tasks with hierarchical classes (i.e. tumor-vs-non-tumor and viable-vs-non-viable), as opposed to the alternative ``flat'' three-class classification task (i.e. non-tumor, non-viable tumor, viable tumor), thereby enabling a hierarchical loss. We show that such a hierarchical loss, with trainable weightings between the two tasks, the per-class performance can be improved significantly. Using the TCIA OS Tumor Assessment dataset, we experimentally demonstrate the benefits from each of the proposed new approaches and their combination, setting a what we consider new state-of-the-art performance on this open dataset for this application.

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge. Recently, some works have incorporated iterative knowledge accumulation processes into RAG models to progressively accumulate and refine query-related knowledge, thereby constructing more comprehensive knowledge representations. However, these iterative processes often lack a coherent organizational structure, which limits the construction of more comprehensive and cohesive knowledge representations. To address this, we propose PAGER, a page-driven autonomous knowledge representation framework for RAG. PAGER first prompts an LLM to construct a structured cognitive outline for a given question, which consists of multiple slots representing a distinct knowledge aspect. Then, PAGER iteratively retrieves and refines relevant documents to populate each slot, ultimately constructing a coherent page that serves as contextual input for guiding answer generation. Experiments on multiple knowledge-intensive benchmarks and backbone models show that PAGER consistently outperforms all RAG baselines. Further analyses demonstrate that PAGER constructs higher-quality and information-dense knowledge representations, better mitigates knowledge conflicts, and enables LLMs to leverage external knowledge more effectively.

We then introduce twisted and doubly twisted covariant representations of product systems. For doubly twisted isometric representations, we prove the existence of a Wold decomposition, recovering earlier results for doubly commuting representations as special cases. We further obtain explicit descriptions of the resulting Wold summands and develop concrete Fock-type models realizing each component. We present non-trivial examples of these families.

As applications, we obtain unitary extensions for several previously studied classes of operator tuples, including doubly twisted, doubly non-commuting, and doubly commuting isometries, and for a special class of doubly twisted representations of product system."

Of particular interest to areas such as quantum simulation and linear-system solvers are sparse quantum states, which contain only a small number $s$ of non-zero computational basis states compared to a generic state. In this work, we present an approach that prepares $s$-sparse states on $n$ qubits, reducing the number of Toffoli gates required compared to prior art. We work in the established framework of first preparing a dense state on a $\\lceil{\\log(s)}\\rceil$-qubit sub-register, and then mapping this state to the target state via an isometry, with the latter step dominating the cost of the full algorithm. The speed-up is achieved by designing an efficient algorithm for finding and implementing the isometry. The worst-case Toffoli cost of our isometry circuit, which may be viewed as a batched version of an approach by Malvetti et al., is essentially $2s$ for sufficiently large values of $n$, yielding roughly a $\\log(s)/2$ improvement factor over the state-of-the-art. In numerical benchmarks on randomly chosen states, the cost is closer to $s$. With the improved isometry circuit, we examine the dense-state preparation step and present ways to optimize the joint cost of both steps, particularly in the case of target states with purely real coefficients, by outsourcing some sub-tasks from the dense-state preparation to the isometry."

Key ingredients to fulfill this pursuit often include algorithms to identify layer compounds on chips, hard-wares to realize sophisticated operations of motion and/or rotation in a microscale, and, as importantly, highly-standardized and uniform transfer stamps that are often used in picking up layered materials under a microscope. Here, we report a hot-casted-droplet batch fabrication method for polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) templates tailored for dry transfer of 2D materials. Controlled precursor formulation, degassing, and motorized-syringe dispensing produce dome-shaped PDMS templates with ultra-smooth surfaces (root-mean-square roughness about 0.3 nm at relatively low curing temperatures). By tuning the curing temperature, the reproducible and controllable apex curvature allows precisely defined contact area between the organic adhesive film and substrate, via thermal expansion. Our results further reveals thermalmechanical behaviors with different casting parameters of such PDMS domes. This scalable and parameterized fabrication protocol gives rise to uniform transfer-stamps with ultra-smooth surface, which may be beneficial for future AI-driven robotic assembly of 2D material heterostructures."

While this phenomenon has been widely studied, the influence of micellar solute structure remains unexplored. By modifying micellar architecture using a structure forming salt, we uncover a pronounced non monotonic dependence of droplet velocity on salt concentration. Increasing salt simultaneously raises the medium viscosity and drives a transition of micelles from spherical to rod-like or worm like morphologies. Using complementary experiments, we quantify the viscosity and micellar interaction lengthscale as functions of the salt to surfactant ratio and develop a theoretical model that consistently reproduces the measured propulsion speeds. Flow fields around the droplets are characterized by particle image velocimetry. Our results demonstrate that salt surfactant composition governs active droplet propulsion by jointly controlling micellar solute interaction lengthscales and medium viscosity."

Prior studies have demonstrated that LLMs are capable of performing grounding acts such as requesting clarification or producing acknowledgments, yet relatively little work has investigated how common ground can be explicitly represented and stored for later use. Without such mechanisms, it remains unclear whether acknowledgment or clarification behaviors truly reflect a grounded understanding. In this work, we evaluate a model's ability to establish and exploit common ground through relational references to entities within the shared context in a situational dialogue. We test multiple methods for representing common ground in situated dialogues and further propose approaches to improve both the establishment of common ground and its subsequent use in the conversation."

Oversampling and pulse shaping are also discussed in the existing literature, but not in the context of channel estimation. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to address the problem of data-to-pilot and vice versa energy leakage caused by oversampling and pulse shaping in OTFS. Theoretical analysis is performed on an oversampled, pulse-shaped OTFS implementing the embedded pilot channel estimation technique, revealing a trade-off between the amount of energy leakage and excess bandwidth introduced by the pulse shape. Next, a novel variant of OTFS is introduced, called UW-OTFS, which is designed to overcome the leakage problem by placing the pilot in the oversampled time domain instead of the DD domain. The unique structure of UW-OTFS offers 36 percent higher spectral efficiency than the OTFS with embedded pilot. UW-OTFS also outperforms traditional OTFS in terms of bit error ratio and out-of-band emissions."

Among their variants, those that satisfy an additional combinatorial property called inclusiveness form a special class suitable for computationally efficient and highly error-tolerant group testing under the general inhibitor complex model, a broad framework that subsumes practical settings such as DNA screening. Despite this relevance, the asymptotic behavior of the inclusive variant of disjunct matrices has remained largely unexplored. In particular, it was not previously known whether this variant can achieve an asymptotically positive rate, a requirement for scalable group testing designs. In this work, we establish the first nontrivial asymptotic lower bound on the maximum achievable rate of the inclusive variant, which matches the strongest known upper bound up to a logarithmic factor. Our proof is based on the probabilistic method and yields a simple and efficient randomized construction. Furthermore, we derandomize this construction to obtain a deterministic polynomial-time construction. These results clarify the asymptotic potential of robust and scalable group testing under the general inhibitor complex model."

    "abstract": "Large regions of gaseous planets are thought to be stratified with an unstable thermal gradient, but a stabilising gradient of heavy element composition. Fluid in these regions is unstable to semi-convection, with motions driven by differences in the molecular diffusivity of temperature and composition, and could play a role in supporting planetary magnetic fields. Previous studies focus largely on local models in Cartesian boxes; here, we investigate semi-convection in rotating spherical shells. The onset of linear instability shows a transition between the two limits of rotating convection and non-rotating semi-convection. Non-linear simulations evolve into a system of concentric layers of relatively constant density, separated by narrow high-gradient regions. These layers gradually merge, resulting in a statistically steady state dominated by either a single convection region or a narrower convective zone beneath a stably stratified layer (SSL), depending on the strength of the thermal forcing compared to the rotation. When magnetic field generation is considered, our magnetohydrodynamic simulations exhibit self-sustained dynamo action. In cases where the turbulent convective region generates magnetic fields that are smoothed by zonal flows within the overlying SSL, the resulting field is strongly dipolar and axisymmetric, in encouraging agreement with Saturn's observed magnetic field. Within the regimes explored, both the Rossby number and the thickness of the SSL are well predicted by a single combination of control parameters. This enables the identification of a parameter range in which the generated magnetic fields resemble those of planetary dynamos."

The behavior of finite-size systems is traditionally understood to be governed by fundamental oscillatory modes arising from bulk physics and boundary conditions. A paradigmatic example is the particle-in-a-box model introduced with the advent of quantum mechanics, in which confinement leads to discrete resonances and quantized energy levels. Such quantization underpins phenomena including semiconductor quantum dots, where electronic waves are confined in all three spatial dimensions, producing standing-wave modes analogous to the vibrational states of a guitar string. These modes are characterized by integer quantum numbers corresponding to the number of envelope oscillations fitting within the cavity. Recently, counter-intuitive modes have been observed in finite systems with Dirac dispersion, including states that do not oscillate spatially, yet a general theoretical framework for modes in such cavities has been lacking. Here, we discover the phenomenon of arbitrary fractional quantization in wave physics and show that, in finite-size boxes with linear dispersion, the quantum number need not be an integer but can take any real value, including zero. Using Bloch theory in a Dirac-cone photonic crystal with a controllable fractional number of unit cells at its boundaries, we demonstrate continuous control of the cavity-mode envelope wavenumber. We introduce a unified nomenclature for these unconventional modes and derive their corresponding wavefunctions. These counter-intuitive states in open Dirac potentials challenge conventional notions of quantization and open new avenues across wave physics."

Their relatively well-understood design presents a promising test-case for probing principles of biological learning. The circuits' expansive projections have long been modelled as random, enabling effective general purpose pattern separation. However, electron-microscopy studies have discovered interesting hints of structure in both the fly mushroom body and mouse cerebellum. Recent numerical work suggested that this non-random connectivity enables the circuit to prioritise learning of some, presumably natural, tasks over others. Here, rather than numerical results, we present a robust mathematical link between the observed connectivity patterns and the cerebellar circuit's learning ability. In particular, we extend a simplified kernel regression model of the system and use recent machine learning theory results to relate connectivity to learning. We find that the reported structure in the projection weights shapes the network's inductive bias in intuitive ways: functions are easier to learn if they depend on inputs that are oversampled, or on collections of neurons that tend to connect to the same hidden layer neurons. Our approach is analytically tractable and pleasingly simple, and we hope it continues to serve as a model for understanding the functional implications of other processing motifs in cerebellar-like networks."

    "abstract": "The time to first crossing for the Poisson counting process with respect to a linear moving barrier with offset is a classic problem, although key results remain scattered across the literature and their equivalence is often unclear. Here we present a unified and pedagogical treatment of two approaches: the direct time-domain approach based on path-decomposition techniques and the Laplace-domain approach based on the Pollaczek-Spitzer formula. Beyond streamlining existing derivations and establishing their consistency, we leverage the complementary nature of the two methods to obtain new exact analytical results. Specifically, we derive an explicit large deviation function for the first-passage time distribution in the subcritical regime and closed-form expressions for the conditional mean first-passage time for arbitrary offset. Despite its simplicity, this first crossing process exhibits non-trivial critical behavior and provides a rare example where all the main results of interest can be derived exactly."

    "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM) agents deployed in complex real-world scenarios typically operate as spatially distributed entities. However, this physical dispersion constrains agents to limited local perception and finite temporal horizons. We characterize this bottleneck as spatiotemporal partial observability. Given such fragmented awareness, distributed agents struggle to coordinate efficiently. To bridge this gap, we introduce MACRO-LLM, LLM-empowered multi-agent collaborative reasoning under spatiotemporal partial observability. The architecture addresses spatiotemporal constraints via three modules: (1) the CoProposer mitigates temporal uncertainty by verifying candidate actions via predictive rollouts; (2) the Negotiator overcomes spatial myopia by resolving conflicts through mean-field statistical aggregation; and (3) the Introspector ensures continuous adaptation by analyzing historical experience to refine strategies via semantic gradient descent. Extensive evaluations on two complex long-horizon tasks, cooperative adaptive cruise control and pandemic control, demonstrate that our framework effectively mitigates spatiotemporal partial observability through spatial and temporal strategies, enabling robust coordination."

DMK-MC computes the energy change and, upon acceptance, updates the stored incoming plane-wave fields with $O(1)$ work per tree level, yielding an overall $O(\\log N)$ expected work per trial move for fixed accuracy. The method decomposes the Coulomb kernel into three components: a global, periodized smooth part; a multilevel sequence of smooth difference kernels whose interactions are restricted to same-level colleague boxes; and a singular residual kernel whose short-range interactions are evaluated directly. Benchmarks on uniform, highly nonuniform, and implicit-solvent electrolyte and colloidal configurations show that DMK-MC consistently outperforms a recent FMM-based $O(\\log N)$ Monte Carlo method, delivering several-fold speedups at comparable tolerances."

    "abstract": "The IEC 61850 Generic Object-Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) protocol plays a critical role in real-time protection and automation of digital substations, yet its lack of native security mechanisms can expose power systems to sophisticated cyberattacks. Traditional rule-based and supervised intrusion detection techniques struggle to detect protocol-compliant and zero-day attacks under significant class imbalance and limited availability of labeled data. This paper proposes an explainable, unsupervised multi-view anomaly detection framework for IEC 61850 GOOSE networks that explicitly separates semantic integrity and temporal availability. The approach employs asymmetric autoencoders trained only on real operational GOOSE traffic to learn distinct latent representations of sequence-based protocol semantics and timing-related transmission dynamics in normal traffic. Anomaly detection is implemented using reconstruction errors mixed with statistically grounded thresholds, enabling robust detection without specified attack types. Feature-level reconstruction analysis provides intrinsic explainability by directly linking detection outcomes to IEC 61850 protocol characteristics. The proposed framework is evaluated using real substation traffic for training and a public dataset containing normal traffic and message suppression, data manipulation, and denial-of-service attacks for testing. Experimental results show attack detection rates above 99% with false positives remaining below 5% of total traffic, demonstrating strong generalization across environments and effective operation under extreme class imbalance and interpretable anomaly attribution."

In this work, we utilize insulating TiOx barrier layers (BLs) to modify the interfacial spin conductance structurally, disentangle spin pumping and magnetic proximity effects (MPE), and establish external control over ultrafast magnetization dynamics in single-layer graphene/TiOx/Co systems. All-optical time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements of femtosecond to nanosecond spin dynamics reveal systematic tunability of ultrafast magnetic parameters via barrier engineering. The thickness-dependent damping modulation in Co indicates strong spin pumping, with interfacial spin transparency close to half its physical limit in the presence of an ultrathin BL, where MPE is eliminated. Our results show that appropriately chosen ultrathin BLs can prevent interfacial alterations from ferromagnetic metals, facilitating efficient spin detection in graphene and enhancing control over spin angular momentum dissipation in graphene/FM interfaces."

We present LatencyPrism, the first zero-intrusion multi-platform latency sculpting system. It aims to break down the inference latency across pipeline, proactively alert on inference latency anomalies, and guarantee adherence to SLOs, all without requiring code modifications or service restarts. LatencyPrism has been deployed across thousands of XPUs for over six months. It enables low-overhead real-time monitoring at batch level with alerts triggered in milliseconds. This approach distinguishes between workload-driven latency variations and anomalies indicating underlying issues with an F1-score of 0.98.

    "abstract": "Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) systems involve distinct physical domains, fluid and solid, governed by different partial differential equations and coupled at a dynamic interface. While learning-based solvers offer a promising alternative to costly numerical simulations, existing methods struggle to capture the heterogeneous dynamics of FSI within a unified framework. This challenge is further exacerbated by inconsistencies in response across domains due to interface coupling and by disparities in learning difficulty across fluid and solid regions, leading to instability during prediction. To address these challenges, we propose the Heterogeneous Graph Attention Solver (HGATSolver). HGATSolver encodes the system as a heterogeneous graph, embedding physical structure directly into the model via distinct node and edge types for fluid, solid, and interface regions. This enables specialized message-passing mechanisms tailored to each physical domain. To stabilize explicit time stepping, we introduce a novel physics-conditioned gating mechanism that serves as a learnable, adaptive relaxation factor. Furthermore, an Inter-domain Gradient-Balancing Loss dynamically balances the optimization objectives across domains based on predictive uncertainty. Extensive experiments on two constructed FSI benchmarks and a public dataset demonstrate that HGATSolver achieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing an effective framework for surrogate modeling of coupled multi-physics systems."

    "abstract": "Reward design remains a significant bottleneck in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to real-world problems. A popular alternative is reward learning, where reward functions are inferred from human feedback rather than manually specified. Recent work has proposed learning reward functions from human feedback in the form of ratings, rather than traditional binary preferences, enabling richer and potentially less cognitively demanding supervision. Building on this paradigm, we introduce a new rating-based RL method, Ranked Return Regression for RL (R4). At its core, R4 employs a novel ranking mean squared error (rMSE) loss, which treats teacher-provided ratings as ordinal targets. Our approach learns from a dataset of trajectory-rating pairs, where each trajectory is labeled with a discrete rating (e.g., \"bad,\" \"neutral,\" \"good\"). At each training step, we sample a set of trajectories, predict their returns, and rank them using a differentiable sorting operator (soft ranks). We then optimize a mean squared error loss between the resulting soft ranks and the teacher's ratings. Unlike prior rating-based approaches, R4 offers formal guarantees: its solution set is provably minimal and complete under mild assumptions. Empirically, using simulated human feedback, we demonstrate that R4 consistently matches or outperforms existing rating and preference-based RL methods on robotic locomotion benchmarks from OpenAI Gym and the DeepMind Control Suite, while requiring significantly less feedback."

To investigate this behavior observationally, we analyzed the long-term hard X-ray light curve from the Swift/BAT 157-Month Hard X-ray Survey in X-ray binary GX 301-2. Using three timing analysis methods--the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, the weighted wavelet Ztransform, and Gaussian processes--we identify a rare dual-SM behavior in this source: the 115-day modulation exceeds the 5$σ$ global significance level, whereas the 65-day signal only marginally reaches the 4$σ$ level. Because the 115-day period is more consistent with the previously reported linear relation between orbital and superorbital periods, we interpret 115 days as the actual superorbital period, while the weaker and less stable 65-day period is its beat modulation with the orbital period.By assessing the applicability of different physical scenarios to our results, we suggest that this dual-SM behavior is most plausibly associated with corotating interaction regions (CIRs) in the stellar wind. This framework can also account for the observed linear orbital-superorbital relation, despite the unclear physical mechanism that sets the apparent ratio between the CIR and orbital periods across sources. Further long-term monitoring of this system, together with continued theoretical development of the CIR scenario, will be essential for clarifying the origin of wind-fed SMs."

Inspired by this observation, we derive a novel attention operator called Hawkes Attention from the multivariate Hawkes process theory for MTPP, using learnable per-type neural kernels to modulate query, key and value projections, thereby replacing the corresponding parts in the traditional attention. Benefited from the design, Hawkes Attention unifies event timing and content interaction, learning both the time-relevant behavior and type-specific excitation patterns from the data. The experimental results show that our method achieves better performance compared to the baselines. In addition to the general MTPP, our attention mechanism can also be easily applied to specific temporal structures, such as time series forecasting."

A key challenge is transferring knowledge from NBI to enhance WLI-only models, yet existing methods are critically hampered by their reliance on paired NBI-WLI images of the same lesion, a costly and often impractical requirement that leaves vast amounts of clinical data untapped. In this paper, we break this paradigm by introducing PaGKD, a novel Pairing-free Group-level Knowledge Distillation framework that that enables effective cross-modal learning using unpaired WLI and NBI data. Instead of forcing alignment between individual, often semantically mismatched image instances, PaGKD operates at the group level to distill more complete and compatible knowledge across modalities. Central to PaGKD are two complementary modules: (1) Group-level Prototype Distillation (GKD-Pro) distills compact group representations by extracting modality-invariant semantic prototypes via shared lesion-aware queries; (2) Group-level Dense Distillation (GKD-Den) performs dense cross-modal alignment by guiding group-aware attention with activation-derived relation maps. Together, these modules enforce global semantic consistency and local structural coherence without requiring image-level correspondence. Extensive experiments on four clinical datasets demonstrate that PaGKD consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving relative AUC improvements of 3.3%, 1.1%, 2.8%, and 3.2%, respectively, establishing a new direction for cross-modal learning from unpaired data."

Theoretical estimates based on condensation and gravitational collisions alone fail to explain the observed timescales for the onset of precipitation for a range of droplet sizes. This suggests the involvement of collisional growth mediated by turbulence to resolve the so-called ``size-gap problem''. For the onset of rain, it is sufficient that statistical outliers, coined ``lucky droplets'', cross the size gap. In this study, we explore the influence of turbulence on droplet growth, focusing on correlated collisions and intermittency. Using direct numerical simulations of droplets in turbulent flow, we constrain a non-Markovian stochastic framework that allows us to assess memory effects on the droplet-size distribution arising from correlations between consecutive collisions. Using our framework, we find that correlated collisions accelerate the initial growth of lucky droplets but have sub-leading effect at later stages. Consequently, we neglect correlations from collisions and model an ensemble of cloud parcels representing fluctuations in the volume-averaged dissipation rate. Here, the distribution of droplet sizes in each parcel is described by a linear master equation with a time-dependent collision rate according to the volume-averaged dissipation rate. Our analyses of this toy model show that intermittency can significantly reduce the time required by lucky droplets to cross the size gap."

To address this gap, we extensively study and thoroughly analyze the susceptibility of 72 SGX-based proposals to cloning attacks.

    "abstract": "The use of formal language for deductive logical reasoning aligns well with language models (LMs), where translating natural language (NL) into first-order logic (FOL) and employing an external solver results in a verifiable and therefore reliable reasoning system. However, smaller LMs often struggle with this translation task, frequently producing incorrect symbolic outputs due to formatting and translation errors. Existing approaches typically rely on self-iteration to correct these errors, but such methods depend heavily on the capabilities of the underlying model. To address this, we first categorize common errors and fine-tune smaller LMs using data synthesized by large language models. The evaluation is performed using the defined error categories. We introduce incremental inference, which divides inference into two stages, predicate generation and FOL translation, providing greater control over model behavior and enhancing generation quality as measured by predicate metrics. This decomposition framework also enables the use of a verification module that targets predicate-arity errors to further improve performance. Our study evaluates three families of models across four logical-reasoning datasets. The comprehensive fine-tuning, incremental inference, and verification modules reduce error rates, increase predicate coverage, and improve reasoning performance for smaller LMs, moving us closer to developing reliable and accessible symbolic-reasoning systems."

    "abstract": "The question of when the derived category of a ring satisfies Brown--Adams representability is revisited via studying the transfer of pure homological dimension along definable functors: it is shown that, for any ring, the pure global dimension of the derived category is at least the pure global dimension of the ring; expanding results of Beligiannis and Keller-Christensen-Neeman. This result is obtained by constructing `change of category' isomorphisms of PExt groups across definable functors. The same isomorphisms illustrate circumstances when one can transfer the property of Brown--Adams representability. We demonstrate how these methods can be used to test whether certain derived category of quasi-coherent sheaves are a Brown category. We also make an investigation into the structure of derived categories of von Neumann regular rings, which are shown in many cases to control Brown--Adams representability; this includes a new proof of the telescope conjecture, and a new and short proof that a coherent ring satisfies Freyd's (strong) generating hypothesis if and only if it is von Neumann regular."

Because the choice of estimand can affect how relevant trial results are to patients and other stakeholders, such as clinicians or policymakers, it is important for them to be involved in these decisions. However, there are barriers to having these conversations. For instance, discussions around how intercurrent events should be addressed in the estimand definition typically involve complex concepts as well as technical language. We three tools to facilitate conversations between researchers and patients and other stakeholders about the choice of estimand and intercurrent event strategy: (i) a video explaining the concept of an estimand and the five different ways that intercurrent events can be incorporated into the estimand definition; (ii) an infographic outlining these five strategies; and (iii) an editable PowerPoint slide which can be completed with trial-specific details to facilitate conversations around choice of estimand for a particular trial. These resources can help to start conversations between the trial team and patients and other stakeholders about the best choice of estimand and intercurrent event strategies for a randomised trial."

    "abstract": "In optoacoustic imaging, recovering the absorption coefficients of tissue by inverting the light transport remains a challenging problem. Improvements in solving this problem can greatly benefit the clinical value of optoacoustic imaging. Existing variational inversion methods require an accurate and differentiable model of this light transport. As neural surrogate models allow fast and differentiable simulations of complex physical processes, they are considered promising candidates to be used in solving such inverse problems. However, there are in general no guarantees that the derivatives of these surrogate models accurately match those of the underlying physical operator. As accurate derivatives are central to solving inverse problems, errors in the model derivative can considerably hinder high fidelity reconstructions. To overcome this limitation, we present a surrogate model for light transport in tissue that uses Sobolev training to improve the accuracy of the model derivatives. Additionally, the form of Sobolev training we used is suitable for high-dimensional models in general. Our results demonstrate that Sobolev training for a light transport surrogate model not only improves derivative accuracy but also reduces generalization error for in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples. These improvements promise to considerably enhance the utility of the surrogate model in downstream tasks, especially in solving inverse problems."

We present an exhaustive photometric and spectroscopic follow-up to determine the orbital and physical properties of the system. We perform multidimensional Gaussian Process regression with the code pyaneti on spectroscopic time-series and NGTS/LCO light curves to disentangle the stellar and planetary signal in ESPRESSO radial velocities. We show how contemporaneous photometry serves as an activity indicator to inform RV modelling within a multidimensional Gaussian Processes framework. We argue that this can be exploited when spectroscopic observations are adversely affected by low signal-to-noise and/or poor sampling. We estimate the Doppler semi-amplitudes of Kb = 2.6(+1.1,-1.2) m/s, Kc = 1.2(+1.0,-0.8) m/s and Kd = 2.7 +/- 1.2 m/s. This translates into 2-sigma mass estimates for TOI-451 b and d of Mb = 4.7(+2.1,-2.2) Earth masses and Md = 10.2(+4.6,-4.5) Earth masses, as well as a mass upper limit for TOI-451 c of Mc < 11.5 Earth masses. The derived planetary properties suggest that planets c and d contain significant hydrogen-rich envelopes. The inferred parameters of TOI-451 b are consistent with either a rocky world that still retains a small hydrogen envelope or a water world. These insights make the TOI-451 system an ideal laboratory for future follow-up studies aimed at measuring atmospheric compositions, detecting atmospheric mass-loss signatures, and further exploring planetary formation and evolution processes."

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on single-step perception-to-judgment tasks, leaving scenarios requiring complex visual-spatial logical chains significantly underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Video-MSR, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate Multi-hop Spatial Reasoning (MSR) in dynamic video scenarios. Video-MSR systematically probes MSR capabilities through four distinct tasks: Constrained Localization, Chain-based Reference Retrieval, Route Planning, and Counterfactual Physical Deduction. Our benchmark comprises 3,052 high-quality video instances with 4,993 question-answer pairs, constructed via a scalable, visually-grounded pipeline combining advanced model generation with rigorous human verification. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we uncover significant limitations, revealing that while models demonstrate proficiency in surface-level perception, they exhibit distinct performance drops in MSR tasks, frequently suffering from spatial disorientation and hallucination during multi-step deductions. To mitigate these shortcomings and empower models with stronger MSR capabilities, we further curate MSR-9K, a specialized instruction-tuning dataset, and fine-tune Qwen-VL, achieving a +7.82% absolute improvement on Video-MSR. Our results underscore the efficacy of multi-hop spatial instruction data and establish Video-MSR as a vital foundation for future research.

    "abstract": "Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are off-nuclear compact objects with apparent luminosities above 10^39 erg/s, often exceeding the Eddington limit for stellar-mass black holes. Beaming is a commonly invoked mechanism to explain their extreme brightness, and the dependence of the beaming factor on accretion rate is a critical parameter. In this work, we investigate how different beaming prescriptions affect the predicted properties of ULX populations. Using binary population synthesis, we construct synthetic X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) for both classical and log-modified beaming models at solar and sub-solar metallicities. The classical model predicts a larger intrinsic number of bright ULXs, but strong beaming reduces their observable fraction, resulting in fewer visible ULXs compared to the log-modified model. The log-modified prescription yields a shallower slope at high-luminosity, aligning better with observed XLFs, and increases the fraction of observable neutron star ULXs above 10^39 erg/s. These results underscore the significant role of the beaming law in shaping ULX statistical distributions and assessing neutron star contributions to the population."

The inclusion of the $\\mathbf{A}^{2}$ term yields a significantly richer and asymmetric steady-state phase diagram, consisting of normal, superradiant, and bistable phases that intersect at tricritical points, while isolated bistable phases also emerge and the number of tricritical points is reduced. Notably, it is near the intersection of the two critical-line branches enclosing the superradiant phases, rather than at the tricritical points, that the $\\mathbf{A}^{2}$ term fundamentally alters the scaling of photon-number fluctuations. Given the inherent role of the $\\mathbf{A}^{2}$ term in light-matter interactions, our findings open a realistic route toward the experimental investigation and dynamical control of nonequilibrium critical phenomena in practical open quantum platforms."

This work aims to present a model that combines Hipparcos and Gaia astrometric data with radial velocity measurements to constrain the orbital inclinations and true masses of long-period companions. Additionally, we re-analyse a small sample of targets that have not yet been studied using this combined approach. This research leverages the simultaneous modelling of proper motion anomalies and radial velocities, in conjunction with an analysis of the sensitivity curve. This approach serves not only as a verification of the parameters but also as a means to acquire valuable insights into planetary systems. The new analyses reveal that some of the targets classified as brown dwarfs or small-mass stars have a planetary nature. HD 5388 b and HD 6718 b are likely planets. HD 141937 b is likely a planet, but the current dataset does not allow us to firmly constrain its true mass. HD 16760 b belongs to the brown dwarf regime and it has a probable second companion. 30 Ari B b falls within the stellar regime, but the presence of an additional stellar companion could compromise the reliability of the final results.

While ACS2 is highly effective at building cognitive maps through latent learning, its performance often stagnates in environments characterized by sparse rewards. We propose a specific architectural variant that triggers hindsight learning when the agent fails to reach its primary goal, re-labeling visited states as virtual goals to densify the learning signal. The proposed model was evaluated on two benchmarks: the deterministic \\texttt{Maze 6} and the stochastic \\texttt{FrozenLake}. The results demonstrate that ACS2HER significantly accelerates knowledge acquisition and environmental mastery compared to the standard ACS2. However, this efficiency gain is accompanied by increased computational overhead and a substantial expansion in classifier numerosity. This work provides the first analysis of combining anticipatory mechanisms with retrospective goal-relabeling in Learning Classifier Systems."

We investigate how abilities are distributed within LLM parameters by analyzing module activations under domain- and language-specific inputs for closely related models. Across layers and modules, we find that ability-related activations are highly concentrated in a small set of channels (typically <5\\%), and these channels are largely disentangled with good sufficiency and stability. Building on these observations, we propose ACT (Activation-Guided Channel-wise Ability Transfer), which localizes ability-relevant channels via activation differences and selectively transfers only the corresponding parameters, followed by lightweight fine-tuning for compatibility. Experiments on multilingual mathematical and scientific reasoning show that ACT can recover forgotten abilities while preserving retained skills. It can also merge multiple specialized models to integrate several abilities into a single model with minimal interference. Our code and data will be publicly released."

This membership checking is captured by a complex arithmetic circuit: a set of polynomial equations over a finite field. ZK programming languages, like Noir, have been proposed to simplify the description of these circuits. A developer can write a Noir program using traditional high-level constructs that can be compiled into a lower-level ACIR (Abstract Circuit Intermediate Representation), which is essentially a high-level description of an arithmetic circuit. In this paper, we formalise some of the ACIR language using SMT-LIB and its extended theory of finite fields. We use this formalisation to create an open-source formal verifier for the Noir language using the SMT solver cvc5. Our verifier can be used to check whether Noir programs behave appropriately. For instance, it can be used to check whether a Noir program has been properly constrained, that is, the finite-field polynomial equations generated truly capture the intended relation. We evaluate our verifier over 4 distinct sets of Noir programs, demonstrating its practical applicability and identifying a hard-to-check constraint type that charts an improvement path for our verification framework."

However, existing parameter-efficient methods, such as PiSSA and MiLoRA, are designed for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and do not account for the distinct optimization dynamics and geometric structures of RLVR. Applying these methods directly leads to spectral collapse and optimization instability, which severely limit model performance. Meanwhile, alternative approaches that leverage update sparsity encounter significant efficiency bottlenecks on modern hardware due to unstructured computations. To address these challenges, we propose GeoRA (Geometry-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation), which exploits the anisotropic and compressible nature of RL update subspaces. GeoRA initializes adapters by extracting principal directions via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) within a geometrically constrained subspace while freezing the residual components. This method preserves the pre-trained geometric structure and enables efficient GPU computation through dense operators. Experiments on Qwen and Llama demonstrate that GeoRA mitigates optimization bottlenecks caused by geometric misalignment. It consistently outperforms established low-rank baselines on key mathematical benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. Moreover, GeoRA shows superior generalization and resilience to catastrophic forgetting in out-of-domain tasks."

The model employs a Pitch Encoder and Loudness Encoder to extract pitch and loudness features of the music, which serve as conditional inputs to the Dif-fusion Model's decoder, generating high-quality piano timbres. Case analysis re-sults show that the model performs excellently in terms of pitch accuracy and timbral similarity, maintaining stable conversion across different musical styles (classical, jazz, pop) and lengths (from short clips to full pieces). Particularly, the model maintains high sound quality and accuracy even when dealing with rapidly changing notes and complex musical structures, demonstrating good generaliza-tion capability. Additionally, the model has the potential for real-time musical conversion and is suitable for live performances and digital music creation tools. Future research will focus on enhancing the handling of loudness dynamics and incorporating additional musical features (such as timbral variations and rhythmic complexity) to improve the model's adaptability and expressiveness. We plan to explore the model's application potential in other timbre conversion tasks, such as converting vocals to instrumental sounds or integration with MIDI digital pianos, further expanding the application scope of the Diffusion-based timbre conversion model in the field of music generation."

Current commercial LLM providers deploy output guardrails to filter harmful outputs, yet these defenses are not impenetrable. Due to LLMs' reliance on autoregressive, token-by-token inference, their semantic representations lack robustness to spatially structured perturbations, such as redistributing tokens across different rows, columns, or diagonals. Exploiting the Transformer's spatial weakness, we propose SpatialJB to disrupt the model's output generation process, allowing harmful content to bypass guardrails without detection. Comprehensive experiments conducted on leading LLMs get nearly 100% ASR, demonstrating the high effectiveness of SpatialJB. Even after adding advanced output guardrails, like the OpenAI Moderation API, SpatialJB consistently maintains a success rate exceeding 75%, outperforming current jailbreak techniques by a significant margin. The proposal of SpatialJB exposes a key weakness in current guardrails and emphasizes the importance of spatial semantics, offering new insights to advance LLM safety research. To prevent potential misuse, we also present baseline defense strategies against SpatialJB and evaluate their effectiveness in mitigating such attacks. The code for the attack, baseline defenses, and a demo are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SpatialJailbreak-8E63."

The study in this paper verifies the physical authenticity of two viscosity models through Taylor Couette laminar flow experiments with inner and outer cylinders rotating at the same angular velocity, and numerically investigate the influence of relative cylinder spacing and rotational speed on the circumferential velocity under the slip model. The experimental results of LDV measurement with a relative cylinder spacing of 0.3 indicate that the maximum deviation from rigid-body rotation is about 0.86%, which is consistent with the theoretical prediction of slip viscosity model. The numerical simulations show that the end-walls have no effect under the strain-rate viscosity model; but when the slip viscosity model is introduced, the end-walls inevitably bring about the circumferential velocity profile changing along the axial direction, and result in a three-dimensional (3D) spiral streamline pattern influenced by the relative cylinder spacing and angular speed of cylinders."

The controlled dynamics are of McKean-Vlasov type and are subject to regime switching driven by a hidden Markov chain. The observation process depends on the control and on the joint distribution of the state and control, which prevents the direct application of standard filtering techniques. The main contribution of this paper is to show how this distribution dependence can be handled within a change-of-probability framework, leading to a well-posed separated control problem. We derive a Zakai equation with a specific structure for the unnormalized filter, and show that the corresponding value function satisfies a dynamic programming principle. This yields a Bellman equation posed on a convex subset of a Wasserstein space, characterizing the optimal control problem under partial observation."

Realizing this picture is nonetheless challenging, since CMB observations tightly constrain energy injection from dark-matter annihilation at recombination and therefore strongly disfavor simple $s$-wave annihilation into visible Standard-Model final states. In this work, we propose a concrete neutrinophilic framework for sub-GeV thermal dark matter (''light WIMPs'') based on an additional gauge symmetry $\\mathrm{U}(1)_{\\mathrm{B}-\\mathrm{L}+x\\mathrm{Y}}$; for an appropriate choice of $x$, the new gauge boson couples predominantly to dark matter and neutrinos while its couplings to charged leptons are suppressed, so that sub-GeV dark matter annihilates almost exclusively into neutrinos, with hadronic modes kinematically closed. We map the parameter space in which the observed relic abundance is reproduced via standard thermal freeze-out in a conventional cosmological history, and show that sizable regions remain viable after imposing current cosmological, indirect-detection, and terrestrial constraints; in part of the allowed parameter space, the dark matter also exhibits sufficiently large self-interactions to potentially alleviate small-scale structure tensions."

One typically finds that each additional factor of the loop counting parameter can induce up to a certain number of logarithms of the scale factor. Loop corrections that attain this number are known as ``leading logarithms''; those with fewer are sub-leading. Starobinsky's stochastic formalism has long been known to reproduce the leading logarithms of scalar potential models. We show that the first sub-leading logarithm is captured by applying the stochastic formalism to a certain part of the 1-loop effective potential. This is checked at 2-loops for a massless, minimally coupled scalar with a quartic self-interaction on de Sitter background."

    "abstract": "Developing Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence models that remain accurate across diverse flow regimes remains a long-standing challenge. In this work, we propose a novel framework, termed the progressive mixture-of-experts (PMoE), designed to enable continual learning for RANS turbulence modelling. The framework employs a modular autoencoder-based router to associate each flow scenario with a specialised turbulence model, referred to as an expert. When an unseen flow regime cannot be adequately represented by the existing router and expert set, a new expert together with its routing component can be introduced at low cost, without modifying or degrading previously trained ones, thereby naturally avoiding catastrophic forgetting. The framework is applied to a range of flows with distinct physical characteristics, including baseline airfoil wakes, wall-attached flows, separated flows and corner-induced secondary flows. The resulting PMoE model effectively integrates multiple experts and achieves improved predictive accuracy across both seen and unseen test cases. Owing to sparse activation, model expansion does not incur additional computational cost during inference. The proposed framework therefore provides a scalable pathway towards lifelong-learning turbulence models for industrial computational fluid dynamics."

    "abstract": "There are multiple performance metrics in the design of coding schemes for distributed storage systems. The first metric is called repair bandwidth, which measures the network resources required during the repair process. Another critical metric for repair efficiency is disk I/O cost, defined as the amount of data packets accessed at helper nodes to repair the failed node. In an encoding scheme with optimal I/O cost, the number of packets sent to the newcomer is exactly the same as the number of packets read from memory. This mode of repair is referred to as uncoded repair, as no coding operations are performed at the helper node. In addition to minimizing disk I/O cost, an uncoded repair mechanism has the advantage of incurring minimal computational overhead at the helper node. In this paper, we demonstrate that for single node failures, if all surviving nodes participate in the repair of the failed node, we can achieve all points on the fundamental tradeoff curve between storage and repair bandwidth. The design of the proposed encoding scheme is based on the theory of gammoids, a specialized class of graph-based matroids. We prove that this scheme can tolerate an unlimited number of node repair iterations over a field of fixed size."

Our approach follows a model-based paradigm, using Coloured Timed Petri Nets to represent the scheduling environment, and Maskable Proximal Policy Optimization to enable dynamic decision-making while restricting the agent to feasible actions at each decision point. To simulate realistic industrial conditions, dynamic job arrivals are modeled using a Gamma distribution, which captures complex temporal patterns such as bursts, clustering, and fluctuating workloads. Machine failures are modeled using a Weibull distribution to represent age-dependent degradation and wear-out dynamics. These stochastic models enable the framework to reflect real-world manufacturing scenarios better. In addition, we study two action-masking strategies: a non-gradient approach that overrides the probabilities of invalid actions, and a gradient-based approach that assigns negative gradients to invalid actions within the policy network. We conduct extensive experiments on dynamic JSSP benchmarks, demonstrating that our method consistently outperforms traditional heuristic and rule-based approaches in terms of makespan minimization. The results highlight the strength of combining interpretable Petri-net-based models with adaptive reinforcement learning policies, yielding a resilient, scalable, and explainable framework for real-time scheduling in dynamic and uncertain manufacturing environments."

This complex time evolution can be considered as a composite process constructed from Lorentzian time evolution and a Euclidean evolution induced by a post-selected measurement. Our main finding is that in the spatially-compact system, this complex time evolution drives the state of the subsystems to those of the primary state with the same conformal dimensions of the inserted operator. Contrary to the compact system, the subsystems of the spatially non-compact system evolve to states that depend on the non-unitary process during a certain time regime. In holographic systems with a compact spatial direction, this process induced by a heavy local operator can correspond to the relaxation from a black hole with an inhomogeneous horizon to that with a uniform one, while in the ones with a non-compact spatial direction, it can correspond to the relaxation to that with a horizon depending on the non-unitary process."

In this paper, we resolve the previously open case of two symbols per card, which corresponds to the original game. We show that Swish is NP-complete for this case. Specifically, we prove the NP-hardness when the allowed transformations of cards are restricted to a single (horizontal or vertical) flip or 180-degree rotation, and extend the results to the original setting allowing all three transformations. In contrast, when neither transformation is allowed, we present a polynomial-time algorithm.

    "abstract": "Collaborative Filtering (CF) remains the cornerstone of modern recommender systems, with dense embedding--based methods dominating current practice. However, these approaches suffer from a critical limitation: our theoretical analysis reveals a fundamental signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ceiling when modeling unpopular items, where parameter-based dense models experience diminishing SNR under severe data sparsity. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose SaD (Sparse and Dense), a unified framework that integrates the semantic expressiveness of dense embeddings with the structural reliability of sparse interaction patterns. We theoretically show that aligning these dual views yields a strictly superior global SNR. Concretely, SaD introduces a lightweight bidirectional alignment mechanism: the dense view enriches the sparse view by injecting semantic correlations, while the sparse view regularizes the dense model through explicit structural signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, under this dual-view alignment, even a simple matrix factorization--style dense model can achieve state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, SaD is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of existing recommender models, highlighting the enduring power of collaborative filtering when leveraged from dual perspectives. Further evaluations on real-world benchmarks show that SaD consistently outperforms strong baselines, ranking first on the BarsMatch leaderboard.

    "abstract": "Choosing a representative element volume (REV) from finite cylindrical $μ$CT scans becomes ambiguous when a key field variable exhibits a slow axial trend, because estimated statistics can change systematically with subvolume size and position rather than converging under simple averaging. A practical workflow is presented to size an REV under such nonstationary conditions by first suppressing axial drift/trend to obtain a residual field suitable for second-order analysis, and then selecting the smallest analysis diameter for which low-wavenumber content stabilizes within a prescribed tolerance. The approach is demonstrated on \\textit{Thalassinoides}-bearing rocks, whose branching, connected burrow networks impose heterogeneity on length scales comparable to typical laboratory core diameters, making imaging-based microstructural statistics and downstream digital-rock proxies highly sensitive to the chosen subvolume. From segmented data, a scalar ``burrowsity'' field--capturing burrow-related pore spaces and infills--is defined, and axial detrending (with optional normalization) is applied to mitigate acquisition drift and nonstationary trends. Representativeness is then posed as a diameter-convergence problem on nested inscribed cylinders: the two-point covariance and its isotropic spectral counterpart $\\widehat{C}$ are estimated, and the smallest diameter at which the low-wavenumber plateau becomes stable is selected. Applied to a segmented \\textit{Thalassinoides} core, the method identifies a minimum analysis cylinder of approximately $D_{\\mathrm{REV}}\\approx 93~\\mathrm{mm}$ and $H_{\\mathrm{REV}}\\approx 83~\\mathrm{mm}$, enabling reproducible correlation-scale reporting and connectivity-sensitive property estimation."

A prototype featuring a cluster state cache and an intent analyzer (using AWS Bedrock) was developed. Empirical evaluation demonstrated high LLM parsing accuracy (>95% Subset Accuracy on an evaluation ground-truth dataset) for top-tier models like Amazon Nova Pro/Premier and Mistral Pixtral Large, significantly outperforming a baseline engine. Scheduling quality tests across six scenarios showed the prototype achieved superior or equivalent placement compared to standard Kubernetes configurations, particularly excelling in complex and quantitative scenarios and handling conflicting soft preferences. The results validate using LLMs for accessible scheduling but highlight limitations like synchronous LLM latency, suggesting asynchronous processing for production readiness. This work confirms the viability of semantic soft affinity for simplifying workload orchestration."

    "abstract": "Recent studies in medical question answering (Medical QA) have actively explored the integration of large language models (LLMs) with biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) to improve factual accuracy. However, most existing approaches still rely on traversing the entire KG or performing large-scale retrieval, which introduces substantial noise and leads to unstable multi-hop reasoning. We argue that the core challenge lies not in expanding access to knowledge, but in identifying and reasoning over the appropriate subset of evidence for each query. ReGraM is a region-first knowledge graph reasoning framework that addresses this challenge by constructing a query-aligned subgraph and performing stepwise reasoning constrained to this localized region under multiple evidence aware modes. By focusing inference on only the most relevant portion of the KG, ReGraM departs from the assumption that all relations are equally useful an assumption that rarely holds in domain-specific medical settings. Experiments on seven medical QA benchmarks demonstrate that ReGraM consistently outperforms a strong baseline (KGARevion), achieving an 8.04% absolute accuracy gain on MCQ, a 4.50% gain on SAQ, and a 42.9% reduction in hallucination rate. Ablation and qualitative analyses further show that aligning region construction with hop-wise reasoning is the primary driver of these improvements. Overall, our results highlight region-first KG reasoning as an effective paradigm for improving factual accuracy and consistency in medical QA."

Using numerical simulations, we analyze representative GHPS states and show that the GHPS spherical coordinates govern the amplitude ratio and relative phase between the pole bases. This framework enables spatially inhomogeneous polarization distributions and intensity patterns, including nonseparable structures in which polarization and intensity are intrinsically intertwined, and provides a systematic state-space description for the coherent geometrical control of advanced structured light fields."

Motivated by recent experimental observations of broken helix magnetic structures in EuIn$_2$As$_2$, we focus on the microscopic interaction conditions in stabilizing such multiple-$Q$ states.We employ two effective spin models: One is the momentum-space-based model, and the other is the real-space-based model, both of which include bilinear and biquadratic easy-plane anisotropic interactions. By analyzing their ground state via simulated annealing, we find that a superposition of a spiral and a staggered modulation yields a robust double-$Q$ magnetic structure. Moreover, we demonstrate that the obtained double-$Q$ spin configuration exhibits an antisymmetric spin-split band structure even without the relativistic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and further reveals asymmetric band modulations when the magnetic field is applied along the out-of-plane direction.

To address these challenges, we introduce GaussianFluent, a unified framework for realistic simulation and rendering of dynamic object states. First, it synthesizes photorealistic interiors by densifying internal Gaussians guided by generative models. Second, it integrates an optimized Continuum Damage Material Point Method (CD-MPM) to enable brittle fracture simulation at remarkably high speed. Our approach handles complex scenarios including mixed-material objects and multi-stage fracture propagation, achieving results infeasible with previous methods.

In this work, we propose CoT-Flow, a framework that reconceptualizes discrete reasoning steps as a continuous probabilistic flow, quantifying the contribution of each step toward the ground-truth answer. Built on this formulation, CoT-Flow enables two complementary methodologies: flow-guided decoding, which employs a greedy flow-based decoding strategy to extract information-efficient reasoning paths, and flow-based reinforcement learning, which constructs a verifier-free dense reward function. Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that CoT-Flow achieves a superior balance between inference efficiency and reasoning performance."

Moiré lattices (MLs), with multiple flat bands, offer an appropriate platform for creating such solitons. We explore the formation mechanism and stability of GSs in spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates under the combined action of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and an ML potential. We identify five Wannier-type GS families bifurcating from the lowest five energy bands in the spectrum induced by the ML with sufficiently large period and depth. These fundamental GSs serve as basic elements for constructing more complex Wannier-type GS states. Reducing the lattice period and depth triggers a transition from the Wannier-type GSs to ones of the Bloch type, the latter exhibiting higher norm thresholds and pronounced spatial broadening near edges of the energy bands. In addition to tuning the lattice-potential parameters, adjusting the SOC strength can also modulate the flatness of energy bands and enhance the localization of gap solitons, enabling reversible transitions between the GSs of the Wannier and Bloch types. Distinctive properties of GSs in the quasiperiodic ML are uncovered too. Thus, we propose the theoretical foundation for the creation of and manipulations with strongly localized GSs."

To address this few-shot generation challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates Knowledge Embedding and Hypernetwork-Guided Conditional Control into a Stable Diffusion pipeline, enabling realistic and controllable synthesis of defect images from limited data. First, we bridge the substantial domain gap between natural-image pre-trained models and industrial equipment by fine-tuning a Stable Diffusion backbone using DreamBooth-style knowledge embedding. This process encodes the unique structural and textural priors of substation meters, ensuring generated images retain authentic meter characteristics. Second, we introduce a geometric crack modeling module that parameterizes defect attributes--such as location, length, curvature, and branching pattern--to produce spatially constrained control maps. These maps provide precise, pixel-level guidance during generation. Third, we design a lightweight hypernetwork that dynamically modulates the denoising process of the diffusion model in response to the control maps and high-level defect descriptors, achieving a flexible balance between generation fidelity and controllability. Extensive experiments on a real-world substation meter dataset demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms existing augmentation and generation baselines. It reduces Frechet Inception Distance (FID) by 32.7%, increases diversity metrics, and--most importantly--boosts the mAP of a downstream defect detector by 15.3% when trained on augmented data. The framework offers a practical, high-quality data synthesis solution for industrial inspection systems where defect samples are rare."

By exploiting the Raman effect of molecular gas confined in a hollow-core capillary we achieve spectral compression of millijoule-level femtosecond laser pulses, attaining a compression ratio up to 14 times with near 50% efficiency. This method also features precise and continuous tunability of the central wavelength. Furthermore, we directly extend this scheme to an ambient air medium, realizing a simple high-energy femtosecond laser spectral tuning apparatus. The developed technique has promising applications in advanced manufacturing, bio-imaging, and material spectroscopic studies."

    "abstract": "Infrared object detection focuses on identifying and locating objects in complex environments (\\eg, dark, snow, and rain) where visible imaging cameras are disabled by poor illumination. However, due to low contrast and weak edge information in infrared images, it is challenging to extract discriminative object features for robust detection. To deal with this issue, we propose a novel vision-language representation learning paradigm for infrared object detection. An additional textual supervision with rich semantic information is explored to guide the disentanglement of object and non-object features. Specifically, we propose a Semantic Feature Alignment (SFA) module to align the object features with the corresponding text features. Furthermore, we develop an Object Feature Disentanglement (OFD) module that disentangles text-aligned object features and non-object features by minimizing their correlation. Finally, the disentangled object features are entered into the detection head. In this manner, the detection performance can be remarkably enhanced via more discriminative and less noisy features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on two benchmarks: M\\textsuperscript{3}FD (83.7\\% mAP), FLIR (86.1\\% mAP). Our code will be publicly available once the paper is accepted."

The proposed loss reshapes localization gradients by combining non monotonic focusing with decoupled width and height optimization, thereby enhancing weak regression signals for hard samples with low overlap while reducing gradient interference. This design is particularly effective for small and low contrast targets commonly observed in agricultural disease imagery. The proposed N EIoU loss is integrated into a lightweight YOLOv9t architecture and evaluated on a self collected field dataset comprising 5908 rice leaf images across four disease categories and healthy leaves. Experimental results demonstrate consistent performance gains over the standard CIoU loss, achieving a mean Average Precision of 90.3 percent, corresponding to a 4.3 percent improvement over the baseline, with improved localization accuracy under stricter evaluation criteria. For practical validation, the optimized model is deployed on an Android device using TensorFlow Lite with Float16 quantization, achieving an average inference time of 156 milliseconds per frame while maintaining accuracy. These results confirm that the proposed approach effectively balances accuracy, optimization stability, and computational efficiency for edge based agricultural monitoring systems."

Most existing methods are based on the assumption that different layers are either independent or follow specific dependence structures, and edges within the same layer are independent. In this article, we propose a novel method for community detection in multilayer networks that accounts for a broad range of inter-layer and intra-layer dependence structures. The proposed method integrates the multilayer stochastic block model for community detection with a multivariate probit model to capture the structures of inter-layer dependence, which also allows intra-layer dependence. To facilitate parameter estimation, we develop a constrained pairwise likelihood method coupled with an efficient alternating updating algorithm. The asymptotic properties of the proposed method are also established, with a focus on examining the influence of inter-layer and intra-layer dependences on the accuracy of both parameter estimation and community detection. The theoretical results are supported by extensive numerical experiments on both simulated networks and a real-world multilayer trade network."

Certain materials exhibit electromechanical coupling, such as piezoelectricity and flexoelectricity, which can alter the curvature and strains. In this work, we generalize Stoney's equation to include flexoelectric and piezoelectric effects in the film. Considering both open and closed circuit configurations, as well as uniform and non-uniform film properties, we compare different cases of electromechanical coupling and discuss their influence on curvature, strains, and electric polarization in the film."

Compared with the higher-order topological type-I hyperbolic lattices, we discover two unique topological phenomena that stem from the nontrivial geometrical topology of the type-II hyperbolic lattice. First, topological edge and corner states exist on both inner and outer boundaries of the type-II hyperbolic lattice and exhibit higher degeneracy than those in the type-I hyperbolic lattice with only an outer boundary. Second, the degeneracy of type-II hyperbolic corner states can be arbitrarily tuned by changing the characteristic (or inner) radius, in contrast to its type-I counterpart, which is determined by the number of sides of the tessellated polygons. Our work explores topological states in more complex hyperbolic lattices, significantly expanding the research scope of hyperbolic topological physics."

The resulting power posterior - also known as an $α$-posterior or fractional posterior - has been shown to exhibit appealing properties, including robustness to model misspecification and asymptotic normality (Bernstein-von Mises theorem). However, practical recommendations for selecting the tempering parameter and statistical guarantees for the resulting power posterior remain open questions. Cross-validation-based approaches to tuning this parameter suggest interesting asymptotic regimes for the selected $α$, which can either vanish or behave like a mixture distribution with a point mass at infinity and the remaining mass converging to zero. We formalize the asymptotic properties of the power posterior in these regimes. In particular, we provide sufficient conditions for (i) consistency of the power posterior moments and (ii) asymptotic normality of the power posterior mean. Our analysis required us to establish a new Laplace approximation that is interesting in its own right and is the key technical tool for showing a critical threshold $α\\asymp 1/\\sqrt{n}$ where the asymptotic normality of the posterior mean breaks.

The prevailing \"restoration-then-recognition\" two-stage paradigm suffers from a fundamental flaw: the pixel-level optimization objectives of image restoration models are misaligned with the semantic goals of character recognition, leading to artifact interference and error accumulation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated powerful general capabilities, they lack explicit structural modeling for license plate character sequences (e.g., fixed length, specific order). To address this, we propose an end-to-end structure-aware multimodal reasoning framework based on Qwen3-VL. The core innovation lies in the Character-Aware Multimodal Reasoning Module (CMRM), which introduces a set of learnable Character Slot Queries. Through a cross-attention mechanism, these queries actively retrieve fine-grained evidence corresponding to character positions from visual features. Subsequently, we inject these character-aware representations back into the visual tokens via residual modulation, enabling the language model to perform autoregressive generation based on explicit structural priors. Furthermore, combined with the LoRA parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, the model achieves domain adaptation while retaining the generalization capabilities of the large model. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world severely degraded datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing restoration-recognition combinations and general VLMs, validating the superiority of incorporating structured reasoning into large models for low-quality text recognition tasks."

However, existing timer management schemes suffer from heavy software load, low precision, lack of hardware update support, and overflow. This paper proposes two novel operations for priority queues--update and group sorting--to enable hardware timer management. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first hardware priority queue to support an update operation through the composition and propagation of basic operations to modify the priorities of elements within the queue. The group sorting mechanism ensures correct timing behavior post-overflow by establishing a group boundary priority to alter the sorting process and element insertion positions. Implemented with a hybrid architecture of a one-dimension (1D) systolic array and shift registers, our design is validated through packet-level simulations for flow table timeout management. Results demonstrate that a 4K-depth, 16-bit timer queue achieves over 500 MHz (175 Mpps, 12 ns precision) in a 28nm process and over 300 MHz (116 Mpps) on an FPGA. Critically, it reduces LUTs and FFs usage by 31% and 25%, respectively, compared to existing designs."

We show that for all signal energy N, $P_\\text{err}^\\text{DSR} \\in \\left[P_\\text{HB}^\\text{DSS}, 2P_\\text{HB}^\\text{DSS}\\right]$, under equal priors and ideal condition. In the low-energy regime, DSR beats the S-BPSK SQL at $N \\approx 0.3$ and drops below the coherent-state BPSK (C-BPSK) Helstrom bound at $N \\approx 0.4$, reaching $P_\\text{err}^\\text{DSR} < 1\\%$ near $N \\approx 0.6$. Finally, we quantify performance under non-unit efficiency and dark counts, phase diffusion, and receiver thermal noise, with MAP threshold adaptation providing robustness across these nonidealities."

    "abstract": "Developing safe, effective, and practically useful clinical prediction models (CPMs) traditionally requires iterative collaboration between clinical experts, data scientists, and informaticists. This process refines the often small but critical details of the model building process, such as which features/patients to include and how clinical categories should be defined. However, this traditional collaboration process is extremely time- and resource-intensive, resulting in only a small fraction of CPMs reaching clinical practice. This challenge intensifies when teams attempt to incorporate unstructured clinical notes, which can contain an enormous number of concepts. To address this challenge, we introduce HACHI, an iterative human-in-the-loop framework that uses AI agents to accelerate the development of fully interpretable CPMs by enabling the exploration of concepts in clinical notes. HACHI alternates between (i) an AI agent rapidly exploring and evaluating candidate concepts in clinical notes and (ii) clinical and domain experts providing feedback to improve the CPM learning process. HACHI defines concepts as simple yes-no questions that are used in linear models, allowing the clinical AI team to transparently review, refine, and validate the CPM learned in each round. In two real-world prediction tasks (acute kidney injury and traumatic brain injury), HACHI outperforms existing approaches, surfaces new clinically relevant concepts not included in commonly-used CPMs, and improves model generalizability across clinical sites and time periods. Furthermore, HACHI reveals the critical role of the clinical AI team, such as directing the AI agent to explore concepts that it had not previously considered, adjusting the granularity of concepts it considers, changing the objective function to better align with the clinical objectives, and identifying issues of data bias and leakage."

    "abstract": "The existence of multiple, equally accurate models for a given predictive task leads to predictive multiplicity, where a ``Rashomon set'' of models achieve similar accuracy but diverges in their individual predictions. This inconsistency undermines trust in high-stakes applications where we want consistent predictions. We propose three approaches to reduce inconsistency among predictions for the members of the Rashomon set. The first approach is \\textbf{outlier correction}. An outlier has a label that none of the good models are capable of predicting correctly. Outliers can cause the Rashomon set to have high variance predictions in a local area, so fixing them can lower variance. Our second approach is local patching. In a local region around a test point, models may disagree with each other because some of them are biased. We can detect and fix such biases using a validation set, which also reduces multiplicity. Our third approach is pairwise reconciliation, where we find pairs of models that disagree on a region around the test point. We modify predictions that disagree, making them less biased. These three approaches can be used together or separately, and they each have distinct advantages. The reconciled predictions can then be distilled into a single interpretable model for real-world deployment. In experiments across multiple datasets, our methods reduce disagreement metrics while maintaining competitive accuracy."

    "abstract": "Stylometry--the identification of an author through analysis of a text's style (i.e., authorship attribution)--serves many constructive purposes: it supports copyright and plagiarism investigations, aids detection of harmful content, offers exploratory cues for certain medical conditions (e.g., early signs of dementia or depression), provides historical context for literary works, and helps uncover misinformation and disinformation. In contrast, when stylometry is employed as a tool for authorship verification--confirming whether a text truly originates from a claimed author--it can also be weaponized for malicious purposes. Techniques such as de-anonymization, re-identification, tracking, profiling, and downstream effects like censorship illustrate the privacy threats that stylometric analysis can enable. Building on these concerns, this paper further explores how adversarial stylometry combined with steganography can counteract stylometric analysis. We first present enhancements to our adversarial attack, $\\textit{TraceTarnish}$, providing stronger evidence of its capacity to confound stylometric systems and reduce their attribution and verification accuracy. Next, we examine how steganographic embedding can be fine-tuned to mask an author's stylistic fingerprint, quantifying the level of authorship obfuscation achievable as a function of the proportion of words altered with zero-width Unicode characters. Based on our findings, steganographic coverage of 33% or higher seemingly ensures authorship obfuscation. Finally, we reflect on the ways stylometry can be used to undermine privacy and argue for the necessity of defensive tools like $\\textit{TraceTarnish}$."

Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance under varying levels of missingness."

Nevertheless, the psychological processes engendered by XR, and the manner in which these processes inform subsequent behavioural intentions, remain only partially delineated. The present study addresses this issue within an applied context by comparing non-immersive 2D viewing advertising with immersive XR experiential advertising. We examined whether XR strengthens internal responses to a product, specifically perceived comprehension and empathy, and whether these responses, in turn, influence the behavioural outcome of purchase intention. A repeated-measures two-way ANOVA demonstrated a significant main effect of advertising modality, with XR yielding higher ratings on all evaluative dimensions. Mediation analysis further indicated that the elevation in purchase intention was mediated by empathy, whereas no significant mediating effect was observed for comprehension within the scope of this study. These findings suggest that immersive XR experiences augment empathic engagement with virtual products, and that this enhanced empathy plays a pivotal role in shaping subsequent behavioural intentions."

Fast-ThinkAct learns to reason efficiently with latent CoTs by distilling from a teacher, driven by a preference-guided objective to align manipulation trajectories that transfers both linguistic and visual planning capabilities for embodied control. This enables reasoning-enhanced policy learning that effectively connects compact reasoning to action execution. Extensive experiments across diverse embodied manipulation and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-ThinkAct achieves strong performance with up to 89.3\\% reduced inference latency over state-of-the-art reasoning VLAs, while maintaining effective long-horizon planning, few-shot adaptation, and failure recovery."

    "abstract": "Multi-Task Learning (MTL) combined with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a promising direction for parameter-efficient deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). By sharing a single adapter across multiple tasks, one can significantly reduce storage overhead. However, this approach suffers from negative transfer, where conflicting gradient updates from distinct tasks degrade the performance of individual tasks compared to single-task fine-tuning. This problem is exacerbated in LoRA due to the low-rank constraint, which limits the optimization landscape's capacity to accommodate diverse task requirements. In this paper, we propose Ortho-LoRA, a gradient projection method specifically tailored for the bipartite structure of LoRA. Ortho-LoRA dynamically projects conflicting task gradients onto the orthogonal complement of each other within the intrinsic LoRA subspace. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark demonstrate that Ortho-LoRA effectively mitigates task interference, outperforming standard joint training and recovering 95\\% of the performance gap between multi-task and single-task baselines with negligible computational overhead."

While many of these disruptions originate deep in the supply network, most companies still lack visibility beyond Tier-1 suppliers, leaving upstream vulnerabilities undetected until the impact cascades downstream. To overcome this blind-spot and move from reactive recovery to proactive resilience, we introduce a minimally supervised agentic AI framework that autonomously monitors, analyses, and responds to disruptions across extended supply networks. The architecture comprises seven specialised agents powered by large language models and deterministic tools that jointly detect disruption signals from unstructured news, map them to multi-tier supplier networks, evaluate exposure based on network structure, and recommend mitigations such as alternative sourcing options. \\rev{We evaluate the framework across 30 synthesised scenarios covering three automotive manufacturers and five disruption classes. The system achieves high accuracy across core tasks, with F1 scores between 0.962 and 0.991, and performs full end-to-end analyses in a mean of 3.83 minutes at a cost of \\$0.0836 per disruption. Relative to industry benchmarks of multi-day, analyst-driven assessments, this represents a reduction of more than three orders of magnitude in response time. A real-world case study of the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict further demonstrates operational applicability. This work establishes a foundational step toward building resilient, proactive, and autonomous supply chains capable of managing disruptions across deep-tier networks."

We propose a probabilistic framework to address both issues. For each match, our approach relies on simulating all other matches played simultaneously or later to compute the qualifying probabilities under the three main outcomes (win, draw, loss), which allows the classification of each match into six different categories. The suggested model is applied to the previous group stage and the new incomplete round-robin league, introduced in the 2024/25 season of UEFA club competitions. An incomplete round-robin tournament is found to contain fewer stakeless matches where both contestants are indifferent, and substantially more matches where both contestants should play offensively. However, the robustly higher proportion of potentially collusive matches can threaten with serious scandals."

In this work, we develop a non-Markovian time-convolutionless master equation to treat an electronic spin coupled to a nuclear-spin bath. By relating ab initio electronic structure parameters directly to the decoherence dynamics, we provide a framework that accounts for pure dephasing in the low-temperature limit.

We address this by proposing LEAN-LLM-OPT, a LightwEight AgeNtic workflow construction framework for LLM-assisted large-scale OPTimization auto-formulation. LEAN-LLM-OPT takes as input a problem description together with associated datasets and orchestrates a team of LLM agents to produce an optimization formulation. Specifically, upon receiving a query, two upstream LLM agents dynamically construct a workflow that specifies, step-by-step, how optimization models for similar problems can be formulated. A downstream LLM agent then follows this workflow to generate the final output. Leveraging LLMs' text-processing capabilities and common modeling practices, the workflow decomposes the modeling task into a sequence of structured sub-tasks and offloads mechanical data-handling operations to auxiliary tools. This design alleviates the downstream agent's burden related to planning and data handling, allowing it to focus on the most challenging components that cannot be readily standardized. Extensive simulations show that LEAN-LLM-OPT, instantiated with GPT-4.1 and the open source gpt-oss-20B, achieves strong performance on large-scale optimization modeling tasks and is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, in a Singapore Airlines choice-based revenue management use case, LEAN-LLM-OPT demonstrates practical value by achieving leading performance across a range of scenarios.

    "abstract": "Teleportation is one of the most common locomotion techniques in virtual reality, yet its perceptual properties remain underexplored. While redirected walking research has shown that users' movements can be subtly manipulated without detection, similar imperceptible adjustments for teleportation have not been systematically investigated. This study examines the thresholds at which teleportation displacements become noticeable to users. We conducted a repeated-measures experiment in which participants' selected teleport destinations were altered in both direction (forwards, backwards) and at different ranges (small, large). Detection thresholds for these positional adjustments were estimated using a psychophysical staircase method with a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task. Results show that teleport destinations can be shifted without detection, with larger tolerances for backward adjustments and across longer teleport ranges. These findings establish baseline perceptual limits for redirected teleportation and highlight its potential as a design technique. Applications include supporting interpersonal distance management in social VR, guiding players toward objectives in games, and assisting novice users with navigation. By identifying the limits of imperceptible teleportation adjustments, this work extends redirection principles beyond walking to teleportation and opens new opportunities for adaptive and socially aware VR locomotion systems."

    "abstract": "Ferroelectric materials exhibit a switchable, spontaneous polarization at the unit cell level--an attractive property utilized in many emerging technologies including, among others, high-density memory storage, low-power transistors, and high-speed fiber optic communication. Understanding the local polarization switching behavior, through domain nucleation and evolution, is critical to advancing these technologies and requires characterization of the local domain microstructure. However, in application-relevant polycrystalline materials exhibiting a distribution of grain orientations, a direct mapping of the polarization direction in three dimensions has remained inaccessible using conventional experimental approaches. Here, taking barium titanate single crystals and lead zirconium titanate polycrystals as our bulk model systems, we map the local polarization directions using a new electron backscatter diffraction indexing technique based on simulated pattern-matching. Through improved pre-processing techniques (including optimized pattern processing, a new pseudosymmetry-sensitive neighbor pattern averaging method, and DIC-based global sample-detector geometry calibration) and a new pseudosymmetry confidence index (which considers not only pattern similarity but pattern dissimilarity trends with other domain variant patterns), we successfully distinguish between the six polarization directions, despite the challengingly small unit cell aspect ratio of the selected materials. The methods developed in this work are not only applicable to ferroelectrics but any material which exhibits close crystallographic pseudosymmetries--extending the current capabilities of EBSD."

    "abstract": "The Journal Impact Factor (IF), as a core indicator of academic evaluation, has not been systematically studied in relation to its historical evolution and global macroeconomic environment. This paper employs a period-based regression analysis using long-term time series data from 1975-2026 to examine the statistical relationship between IF and Federal Reserve monetary policy (using real interest rate as a proxy variable). The study estimates three nested models using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS): (1) a baseline linear model, (2) a linear model controlling for time trends, and (3) a log-transformed model. Empirical results show that: (i) in the early period (1975-2000), there is no significant statistical relationship between IF and real interest rate ($p>0.1$); (ii) during the quantitative easing period (2001-2020), they exhibit a significant negative correlation ($β=-0.069$, $p<0.01$), meaning that for every 1 percentage point decrease in real interest rate, IF increases by approximately 6.9\\%; (iii) the adjusted $R^2$ of the full-sample model reaches 0.893, indicating that real interest rate and time trends can explain 89.3\\% of IF variation. This finding reveals the indirect impact of monetary policy on the academic publishing system through multiple channels such as research funding and journal pricing power, providing econometric evidence for understanding the phenomenon of \"financialization of academic capital.\" This study not only enriches the literature on monetary policy transmission mechanisms but also provides a new perspective for valuation analysis of the academic publishing industry."

These models usually consist of hundreds of millions, or even billions, of parameters, making them resource-intensive during training and in production systems, leading to increased costs. This paper focuses on the reduction of a foundation's model size when applied to music information retrieval (MIR) tasks. Our research combines the Branchformer architecture with SummaryMixing, which were first applied in speech recognition, along with a random quantization process. To facilitate reproducibility, we conduct pre-training on publicly available datasets, complemented by a proprietary dataset comparable in scale to other private datasets reported in the literature. We ensure robust evaluation by using a framework consisting of a variety of downstream MIR tasks. Our results show that our architecture achieves competitive performance when compared with other state-of-the-art models that use multi-head self-attention, while reducing the model size from 8.5% up to 12.3%."

We perform an exhaustive scan over all possible models in this class and find many viable fixed points and modular form alignments, after confronting them with the latest neutrino oscillation global fits. The resulting models have the new feature that the two Dirac columns take more general forms than traditional Littlest Seesaw models, resulting in new sum rule relations between the solar and reactor angles, beyond those associated with TM1 (where the first column of the tri-bimaximal mixing matrix is preserved), which are compared to present and future projected JUNO results. We also compare the predictions of these models for the atmospheric angle and CP violating phase to current global fits and future T2HK and DUNE sensitivities."

Part 2 reframes circuits as dataflow graphs: measurement outcomes are parsed, aggregated, and reduced to small linear-algebra updates that schedule the next pulses, highlighting why low-latency, low-jitter streaming matters. Part 3 treats multi-qubit structure and entanglement as geometry and computation, including teleportation, superdense coding, entanglement detection, and Shor's algorithm via quantum phase estimation. Part 4 focuses on topological error correction and real-time decoding (Track A): stabilizer codes, surface-code decoding as \"topology -> graph -> algorithm\", and Union-Find decoders down to microarchitectural/RTL constraints, with verification, fault injection, and host/control-stack integration under product metrics (bounded latency, p99 tails, fail-closed policies, observability).

Dedicated cloud GPU instances offer improved privacy but with limited guarantees and ongoing costs, while professional on-premise hardware (A100, H100) remains prohibitively expensive. We present a systematic evaluation of NVIDIA's Blackwell consumer GPUs (RTX 5060 Ti, 5070 Ti, 5090) for production LLM inference, benchmarking four open-weight models (Qwen3-8B, Gemma3-12B, Gemma3-27B, GPT-OSS-20B) across 79 configurations spanning quantization formats (BF16, W4A16, NVFP4, MXFP4), context lengths (8k-64k), and three workloads: RAG, multi-LoRA agentic serving, and high-concurrency APIs. The RTX 5090 delivers 3.5-4.6x higher throughput than the 5060 Ti with 21x lower latency for RAG, but budget GPUs achieve the highest throughput-per-dollar for API workloads with sub-second latency. NVFP4 quantization provides 1.6x throughput over BF16 with 41% energy reduction and only 2-4% quality loss. Self-hosted inference costs $0.001-0.04 per million tokens (electricity only), which is 40-200x cheaper than budget-tier cloud APIs, with hardware breaking even in under four months at moderate volume (30M tokens/day). Our results show that consumer GPUs can reliably replace cloud inference for most SME workloads, except latency-critical long-context RAG, where high-end GPUs remain essential. We provide deployment guidance and release all benchmark data for reproducible SME-scale deployments."

These effects may bias brain connectivity measures, such as functional connectivity (FC), which quantify functional network organization derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). How to leverage high-dimensional network structures to effectively mitigate site effects has yet to be addressed. In this paper, we propose SLACC (Sparse LAtent Covariate-driven Connectome) factorization, a multivariate method that explicitly parameterizes covariate effects in latent subject scores corresponding to sparse rank-1 latent patterns derived from brain connectivity. The proposed method identifies localized site-driven variability within and across brain networks, enabling targeted correction. We develop a penalized Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for parameter estimation, incorporating the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to guide optimization. Extensive simulations validate SLACC's robustness in recovering the true parameters and underlying connectivity patterns. Applied to the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) dataset, SLACC demonstrates its ability to reduce site effects. The R package to implement our method is publicly available."

This enables the trained encoder to not capture irrelevant information about a given video like the color of a region of pixels in the background. Using a pre-trained V-JEPA video encoder, we train shallow classifiers using the RAVDESS and CREMA-D datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on RAVDESS and outperforming all other vision-based methods on CREMA-D (+1.48 WAR). Furthermore, cross-dataset evaluations reveal strong generalization capabilities, demonstrating the potential of purely embedding-based pre-training approaches to advance FER.

    "abstract": "Two of the most pressing challenges in cosmology are the persistent discrepancy in measurements of the Hubble constant, referred to as the Hubble tension, and the deficit of baryons in the local Universe, known as the missing baryon problem. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) encode the integrated electron column density along their lines of sight, offering a unique probe of both the cosmic expansion rate ($H_0$) and the baryon density ($Ω_{\\rm b}$). However, constraints from FRBs alone suffer from a severe $H_0$-$Ω_{\\rm b}$ degeneracy that prevents them from resolving either problem independently. We show that this degeneracy can be broken by combining FRBs with other emerging probes whose degeneracy directions differ in the $H_0$-$Ω_{\\rm b}$ plane. Specifically, we quantify three multi-messenger approaches: FRBs paired with gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens, strong gravitational lensing (SGL) time delays, and 21 cm intensity mapping (IM). The combinations FRB+GW, FRB+SGL, and FRB+21 cm IM each deliver simultaneous constraints on $H_0$ and $Ω_{\\rm b}$ better than ($1\\%$, $1\\%$) in the $Λ$CDM model, ($1.5\\%$, $2\\%$) in the $w$CDM model, and ($2\\%$, $3.5\\%$) in the CPL model. Moreover, in a model-independent framework, both FRB+GW and FRB+SGL constrain $H_0$ and $Ω_{\\rm b}$ to better than ($1\\%$, $2\\%$) precision. These results demonstrate that the synergy between FRBs and other emerging probes holds great promise for resolving the Hubble tension and locating the missing baryons."

Existing workarounds that use synthetic data often introduce a significant domain gap, as they typically rely on low-fidelity SoundFont libraries that lack acoustic diversity. While high-quality one-shot samples offer a better alternative, they are not available in a standardized, large-scale format suitable for training. This paper introduces a new paradigm for ADT that circumvents the need for paired audio-MIDI training data. Our primary contribution is a semi-supervised method to automatically curate a large and diverse corpus of one-shot drum samples from unlabeled audio sources. We then use this corpus to synthesize a high-quality dataset from MIDI files alone, which we use to train a sequence-to-sequence transcription model. We evaluate our model on the ENST and MDB test sets, where it achieves new state-of-the-art results, significantly outperforming both fully supervised methods and previous synthetic-data approaches.

The Lax integrability and conservation laws are exhibited. We also study the stability of the generalised plane wave against small amplitude perturbations.

In this paper, we further generalize the results of Gerbner and Picollelli~(2023) to edge-critical graphs. More precisely, we prove that for an edge-critical graph $G$ with $χ(G) = s+1$, when $s \\ge r \\ge 3$ and $n$ is sufficiently large, the $r$-uniform Turán graph $T_r(n,s)$ is the unique extremal hypergraph."

    "abstract": "We investigate tidal forces, geodesic deviation, and tidal disruption in the black hole spacetime described by the Kalb-Ramond-ModMax solution, where electromagnetic nonlinearity is governed by the parameter $γ$ and Lorentz symmetry violation by the parameter $l$. In the canonical sector ($α=1$), the radial tidal force exhibits a transition marked by a sign inversion between the horizons $r_{-}$ and $r_+$, signaling internal regimes of radial compression analogous to those of charged black holes; the parameter $l$ controls the strength and location of this transition, while $γ$ regulates the nonlinear electromagnetic contribution. The angular tidal force is predominantly compressive, $l$ shaping the effective geometry, and $γ$ acting as a damping factor. In the phantom sector ($α=-1$), tidal forces and geodesic deviation diverge, indicating a tidal instability, with $l$ and $γ$ affecting only the magnitude of the response. We further show that $l$ shifts the relation between the horizon radius $r_+$ and the tidal disruption radius $r_{\\rm Roche}$, thereby modifying the critical (Hills) mass defined by $r_{\\rm Roche}=r_+$. Tidal disruption of neutron stars occurs inside the horizon for supermassive black holes, whereas Sun-like stars are disrupted outside the horizon, with $γ$ becoming relevant only for ultramassive black holes with masses $\\sim 10^{8}M_{\\odot}$. Our results demonstrate that Kalb-Ramon-ModMax effects are largely suppressed for supermassive black holes, but may be relevant for intermediate-mass systems and observable tidal disruption events, offering an indirect probe of Lorentz violation and nonlinear electrodynamics in the strong-field regime."

    "abstract": "The NANOGrav 15-year (NG15) data set provides evidence for a gravitational-wave background (GWB) signal at nanohertz frequencies, which is expected to originate either from a cosmic population of inspiraling supermassive black-hole binaries or new particle physics in the early Universe. A firm identification of the source of the NG15 signal requires an accurate reconstruction of its frequency spectrum. In this paper, we provide such a spectral characterization of the NG15 signal based on a piecewise power-law (PPL) ansatz that strikes a balance between existing alternatives in the literature. Our PPL reconstruction is more flexible than the standard constant-power-law model, which describes the GWB spectrum in terms of only two parameters: an amplitude A and a spectral index gamma. Concurrently, it better approximates physically realistic GWB spectra -- especially those of cosmological origin -- than the free spectral model, since the latter allows for arbitrary variations in the GWB amplitude from one frequency bin to the next. Our PPL reconstruction of the NG15 signal relies on individual PPL models with a fixed number of internal nodes (i.e., constant power law, broken power law, doubly broken power law, etc.) that are ultimately combined in a Bayesian model average. The data products resulting from our analysis provide the basis for fast refits of spectral GWB models."

By leveraging fast polynomial multiplication via the FFT, the algorithm achieves high performance when the product matrix is sparse or contains only a small number of entries with magnitudes significantly larger than the rest. We show empirically that the algorithm is practical and can outperform state-of-the-art DGEMM implementations when the product matrix has few nonzero entries or is otherwise dominated by a small subset of elements with large magnitude. As a minor theoretical contribution, we replace the FFT with the Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform (FWHT) in sketched multiplication, preserving all correctness and variance guarantees of the original algorithm. Experiments with our carefully engineered multithreaded CPU implementation for dense double-precision matrices on 64-core CPU nodes across a range of synthetic benchmarks, exhibiting variable sparsity patterns, show that the FWHT variant is up to 4 times faster than the FFT-based version. Under favorable sparsity and magnitude patterns in the product matrix, our FWHT-based implementation achieves a speedup of up to 40 over DGEMM from Intel MKL, with low probability of error in the estimates. Our implementation is released as free software and comes with NumPy-compatible Python bindings."

The limiting density undergoes a phase transition at an explicitly determined critical value $λ_c$: for $λ<λ_c$, the support consists of a single band region, whereas for $λ>λ_c$ an additional saturated region emerges adjacent to the band region. Our derivation of the limiting distribution is based on three complementary approaches: the method of moments, the analysis of a constrained equilibrium problem, and the asymptotic zero distribution of orthogonal polynomials. As a consequence, we establish the convergence of the empirical measure as well as a large deviation principle. In addition, we derive closed-form expressions for the spectral moments using the combinatorial structure of orthogonal polynomials, and obtain large-$N$ expansions for these moments."

To address limitations of existing LLMs, often caused by insufficient or low-quality Korean data and lack of cultural alignment, Mi:dm 2.0 emphasizes robust data quality through a comprehensive pipeline that includes proprietary data cleansing, high-quality synthetic data generation, strategic data mixing with curriculum learning, and a custom Korean-optimized tokenizer to improve efficiency and coverage. To realize this vision, we offer two complementary configurations: Mi:dm 2.0 Base (11.5B parameters), built with a depth-up scaling strategy for general-purpose use, and Mi:dm 2.0 Mini (2.3B parameters), optimized for resource-constrained environments and specialized tasks. Mi:dm 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on Korean-specific benchmarks, with top-tier zero-shot results on KMMLU and strong internal evaluation results across language, humanities, and social science tasks. The Mi:dm 2.0 lineup is released under the MIT license to support extensive research and commercial use.

Civitai, a popular community-driven platform for AI-generated content, operates a monetized feature called Bounties, which allows users to commission the generation of content in exchange for payment. To examine how this mechanism is used and what content it incentivizes, we conduct a longitudinal analysis of all publicly available bounty requests collected over a 14-month period following the platform's launch. We find that the bounty marketplace is dominated by tools that let users steer AI models toward content they were not trained to generate. At the same time, requests for content that is \"Not Safe For Work\" are widespread and have increased steadily over time, now comprising a majority of all bounties. Participation in bounty creation is uneven, with 20% of requesters accounting for roughly half of requests. Requests for \"deepfake\" - media depicting identifiable real individuals - exhibit a higher concentration than other types of bounties. A nontrivial subset of these requests involves explicit deepfakes despite platform policies prohibiting such content. These bounties disproportionately target female celebrities, revealing a pronounced gender asymmetry in social harm. Together, these findings show how monetized, community-driven generative AI platforms can produce gendered harms, raising questions about consent, governance, and enforcement."

The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential of synthetic anatomical data for improving machine learning-based personalized computed tomography (CT) dosimetry. It is investigated whether the combination of synthetic human body geometries with real patient data can improve model accuracy and generalization for CT organ dose estimation while maintaining the uncertainty requirements outlined in IAEA TRS-457. Deep learning models for organ dose prediction are trained using datasets with varying proportions of real and synthetic data. Synthetic datasets are generated from computational human phantoms with controlled distributions of organ volumes and body. A dedicated model uncertainty evaluation method is implemented to quantify prediction reliability and verify compliance with TRS-457 accuracy limits. Model performance and uncertainty are compared across different training data compositions, including a model trained solely on real patient data. As baseline validated Monte Carlo simulation is used. Models trained solely on synthetic data show limited predictive accuracy, particularly for small or peripheral organs. Incorporating as little as 10 % real patient data significantly improves both statistical accuracy and uncertainty estimates, achieving a performance comparable to that of real-only models. The hybrid training approach improves robustness across different anatomies while maintaining TRS-457-compliant uncertainty levels (k=2 uncertainty < 20% for adults). The results indicate that the combination of real and synthetic data in combination with a systematic uncertainty assessment supports the development of CT dosimetry models and at the same time reduces the amount of real data required."

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has strongly impacted software engineering, leading to a growing number of studies on automated unit test generation. However, the standalone use of LLMs without post-processing has proven insufficient, often producing tests that fail to compile or achieve high coverage. Several techniques have been proposed to address these issues, reporting improvements in test compilation and coverage. While important, LLM-based test generation techniques have been evaluated against relatively weak baselines (for todays' standards), i.e., old LLM versions and relatively weak prompts, which may exacerbate the performance contribution of the approaches. In other words, stronger (newer) LLMs may obviate any advantage these techniques bring. We investigate this issue by replicating four state-of-the-art LLM-based test generation tools, HITS, SymPrompt, TestSpark, and CoverUp that include engineering components aimed at guiding the test generation process through compilation and execution feedback, and evaluate their relative effectiveness and efficiency over a plain LLM test generation method. We integrate current LLM versions in all approaches and run an experiment on 393 classes and 3,657 methods. Our results show that the plain LLM approach can outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches in all test effectiveness metrics we used: line coverage (by 17.72%), branch coverage (by 19.80%) and mutation score (by 20.92%), and it does so at a comparable cost (LLM queries). We also observe that the granularity at which the plain LLM is applied has a significant impact on the cost. We therefore propose targeting first the program classes, where test generation is more efficient, and then the uncovered methods to reduce the number of LLM requests. This strategy achieves comparable (slightly higher) effectiveness while requiring about 20% fewer LLM requests."

Our analysis reveals two crucial characteristics of effective generators: they must accurately respond to their own questions, and their questions must produce sufficient performance differentiation among the model pool. We then show how filtering for these characteristics can improve the quality of generated data. We further propose CASCAL, a novel query-only router that estimates model correctness through consensus voting and identifies model-specific skill niches via hierarchical clustering. CASCAL is substantially more robust to generator quality, outperforming the best query-answer router by 4.6% absolute accuracy when trained on weak generator data."

Reliable inference of the source properties is crucial for accurate interpretation of its astrophysical implications. However, characterization of GW231123 is challenging: only few signal cycles are observed and different signal models result in systematically different parameters. We investigate whether the interpretation of GW231123 is robust against model systematics and Gaussian detector noise. We show that the model systematics observed in GW231123 can be reproduced for a simulated signal based on the numerical-relativity surrogate model NRSur7dq4. Simulating data using the maximum-likelihood NRSur7dq4 waveform for GW231123 and no noise realization, we closely recover the systematics observed for the real signal. We then explore how the headline properties of GW231123 are impacted by Gaussian detector noise. Using the NRSur7dq4 maximum-likelihood waveform and different noise realizations, we consistently find support for large masses, high spin magnitudes (median $χ_1\\geq 0.7$), and high spin precession (median $χ_\\mathrm{p}\\geq 0.68$). The spin in the direction of the angular momentum ($χ_\\mathrm{eff}$) fluctuates more. Finally, again comparing to simulated signals, we show that any differences in the GW231123 inference based on each separate detector are not statistically significant.

    "abstract": "Blind image deconvolution refers to the problem of simultaneously estimating the blur kernel and the true image from a set of observations when both the blur kernel and the true image are unknown. Sometimes, additional image and/or blur information is available and the term semi-blind deconvolution (SBD) is used. We consider a recently introduced Bayesian conjugate hierarchical model for SBD, formulated on an extended cyclic lattice to allow a computationally scalable Gibbs sampler. In this article, we extend this model to the general SBD problem, rewrite the previously proposed Gibbs sampler so that operations are performed in the Fourier domain whenever possible, and introduce a new marginal Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) blur update, obtained by analytically integrating the blur-image joint conditional over the image. The cyclic formulation combined with non-trivial linear algebra manipulations allows a Fourier-based, scalable HMC update, otherwise complicated by the rigid constraints of the SBD problem. Having determined the padding size in the cyclic embedding through a numerical experiment, we compare the mixing and exploration behaviour of the Gibbs and HMC blur updates on simulated data and on a real geophysical seismic imaging problem where we invert a grid with $300\\times50$ nodes, corresponding to a posterior with approximately $80,000$ parameters."

Building on our work~\\cite{r15} that introduced a Clique Lovász Local Lemma (CLLL)-based design principle and a Moser--Tardos (MT)-type constructive approach, this work quantifies the size and structure of the feasible design space. Using the quantitative CLLL, we derive explicit lower bounds on the number of partition matrices satisfying a given family of structure-avoidance constraints, and further obtain bounds on the number of non-equivalent solutions under row/column permutations. Moreover, via Rényi-entropy bounds for the MT distribution, we provide a computable lower bound on the number of distinct solutions that the MT algorithm can output, giving a concrete diversity guarantee for randomized constructions. Specializations for eliminating 4-cycle candidates yield closed-form bounds as functions of system parameters, offering a principled way to size memory/lifting and to estimate the remaining search space."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "We present a closed-form surrogate for the equivalent diameter of the Kerr black-hole shadow, defined as the diameter of the circle with the same area as the shadow's critical curve. The construction enforces the exact face-on (polar) limit by explicitly separating an analytically computed polar contribution based on the spherical photon-orbit branch where the horizontal impact parameter vanishes. The remaining inclination dependence is captured by a compact 15-parameter polynomial placed inside an exponential correction. The coefficients are determined by ordinary least squares on a deterministic reference grid generated from the Kerr critical-curve area. Over the practical domain of dimensionless spin from 0 to 0.998 and inclination from just above 0 degrees up to 90 degrees (with the exactly polar point treated analytically), the surrogate achieves sub-percent accuracy. On the training grid the median absolute percent error is 0.0105 percent with a worst case of 0.782 percent, and on a denser out-of-sample validation set (including inclinations down to 0.5 degrees) the median, 95th-percentile, and worst-case errors are 0.023 percent, 0.471 percent, and 1.64 percent, respectively. The resulting expression provides fast evaluations of the shadow size without numerical ray tracing, making it convenient for repeated calls in parameter inference and rapid model comparisons."

    "abstract": "The exchange bias (EB) effect, arising from interfacial coupling between ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AF) layers, induces a unidirectional magnetic anisotropy and underpins a wide range of spintronic functionalities. Extending the EB effect to three-dimensional (3D) architectures enables investigation of interfacial coupling in non-planar structures, which is a key step toward realizing spintronic functionalities beyond planar systems. Achieving this requires the fabrication of FM/AF bilayers with smooth interfaces and well-defined thicknesses on non-planar scaffolds, together with suitable characterization methods. In this work, we realize exchange-biased 3D FM/AF microwires by combining two-photon lithography with magnetron sputtering. CoFe/IrMn bilayers are deposited on microwire scaffolds with inclination angles of 0 deg, 30 deg, 45 deg relative to the substrate, and their magnetization reversal is probed using dark-field magneto-optical Kerr effect (DF-MOKE) magnetometry. We find that the EB and coercive fields vary in a characteristic way with the inclination angle, consistent with the systematic reduction in film thickness expected from inclined directional deposition. In addition, the EB magnitude is influenced by the combined effects of surface roughness of non-planar geometries and the directional growth of the bilayer, highlighting the importance of 3D scaffold surface quality for integrating magnetic multilayers. These results provide insight into the growth and magnetic behavior of sputter-deposited magnetic multilayers with functional interfaces on 3D geometries."

    "abstract": "Recent studies report a mild discrepancy between baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements within the $Λ$CDM framework. This discrepancy could be explained if the optical depth $τ$ inferred from the CMB large-scale E-mode polarization is underestimated, which may be biased by foreground-subtraction or instrumental systematics. In this work, we present a determination of $τ$ independent of the large-scale E-mode polarization, using the latest measurements of the redshift evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction $x_\\mathrm{HI}(z)$, which is constrained by Lyman-$α$ forest and damping-wing absorption measurements at $z\\sim5$-$14$, based on ground-based optical and JWST observations. Combining $x_\\mathrm{HI}(z)$ with the Planck CMB power spectra excluding the large-scale E-mode polarization, we obtain $τ=0.0552^{+0.0019}_{-0.0026}$, a stringent constraint consistent with the previous CMB results including the large-scale E-mode. We also evaluate a potential systematic error in our method associated with absorption modeling, obtaining $τ=0.0552^{+0.0075}_{-0.0049}$. Using this constraint on $τ$, we resolve the degeneracy in the $τ$-$Ω_m$ plane and find a $2.4σ$ tension with the DESI DR2 BAO results, thereby confirming the claimed mild discrepancy suggestive of physics beyond $Λ$CDM. Finally, we derive an upper limit on the sum of neutrino masses, $Σm_ν<0.0550\\,(0.0717)$ eV at the 95% (99%) confidence level. This limit favors the normal mass ordering and, when combined with the lower limits from neutrino oscillation experiments, yields a further constraint, $Σm_ν=0.0594_{-0.0007}^{+0.0113}$ eV. However, the cosmological upper limit and the oscillation-based lower limit show a mild $2.2σ$ tension, providing an independent indication of possible physics beyond $Λ$CDM."

To facilitate this study, we introduce AndroidIntent, a benchmark designed to evaluate agents' ability in resolving vague instructions and providing proactive suggestions through reasoning over long-term user records. We annotated 775 user-specific preferences and 215 routines from 20k long-term records across different users for evaluation. Furthermore, we introduce Hierarchical Intent Memory Agent (HIM-Agent), which maintains a continuously updating personal memory and hierarchically organizes user preferences and routines for personalization. Finally, we evaluate a range of GUI agents on AndroidIntent, including GPT-5, Qwen3-VL, and UI-TARS, further results show that HIM-Agent significantly improves both execution and proactive performance by 15.7% and 7.3%."

    "abstract": "Machine unlearning is becoming essential for building trustworthy and compliant language models. Yet unlearning success varies considerably across individual samples: some are reliably erased, while others persist despite the same procedure. We argue that this disparity is not only a data-side phenomenon, but also reflects model-internal mechanisms that encode and protect memorized information. We study this problem from a mechanistic perspective based on model circuits--structured interaction pathways that govern how predictions are formed. We propose Circuit-guided Unlearning Difficulty (CUD), a {\\em pre-unlearning} metric that assigns each sample a continuous difficulty score using circuit-level signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CUD reliably separates intrinsically easy and hard samples, and remains stable across unlearning methods. We identify key circuit-level patterns that reveal a mechanistic signature of difficulty: easy-to-unlearn samples are associated with shorter, shallower interactions concentrated in earlier-to-intermediate parts of the original model, whereas hard samples rely on longer and deeper pathways closer to late-stage computation. Compared to existing qualitative studies, CUD takes a first step toward a principled, fine-grained, and interpretable analysis of unlearning difficulty; and motivates the development of unlearning methods grounded in model mechanisms."

Recent studies suggest that AI disclosures can lead to a ``transparency dilemma'', where disclosure reduces readers' trust. However, little is known about how the \\textit{level of detail} in AI disclosures influences trust and contributes to this dilemma within the news context. In this 3$\\times$2$\\times$2 mixed factorial study with 40 participants, we investigate how three levels of AI disclosures (none, one-line, detailed) across two types of news (politics and lifestyle) and two levels of AI involvement (low and high) affect news readers' trust. We measured trust using the News Media Trust questionnaire, along with two decision behaviors: source-checking and subscription decisions. Questionnaire responses and subscription rates showed a decline in trust only for detailed AI disclosures, whereas source-checking behavior increased for both one-line and detailed disclosures, with the effect being more pronounced for detailed disclosures. Insights from semi-structured interviews suggest that source-checking behavior was primarily driven by interest in the topic, followed by trust, whereas trust was the main factor influencing subscription decisions. Around two-thirds of participants expressed a preference for detailed disclosures, while most participants who preferred one-line indicated a need for detail-on-demand disclosure formats. Our findings show that not all AI disclosures lead to a transparency dilemma, but instead reflect a trade-off between readers' desire for more transparency and their trust in AI-assisted news content."

Nevertheless, a side effect is the appearance of a helical striations in the particle and heat loads onto divertor targets. The extent and field line connection of these striations is significantly altered by the plasma response to external perturbations. For an ELM suppressed H-mode plasma at KSTAR, magnetic footprints are computed by FLARE based on plasma response from GPEC, MARS-F, M3D-C1 and JOREK with substantial differences in the resulting footprints (from 2 cm to 14 cm). This is reflected in EMC3-EIRENE simulations of the resulting heat loads: it is found that either the peak value or the extent of the striations appear to be overestimated compared to IRTV measurements. Reasonable agreement can only be achieved for the smallest footprint for lower input power and lower cross-field transport, or for higher upstream density and radiative power losses."

    "abstract": "Reproducing system-level concurrency bugs requires both input data and the precise interleaving order of system calls. This process is challenging because such bugs are non-deterministic, and bug reports often lack the detailed information needed. Additionally, the unstructured nature of reports written in natural language makes it difficult to extract necessary details. Existing tools are inadequate to reproduce these bugs due to their inability to manage the specific interleaving at the system call level. To address these challenges, we propose SysPro, a novel approach that automatically extracts relevant system call names from bug reports and identifies their locations in the source code. It generates input data by utilizing information retrieval, regular expression matching, and the category-partition method. This extracted input and interleaving data are then used to reproduce bugs through dynamic source code instrumentation. Our empirical study on real-world benchmarks demonstrates that SysPro is both effective and efficient at localizing and reproducing system-level concurrency bugs from bug reports."

Despite its broad adoption, little is known about the challenges users face during the development and maintenance of these pipelines. This paper presents an empirical study of 25,173 issues and pull requests from these pipelines to uncover recurring challenges, management practices, and perceived difficulties.

We then examine issue resolution dynamics, showing that 89.38\\% of issues and pull requests are eventually closed, with half resolved within three days. Statistical analysis reveals that the presence of labels (large effect, $δ$ = 0.94) and code snippets (medium effect, $δ$ = 0.50) significantly improve resolution likelihood. Further analysis reveals that tool development and repository maintenance poses the most significant challenges, followed by testing pipelines and CI configurations, and debugging containerized pipelines. Overall, this study provides actionable insights into the collaborative development and maintenance of nf-core pipelines, highlighting opportunities to enhance their usability, sustainability, and reproducibility."

They enable users to translate their physical movements into corresponding avatar movements in real-time, allowing them to perceive their avatars via the displays. Consumer-grade IVR systems have been available for 10 years, significantly fostering VR research worldwide. However, the effects of even apparently significant technological advances of IVR systems on user experience and the overall validity of prior embodiment research using such systems often remain unclear. We ran a user-centered study comparing two comparable IVR generations: a nearly 10-year-old hardware (HTC Vive, 6-point tracking) and a modern counterpart (HTC Vive Pro 2, 6-point tracking). To ensure ecological validity, we evaluated the systems in their commercially available, as-is configurations. In a 2x5 mixed design, participants completed five tasks covering different use cases on either the old or new system. We assessed presence, sense of embodiment, appearance and behavior plausibility, workload, task performance, and gathered qualitative feedback. Results showed no significant system differences, with only small effect sizes. Bayesian analysis further supported the null hypothesis, suggesting that the investigated generational hardware improvements offer limited benefits for user experience and task performance. For the 10-year generational step examined here, excluding potential technological progress in the necessary software components, this supports the validity of conclusions from prior work and underscores the applicability of older configurations for research in embodied VR."

To bridge this gap, we propose MANGO -- an unpaired image translation method with a novel segmentation-conditioned InfoNCE loss, a highly-regularized discriminator design, and a modified PatchNCE loss. We find that these elements are crucial for maintaining viewpoint consistency during sim2real translation. When training MANGO, we only require a small amount of fixed-camera data from the real world, but show that our method can generate diverse unseen viewpoints by translating simulated observations. In this domain, MANGO outperforms all other image translation methods we tested. Imitation-learning policies trained on data augmented by MANGO are able to achieve success rates as high as 60\\% on views that the non-augmented policy fails completely on."

These concerns are particularly serious and urgent today in light of the rising levels of democratic erosion worldwide, the emerging capabilities of generative AI technologies such as AI persuasion, and the increasing concentration of economic and political power in the hands of Big Tech. This raises the question of what alternative IA infrastructure we must reimagine and build to mitigate the risks of authoritarian capture of our information ecosystems. We explore this question through the lens of Paulo Freire's theories of emancipatory pedagogy. Freire's theories provide a radically different lens for exploring IA's sociotechnical concerns relative to the current dominating frames of fairness, accountability, confidentiality, transparency, and safety. We make explicit, with the intention to challenge, the dichotomy of how we relate to technology as either technologists (who envision and build technology) and its users. We posit that this mirrors the teacher-student relationship in Freire's analysis. By extending Freire's analysis to IA, we challenge the notion that it is the burden of the (altruistic) technologists to come up with interventions to mitigate the risks that emerging technologies pose to marginalized communities. Instead, we advocate that the first task for the technologists is to pose these as problems to the marginalized communities, to encourage them to make and unmake the technology as part of their material struggle against oppression. Their second task is to redesign our online technology stacks to structurally expose spaces for community members to co-opt and co-construct the technology in aid of their emancipatory struggles. We operationalize Freire's theories to develop a problem-posing framework for envisioning emancipatory IA platforms of the future."

In this regime, electrons can reach relativistic velocities. We extend linear theory to the nonlinear regime, showing that plasma waves can reach the wave-breaking limit. Perfectly collimated drivers produce wakes propagating at the speed of light, allowing electron phase-locking (limited by driver depletion). Non-collimated drivers induce subluminal phase velocities, limiting acceleration via dephasing. Two-dimensional simulations reveal unique transverse fields compared to laser wakefields, with a DC magnetic field leading to consistent focusing. The work considers observational prospects in laboratory and astrophysical scenarios such as around highly luminous compact objects (e.g., pulsars, gamma-ray bursts) interacting with tenuous interstellar or intergalactic plasmas, where conditions favor Comptondominated wakefield acceleration."

Deep generative models have been explored, but most rely solely on image intensity, leading to two key limitations: 1) the fidelity or trustworthiness of the generated brain images are limited, making downstream studies questionable; 2) the usage flexibility is restricted due to fixed guidance rooted in the model structure, restricting full ability to versatile application scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DF-DiffCom, a Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)-enhanced diffusion model that smartly leverages deformation fields for trustworthy longitudinal brain image completion. Trained on OASIS-3, DF-DiffCom outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving PSNR by 5.6% and SSIM by 0.12. More importantly, its modality-agnostic nature allows smooth extension to varied MRI modalities, even to attribute maps such as brain tissue segmentation results."

    "abstract": "Autonomous systems conducting schema-grounded information-gathering dialogues face an instrumentation gap, lacking turn-level observables for monitoring acquisition efficiency and detecting when questioning becomes unproductive. We introduce Dialogue Telemetry (DT), a measurement framework that produces two model-agnostic signals after each question-answer exchange: (i) a Progress Estimator (PE) quantifying residual information potential per category (with a bits-based variant), and (ii) a Stalling Index (SI) detecting an observable failure signature characterized by repeated category probing with semantically similar, low-marginal-gain responses. SI flags this pattern without requiring causal diagnosis, supporting monitoring in settings where attributing degradation to specific causes may be impractical. We validate DT in controlled search-and-rescue (SAR)-inspired interviews using large language model (LLM)-based simulations, distinguishing efficient from stalled dialogue traces and illustrating downstream utility by integrating DT signals into a reinforcement learning (RL) policy. Across these settings, DT provides interpretable turn-level instrumentation that improves policy performance when stalling carries operational costs."

    "abstract": "How do religious identities change? We study the effects of civic education reforms on religious identification using Colombia's 1991 Constitution, which dismantled the country's confessional regime and mandated constitutional instruction in high schools. Exploiting cohort-based variation in exposure to the reform and nationally representative survey data, we implement a difference-in-differences design. We find that exposure to the constitutional curriculum reduced Catholic self-identification by about three percentage points. This decline reflects a reallocation of religious identities rather than a generalized decline in religiosity. In regions where Catholic institutional presence was historically weaker, Catholic losses translate into switching toward non-Catholic Christian denominations and higher religious attendance. In contrast, in regions where Catholic dominance was stronger, the decline is associated with increased secular identification and lower attendance. These patterns hold across ethnic and non-ethnic groups and are shaped primarily by regional religious supply rather than ethnicity per se. Overall, the results show that civic education can reconfigure religious identities by reshaping the relative legitimacy of competing affiliations."

    "abstract": "The Berry phase, a fundamental geometric phase in quantum systems, has become a crucial tool for probing the topological properties of materials. Quantum oscillations, such as Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations, are widely used to extract this phase, but its unambiguous determination remains challenging. This work highlights the inherent ambiguities in interpreting the oscillation phase solely from SdH data, primarily due to the influence of the spin factor $R_S$, which depends on the Landé $g$-factor and effective mass. While the Lifshitz-Kosevich (LK) theory provides a framework for analyzing oscillations, the unknown g-factor introduces significant uncertainty. For instance, a zero oscillation phase could arise either from a nontrivial Berry phase or a negative $R_S$. We demonstrate that neglecting $R_S$ in modern studies, especially for topological materials with strong spin-orbit coupling, can lead to doubtful conclusions. Through theoretical analysis and numerical examples, we show how the interplay between the Berry phase and Zeeman effect complicates phase determination. Additionally, we also discuss another underappreciated mechanism - the magnetic field dependence of the Fermi level. Our discussion underscores the need for complementary experimental techniques to resolve these ambiguities and calls for further research to refine the interpretation of quantum oscillations in topological systems."

We derive analytic expressions for a wide range of helicity configurations, including both Standard Model contributions and generic new-physics effects parametrised by scalar, vector, and tensor four-fermion operators within an effective field theory framework.

We demonstrate that obsolete Bitcoin mining Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) can be repurposed to create a secure, low-cost, and energy-efficient medical records system. The proposed architecture employs a four-tier hierarchical network: regional hospitals using Antminer S19 Pro (90+ TH/s), urban health centers with Antminer S9 (14 TH/s), rural clinics equipped with Lucky Miner LV06 (500 GH/s, 13W), and mobile health points with portable ASIC devices. We introduce the Deterministic Hardware Fingerprinting (DHF) paradigm, which repurposes SHA-256 mining ASICs as cryptographic proof generators, achieving 100% verification rate across 23 test proofs during 300-second validation sessions. The system incorporates Reed-Solomon LSB watermarking for medical image authentication with 30-40% damage tolerance, semantic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for intelligent medical record queries, and offline synchronization protocols for intermittent connectivity. Economic analysis demonstrates 96% cost reduction compared to GPU-based alternatives, with total deployment cost of $847 per rural clinic including 5-year solar power infrastructure. Validation experiments on Lucky Miner LV06 (BM1366 chip, 5nm) achieve 2.93 MH/W efficiency and confirm hardware universality. This work establishes a practical framework for deploying verifiable, tamper-proof electronic health records in regions where traditional healthcare IT infrastructure is economically unfeasible, potentially benefiting over 600 million people lacking access to basic health information systems."

In this framework, a CAD $\\mathscr{C}$ is adapted to a given set $S$ if $S$ is a union of cells of $\\mathscr{C}$. Different algorithms computing an adapted CAD may produce different outputs, usually with redundant cell divisions. In this paper we analyse the possibility to remove the superfluous data.

In contrast, for any $n \\geq 3$, we provide explicit examples of semi-algebraic sets whose associated poset of adapted CADs does not admit a minimum.

    "abstract": "Spatiotemporal vector retrieval has emerged as a critical paradigm in modern information retrieval, enabling efficient access to massive, heterogeneous data that evolve over both time and space. However, existing spatiotemporal retrieval methods are often extensions of conventional vector search systems that rely on external filters or specialized indices to incorporate temporal and spatial constraints, leading to inefficiency, architectural complexity, and limited flexibility in handling heterogeneous modalities. To overcome these challenges, we present a unified spatiotemporal vector retrieval framework that integrates temporal, spatial, and semantic cues within a coherent similarity space while maintaining scalability and adaptability to continuous data streams. Specifically, we propose (1) a Rotary-based Unified Encoding Method that embeds time and location into rotational position vectors for consistent spatiotemporal representation; (2) a Circular Incremental Update Mechanism that supports efficient sliding-window updates without global re-encoding or index reconstruction; and (3) a Weighted Interest-based Retrieval Algorithm that adaptively balances modality weights for context-aware and personalized retrieval. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both retrieval accuracy and efficiency, while maintaining robustness under dynamic data evolution. These results highlight the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed approach for scalable spatiotemporal information retrieval in intelligent systems."

However, the realization of high-performance functional nanostructures presents formidable challenges due to the difficulty of applying conventional nanofabrication methods to such sensitive materials, making the search for alternative methods a key enabling factor. Since YBCO's superconducting and normal-state properties are highly dependent on oxygen stoichiometry, precise nanoscale control of the oxygen content represents a highly appealing approach for creating advanced nanoengineered devices. In this work, we demonstrate the precise fabrication of sub-micrometer, grayscale patterns over large areas in epitaxial YBCO thin films, achieving finely tuned optical and superconducting transport properties by locally controlling the stoichiometry through maskless direct laser writing under ambient conditions. Cryogenic magneto-optical imaging and transport measurements in irradiated devices directly demonstrate the spatial tuning of the critical temperature and carrier density with the patterning conditions. Correlated Raman microscopy and reflectometry of the patterned regions indicate a laser-power dependent oxygen depletion in the irradiated regions. The proposed laser-controlled stoichiometry approach provides a direct and scalable method to navigate the phase diagram of high-Tc superconducting oxides, offering new possibilities for integrating functional nanostructures into superconducting devices."

To address this gap, we propose Task-to-Quiz (T2Q), a deterministic and automated evaluation paradigm designed to decouple task execution from world-state understanding. We instantiate this paradigm in T2QBench, a suite comprising 30 environments and 1,967 grounded QA pairs across multiple difficulty levels. Our extensive experiments reveal that task success is often a poor proxy for environment understanding, and that current memory machanism can not effectively help agents acquire a grounded model of the environment. These findings identify proactive exploration and fine-grained state representation as primary bottlenecks, offering a robust foundation for developing more generalizable autonomous agents."

While point maps assume static scenes, Dynamic Point Maps (DPMs) extend this concept to dynamic 3D content by additionally representing scene motion. However, existing DPMs are limited to image pairs and, like DUSt3R, require post processing via optimization when more than two views are involved. We argue that DPMs are more useful when applied to videos and introduce V-DPM to demonstrate this. First, we show how to formulate DPMs for video input in a way that maximizes representational power, facilitates neural prediction, and enables reuse of pretrained models. Second, we implement these ideas on top of VGGT, a recent and powerful 3D reconstructor. Although VGGT was trained on static scenes, we show that a modest amount of synthetic data is sufficient to adapt it into an effective V-DPM predictor. Our approach achieves state of the art performance in 3D and 4D reconstruction for dynamic scenes. In particular, unlike recent dynamic extensions of VGGT such as P3, DPMs recover not only dynamic depth but also the full 3D motion of every point in the scene."

We study cross-dataset object detection (CD-OD) through a lens of setting specificity. We group benchmarks into setting-agnostic datasets with diverse everyday scenes and setting-specific datasets tied to a narrow environment, and evaluate a standard detector family across all train--test pairs. This reveals a clear structure in CD-OD: transfer within the same setting type is relatively stable, while transfer across setting types drops substantially and is often asymmetric. The most severe breakdowns occur when transferring from specific sources to agnostic targets, and persist after open-label alignment, indicating that domain shift dominates in the hardest regimes. To disentangle domain shift from label mismatch, we compare closed-label transfer with an open-label protocol that maps predicted classes to the nearest target label using CLIP similarity. Open-label evaluation yields consistent but bounded gains, and many corrected cases correspond to semantic near-misses supported by the image evidence. Overall, we provide a principled characterization of CD-OD under setting specificity and practical guidance for evaluating detectors under distribution shift.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel framework for disturbance rejection in a class of nonautonomous nonlinear systems affected by trigonometric-polynomial disturbances. The core of our approach is the design of a canonical internal model that directly converts the disturbance rejection problem into an adaptive stabilization problem for an augmented system. Unlike conventional methods, this internal model is synthesized directly from the given nonlinear plant and the knowledge of the exosystem, without relying on the solution of the regulator equations. This makes the approach applicable to a significantly broader class of nonautonomous nonlinear systems. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive disturbance observer comprising the canonical nonlinear internal model, a Luenberger-type state observer, and a parameter adaptation law. This observer ensures global asymptotic convergence of the disturbance estimate to the true disturbance without requiring persistent excitation (PE). Under the PE condition, both the disturbance estimation error and the parameter estimation error converge exponentially. By incorporating the disturbance estimate as a feedforward compensation signal, we establish sufficient conditions for achieving global trajectory tracking and asymptotic disturbance rejection. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a numerical simulation of a flexible-joint robotic manipulator."

    "abstract": "Topographic models are essential for characterizing planetary surfaces and for inferring underlying geological processes. Nevertheless, meter-scale topographic data remain limited, which constrains detailed planetary investigations, even for the Moon, where extensive high-resolution orbital images are available. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) exploit single-view imagery, constrained by low-resolution topography, for fast and flexible reconstruction of fine-scale topography. However, their robustness and general applicability across diverse lunar landforms and illumination conditions remain insufficiently explored. In this study, we build upon our previously proposed DL framework by incorporating a more robust scale recovery scheme and extending the model to polar regions under low solar illumination conditions. We demonstrate that, compared with single-view shape-from-shading methods, the proposed DL approach exhibits greater robustness to varying illumination and achieves more consistent and accurate topographic reconstructions. Furthermore, it reliably reconstructs topography across lunar features of diverse scales, morphologies, and geological ages. High-quality topographic models are also produced for the lunar south polar areas, including permanently shadowed regions, demonstrating the method's capability in reconstructing complex and low-illumination terrain. These findings suggest that DL-based approaches have the potential to leverage extensive lunar datasets to support advanced exploration missions and enable investigations of the Moon at unprecedented topographic resolution."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a two-scale spatial deployment strategy to ensure reliable coverage for multiple target areas, integrating macroscopic intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) and fine-grained movable antennas (MAs). Specifically, IRSs are selectively deployed from candidate sites to shape the propagation geometry, while MAs are locally repositioned among discretized locations to exploit small-scale channel variations. The objective is to minimize the total deployment cost of MAs and IRSs by jointly optimizing the IRS site selection, MA positions, transmit precoding, and IRS phase shifts, subject to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirements for all target areas. This leads to a challenging mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem that is intractable to solve directly. To address this, we first formulate an auxiliary problem to verify the feasibility. A penalty-based double-loop algorithm integrating alternating optimization and successive convex approximation (SCA) is developed to solve this feasibility issue, which is subsequently adapted to obtain a suboptimal solution for the original cost minimization problem. Finally, based on the obtained solution, we formulate an element refinement problem to further reduce the deployment cost, which is solved by a penalty-based SCA algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed designs consistently outperform benchmarks relying on independent area planning or full IRS deployment in terms of cost-efficiency. Moreover, for cost minimization, MA architectures are preferable in large placement apertures, whereas fully populated FPA architectures excel in compact ones; for worst-case SNR maximization, MA architectures exhibit a lower cost threshold for feasibility, while FPA architectures can attain peak SNR at a lower total cost."

    "abstract": "In collaborative learning (CL), multiple parties jointly train a machine learning model on their private datasets. However, data can not be shared directly due to privacy concerns. To ensure input confidentiality, cryptographic techniques, e.g., multi-party computation (MPC), enable training on encrypted data. Yet, even securely trained models are vulnerable to inference attacks aiming to extract memorized data from model outputs. To ensure output privacy and mitigate inference attacks, differential privacy (DP) injects calibrated noise during training. While cryptography and DP offer complementary guarantees, combining them efficiently for cryptographic and differentially private CL (CPCL) is challenging. Cryptography incurs performance overheads, while DP degrades accuracy, creating a privacy-accuracy-performance trade-off that needs careful design considerations. This work systematizes the CPCL landscape. We introduce a unified framework that generalizes common phases across CPCL paradigms, and identify secure noise sampling as the foundational phase to achieve CPCL. We analyze trade-offs of different secure noise sampling techniques, noise types, and DP mechanisms discussing their implementation challenges and evaluating their accuracy and cryptographic overhead across CPCL paradigms. Additionally, we implement identified secure noise sampling options in MPC and evaluate their computation and communication costs in WAN and LAN. Finally, we propose future research directions based on identified key observations, gaps and possible enhancements in the literature."

Each code coordinate (node) is assumed to store an array of $\\ell$ symbols, where $\\ell$ is termed as sub-packetization. Large sub-packetization tends to induce high complexity, large input/output in practice. To address the disk IO capability, a cooperative MSR code is said to have optimal-access property, if during node repair, the amount of data accessed at each helper node meets a theoretical lower bound. In this paper, we focus on reducing the sub-packetization of optimal-access cooperative MSR codes with two erasures. At first, we design two crucial MDS array codes for repairing a specific repair pattern of two erasures with optimal access. Then, using the two codes as building blocks and by stacking up of the two codes for several times, we obtain an optimal-access cooperative MSR code with two erasures. The derived code has sub-packetization $\\ell=r^{\\binom{n}{2}-\\lfloor\\frac{n}{r}\\rfloor(\\binom{r}{2}-1)}$ where $r=n-k$, and it reduces $\\ell$ by a fraction of $1/r^{\\lfloor\\frac{n}{r}\\rfloor(\\binom{r}{2}-1)}$ compared with the state of the art ($\\ell=r^{\\binom{n}{2}}$)."

For ions with a $Λ$ level structure, driven by Raman lasers, we identify an ion-number-dependent crossover between weak and strong coupling where both the cooling rate and final temperature are simultaneously optimized. We obtain simple analytic results in both extremes: In the weak coupling limit, we show a Lorentzian spin-absorption spectrum determines the cooling rate and final occupation of the motional state, which are both independent of the number of ions. We also highlight the benefit of including an additional spin dependent force in this case. In the strong coupling regime, our theory reveals the role of collective dynamics arising from phonon exchange between dark and bright states, allowing us to explain the enhancement of the cooling rate with increasing ion number. Our analytic results agree closely with exact numerical simulations and provide experimentally accessible guidelines for optimizing cooling in large ion crystals, a key step toward scalable, high-fidelity trapped-ion quantum technologies."

To extract generalizable out-of-band (OOB) channel features from multi-modal sensing, we introduce ContraSoM, a contrastive pre-training strategy. Once pre-trained, WiFo-M$^2$ infers future OOB channel features from historical sensor data and strengthens feature robustness via modality-specific data augmentation.

    "abstract": "Agile control of robotic systems often requires anticipating how the environment affects system behavior. For example, a driver must perceive the road ahead to anticipate available friction and plan actions accordingly. Achieving such proactive adaptation within autonomous frameworks remains a challenge, particularly under rapidly changing conditions. Traditional modeling approaches often struggle to capture abrupt variations in system behavior, while adaptive methods are inherently reactive and may adapt too late to ensure safety. We propose a vision-conditioned variational Bayesian last-layer dynamics model that leverages visual context to anticipate changes in the environment. The model first learns nominal vehicle dynamics and is then fine-tuned with feature-wise affine transformations of latent features, enabling context-aware dynamics prediction. The resulting model is integrated into an optimal controller for vehicle racing. We validate our method on a Lexus LC500 racing through water puddles. With vision-conditioning, the system completed all 12 attempted laps under varying conditions. In contrast, all baselines without visual context consistently lost control, demonstrating the importance of proactive dynamics adaptation in high-performance applications."

To address this problem, we propose a differential stream sensing framework that reframes the problem from estimating the total stream count to isolating newly activated streams via covariance differencing. We analyze the covariance deviation induced by channel variations to establish a theoretical bound based on channel correlation for determining the sensing window size. To mitigate residual interference from finite sampling, a deep learning (DL) classifier is integrated. Simulations across both independent and identically distributed flat Rayleigh fading and standardized channel environments demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms non-DL baselines and remains robust in overloaded scenarios."

Although recent approaches such as Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) and Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR) alleviate these issues to some extent, they still suffer from retrieval accuracy degradation. This paper proposes \\emph{Isolation Kernel Embedding} or IKE, a learning-free method that transforms an LLM embedding into a binary embedding using Isolation Kernel (IK). IKE is an ensemble of diverse (random) partitions, enabling robust estimation of ideal kernel in the LLM embedding space, thus reducing retrieval accuracy loss as the ensemble grows. Lightweight and based on binary encoding, it offers low memory footprint and fast bitwise computation, lowering retrieval latency. Experiments on multiple text retrieval datasets demonstrate that IKE offers up to 16.7x faster retrieval and 16x lower memory usage than LLM embeddings, while maintaining comparable or better accuracy. Compared to CSR and other compression methods, IKE consistently achieves the best balance between retrieval efficiency and effectiveness."

Here, we establish both spatial and spatiotemporal topologies in a newly discovered type-II hyperbolic lattice possessing outer and inner edges. Using electric circuits, we experimentally realize a type-II hyperbolic Chern insulator and directly observe degenerate chiral edge states of opposite chirality at its outer and inner edges. Furthermore, by coupling these counter-propagating chiral edge states, we demonstrate an anti-time-parity phase transition, enabling dynamic transfer between them in arbitrary proportions. Finally, we propose a novel paradigm for constructing a (2+1)-dimensional hyperbolic space-time crystal, which hosts an intertwined topology of spatial Chern and temporal winding numbers, resulting in a unique space-time topological string state.

    "abstract": "The rapid development of generative AI has brought value- and ethics-related risks to the forefront, making value safety a critical concern while a unified consensus remains lacking. In this work, we propose an internationally inclusive and resilient unified value framework, the GenAI Value Safety Scale (GVS-Scale): Grounded in a lifecycle-oriented perspective, we develop a taxonomy of GenAI value safety risks and construct the GenAI Value Safety Incident Repository (GVSIR), and further derive the GVS-Scale through grounded theory and operationalize it via the GenAI Value Safety Benchmark (GVS-Bench). Experiments on mainstream text generation models reveal substantial variation in value safety performance across models and value categories, indicating uneven and fragmented value alignment in current systems. Our findings highlight the importance of establishing shared safety foundations through dialogue and advancing technical safety mechanisms beyond reactive constraints toward more flexible approaches.

    "abstract": "Few-shot semantic segmentation of time-series remote sensing images remains a critical challenge, particularly in regions where labeled data is scarce or costly to obtain. While state-of-the-art models perform well under full supervision, their performance degrades significantly under limited labeling, limiting their real-world applicability. In this work, we propose SAM-Aug, a new annotation-efficient framework that leverages the geometry-aware segmentation capability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to improve few-shot land cover mapping. Our approach constructs cloud-free composite images from temporal sequences and applies SAM in a fully unsupervised manner to generate geometry-aware mask priors. These priors are then integrated into training through a proposed loss function called RegionSmoothLoss, which enforces prediction consistency within each SAM-derived region across temporal frames, effectively regularizing the model to respect semantically coherent structures. Extensive experiments on the PASTIS-R benchmark under a 5 percent labeled setting demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SAM-Aug. Averaged over three random seeds (42, 2025, 4090), our method achieves a mean test mIoU of 36.21 percent, outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline by +2.33 percentage points, a relative improvement of 6.89 percent. Notably, on the most favorable split (seed=42), SAM-Aug reaches a test mIoU of 40.28 percent, representing an 11.2 percent relative gain with no additional labeled data. The consistent improvement across all seeds confirms the generalization power of leveraging foundation model priors under annotation scarcity. Our results highlight that vision models like SAM can serve as useful regularizers in few-shot remote sensing learning, offering a scalable and plug-and-play solution for land cover monitoring without requiring manual annotations or model fine-tuning."

Most existing soft grippers are pneumatically actuated with several hundred kPa pressure, and cannot generate output force sufficient for such a large and heavy object. Instead of pneumatic actuation, hydraulic actuation has a potential to generate much larger power by several MPa pressure. In this study, we develop a hydraulically-driven soft gripper, in which its basic design parameters are determined based on a mathematical model that represents the relationship among the driving pressure, bending angle, object mass and grasping force. Moreover, we selected materials suitable for grasping a heavier object, based on the finite element analysis result of the detailed design. We report experimental results on a 20 kg object grasping and closed-loop control of the finger bending angle."

    "abstract": "The move to next-generation wireless communications with extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) brings the communications into the radiative near-field (RNF) region, where distance-aware focusing is feasible. However, high-frequency RNF links are highly vulnerable to blockage in indoor environments dominated by half-space obstacles (walls, corners) that create knife-edge shadows. Conventional near-field focused beams offer high gain in line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios but suffer from severe energy truncation and effective-rank collapse in shadowed regions, making hardware remedies such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) impractical. We propose a beamforming strategy that exploits the auto-bending property of Airy beams to mitigate half-space blockage without additional hardware. The Airy beam is designed to ``ride'' the diffraction edge, accelerating its main lobe into the shadow to restore connectivity. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a Green's function-based RNF multi-user channel model that analytically reveals singular-value collapse behind knife-edge obstacles; (ii) an Airy analog beamforming scheme that optimizes the bending trajectory to recover the effective channel rank; and (iii) an Airy null-steering method that aligns oscillatory nulls with bright-region users to suppress interference in mixed shadow/bright scenarios. Simulations show that the proposed edge-riding Airy strategy achieves an SNR improvement of over 20 dB and restores full-rank connectivity in shadowed links compared to conventional RNF focusing, virtually eliminating outage in geometric shadows and increasing multi-user spectral efficiency by approximately 35\\% under typical indoor ELAA configurations. These results demonstrate robust RNF multi-user access in half-space blockage scenarios without relying on RIS."

Recent advances in artificial intelligence enable data-driven modeling frameworks capable of supporting automated decision-making in construction quality control. This study leverages an industry-scale dataset consisting of approximately 70,000 compressive strength test records to evaluate and compare multiple predictive approaches, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, transformer-based neural networks, and embedding-based neural networks. The models incorporate key mixture design and placement variables such as water cement ratio, cementitious material content, slump, air content, temperature, and placement conditions. Results indicate that the embedding-based neural network consistently outperforms traditional machine learning and transformer-based models, achieving a mean 28-day prediction error of approximately 2.5%. This level of accuracy is comparable to routine laboratory testing variability, demonstrating the potential of embedding-based learning frameworks to enable automated, data-driven quality control and decision support in large-scale construction operations."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance reasoning capabilities through test-time scaling by generating multiple traces. However, the combination of lengthy reasoning traces with multiple sampling introduces substantial computation and high end-to-end latency. Prior work on accelerating this process has relied on similarity-based or confidence-based pruning, but these signals do not reliably indicate trace quality. To address these limitations, we propose STEP: Step-level Trace Evaluation and Pruning, a novel pruning framework that evaluates reasoning steps using hidden states and dynamically prunes unpromising traces during generation. We train a lightweight step scorer to estimate trace quality, and design a GPU memory-aware pruning strategy that triggers pruning as the GPU memory is saturated by KV cache to reduce end-to-end latency. Experiments across challenging reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that STEP reduces end-to-end inference latency by 45%-70% on average compared to self-consistency while also improving reasoning accuracy.

Although recent work has reduced the number of training steps required to reach peak performance, the overall wall-clock training time often remains unchanged or even increases due to higher per-step cost. We propose MMR-GRPO, which integrates Maximal Marginal Relevance to reweigh rewards based on completion diversity. Our key insight is that semantically redundant completions contribute limited marginal learning signal; prioritizing diverse solutions yields more informative updates and accelerates convergence. Extensive evaluations across three model sizes (1.5B, 7B, 8B), three GRPO variants, and five mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that MMR-GRPO achieves comparable peak performance while requiring on average 47.9% fewer training steps and 70.2% less wall-clock time. These gains are consistent across models, methods, and benchmarks. We will release our code, trained models, and experimental protocols."

SRT exploits the empirical similarity of rollouts for the same prompt across training steps by storing previously generated continuations in a per-prompt tree-structured cache. During generation, the current policy uses this tree as the draft model for performing speculative decoding. To keep the cache fresh and improve draft model quality, SRT updates trees online from ongoing rollouts and proactively performs run-ahead generation during idle GPU bubbles. Integrated into standard RL pipelines (\\textit{e.g.}, PPO, GRPO and DAPO) and multi-turn settings, SRT consistently reduces generation and step latency and lowers per-token inference cost, achieving up to 2.08x wall-clock time speedup during rollout."

    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) have commonly been constructed using predefined symbolic relation schemas, typically implemented as categorical relation labels. This design has notable shortcomings: real-world relations are often contextual, nuanced, and sometimes uncertain, and compressing it into discrete relation labels abstracts away critical semantic detail. Nevertheless, symbolic-relation KGs remain widely used because they have been operationally effective and broadly compatible with pre-LLM downstream models and algorithms, in which KG knowledge could be retrieved or encoded into quantified features and embeddings at scale. The emergence of LLMs has reshaped how knowledge is created and consumed. LLMs support scalable synthesis of domain facts directly in concise natural language, and prompting-based inference favors context-rich free-form text over quantified representations. This position paper argues that these changes call for rethinking the representation of relations themselves rather than merely using LLMs to populate conventional schemas more efficiently. We therefore advocate moving from symbolic to natural-language relation descriptions, and we propose hybrid design principles that preserve a minimal structural backbone while enabling more flexible and context-sensitive relational representations."

Improving a result of Błaszczyk and Shelah we prove that the addition of Cohen reals and the Laver property are not equivalent, even in the case of ultrafilters. As an application, we investigate the problem of adding half Cohen reals without adding Cohen reals via tree-like forcings arising from co-ideals. We obtain several partial results and structural obstructions. Finally, we resolve several open questions from the literature concerning the one-to-one or constant property and cardinal invariants associated with ideals."

However, conventional optical fiber sensors are often limited by strong parameter cross sensitivity, poor discrimination capability, and increased system complexity when multiple sensing units are required. In this work, a compact multi-parameter optical fiber sensing platform is proposed based on a cascaded single-mode fiber, multimode fiber, and long-period fiber grating structure, combined with a wavelength-based spectral demodulation strategy. Within the cascaded configuration, multiple characteristic spectral troughs arising from distinct physical mechanisms coexist in a single transmission spectrum. Interference-induced troughs are generated by the multimode fiber section, while a resonance-induced trough is introduced by the long-period fiber grating. Although none of these troughs responds exclusively to a single parameter, each exhibits simultaneous and linearly independent responses to temperature, axial strain, and refractive index with distinct sensitivity magnitudes and trends. Consequently, each trough can be described by a unique sensitivity vector, enabling robust multi-parameter discrimination through multi-wavelength spectral demodulation."

The 20B model achieved a mean accuracy of 86.02%, substantially outperforming smaller models and confirming the importance of scale in handling complex clinical text. Crucially, we identified a highly complementary error profile: the LLM excelled at syntactic consistency (e.g., date/numeric formatting) where humans faltered, while human experts provided superior semantic and contextual interpretation. We also found that the LLM's semantic errors were fundamental limitations that could not be mitigated by simple prompt engineering. These findings strongly support a human-in-the-loop (HITL) workflow in which the on-premise LLM serves as a collaborative tool, not a full replacement. It automates routine structuring and flags potential human errors, enabling imaging specialists to focus on high-level semantic validation. We discuss implications for structured reporting and interactive AI systems in clinical practice."

Recent research suggests that parameter-sharing transformers can bridge this gap by forming a \"Generalization Circuit\" during a prolonged \"grokking\" phase. A fundamental question arises: Is a grokked model superior to its non-grokked counterparts on downstream tasks? Furthermore, is the extensive computational cost of waiting for the grokking phase worthwhile? In this work, we conduct a mechanistic study to evaluate the Generalization Circuit's role in knowledge assimilation and transfer. We demonstrate that: (i) The inference paths established by non-grokked and grokked models for in-distribution compositional queries are identical. This suggests that the \"Generalization Circuit\" does not represent the sudden acquisition of a new reasoning paradigm. Instead, we argue that grokking is the process of integrating memorized atomic facts into an naturally established reasoning path. (ii) Achieving high accuracy on unseen cases after prolonged training and the formation of a certain reasoning path are not bound; they can occur independently under specific data regimes. (iii) Even a mature circuit exhibits limited transferability when integrating new knowledge, suggesting that \"grokked\" Transformers do not achieve a full mastery of compositional logic."

Motivated by recent progress in blockwise self-supervised learning (BWSSL), we ask whether masked video transformers can be trained without end-to-end backpropagation. Applying BWSSL to masked video modeling remains relatively underexplored and must handle spatiotemporal context and long-range temporal structure. More broadly, analyses that compare BWSSL and end-to-end training in terms of learning dynamics and depth-wise representation development remain sparse. We apply blockwise learning to a masked autoencoding video vision transformer by partitioning the encoder into blocks, each of which is optimized with a local masked reconstruction loss. Across model sizes and partition granularities, training converges and yields representations close to matched end-to-end baselines under linear-probe and retrieval proxies. In order to compare intermediate representations, we analyze depth-wise decodability, inter-block similarity, and patch-level diagnostics. Blockwise training exposes higher-level structure earlier, while later blocks saturate and operate in a more geometry-preserving regime. It can also induce token-level shifts consistent with stronger early mixing that pooled metrics can miss. These findings point to late-block saturation and interface formation as contributors to the remaining gap."

Despite their central role in LLM pipelines, the link between tokenization, compression efficiency and induced structure is not well understood. We empirically demonstrate that tokenizer training scale redistributes entropy: as training data grows, the token stream becomes more diverse in aggregate (higher unigram entropy) yet markedly more predictable in-context (lower higher-order conditional entropies), indicating that tokenization absorbs substantial short-range regularity although these gains degrade under train-test domain mismatch. To ground these observations, we first benchmark i) pretrained GPT-family tokenizers as black-box compressors across various domains, and ii) learned tokenizers across configurations spanning vocabulary size, training scale, and domain. Next, we study tokenization as a transform for universal compression and introduce a compression-aware BPE variant. Finally, we adopt a channel lens and introduce capacity-utilization metrics to analyze tokenizer behaviour and outline implications for downstream modeling. Put together, our results expose various trade-offs between compression, induced structure, and robustness under domain shift, and motivate principled, compression-aware tokenizer design."

Here, we examine the Ta-W binary alloy system, which evolves from ductile character at Ta-rich compositions to brittleness at high W. We show that a change in slope of the composition-dependent shear modulus near the equiatomic composition coincides with an abrupt change in the Fermi level density of states. We relate the behaviors of the elastic constants to the characters of occupied electronic orbitals close to the Fermi level.

    "abstract": "We examine the influence of a static dc electric field on Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) resonances that involve highly excited Rydberg states. Our focus is on how these resonances are altered when the relative orientation between the laser polarization and the external electric field vectors are varied. We experimentally demonstrate characteristic variations in the amplitude of the Stark-split EIT resonances, which can be explained by the selection rules in various geometries. We also present a simplified semi-analytical model that closely resembles the experimental observations. We use these findings to obtain information about the spatially inhomogeneous electric field, produced by a biased wire, using EIT fluorescence measurements that agrees with the expected angular dependencies. These results suggest that simultaneous analysis of frequency shifts and amplitudes of Rydberg EIT resonances may enable vector electrometry of electrostatic fields, necessary for many quantum sensing applications."

    "abstract": "High-rate concatenated quantum codes offer a promising pathway toward fault-tolerant quantum computation, yet designing efficient decoders that fully exploit their error-correction capability remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce a hard-decision decoder for concatenated quantum Hamming codes with time complexity polynomial in the block length. This decoder overcomes the limitations of conventional local decoding by leveraging higher-level syndrome information to revise lower-level recovery decisions -- a strategy we refer to as bidirectional decoding. For the concatenated $[[15,7,3]]$ quantum Hamming code under independent bit-flip noise, the bidirectional decoder improves the threshold from approximately $1.56\\%$ to $4.35\\%$ compared with standard local decoding. Moreover, the decoder empirically preserves the full $3^{L}$ code-distance scaling for at least three levels of concatenation, resulting in substantially faster logical-error suppression than the $2^{L+1}$ scaling offered by local decoders. Our results can enhance the competitiveness of concatenated-code architectures for low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation."

This enables a conversational approach to sound system control. By utilizing data collected from a controlled listening experiment, our models exploit in-context learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to reliably align with population-preferred equalization settings. Our evaluation methods, which leverage distributional metrics that capture users' varied preferences, show statistically significant improvements in distributional alignment over random sampling and static preset baselines. These results indicate that LLMs could function as \"artificial equalizers,\" contributing to the development of more accessible, context-aware, and expert-level audio tuning methods."

    "abstract": "For the buffet, the waiter of a restaurant gets a large stack of pancakes from the overworked cook. As usual, one side is burnt, and as the level of batter decreases, the pancakes became smaller and smaller. Hence, the waiter ends up with a stack of one-sided burnt pancakes sorted by size, with the larger at the bottom and burnt side up. However, the waiter cannot serve them this way. He needs to turn all the burnt sides down, without changing the order. Having only a spatula, he can only perform flips to the top of the stack. How can he perform this transformation in a minimum number of flips? Having n pancakes, this problem can be modeled in the burnt pancake graph, having 2^n*n! vertices, where each possible stack of pancakes corresponds to a vertex expressed by a permutation of size n, where the pancakes are ordered by size, and the pancake numbers are multiplied by -1, if the corresponding pancake has the burnt side side up. An edge exists in this graph, if the corresponding stacks can be reached from each other by one flip. Let T(n) be the minimum number of flips to sort the stack of n pancakes (-1,...,-n). General burnt pancake sorting has been introduced by Bill Gates and Papadimitriou. The instance (-1,...,-n) has strong relevance because of its easy structure and as it has been shown to be a worst-case instance for several small n. Heydari and Sudborough gave the currently best upper bound of T(n), namely (3n+3)/2 for n = 3 mod 4, which later has been shown to be exact by a work of Cibulka. Except these two works, no progress regarding lower and upper bounds has been made until now. In our work, we present that (3n+3)/2 is also an upper bound of T(n) for n = 1 mod 4, which again matches the lower bound of Cibulka and thus is exact. The case of even n keeps an open problem, where two possible values for T(n) are possible, namely (3/2)n + 1 or (3/2)n + 2."

While prior work has primarily focused on resolving conflicts between a model's internal knowledge and external resources through approaches such as fine-tuning or knowledge editing, the problem of localizing conflicts that originate during pre-training within the model's internal representations remain unexplored. In this work, we design a framework based on mechanistic interpretability methods to identify where and how conflicting knowledge from the pre-training data is encoded within LMs. Our findings contribute to a growing body of evidence that specific internal components of a language model are responsible for encoding conflicting knowledge from pre-training, and we demonstrate how mechanistic interpretability methods can be leveraged to causally intervene in and control conflicting knowledge at inference time."

We address this by conducting the first large-scale study of how data quantity and data diversity affect real-world generalization in end-to-end, map-free visual navigation. Using a curated 4,565-hour crowd-sourced dataset collected across 161 locations in 35 countries, we train policies for point goal navigation and evaluate their closed-loop control performance on sidewalk robots operating in four countries, covering 125 km of autonomous driving. Our results show that large-scale training data enables zero-shot navigation in unknown environments, approaching the performance of policies trained with environment-specific demonstrations. Critically, we find that data diversity is far more important than data quantity. Doubling the number of geographical locations in a training set decreases navigation errors by ~15%, while performance benefit from adding data from existing locations saturates with very little data. We also observe that, with noisy crowd-sourced data, simple regression-based models outperform generative and sequence-based architectures. We release our policies, evaluation setup and example videos on the project page."

    "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) enhance complex problem solving through multi-agent collaboration, but often incur substantially higher costs than single-agent systems. Recent MAS routing methods aim to balance performance and overhead by dynamically selecting agent roles and language models. However, these approaches typically rely on a homogeneous collaboration mode, where all agents follow the same interaction pattern, limiting collaboration flexibility across different roles. Motivated by Social Capital Theory, which emphasizes that different roles benefit from distinct forms of collaboration, we propose SC-MAS, a framework for constructing heterogeneous and cost-efficient multi-agent systems. SC-MAS models MAS as directed graphs, where edges explicitly represent pairwise collaboration strategies, allowing different agent pairs to interact through tailored communication patterns. Given an input query, a unified controller progressively constructs an executable MAS by selecting task-relevant agent roles, assigning edge-level collaboration strategies, and allocating appropriate LLM backbones to individual agents. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SC-MAS. In particular, SC-MAS improves accuracy by 3.35% on MMLU while reducing inference cost by 15.38%, and achieves a 3.53% accuracy gain with a 12.13% cost reduction on MBPP. These results validate the feasibility of SC-MAS and highlight the effectiveness of heterogeneous collaboration in multi-agent systems."

Yet, a direct way to see the connection was lacking until a common ancestor, the Fibonacci-Hall model, was introduced recently \\cite{aj2025}. This 2D ancestor model relates the role of the external magnetic flux in the Hall problem and that of a geometric flux which describes the winding of the quasicrystal in 2D, in the cut-and-project method. Doing this enables us to extend the notion of Chern numbers as defined in 2D, to the energy bands of the 1D chain by adiabatic continuity. The older notion of gap labels in the 1D system are now seen to be derivable from the Chern numbers of the 2D bands. The Fibonacci-Hall model thus provides an important link between physics of two paradigmatic models, the Fibonacci quasicrystal and the quantum Hall insulator. The generalization to other 1D quasiperiodic models is expected to be relatively straightforward. The extension to 2D cut-and-project tilings is left for future studies."

We demonstrate that adding construction steps between the designer's input geometry and the final profile improves generation quality in a similar way to the introduction of a chain of thought in language models. Similar to the constraints in a parametric CAD model, the construction sequences reduce the degrees of freedom in the modeled shape to a small set of parameter values which can be adjusted by the designer, allowing parametric editing with the constructed geometry evaluated to floating point precision. In addition we show that applying reinforcement learning to the construction sequences gives further improvements over a wide range of metrics, including some which were not explicitly optimized."

This result holds regardless of whether the beamforming is at the transmitter, at the receiver, or at a reconfigurable intelligent surface. In i.i.d. fading channels, the shortfall hardens to the maximum possible shortfall as the number of antennas grows."

Deviations from $ρ_{\\rm FL}=ρ_0+AT^2$ in bad and strange metals are commonly ascribed to a breakdown of Landau's quasiparticle (QP) concept. Yet, it remains unclear what mechanism drives the temperature dependence of $ρ(T)$ beyond $ρ_{\\rm FL}$. Here, we examine the bad metal upon approaching the Mott metal-insulator transition via chemical pressure in $κ$-[(BEDT-STF)$_x$(BEDT-TTF)$_{1-x}$]$\\rm _2 Cu_2 (CN)_3$. Through nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and transport experiments on the same single crystals, we directly link the onset of deviations from Korringa law $(T_1T)^{-1} = \\mathrm{const.}$ with the rise of $ρ(T)$ beyond $ρ_{\\rm FL}$. From the NMR relaxation rate, we can identify the gradual crossover between the QP-dominated regime at low $T$ to predominant local moments at higher $T$. By comparing our experimental findings with dynamical mean-field theory calculations, which accurately reproduce the transport data, we reveal how this crossover is reflected in $T$-dependent changes of the QP spectrum. Near the Mott insulator, where $dρ/dT<0$ at high $T$, an Einstein-relation analysis shows that bad-metal behavior with $dρ/dT>0$ is driven by the temperature dependence of the electronic compressibility rather than the diffusion constant."

    "abstract": "Interference of the ultralight dark matter (ULDM) field generates time-varying gravitational potential fluctuations, which stochastically heat stellar systems embedded in ULDM halos. Small-sized stellar systems are therefore often used to set stringent constraints on ULDM. However, the evolution of systems with sizes well below the ULDM de Broglie wavelength remains poorly explored. Using numerical simulations, we show that the evolution of compact stellar systems in ULDM halos is governed by the interplay between internal stellar relaxation and ULDM-induced heating. We find the following main results. First, in sufficiently compact systems, relaxation-driven core collapse dominates, allowing the system to remain bound and dense, while ULDM-induced stripping of outer stars further accelerates the collapse. Second, in more extended systems, ULDM heating dominates and ultimately disrupts the system. Near the disruption threshold, we identify systems resembling ultra-faint dwarfs like Segue 1. Third, we further introduce a dimensionless parameter to quantify the relative importance of heating and relaxation and finally lead to an evolutionary phase diagram. Our results reveal the rich and nontrivial dynamics of compact stellar systems in ULDM halos, indicating that precise system modeling is essential for robust ULDM constraints."

This issue is particularly critical in incomplete social networks, where sensitive attributes are frequently missing due to privacy and ethical restrictions. Existing solutions commonly generate these incomplete attributes, which may introduce additional biases and further compromise user privacy. To address this challenge, FairGE (Fair Graph Encoding) is introduced as a fairness-aware framework for GTs in incomplete social networks. Instead of generating sensitive attributes, FairGE encodes fairness directly through spectral graph theory. By leveraging the principal eigenvector to represent structural information and padding incomplete sensitive attributes with zeros to maintain independence, FairGE ensures fairness without data reconstruction. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the method suppresses the influence of non-principal spectral components, thereby enhancing fairness. Extensive experiments on seven real-world social network datasets confirm that FairGE achieves at least a 16% improvement in both statistical parity and equality of opportunity compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

To bridge this gap, we introduce AI-NativeBench, the first application-centric and white-box AI-Native benchmark suite grounded in Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) standards. By treating agentic spans as first-class citizens within distributed traces, our methodology enables granular analysis of engineering characteristics beyond simple capabilities. Leveraging this benchmark across 21 system variants, we uncover critical engineering realities invisible to traditional metrics: a parameter paradox where lightweight models often surpass flagships in protocol adherence, a pervasive inference dominance that renders protocol overhead secondary, and an expensive failure pattern where self-healing mechanisms paradoxically act as cost multipliers on unviable workflows. This work provides the first systematic evidence to guide the transition from measuring model capability to engineering reliable AI-Native systems. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we have open-sourced the benchmark and dataset."

P concentration is determined by Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). Sample resistivity ($ρ$), carrier concentration ($n_e$), and mobility ($μ_e$) are extracted by combining sheet resistance and Hall measurements in van der Pauw configuration. When $H_{SOI}$ = 30 nm, transport properties at room temperature are fully compatible with those of a similarly doped bulk Si. Progressive 2D confinement by reduction of $H_{SOI}$ below 30 nm results in a reduction of the carrier concentration and a concomitant degradation of $μ_e$. These effects, which are steadily enhanced decreasing $n_D$, are attributed to non-passivated interface states at the SiO$_2$/Si interface and can be significantly mitigated by high temperature rapid thermal oxidation (RTO). The effectiveness of this approach was verified by electron-paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra and capacitance-voltage (CV) measurements, which allowed the assessment of the quality of the RTO-SiO$_2$/Si interface and the correlation with observed electrical properties. After effective interface engineering, low temperature electrical characterization revealed a significant increase in P ionization energy in samples with $H_{SOI}$ <= 15 nm, a result directly related to the dielectric mismatch."

In this work, we mainly investigate the relative roles and interplay of two key mechanisms: the nonlinear decay of Langmuir/$\\mathcal Z$-mode waves and their linear transformations on random density fluctuations and, in particular, their mode conversion at constant frequency into electromagnetic waves. Using two-dimensional Particle-In-Cell simulations, we employ a diagnostic approach based on large ensembles of virtual satellites that record local waveforms, enabling detailed temporal and spatial characterization of wave processes in randomly inhomogeneous plasmas. This method allows robust statistical analysis and direct comparison with spacecraft observations. The study focuses on the dependence of wave dynamics on the average level of density fluctuations and the plasma magnetization. Our results quantify the occurrence rate of decay under varying physical conditions and demonstrate how developed plasma density turbulence can significantly alter the balance between nonlinear wave-wave interactions and linear wave transformations. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms responsible for electromagnetic emissions during type III radio bursts and strengthen the connection between numerical simulations and in situ solar wind measurements, offering a valuable framework for the interpretation of future space-based waveform observations."

    "abstract": "The scarcity of annotated datasets for clinical information extraction in non-English languages hinders the evaluation of large language model (LLM)-based methods developed primarily in English. In this study, we present the first comprehensive bilingual evaluation of LLMs for the clinical Relation Extraction (RE) task in both English and Turkish. To facilitate this evaluation, we introduce the first English-Turkish parallel clinical RE dataset, derived and carefully curated from the 2010 i2b2/VA relation classification corpus. We systematically assess a diverse set of prompting strategies, including multiple in-context learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approaches, and compare their performance to fine-tuned baselines such as PURE. Furthermore, we propose Relation-Aware Retrieval (RAR), a novel in-context example selection method based on contrastive learning, that is specifically designed to capture both sentence-level and relation-level semantics. Our results show that prompting-based LLM approaches consistently outperform traditional fine-tuned models. Moreover, evaluations for English performed better than their Turkish counterparts across all evaluated LLMs and prompting techniques. Among ICL methods, RAR achieves the highest performance, with Gemini 1.5 Flash reaching a micro-F1 score of 0.906 in English and 0.888 in Turkish. Performance further improves to 0.918 F1 in English when RAR is combined with a structured reasoning prompt using the DeepSeek-V3 model. These findings highlight the importance of high-quality demonstration retrieval and underscore the potential of advanced retrieval and prompting techniques to bridge resource gaps in clinical natural language processing."

In this chapter we introduce the Matrix Product State representation of quantum systems and show how it may be used to construct circuits which encode a desired state. Putting this in the context of QML we show how this process may be modified to give a low depth approximate encoding and crucially that this encoding does not hinder classification accuracy and is indeed exhibits an increased robustness against classical adversarial attacks. This is illustrated by demonstrations of adversarially robust variational quantum classifiers for the MNIST and FMNIST dataset, as well as a small-scale experimental demonstration on a superconducting quantum device."

Experiments are conducted in rectangular tanks with varying aspect ratios, in which the fluid surface is perturbed locally and erratically by small, partially submerged magnets. Driven by an oscillating vertical electromagnetic field, these magnets generate a statistically homogeneous and isotropic random wave field. This setup enables us to probe finite-size effects without the dominant influence of global forcing present in horizontally oscillated tanks. Spatiotemporal measurements of the wave field reveal multiple branches in the wave-energy spectrum along the unconfined direction, corresponding to sloshing modes in the confined direction. We show that the spectral properties of these modes can be tuned by varying either the wave steepness or the confinement. Signatures of discrete wave turbulence in the confined direction and mesoscopic continuous wave turbulence in the unconfined direction are observed. As the confinement is gradually relaxed, we further demonstrate a smooth transition from discrete to continuous wave turbulence, consistent with the nonlinear-to-discreteness timescale ratio. Using high-order correlation analysis, we also show that finite-size effects alter wave dynamics by depleting two-dimensional three-wave resonant interactions along the confined direction."

In this setting, the energy functional reduces to a one-dimensional variational problem. We rigorously prove the existence and uniqueness of minimizers and we provide their complete geometric characterization. Finally, we run some numerical simulations."

By introducing a local perturbation that drives the system from integrability to chaos, we track the standard ETH indicators and the eigenstate entanglement entropy. We introduce a submatrix-based framework for analyzing local observables in the energy eigenbasis. By extracting real-symmetric blocks along the diagonal of the local observables represented in eigenbasis, we show that these submatrices exhibit both the short-range and long-range spectral features of the Hamiltonian. Remarkably, this correspondence persists even in a partially ergodic regime, indicating that the emergence of chaos is already encoded locally within the observables' matrix structure and that small blocks are sufficient to capture the underlying spectral correlations."

We construct a loopholes-closed game with capital processes that test (i) convergence of empirical conditional frequencies to the CHSH correlations and (ii) the absence of systematic correlations between measurement settings and Nature's hidden-variable assignments, and prove that Nature cannot satisfy both simultaneously: at least one capital process must diverge. This yields an operational winning strategy for Scientists and a game-theoretic probabilistic interpretation of experimentally observed CHSH violations."

It was originally introduced for the homogeneous one-dimensional wave equation in [Ciaramella, Gander, Mazzieri, 2024]. UTP is inspired by the Mapped Tent Pitching (MTP) algorithm [Gopalakrishnan, Sch{ö}berl, Wintersteiger, 2017], which constructs the solution by iteratively building polytopal space--time subdomains, referred to as tents. In MTP, each physical tent is mapped onto a space--time rectangle, where local problems are solved before being mapped back to the original domain. In contrast, UTP avoids the nonlinear and potentially singular mapping step by computing the solution directly on a physical space--time rectangle that contains the tent, at the expense of redundant computations in the region outside the tent. In this work, we investigate several strategies to extend UTP to heterogeneous media, where the wave propagation speed is piecewise constant over two subregions of the domain. Among the considered approaches, the most efficient in terms of computational time is the one employing space--time subdomains with identical spatial and temporal dimensions in both regions, determined by the maximum propagation speed."

Existing methods like purification and minimally entangled typical thermal states offer partial solutions but struggle with scalability and accuracy in low-temperature regime. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new approach based on generating-function matrix product states (GFMPS). By directly computing a large set of Bloch-type excited states, we construct Gibbs states that moderate the area-law constraint, enabling accurate and efficient approximation of low-temperature thermal behavior. Our benchmark results show magnificent agreement with both exact diagonalization and experimental observations, validating the accuracy of our approach. This method offers a promising new direction for overcoming the longstanding challenges of studying low-temperature properties within the tensor network framework. We also expect that our method will facilitate the numerical simulation of quantum materials in comparison with experimental observations."

The microscopic origin of the emergent local electronic properties is often debated, however, as quantitative atomic-scale characterization remains challenging. A prime example is enhanced conductivity at ferroelectric domain walls, attributed to mechanisms ranging from local band gap reduction to point defect accumulations. Here, we resolve the microscopic mechanisms for domain wall conduction in the ferroelectric model system BiFeO3, by combining transport measurements with atom probe tomography to quantify the local chemical composition and correlate it with the electrical properties. Significant chemical variations along the walls are observed, demonstrating an outstanding chemical flexibility at domain walls, which manifest in spatially varying physical properties. The results give a unifying explanation for the diverse electronic behavior observed and establish the fundamental notion that multiple conduction mechanisms can coexist within individual domain walls."

In the dark, the intrinsic magnetism of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ is shown to yield a stronger anisotropic RKKY spin model compared to nonmagnetic topological insulators, providing a clear signature for differentiating these systems. Furthermore, key band properties -- such as energy gap, band degeneracy/splitting, and topological deformations of the Fermi surface -- imprint distinct signatures on the RKKY interaction, enabling clear discrimination between even- and odd-septuple-layer (SL) films. This discrimination manifests in multiple ways: through the Fermi-energy dependence or spatial oscillations of the interaction for impurities on the same surface, or via the presence versus absence of spin-frustrated terms for those on different surfaces. Under off-resonant circularly polarized light, we track photoinduced topological phase transitions and identify two characteristic signatures at the phase boundary: a sign reversal in spin-frustrated terms and a dip in collinear RKKY components. These serve as fingerprints for circular-polarization-chirality-dependent topological transitions in even- and odd-SL films, respectively. Overall, this work establishes RKKY interactions as a sensitive magnetic probe for revealing both distinctive band properties and light-driven phase transitions in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ films, thereby complementing conventional electrical measurements while providing new insights into the influence of intrinsic magnetism on the surface-state band structure."

Inspired by the success of block-wise paradigms in deep generative models, we pioneer the use of LLMs in this domain by introducing MOF-LLM, the first LLM framework specifically adapted for block-level MOF structure prediction. To effectively harness LLMs for this modular assembly task, our training paradigm integrates spatial-aware continual pre-training (CPT), structural supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and matching-driven reinforcement learning (RL). By incorporating explicit spatial priors and optimizing structural stability via Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), our approach substantially enhances the spatial reasoning capability of a Qwen-3 8B model for accurate MOF structure prediction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MOF-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art denoising-based and LLM-based methods while exhibiting superior sampling efficiency."

Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) unlearning approaches that typically focus on modifying only final answers are insufficient for LRMs, as they fail to remove sensitive content from intermediate steps, leading to persistent privacy leakage and degraded security. To address these challenges, we propose Sensitive Trajectory Regulation (STaR), a parameter-free, inference-time unlearning framework that achieves robust privacy protection throughout the reasoning process. Specifically, we first identify sensitive content via semantic-aware detection. Then, we inject global safety constraints through secure prompt prefix. Next, we perform trajectory-aware suppression to dynamically block sensitive content across the entire reasoning chain. Finally, we apply token-level adaptive filtering to prevent both exact and paraphrased sensitive tokens during generation. Furthermore, to overcome the inadequacies of existing evaluation protocols, we introduce two metrics: Multi-Decoding Consistency Assessment (MCS), which measures the consistency of unlearning across diverse decoding strategies, and Multi-Granularity Membership Inference Attack (MIA) Evaluation, which quantifies privacy protection at both answer and reasoning-chain levels. Experiments on the R-TOFU benchmark demonstrate that STaR achieves comprehensive and stable unlearning with minimal utility loss, setting a new standard for privacy-preserving reasoning in LRMs."

To address this, we propose BrainSegNet, a novel framework that adapts SAM for accurate whole-brain parcellation into 95 regions. We enhance SAM by integrating U-Net skip connections and specialized modules into its encoder and decoder, enabling fine-grained anatomical precision. Key components include a hybrid encoder combining U-Net skip connections with SAM's transformer blocks, a multi-scale attention decoder with pyramid pooling for varying-sized structures, and a boundary refinement module to sharpen edges.

Inclusion of the cubic Lovelock term removes this ghost instability; however, the resulting Minkowski vacuum is generically only metastable, being accompanied by energetically favored Anti-de Sitter vacua. While such metastability cannot be avoided for spherical internal spaces, we identify an infinite class of higher-rank symmetric spaces where the true vacuum can be pushed to infinity in moduli space, thereby realizing genuinely stable and ghost-free Minkowski vacua at the level of the four-dimensional effective theory. To support these conclusions, we explicitly compute Lovelock terms up to cubic order on these spaces, confirming a universal log-convexity among the linear, quadratic, and cubic invariants, which plays a central role in our analysis."

    "abstract": "While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT) are standard for LLM alignment, they either rely on costly expert data or discard valuable negative samples, leading to data inefficiency. To address this, we propose Reward Informed Fine-Tuning (RIFT), a simple yet effective framework that utilizes all self-generated samples. Unlike the hard thresholding of RFT, RIFT repurposes negative trajectories, reweighting the loss with scalar rewards to learn from both the positive and negative trajectories from the model outputs. To overcome the training collapse caused by naive reward integration, where direct multiplication yields an unbounded loss, we introduce a stabilized loss formulation that ensures numerical robustness and optimization efficiency. Extensive experiments on mathematical benchmarks across various base models show that RIFT consistently outperforms RFT. Our results demonstrate that RIFT is a robust and data-efficient alternative for alignment using mixed-quality, self-generated data."

    "abstract": "Autonomous agents such as cars, robots and drones need to precisely localize themselves in diverse environments, including in GPS-denied indoor environments. One approach for precise localization is visual place recognition (VPR), which estimates the place of an image based on previously seen places. State-of-the-art VPR models require high amounts of memory, making them unwieldy for mobile deployment, while more compact models lack robustness and generalization capabilities. This work overcomes these limitations for robotics using a combination of event-based vision sensors and an event-based novel guided variational autoencoder (VAE). The encoder part of our model is based on a spiking neural network model which is compatible with power-efficient low latency neuromorphic hardware. The VAE successfully disentangles the visual features of 16 distinct places in our new indoor VPR dataset with a classification performance comparable to other state-of-the-art approaches while, showing robust performance also under various illumination conditions. When tested with novel visual inputs from unknown scenes, our model can distinguish between these places, which demonstrates a high generalization capability by learning the essential features of location. Our compact and robust guided VAE with generalization capabilities poses a promising model for visual place recognition that can significantly enhance mobile robot navigation in known and unknown indoor environments."

    "abstract": "Label assignment is a critical component in object detectors, particularly within DETR-style frameworks where the one-to-one matching strategy, despite its end-to-end elegance, suffers from slow convergence due to sparse supervision. While recent works have explored one-to-many assignments to enrich supervisory signals, they often introduce complex, architecture-specific modifications and typically focus on a single auxiliary strategy, lacking a unified and scalable design. In this paper, we first systematically investigate the effects of ``one-to-many'' supervision and reveal a surprising insight that performance gains are driven not by the sheer quantity of supervision, but by the diversity of the assignment strategies employed. This finding suggests that a more elegant, parameter-efficient approach is attainable. Building on this insight, we propose LoRA-DETR, a flexible and lightweight framework that seamlessly integrates diverse assignment strategies into any DETR-style detector. Our method augments the primary network with multiple Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) branches during training, each instantiating a different one-to-many assignment rule. These branches act as auxiliary modules that inject rich, varied supervisory gradients into the main model and are discarded during inference, thus incurring no additional computational cost. This design promotes robust joint optimization while maintaining the architectural simplicity of the original detector. Extensive experiments on different baselines validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our work presents a new paradigm for enhancing detectors, demonstrating that diverse ``one-to-many'' supervision can be integrated to achieve state-of-the-art results without compromising model elegance."

Ca2KG integrates counterfactual prompting, which exposes retrieval-dependent uncertainties in knowledge quality and reasoning reliability, with a panel-based re-scoring mechanism that stabilises predictions across interventions. Extensive experiments on two complex QA datasets demonstrate that Ca2KG consistently improves calibration while maintaining or even enhancing predictive accuracy."

    "abstract": "An emerging class of trajectory optimization methods enforces collision avoidance by jointly optimizing the robot's configuration and a separating hyperplane. However, as linear separators only apply to convex sets, these methods require convex approximations of both the robot and obstacles, which becomes an overly conservative assumption in cluttered and narrow environments. In this work, we unequivocally remove this limitation by introducing nonlinear separating hypersurfaces parameterized by polynomial functions. We first generalize the classical separating hyperplane theorem and prove that any two disjoint bounded closed sets in Euclidean space can be separated by a polynomial hypersurface, serving as the theoretical foundation for nonlinear separation of arbitrary geometries. Building on this result, we formulate a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem that jointly optimizes the robot's trajectory and the coefficients of the separating polynomials, enabling geometry-aware collision avoidance without conservative convex simplifications. The optimization remains efficiently solvable using standard NLP solvers. Simulation and real-world experiments with nonconvex robots demonstrate that our method achieves smooth, collision-free, and agile maneuvers in environments where convex-approximation baselines fail."

    "abstract": "Statistically, green valley (GV) galaxies exhibit lower molecular gas fractions ($f_{gas}$) and reduced star formation efficiency (SFE) compared to star-forming galaxies. However, it remains unclear whether quenching is primarily driven by one factor or results from a combination of mechanisms in individual GV galaxies. In this study, we address this question by examining the spatial distributions of star formation and molecular gas in 28 GVs selected from the ALMaQUEST survey and additional literature samples. For each galaxy, we identify regions with suppressed specific star formation rate (sSFR) and measure $Δf_{gas}$ and $Δ$SFE-offsets from the resolved scaling relations of the star-forming main sequence galaxies. By comparing the fraction of regions with negative $Δf_{gas}$ and $Δ$SFE, we classify 35.7$\\pm$13.2\\% (57.1$\\pm$17.9\\%) of GV galaxies as $f_{gas}$-driven, 39.3$\\pm$14.0\\% (39.3$\\pm$14.0\\%) as SFE-driven, and 25.0$\\pm$10.6\\% (3.6$\\pm$3.6\\%) as mixed mode when adopting a fixed (variable) CO-to-$\\rm H_{2}$ conversion factor ($α_{CO}$). These results indicate that GVs undergo quenching through multiple pathways. As sSFR decreases from the main sequence to the green valley, we observe a transition toward predominantly SFE-driven quenching, possibly linked to internal processes such as morphological quenching or AGN activity. We further estimate the quenching timescale ($τ_{decay}$), defined as the time from the peak SFR to 1/e (approximately 37\\%) of its value, using integrated MaNGA spectra. SFE-driven quenching is typically associated with short $τ_{decay}$ , while $f_{gas}$-driven quenching shows a broader range. Overall, 75\\% of GVs exhibit $τ_{decay}$ shorter than 1 Gyr, suggesting that quenching in most GVs proceeds rapidly, challenging purely slow-quenching scenarios like starvation."

To analyze the performance under the new construction, we then propose an accurate characterization of the distribution of the error event under the genie-aided successive cancellation (SC) decoding. This characterization can be also used to predict the performance of the standard SC decoding of polar codes with rates close to capacity."

    "abstract": "With advances in artificial intelligence, image processing has gained significant interest. Image super-resolution is a vital technology closely related to real-world applications, as it enhances the quality of existing images. Since enhancing fine details is crucial for the super-resolution task, pixels that contribute to high-frequency information should be emphasized. This paper proposes two methods to enhance high-frequency details in super-resolution images: a Laplacian pyramid-based detail loss and a repeated upscaling and downscaling process. Total loss with our detail loss guides a model by separately generating and controlling super-resolution and detail images. This approach allows the model to focus more effectively on high-frequency components, resulting in improved super-resolution images. Additionally, repeated upscaling and downscaling amplify the effectiveness of the detail loss by extracting diverse information from multiple low-resolution features. We conduct two types of experiments. First, we design a CNN-based model incorporating our methods. This model achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing all currently available CNN-based and even some attention-based models. Second, we apply our methods to existing attention-based models on a small scale. In all our experiments, attention-based models adding our detail loss show improvements compared to the originals. These results demonstrate our approaches effectively enhance super-resolution images across different model structures."

    "abstract": "Jahn--Teller (JT) distortions are a key driver of physical properties in many correlated oxide materials. Cooperative JT distortions, in which long-range orbital order reduces the symmetry of the average structure macroscopically, are common in JT-distorted materials at low temperatures. This long-range order will often melt on heating, \\textit{via} a transition to a high-temperature state without long-range orbital order. The nature of this transition has been observed to vary with different materials depending on crystal structure; in LaMnO$_3$ the transition has generally been interpreted as order-disorder, whereas in layered nickelates $A$NiO$_2$ ($A$=Li,Na) there is a displacive transition. Alternatively, recent theoretical work has suggested that previous attributions of order-disorder may in fact be a consequence of phonon anharmonicity, rather than persistence of JT distortions, which would suggest that the displacive transition may be more common than currently believed. In this work, we run Monte Carlo simulations with a simple Hamiltonian which is modified to include terms dependent on the JT amplitude $ρ$, which is allowed to vary within the simulation \\textit{via} the Metropolis algorithm. Our simulations yield distributions of JT amplitudes consistent with displacive rather than order-disorder behaviour for both perovskites and layered nickelates, suggesting that displacive-like JT transitions may be more common than previously assumed in both perovskites and layered nickelates. We also find significant differences between the transition observed for perovskites compared with layered nickelates, which we attribute to differing extensivity of configurational entropy on the two lattices, showing the crucial role of lattice geometry in determining behaviour."

Considering an IoT network with devices spread in clusters covered by a base station, we present in this paper a novel model-free multiple access and data transmission framework empowered by reinforcement learning, designed for power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access networks to facilitate uplink traffic of small data packets. The framework supports two access modes referred to as contention-based and semi-contention-free, with its core component being a policy gradient algorithm executed at the base station. The base station performs access control and optimal radio resource allocation by periodically broadcasting two control parameters to each cluster of devices that considerably reduce data detection failures with a minimum computation requirement on devices. Numerical results, in terms of system and cluster throughput, throughput fairness, access delay, and energy consumption, demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the framework as network size and traffic load vary."

These systems facilitate product recall and mitigate problems such as counterfeiting, tampering, and theft by tracking the manufacturing and distribution life-cycle of a product. Therefore, traceability systems are a defense mechanism against supply chain attacks and, consequently, have become a target for attackers to circumvent. For example, a counterfeiter may change the trace of a fake product for the trace of an authentic product, fooling the system into accepting a counterfeit product as legit and thereby giving a false sense of security. This systematic analysis starts with the observation that security requirements in existing traceability solutions are often unstructured or incomplete, leaving critical vulnerabilities unaddressed. We synthesized the properties of current state-of-the-art traceability solutions within a single security framework that allows us to analyze and compare their security claims. Using this framework, we objectively compared the security of $17$ traceability solutions and identified several weaknesses and vulnerabilities. This article reports on these flaws, the methodology we used to identify them, and the first security evaluation of traceability solutions on a large scale."

    "abstract": "The recent surge in open-source Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) frameworks, such as LLaVA, provides a convenient kickoff for artificial intelligence developers and researchers. However, most of the MLLM frameworks take vision as the main input modality, and provide limited in-depth support for the modality of speech, audio, and music. This situation hinders the development of audio-language models, and forces researchers to spend a lot of effort on code writing and hyperparameter tuning. We present SLAM-LLM, an open-source deep learning framework designed to train customized MLLMs, focused on speech, language, audio, and music processing. SLAM-LLM provides a modular configuration of different encoders, projectors, LLMs, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning plugins. SLAM-LLM also includes detailed training and inference recipes for mainstream tasks, along with high-performance checkpoints like LLM-based Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Automated Audio Captioning (AAC), and Music Captioning (MC). Some of these recipes have already reached or are nearing state-of-the-art performance, and some relevant techniques have also been accepted by academic papers. We hope SLAM-LLM will accelerate iteration, development, data engineering, and model training for researchers. We are committed to continually pushing forward audio-based MLLMs through this open-source framework, and call on the community to contribute to the LLM-based speech, audio and music processing."

    "abstract": "Current large language model agents predominantly operate under a reactive paradigm, responding only to immediate user queries within short-term sessions. This limitation hinders their ability to maintain long-term user's intents and dynamically adapt to evolving external environments. In this paper, we propose a novel interaction paradigm for proactive Task-oriented Agents capable of bridging the gap between relatively static user's needs and a dynamic environment. We formalize proactivity through two key capabilities, (i) Intent-Conditioned Monitoring: The agent autonomously formulates trigger conditions based on dialog history; (ii) Event-Triggered Follow-up: The agent actively engages the user upon detecting useful environmental updates. We introduce a high-quality data synthesis pipeline to construct complex, multi-turn dialog data in a dynamic environment. Furthermore, we attempt to address the lack of evaluation criteria of task-oriented interaction in a dynamic environment by proposing a new benchmark, namely ChronosBench. We evaluated some leading close-source and open-source models at present and revealed their flaws in long-term task-oriented interaction. Furthermore, our fine-tuned model trained using synthetic data for supervised learning achieves a task completion rate of 85.19% for complex tasks including shifts in user intent, outperforming other models under test. And the result validated the effectiveness of our data-driven strategy."

    "abstract": "This paper develops a complete framework for understanding when a dual truncated Toeplitz operator (DTTO) attains its norm. Given a nonconstant inner function $u$, the DTTO associated with a symbol $\\varphi \\in L^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{T})$ acts on the orthogonal complement ${\\mathcal{K}_u}^{\\perp} = uH^{2} \\oplus H^{2}_{-}$ of the model space $\\mathcal{K}_u = H^{2}\\ominus uH^{2}$. Assuming $\\|\\varphi\\|_{\\infty}=1$, we give a characterization of the norm attaining property of $D_{\\varphi}$ and describe all extremal vectors. A sharp analytic and coanalytic dichotomy emerges $D_{\\varphi}$ attains its norm precisely when the symbol admits either $\\varphi=\\overline{u}\\overlineψ_{+}χ_{+}$ or $\\varphi=uψ_{-}\\overlineχ_{-},$ where $ψ_{\\pm},χ_{\\pm}$ are inner functions. The first condition corresponds to norm attainment on the analytic component $uH^{2}$, while the second corresponds to norm attainment on the coanalytic component $H^{2}_{-}$ via the natural conjugation $C_{u}$. A key feature of the theory is that the dual compressed shift $D_{u}$ (the case $\\varphi(z)=z$) always attains its norm. We also obtain a coupled Toeplitz, Hankel system governing analytic and coanalytic components of extremal vectors, and provide several concrete examples including nonanalytic unimodular symbols illustrating how the factorization criteria govern norm attainment."

    "abstract": "Do Large Language Models (LLMs) genuinely grasp the compositional semantics of events, or do they rely on surface-level probabilistic heuristics? We investigate the Imperfective Paradox, a logical phenomenon where the past progressive aspect entails event realization for activities (e.g., running $\\to$ ran) but not for accomplishments (e.g., building $\\nrightarrow$ built). We introduce ImperfectiveNLI, a diagnostic dataset designed to probe this distinction across diverse semantic classes. Evaluating state-of-the-art open-weight models, we uncover a pervasive Teleological Bias: models systematically hallucinate completion for goal-oriented events, often overriding explicit textual negation. Representational analyses show that while internal embeddings often distinguish process from result, inference decisions are dominated by strong priors about goal attainment. We further find that prompting-based interventions reduce hallucinated completions but also increase incorrect rejections of valid entailments. Our findings suggest that current LLMs lack structural aspectual awareness, operating as predictive narrative engines rather than faithful logical reasoners."

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel class of nonlinear tests for serial dependence in functional time series, grounded in the functional quantile autocorrelation framework. Unlike traditional approaches based on the classical autocovariance kernel, the functional quantile autocorrelation framework leverages quantile-based excursion sets to robustly capture temporal dependence within infinite-dimensional functional data, accommodating potential outliers and complex nonlinear dependencies. We propose omnibus test statistics and study their asymptotic properties under both known and estimated quantile curves, establishing their asymptotic distribution and consistency under mild assumptions. In particular, no moment conditions are required for the validity of the tests. Extensive simulations and an application to high-frequency financial functional time series demonstrate the methodology's effectiveness, reliably detecting complex serial dependence with superior power relative to several existing tests. This work expands the toolkit for functional time series, providing a robust framework for inference in settings where traditional methods may fail."

Here, a non-porous crystalline 1D Fe(II) coordination polymer acting as a porous acetonitrile host is presented. The desorption of interstitial acetonitrile is accompanied by magneto-structural transitions easily detectable in the optical and electronic properties of the material. The structural switch and therefore its (opto)electronic readout are reversible under exposition of the crystal to acetonitrile vapor. Coordination polymers can be versatile sensors for volatile acetonitrile and potentially other organic compounds."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "One of the key challenges in strong gravitational lensing cosmography is the accurate measurement of time delays between multiple lensed images, which are essential for constraining the Hubble constant ($H_0$). We investigate how lens mass-profile assumptions affect time delays. Specifically, we implement a Broken Power Law (BPL) mass model within the Lenstronomy framework (Birrer & Amara 2018), which introduces additional flexibility in the radial mass distribution and can phenomenologically capture deviations from a single power-law profile. This model is combined with a numerical approach to compute time delays at the image positions. We validate the BPL implementation using simulated lenses and compare the results with those obtained from the elliptical power-law (EPL) model. We then apply both model families to the quadruply imaged quasar WGD~2038-4008. Both models fit the imaging and kinematic data comparably well, yet the greater radial freedom in the BPL model shifts the inferred time-delay distance -- and thus $H_0$ -- by an amount comparable to the current discrepancy between early- and late-universe $H_0$ estimates. In a flat $Λ$CDM cosmology, the $H_0$ inferred using the BPL lens model is $75^{+23.1}_{-16.3} \\ \\mathrm{km \\ s^{-1} \\ Mpc^{-1}},$ while the EPL model gives $H_0 = 61^{+19.2}_{-13.2} \\ \\mathrm{km \\ s^{-1} \\ Mpc^{-1}}.$ This difference is largely due to uncertainties in the inner mass profile ($θ<0.2''$), a region where point spread function (PSF) reconstruction is a critical factor -- a finding consistent with results reported in Shajib et al. (2022). This highlights how time-delay cosmography remains sensitive to assumptions about the lens mass profile. With current precision, this difference does not favor one cosmological scenario over another, but rather underscores the importance of flexible mass modeling and PSF modeling."

Machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques guide its exploration and navigation. The effective use of the combined heterogeneous data requires more than just a simple research data management plan. Consequently, our research data management system maps different data modalities in different formats and resolutions from different labs to the correct spatial locations on physical samples. Besides a graphical user interface, the system can also be accessed through an application programming interface for reproducible data-driven workflows. It is implemented by a combination of a custom research data management system designed around a relational database, an ontology which builds upon materials science-specific ontologies, and the construction of a Knowledge Graph. Along with the technical solutions of research data management system and lessons learned, first use cases are shown which were not possible (or at least much harder to achieve) without it."

The aim of this paper is to identify forces generated by a filament-motor network of F-actin and myosin -- actomyosin -- and exerted on the surrounding fluid, therefore causing a fluid flow. In particular, we evaluate optical microscopy data stemming from two different physical settings, confined and non-confined active gels. As a theoretical model, we use the Stokes equation together with an incompressibility condition and suitable boundary conditions reflecting the physical settings. The problem of determining the forces from knowledge on the fluid flow is formulated as an inverse source problem. Due to experimental limitations, only incomplete data are available. We provide a rigorous analysis of the forward problems and the impact of missing data, derive the adjoints of the forward operators needed for regularization, and demonstrate our methods on both synthetic and experimentally measured data."

The formulation applies to electronic systems with an arbitrary number N of electronic states and to response functions of arbitrary order M in the light-matter interaction. We show that Herzberg-Teller coupling introduces additional oscillatory factors in the time-domain response functions, leading, upon Fourier transformation, to replicas of the Franck-Condon multidimensional spectra shifted by integer multiples of the vibrational frequencies. The present results provide a general analytical framework for the interpretation of non-Condon effects in coherent multidimensional spectroscopies."

    "abstract": "Valiant's conjecture asserts that the circuit complexity classes VP and VNP are distinct, meaning that the permanent does not admit polynomial-size algebraic circuits. As it is the case in many branches of complexity theory, the unconditional separation of these complexity classes seems elusive. In stark contrast, the symmetric analogue of Valiant's conjecture has been proven by Dawar and Wilsenach (2020): the permanent does not admit symmetric algebraic circuits of polynomial size, while the determinant does. Symmetric algebraic circuits are both a powerful computational model and amenable to proving unconditional lower bounds. In this paper, we develop a symmetric algebraic complexity theory by introducing symmetric analogues of the complexity classes VP, VBP, and VF called symVP, symVBP, and symVF. They comprise polynomials that admit symmetric algebraic circuits, skew circuits, and formulas, respectively, of polynomial orbit size. Having defined these classes, we show unconditionally that $\\mathsf{symVF} \\subsetneq \\mathsf{symVBP} \\subsetneq \\mathsf{symVP}$. To that end, we characterise the polynomials in symVF and symVBP as those that can be written as linear combinations of homomorphism polynomials for patterns of bounded treedepth and pathwidth, respectively. This extends a previous characterisation by Dawar, Pago, and Seppelt (2026) of symVP. Finally, we show that symVBP and symVP contain homomorphism polynomials which are VBP- and VP-complete, respectively. We give general graph-theoretic criteria for homomorphism polynomials and their linear combinations to be VBP-, VP-, or VNP-complete. These conditional lower bounds drastically enlarge the realm of natural polynomials known to be complete for VNP, VP, or VBP. Under the assumption VFPT $\\neq$ VW[1], we precisely identify the homomorphism polynomials that lie in VP as those whose patterns have bounded treewidth."

    "abstract": "Reliable river flow forecasting is an essential component of flood risk management and early warning systems. It enables improved emergency response coordination and is critical for protecting infrastructure, communities, and ecosystems from extreme hydrological events. Process-based hydrological models and purely data-driven approaches often underperform during extreme events, particularly in forecasting peak flows. To address this limitation, this study introduces a hybrid forecasting framework that couples Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forest (RF). XGBoost is employed for continuous streamflow forecasting, while RF is specifically trained for peak-flow prediction, and the two outputs are combined into an enhanced forecast. The approach is implemented across 857 catchments of the LamaH-CE dataset, using rainfall and discharge observations at 6-hour resolution. Results demonstrate consistently high skill, with 71% of catchments achieving a Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) greater than 0.90. Peak-flow detection reaches 87%, with a false-alarm rate of 13%. Compared to the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS), the framework achieves lower peak-magnitude errors, fewer false alarms, and improved streamflow and peak-flow forecasting accuracy. The proposed framework is computationally lightweight, scalable, and easily transferable across watersheds, with training times of only seconds on standard CPUs. These findings highlight the potential of integrating hydrological understanding with efficient machine learning to improve the accuracy and reliability of operational flood forecasting, and outline future directions for hybrid hydrological-machine learning model development."

With an orbital period of 2.85 d, the transiting sub-Neptune GJ 3090 b has a mass we refine to $4.52 \\pm 0.47 M_{\\oplus}$, which, combined with our derived radius of $2.18 \\pm 0.06 R_{\\oplus}$, yields a density of $2.40^{+0.33}_{-0.30}$ g cm$^{-3}$. The combined interior structure and atmospheric constraints indicate that GJ 3090 b is a compelling water-world candidate, with a volatile-rich envelope in which water likely represents a significant fraction. We also confirm the presence of a second planet, GJ 3090 c, a sub-Neptune with a 15.9 d orbit and a minimum mass of $10.0 \\pm 1.3 M_{\\oplus}$, which does not transit. Despite its proximity to the star's 18 d rotation period, our joint analysis using a multidimensional Gaussian process (GP) model that incorporates TESS photometry and differential stellar temperature measurements distinguishes this planetary signal from activity-induced variability. In addition, we place new constraints on a non-transiting planet candidate with a period of 12.7 d, suggested in earlier RV analyses. This candidate remains a compelling target for future monitoring. These results highlight the crucial role of multidimensional GP modelling in disentangling planetary signals from stellar activity, enabling the detection of a planet near the stellar rotation period that could have remained undetected with traditional approaches."

CallShield introduces a real-time neural watermarking technique that enables per-bit embedding and recovery within 40-millisecond frames of live 8 kHz speech. This capability allows CallShield to transform the real-time audio channel into a noisy serial communication medium. To ensure reliable data transmission, CallShield implements a low-bitrate data link protocol that provides basic frame synchronization along with error detection, correction, and recovery. For caller authentication, CallShield adopts a secure and lightweight symmetric-key protocol that relies on pairwise shared secrets among trusted contacts. The system completes the full authentication process in an average of 63 seconds, including up to three retransmission attempts, making it suitable for real-time deployment. Extensive experiments under realistic telephony conditions demonstrate that CallShield achieves an overall authentication success rates exceeding 99.2% on clean audio and over 95% under common distortions, aided by selective retransmission of failed messages. Additionally, CallShield maintains high audio quality, achieving PESQ scores above 4.2 and STOI scores above 0.94 on clean speech, and exhibits robustness across a wide range of channel distortions, validating its practical viability for secure, real-time caller authentication."

Conventional methods typically rely on simplifying assumptions, such as linear target motion, narrowband operation, or constant velocity, to enable fast computation. However, these assumptions break down in scenarios involving quadratic range-time behavior, high radial velocities or accelerations, or wideband signals, leading to undesired effects such as intra-pulse Doppler shift/stretch and target migration across Range-Doppler cells. This paper presents a generalized waveform-independent Range-Doppler compression approach that compensates for these effects while maintaining minimal Signal-to-Noise-Ratio loss and practical computational efficiency. The performance limits of the proposed method are analyzed and expressed through a unified metric that depends on both scene and system parameters. Comparison with other approaches is presented, showing their estimation bias and performance degradation."

(2024) showed that, when agents have binary marginal values, a $0.1222$-APS allocation can be found in polynomial time, and there exists an instance where no allocation is better than $0.5$-approximate APS. Very recently, Feige and Grinberg (2025) extended the problem to the asymmetric case, where agents may have different entitlements, and improved the approximation ratio to $1/6$ for general XOS valuations. In this work, we focus on the asymmetric setting with binary XOS valuations, and further improve the approximation ratio to $1/2$, which matches the known upper bound. We also present a polynomial-time algorithm to compute such an allocation. Beyond APS fairness, we also study the weighted maximin share (WMMS) fairness. Farhadi et al. (2019) showed that, a $1/n$-WMMS allocation always exists for agents with general additive valuations, and that this approximation ratio is tight. We extend this result to general XOS valuations, where a $1/n$-WMMS allocation still exists, and this approximation ratio cannot be improved even when marginal values are binary. This shows a sharp contrast to binary additive valuations, where an exact WMMS allocation exists and can be found in polynomial time."

    "abstract": "In the information and communications technology (ICT) industry, training a domain-specific large language model (LLM) or constructing a retrieval-augmented generation system requires a substantial amount of high-value domain knowledge. However, the knowledge is not only hidden in the textual modality but also in the image modality. Traditional methods can parse text from domain documents but dont have image captioning ability. Multi-modal LLM (MLLM) can understand images, but they do not have sufficient domain knowledge. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a multi-stage progressive training strategy to train a Domain-specific Image Captioning Model (DICModel) in ICT, and constructs a standard evaluation system to validate the performance of DICModel. Specifically, this work first synthesizes about 7K image-text pairs by combining the Mermaid tool and LLMs, which are used for the first-stage supervised-fine-tuning (SFT) of DICModel. Then, ICT-domain experts manually annotate about 2K image-text pairs for the second-stage SFT of DICModel. Finally, experts and LLMs jointly synthesize about 1.5K visual question answering data for the instruction-based SFT. Experimental results indicate that our DICModel with only 7B parameters performs better than other state-of-the-art models with 32B parameters. Compared to the SOTA models with 7B and 32B parameters, our DICModel increases the BLEU metric by approximately 56.8% and 20.8%, respectively. On the objective questions constructed by ICT domain experts, our DICModel outperforms Qwen2.5-VL 32B by 1% in terms of accuracy rate. In summary, this work can efficiently and accurately extract the logical text from images, which is expected to promote the development of multimodal models in the ICT domain."

    "abstract": "We investigate exact cosmological solutions with a massive scalar field minimally coupled to the Einstein-Hilbert action in General Relativity. For an extended Higgs-like scalar self-interaction, we find that the resulting field equations belong to the damped Ermakov-Painlevé II class and construct novel analytical solutions within the framework of the Chiellini integrability condition. We analyze whether the expanding branch of the solutions can describe a late-time cosmic acceleration, using a combined statistical analysis of BAO, CMB, cosmic chronometer and Pantheon+SHOES supernova datasets. A crucial outcome of this exercise is the analytical emergence of a smooth phantom divide crossing in the dark energy equation of state, achieved without introducing any pathological instabilities. The reconstruction yields a present-day Hubble parameter $H_0 \\gtrsim 70 \\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}\\,Mpc^{-1}}$, with a reduced tension relative to the $Λ$CDM cosmology. The results indicate that Chiellini-integrable scalar cosmologies are capable of providing a robust and analytically controlled framework for modeling late-time cosmic acceleration and phantom divide crossing, offering a viable alternative to phenomenological dark-energy parametrizations."

While activation steering has emerged as a parameter efficient alternative, existing methods apply static, manual interventions that fail to adapt to the dynamic nature of complex reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose RISER (Router-based Intervention for Steerable Enhancement of Reasoning), a plug-and-play intervention framework that adaptively steers LLM reasoning in activation space. RISER constructs a library of reusable reasoning vectors and employs a lightweight Router to dynamically compose them for each input. The Router is optimized via reinforcement learning under task-level rewards, activating latent cognitive primitives in an emergent and compositional manner. Across seven diverse benchmarks, RISER yields 3.4-6.5% average zero-shot accuracy improvements over the base model while surpassing CoT-style reasoning with 2-3x higher token efficiency and robust accuracy gains. Further analysis shows that RISER autonomously combines multiple vectors into interpretable, precise control strategies, pointing toward more controllable and efficient LLM reasoning."

Here we discuss yet another discrete symmetry to which continuous scale invariance can be broken: discrete phase invariance. We first revisit the one-body problem on the half line in the presence of an inverse-square potential -- the simplest example of nontrivial scale-invariant quantum mechanics -- and show that continuous scale invariance can be broken to discrete phase invariance in a small window of coupling constant. We also show that discrete phase invariance manifests itself as circularly distributed simple poles on Riemann sheets of the S-matrix. We then present three examples of few-body problems that exhibit discrete phase invariance. These examples are the one-body Aharonov-Bohm problem, a two-body problem of nonidentical particles in two dimensions, and a three-body problem of nonidentical particles in one dimension, all of which contain a codimension-two ``magnetic'' flux in configuration spaces."

However, human-driven responses are often fragmented and reactive, with policies formulated in isolation and adjusted only after outbreaks escalate, undermining proactive intervention and global pandemic mitigation. To address this challenge, here we propose a large language model (LLM) multi-agent policymaking framework that supports coordinated and proactive pandemic control across regions. Within our framework, each administrative region is assigned an LLM agent as an AI policymaking assistant. The agent reasons over region-specific epidemiological dynamics while communicating with other agents to account for cross-regional interdependencies. By integrating real-world data, a pandemic evolution simulator, and structured inter-agent communication, our framework enables agents to jointly explore counterfactual intervention scenarios and synthesize coordinated policy decisions through a closed-loop simulation process. We validate the proposed framework using state-level COVID-19 data from the United States between April and December 2020, together with real-world mobility records and observed policy interventions. Compared with real-world pandemic outcomes, our approach reduces cumulative infections and deaths by up to 63.7% and 40.1%, respectively, at the individual state level, and by 39.0% and 27.0%, respectively, when aggregated across states. These results demonstrate that LLM multi-agent systems can enable more effective pandemic control with coordinated policymaking..."

    "abstract": "Learning under unobservable feedback reliability poses a distinct challenge beyond optimization robustness: a system must decide whether to learn from an experience, not only how to learn stably. We study this setting as Epistemic Identifiability under Unobservable Reliability (EIUR), where each experience has a latent credibility, reliable and unreliable feedback can be locally indistinguishable, and data are generated in a closed loop by the learner's own evolving beliefs and actions. In EIUR, standard robust learning can converge stably yet form high-confidence, systematically wrong beliefs. We propose metacognitive regulation as a practical response: a second, introspective control loop that infers experience credibility from endogenous evidence in the learner's internal dynamics. We formalize this as a modular Monitor-Trust-Regulator (MTR) decomposition and instantiate it with self-diagnosis, which maintains a slowly varying experience-trust variable that softly modulates learning updates, without exogenous reliability labels or an explicit corruption model. Empirically, in the EIUR regimes studied here, self-diagnosis is associated with improved epistemic identifiability. In reinforcement learning, it enables calibrated skepticism and recovery under systematically corrupted rewards. In supervised learning, it exposes a critical dissociation: performance recovery does not imply epistemic recovery. Accuracy can rebound while internal belief dynamics remain locked-in by early misleading data, a failure detectable only through introspective diagnostics. Together, MTR and self-diagnosis provide an organizing abstraction and a concrete design template for intrinsic reliability assessment in autonomous learning under unobservable reliability."

While recent neural codecs have achieved remarkable empirical results, their distance from the information-theoretic limit remains unclear. Our work addresses this gap by decomposing the R-D performance loss into three key components: variance estimation, quantization strategy, and context modeling. First, we derive the optimal latent variance as the second moment under a Gaussian assumption, providing a principled alternative to hyperprior-based estimation. Second, we quantify the gap between uniform quantization and the Gaussian test channel derived from the reverse water-filling theorem. Third, we extend our framework to include context modeling, and demonstrate that accurate mean prediction yields substantial entropy reduction. Unlike prior R-D estimators, our method provides a structurally interpretable perspective that aligns with real compression modules and enables fine-grained analysis. Through joint simulation and end-to-end training, we derive a tight and actionable approximation of the theoretical R-D limits, offering new insights into the design of more efficient learned compression systems."

We first propose a Dimension-Anchored Evidence Encoder, which integrates three core components: (i) a pre-trained text encoder that transforms qualitative feedback annotations into contextualized embeddings; (ii) a prompt module that represents five teaching dimensions as learnable semantic anchors; and (iii) a cross-attention mechanism that aligns evidence with pedagogical dimensions within a structured semantic space. We then propose a Cross-View Graph Synergy Network to represent student comments. This network comprises two components: (i) a Syntactic Branch that extracts explicit grammatical dependencies from parse trees, and (ii) a Semantic Branch that models latent conceptual relations derived from BERT-based similarity graphs. BiAffine fusion module aligns syntactic and semantic units, while a differential regularizer disentangles embeddings to encourage complementary representations. Finally, a cross-attention mechanism bridges the dimension-anchored evidence with the multi-view comment representations. We also contribute a novel benchmark dataset featuring expert qualitative annotations and multi-label scores.

In this paper, we introduce adaptive anisotropic textured Gaussians (A$^2$TG), a novel representation that generalizes textured Gaussians by equipping each primitive with an anisotropic texture. Our method employs a gradient-guided adaptive rule to jointly determine texture resolution and aspect ratio, enabling non-uniform, detail-aware allocation that aligns with the anisotropic nature of Gaussian splats. This design significantly improves texture efficiency, reducing memory consumption while enhancing image quality. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that A TG consistently outperforms fixed-texture Gaussian Splatting methods, achieving comparable rendering fidelity with substantially lower memory requirements."

    "abstract": "Despite the prevalent assumption of uniform variable importance in long-term time series forecasting models, real world applications often exhibit asymmetric causal relationships and varying data acquisition costs. Specifically, cost-effective exogenous data (e.g., local weather) can unilaterally influence dynamics of endogenous variables, such as lake surface temperature. Exploiting these links enables more effective forecasts when exogenous inputs are readily available. Transformer-based models capture long-range dependencies but incur high computation and suffer from permutation invariance. Patch-based variants improve efficiency yet can miss local temporal patterns. To efficiently exploit informative signals across both the temporal dimension and relevant exogenous variables, this study proposes XLinear, a lightweight time series forecasting model built upon MultiLayer Perceptrons (MLPs). XLinear uses a global token derived from an endogenous variable as a pivotal hub for interacting with exogenous variables, and employs MLPs with sigmoid activation to extract both temporal patterns and variate-wise dependencies. Its prediction head then integrates these signals to forecast the endogenous series. We evaluate XLinear on seven standard benchmarks and five real-world datasets with exogenous inputs. Compared with state-of-the-art models, XLinear delivers superior accuracy and efficiency for both multivariate forecasts and univariate forecasts influenced by exogenous inputs."

This approach utilizes learnable offsets to capture fine-grained structural details across scales while bypassing the computational burden of unified dense representations. To ensure real-time performance, we implement a hardware-aware kernel fusion strategy that maximizes inference throughput. Furthermore, we develop a scalable framework that integrates lightweight architectures with a training protocol leveraging both metric learning and knowledge distillation. This scheme generates a wide spectrum of model variants optimized for diverse deployment constraints. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves superior matching accuracy and exceptional computational efficiency simultaneously. Specifically, the ultra-compact variant matches the precision of SuperPoint while utilizing only 0.004M parameters, achieving a 99.7% reduction in model size. Furthermore, our high-performance configuration outperforms all current state-of-the-art methods, including high-capacity DINOv2-based frameworks, while exceeding 200 FPS on edge devices.

We will then differentiate between relativization and what we will call \"semi-relativization\", i.e., separating classes using only the acceptance problem oracle. We argue the separation of R and RE is a fact that only \"semi-relativization\" proves. We will then \"scale down\" to the polynomial analog of R and RE, to evade the Baker-Gill-Solovay barrier using \"semi-relativized\" diagonalization, noting this subtle distinction between diagonalization and relativization. This \"polynomial acceptance problem\" is then reducible to CIRCUIT-SAT and 3-CNF-SAT proving that these problems are undecidable in polynomial time yet verifiable in polynomial time. \"Semi-relativization\" does not employ arithmetization to evade the relativization barrier, and so itself evades the algebrization barrier of Aaronson and Wigderson. Finally, since semi-relativization is a non-constructive technique, the natural proofs barrier of Razborov and Rudich is evaded. Thus the separation of R and RE as well as P and NP both do not relativize but do \"semi-relativize\", evading all three barriers."

    "abstract": "Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) provides high-resolution electricity consumption data that can enhance monitoring, diagnosis, and decision making in modern power distribution systems. Detecting anomalies in these time-series measurements is challenging due to nonlinear, nonstationary, and multi-scale temporal behavior across diverse building types and operating conditions. This work presents a systematic, power-system-oriented evaluation of a GAN-LSTM framework for smart meter anomaly detection using the Large-scale Energy Anomaly Detection (LEAD) dataset, which contains one year of hourly measurements from 406 buildings. The proposed pipeline applies consistent preprocessing, temporal windowing, and threshold selection across all methods, and compares the GAN-LSTM approach against six widely used baselines, including statistical, kernel-based, reconstruction-based, and GAN-based models. Experimental results demonstrate that the GAN-LSTM significantly improves detection performance, achieving an F1-score of 0.89. These findings highlight the potential of adversarial temporal modeling as a practical tool for supporting asset monitoring, non-technical loss detection, and situational awareness in real-world power distribution networks.

    "abstract": "3D pose estimation from sparse multi-views is a critical task for numerous applications, including action recognition, sports analysis, and human-robot interaction. Optimization-based methods typically follow a two-stage pipeline, first detecting 2D keypoints in each view and then associating these detections across views to triangulate the 3D pose. Existing methods rely on mere pairwise associations to model this correspondence problem, treating global consistency between views (i.e., cycle consistency) as a soft constraint. Yet, reconciling these constraints for multiple views becomes brittle when spurious associations propagate errors. We thus propose COMPOSE, a novel framework that formulates multi-view pose correspondence matching as a hypergraph partitioning problem rather than through pairwise association. While the complexity of the resulting integer linear program grows exponentially in theory, we introduce an efficient geometric pruning strategy to substantially reduce the search space. COMPOSE achieves improvements of up to 23% in average precision over previous optimization-based methods and up to 11% over self-supervised end-to-end learned methods, offering a promising solution to a widely studied problem."

    "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to scale, post-training pruning has emerged as a promising approach to reduce computational costs while preserving performance. Existing methods such as SparseGPT and Wanda achieve high sparsity through layer-wise weight reconstruction or activation-aware magnitude pruning, but rely on uniform or hand-crafted heuristics to determine per-layer sparsity ratios. Moreover, recent work has shown that pruned LLMs suffer from severe factual knowledge degradation, with structured pruning methods experiencing near-total collapse in factual question-answering capabilities. We introduce agent-guided pruning, where a foundation model acts as an adaptive pruning agent to intelligently select which layers to prune at each iteration while preserving critical knowledge pathways. Our method constructs layer-wise sensitivity profiles by combining Wanda-inspired weight-activation metrics with gradient importance scores, normalized as z-scores for model-agnostic comparison. These statistics are processed by an LLM agent equipped with self-reflection capabilities, enabling it to learn from previous pruning outcomes and iteratively refine its strategy. A checkpoint rollback mechanism maintains model quality by reverting when perplexity degradation exceeds a threshold. We evaluate our approach on Qwen3 models (4B and 8B parameters) at approximately 45% sparsity, demonstrating substantial improvements over structured pruning baselines: 56% relative improvement in MMLU accuracy, 19x better factual knowledge retention on FreebaseQA, and 69% lower perplexity degradation. Notably, our framework requires no retraining, operates in a model-agnostic manner, and exhibits effective self-correction with only 2-4 rollbacks across 21-40 iterations, demonstrating that foundation models can effectively guide the compression of other foundation models."

In this work, we introduce Contrastive Geometric Learning for Unified Computational Drug Design (ConGLUDe), a single contrastive geometric model that unifies structure- and ligand-based training. ConGLUDe couples a geometric protein encoder that produces whole-protein representations and implicit embeddings of predicted binding sites with a fast ligand encoder, removing the need for pre-defined pockets. By aligning ligands with both global protein representations and multiple candidate binding sites through contrastive learning, ConGLUDe supports ligand-conditioned pocket prediction in addition to virtual screening and target fishing, while being trained jointly on protein-ligand complexes and large-scale bioactivity data. Across diverse benchmarks, ConGLUDe achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot virtual screening performance in settings where no binding pocket information is provided as input, substantially outperforms existing methods on a challenging target fishing task, and demonstrates competitive ligand-conditioned pocket selection. These results highlight the advantages of unified structure-ligand training and position ConGLUDe as a step toward general-purpose foundation models for drug discovery."

We present two significant advancements related to this conjecture. First, we resolve an open question posed by Courtade and Kumar, proving that for any Boolean function (regardless of bias), the sum of mutual information between the function's output and the individual noisy input coordinates is bounded by $1-H(α)$, where $α$ is the noise parameter of the Binary Symmetric Channel. This generalizes their previous result which was restricted to balanced Boolean functions. Second, we advance the study of the main conjecture in the high noise regime. We establish an optimal error bound of $O(λ^2)$ for the asymptotic entropy expansion, where $λ= (1-2α)^2$, improving upon the previous best-known bounds. This refined analysis leads to a sharp, linear Fourier concentration bound for highly informative functions and significantly extends the range of the noise parameter $λ$ for which the conjecture is proven to hold."

Traditional methods require extensive manual annotation, while existing self-supervised approaches are computationally demanding and ill-suited for long sequences due to memory constraints and temporal error propagation. We introduce a highly efficient, self-supervised method that reframes animal identification as a global clustering task rather than a sequential tracking problem. Our approach assumes a known, fixed number of individuals within a single video -- a common scenario in practice -- and requires only bounding box detections and the total count. By sampling pairs of frames, using a frozen pre-trained backbone, and employing a self-bootstrapping mechanism with the Hungarian algorithm for in-batch pseudo-label assignment, our method learns discriminative features without identity labels. We adapt a Binary Cross Entropy loss from vision-language models, enabling state-of-the-art accuracy ($>$97\\%) while consuming less than 1 GB of GPU memory per batch -- an order of magnitude less than standard contrastive methods. Evaluated on challenging real-world datasets (3D-POP pigeons and 8-calves feeding videos), our framework matches or surpasses supervised baselines trained on over 1,000 labeled frames, effectively removing the manual annotation bottleneck. This work enables practical, high-accuracy animal identification on consumer-grade hardware, with broad applicability in resource-constrained research settings.

The same result holds for periodic unbounded domains with two boundary components. In particular, any such domain is determined by suitable holomorphic data in some algebraic curve. As a consequence, the space of all Serrin ring domains, or periodic Serrin bands, can be ordered into a sequence of finite-dimensional complexity levels. By studying the first non-trivial level, given by elliptic functions, we construct: $(i)$ a global $1$-parameter family of periodic solutions to Serrin's problem that interpolates between a flat band and a chain of disks along an axis, following an unduloid pattern, and $(ii)$ for any $n>1$, a two-dimensional moduli space ${\\bf T}_n$ of non-radial Serrin ring domains with a dihedral symmetry group of order $2n$.

    "abstract": "Constrained propagation of massless fields is ubiquitous in physical systems, arising from boundaries, material structure, or other restrictions on admissible modes. This paper shows that such constraints generically induce mass-like terms in the effective dispersion relation, without modifying the underlying field equations or introducing new degrees of freedom. Working at an abstract level, constraints are represented as linear operators acting on the field's mode space. Restriction of the admissible mode manifold produces a spectral gap whose magnitude is set by the smallest non-zero eigenvalue of an associated positive semidefinite operator. This gap may be identified with an effective mass parameter, yielding a Proca-like dispersion relation in the long-wavelength limit. The resulting Mass Induction Principle identifies rank reduction of the accessible mode space as the structural mechanism responsible for effective mass generation in constrained massless fields. Familiar systems such as plasmas, superconductors, and periodic media realise this structure as special cases, without introducing new dynamics. The analysis is deliberately dispersion-level and non-phenomenological: it does not assert a field-theoretic mass term, does not address vacuum propagation, and does not make claims about bounds on intrinsic particle masses."

In particular, the High Energy Telescopes (HETs) on the STEREO spacecraft observe 0.7-4 MeV electrons and 13-100 MeV protons. This paper summarizes observations of solar energetic particle (SEP) events made by the STEREO HETs from the beginning of the mission through Solar Cycle 24 to December 2023, approaching the maximum of Solar Cycle 25 and encompassing STEREO A's first full orbit of the Sun relative to Earth, completed in August 2023; contact with STEREO B was lost in October 2014. Specifically, the catalog of SEP events including approximately 25 MeV protons observed by the STEREO HETs and/or instruments on spacecraft near Earth in Richardson et al. (2014) is updated to include around 450 SEP events and a total of around 1000 separate observations of these events from the various spacecraft locations. These extensive observations can provide unique insight into the propagation of energetic protons in the inner heliosphere and how the properties of the particle events are related to those of the associated solar eruptions."

Many existing approaches address this difficulty by heavily constraining the protocol search space, which limits the diversity of protocols that can be explored, preventing the discovery of higher-performing solutions. We introduce two gradient-free, LLM-driven closed-loop methods: Prompt-to-Optimizer (P2O), which uses an LLM to propose the code for small neural-network-based protocols, which are then trained by an inner loop, and Prompt-to-Protocol (P2P), which simply writes an explicit function for the current and its scalar parameters. Across our case studies, LLM-guided P2O outperforms neural networks designed by Bayesian optimization, evolutionary algorithms, and random search. In a realistic fast charging scenario, both P2O and P2P yield around a 4.2 percent improvement in state of health (capacity retention based health metric under fast charging cycling) over a state-of-the-art multi-step constant current (CC) baseline, with P2P achieving this under matched evaluation budgets (same number of protocol evaluations). These results demonstrate that LLMs can expand the space of protocol functional forms, incorporate language-based constraints, and enable efficient optimization in high cost experimental settings."

The dominant framing of these threats as \"prompt injection\" -- a catch-all phrase for security failures in LLM-based systems -- obscures a more complex reality: Attacks on LLM-based systems increasingly involve multi-step sequences that mirror traditional malware campaigns. In this paper, we propose that attacks targeting LLM-based applications constitute a distinct class of malware, which we term \\textit{promptware}, and introduce a five-step kill chain model for analyzing these threats. The framework comprises Initial Access (prompt injection), Privilege Escalation (jailbreaking), Persistence (memory and retrieval poisoning), Lateral Movement (cross-system and cross-user propagation), and Actions on Objective (ranging from data exfiltration to unauthorized transactions). By mapping recent attacks to this structure, we demonstrate that LLM-related attacks follow systematic sequences analogous to traditional malware campaigns. The promptware kill chain offers security practitioners a structured methodology for threat modeling and provides a common vocabulary for researchers across AI safety and cybersecurity to address a rapidly evolving threat landscape."

    "abstract": "Most Multimodal Sentiment Analysis research has focused on point-wise regression. While straightforward, this approach is sensitive to label noise and neglects whether one sample is more positive than another, resulting in unstable predictions and poor correlation alignment. Pairwise ordinal learning frameworks emerged to address this gap, capturing relative order by learning from comparisons. Yet, they introduce two new trade-offs: First, they assign uniform importance to all comparisons, failing to adaptively focus on hard-to-rank samples. Second, they employ static ranking margins, which fail to reflect the varying semantic distances between sentiment groups. To address this, we propose a Two-Stage Group-wise Ranking and Calibration Framework (GRCF) that adapts the philosophy of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our framework resolves these trade-offs by simultaneously preserving relative ordinal structure, ensuring absolute score calibration, and adaptively focusing on difficult samples. Specifically, Stage 1 introduces a GRPO-inspired Advantage-Weighted Dynamic Margin Ranking Loss to build a fine-grained ordinal structure. Stage 2 then employs an MAE-driven objective to align prediction magnitudes. To validate its generalizability, we extend GRCF to classification tasks, including multimodal humor detection and sarcasm detection. GRCF achieves state-of-the-art performance on core regression benchmarks, while also showing strong generalizability in classification tasks."

We investigate the dissipative generation of a complex entanglement structure as in a cluster state through engineered Markovian dynamics in the spin systems coupled via Ising interactions. Using the Lindblad master equation, we design a projection based dissipative channel that drives the system toward a unique pure steady state corresponding to the desired cluster state. This is done by removing the contribution of the orthogonal states. By explicitly constructing the Liouvillian superoperator in the full $2^N$-dimensional Hilbert space, we compute the steady-state density matrix, the Liouvillian spectral gap, entanglement witness and the fidelity with respect to the ideal cluster state. The results demonstrate that the cluster state emerges as the steady state when the engineered Liouvillian dissipation dominates over the local Ising interaction between spins. Moreover, we find that the fidelity and Liouvillian spectral gap is relatively insensitive to the system size once the saturation dissipation has been achieved that scales linearly with the qubit number. This analysis illustrates a physically realizable path towards steady-state entanglement generation in the spin systems using engineered dissipation."

We compared AS-CMA to CMA-ES and Bayesian optimization using a range of static sampling times in four simulated cost landscapes. AS-CMA converged on 98% of all runs without adjustment to its tunable parameter, and converged 24-65% faster and with 29-76% lower total cost than each landscape's best CMA-ES static sampling time. As compared to Bayesian optimization, AS-CMA converged more efficiently and reliably in complex landscapes, while in simpler landscapes, AS-CMA was less efficient but equally reliable. We deployed AS-CMA in an exoskeleton optimization experiment and found the optimizer's behavior was consistent with expectations. These results indicate that AS-CMA can improve optimization efficiency in the presence of noise while minimally affecting optimization setup complexity and tuning requirements."

    "abstract": "Optimizing compilers are essential for the efficient and correct execution of software across various scientific fields. Domain-specific languages (DSL) typically use higher level intermediate representations (IR) in their compiler pipelines for domain-specific optimizations. As these IRs add to complexity, it is crucial to test them thoroughly. Random program generators have proven to be an effective tool to test compilers through differential and fuzz testing. However, developing specialized program generators for compiler IRs is not straightforward and demands considerable resources. We introduce MLIR-Forge, a novel random program generator framework that leverages the flexibility of MLIR, aiming to simplify the creation of specialized program generators. MLIR-Forge achieves this by splitting the generation process into fundamental building blocks that are language specific, and reusable program creation logic that constructs random programs from these building blocks. This hides complexity and furthermore, even the language specific components can be defined using a set of common tools. We demonstrate MLIR-Forge's capabilities by generating MLIR with built-in dialects, WebAssembly, and a data-centric program representation, DaCe -- requiring less than a week of development time in total for each of them. Using the generated programs we conduct differential testing and find 9 MLIR, 15 WebAssembly, and 774 DaCe groups of bugs with the corresponding program generators, after running them until the rate of new bugs stagnates."

Also, by leveraging powerful Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), our OpenVoxel successfully build an informative scene map by captioning each group, enabling further 3D scene understanding tasks such as open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) or referring expression segmentation (RES). Unlike previous methods, our method is training-free and does not introduce embeddings from a CLIP/BERT text encoder. Instead, we directly proceed with text-to-text search using MLLMs. Through extensive experiments, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to recent studies, particularly in complex referring expression segmentation (RES) tasks.

Our dataset consists of 2,803 real-world queries spanning 29 diverse technical domains, with four tasks of increasing complexity: text-to-text, multimodal-to-text, multimodal-to-image, and multimodal-to-multimodal retrieval. Extensive evaluation reveals that state-of-the-art models struggle across all tasks: BM25 achieves only 8.5 nDCG@10 on text-only retrieval, while the best multimodal model Nomic-Vision reaches just 27.6 nDCG@10 on multimodal-to-text retrieval actually underperforming the best text-only model (DiVeR: 32.2).

Despite various post-training quantization (PTQ) algorithms being proposed, they mostly focus on integer quantization, while their applicability and behavior under MXFP formats remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, this work conducts a systematic investigation of PTQ under MXFP formats, encompassing over 7 PTQ algorithms, 15 evaluation benchmarks, and 3 LLM families. The key findings include: 1) MXFP8 consistently achieves near-lossless performance, while MXFP4 introduces substantial accuracy degradation and remains challenging; 2) PTQ effectiveness under MXFP depends strongly on format compatibility, with some algorithmic paradigms being consistently more effective than others; 3) PTQ performance exhibits highly consistent trends across model families and modalities, in particular, quantization sensitivity is dominated by the language model rather than the vision encoder in multimodal LLMs; 4) The scaling factor of quantization is a critical error source in MXFP4, and a simple pre-scale optimization strategy can significantly mitigate its impact. Together, these results provide practical guidance on adapting existing PTQ methods to MXFP quantization."

The scale of this data and its unstructured format still continue to grow requiring ever more robust automated extraction and retrieval mechanisms. Existing work, leveraging the web pages Document Object Model (DOM), often derives clustering vectors from coordinates informed by the DOM such as visual placement or tree structure. The construction and component value of these vectors often go unexamined. Our work proposes and examines DOM coordinates in a detail to understand their impact on web page segmentation. Our work finds that there is no one-size-fits-all vector, and that visual coordinates under-perform compared to DOM coordinates by about 20-30% on average. This challenges the necessity of including visual coordinates in clustering vectors. Further, our work finds that simple vectors, comprised of single coordinates, fare better than complex vectors constituting 68.2% of the top performing vectors of the pages examined. Finally, we find that if a vector, clustering algorithm, and page are properly matched, one can achieve overall high segmentation accuracy at 74%. This constitutes a 20% improvement over a naive application of vectors. Conclusively, our results challenge the current orthodoxy for segmentation vector creation, opens up the possibility to optimize page segmentation via clustering on DOM coordinates, and highlights the importance of finding mechanisms to match the best approach for web page segmentation."

    "abstract": "Digital advertising platforms and publishers sell ad inventory that conveys targeting information, such as demographic, contextual, or behavioral audience segments, to advertisers. While revealing this information improves ad relevance, it can reduce competition and lower auction revenues. To resolve this trade-off, this paper develops a general auction mechanism -- the Information-Bundling Position Auction (IBPA) mechanism -- that leverages the targeting information to maximize publisher revenue across both search and display advertising environments. The proposed mechanism treats the ad inventory type as the publisher's private information and allocates impressions by comparing advertisers' marginal revenues. We show that IBPA resolves the trade-off between targeting precision and market thickness: publisher revenue is increasing in information granularity and decreasing in disclosure granularity. Moreover, IBPA dominates the generalized second-price (GSP) auction for any distribution of advertiser valuations and under any information or disclosure regime. We also characterize computationally efficient approximations that preserve these guarantees. Using auction-level data from a large retail media platform, we estimate advertiser valuation distributions and simulate counterfactual outcomes. Relative to GSP, IBPA increases publisher revenue by 68%, allocation rate by 19pp, advertiser welfare by 29%, and total welfare by 54%."

More recent studies have incorporated multimodal information into the reasoning steps; however, they often follow a single task-specific reasoning pattern, which limits their generalizability across various multimodal tasks. In fact, there are numerous multimodal tasks requiring diverse reasoning skills, such as zooming in on a specific region or marking an object within an image. To address this, we propose unified generative multimodal reasoning, which unifies diverse multimodal reasoning skills by generating intermediate images during the reasoning process. We instantiate this paradigm with Omni-R1, a two-stage SFT+RL framework featuring perception alignment loss and perception reward, thereby enabling functional image generation. Additionally, we introduce Omni-R1-Zero, which eliminates the need for multimodal annotations by bootstrapping step-wise visualizations from text-only reasoning data. Empirical results show that Omni-R1 achieves unified generative reasoning across a wide range of multimodal tasks, and Omni-R1-Zero can match or even surpass Omni-R1 on average, suggesting a promising direction for generative multimodal reasoning."

Motivated by this, we extend Nielsen's geometric approach to quantum circuit complexity to incorporate non-invertible gates. These arise naturally from fusion of topological defects and allow transitions between superselection sectors. We realise fusion operations as completely positive, trace-preserving quantum channels. Including such gates makes the sector-changing optimisation problem discrete: it reduces to a weighted shortest-path problem on the fusion graph. Circuit complexity therefore combines continuous geometry within sectors with discrete sector jumps. We illustrate the framework in rational conformal field theories and briefly comment on an AdS$_3$ interpretation in which fusion-induced transitions correspond to geometry-changing boundary operations. A companion paper provides full derivations and extended examples."

    "abstract": "We explore a situation in which the target domain is accessible, but real-time data annotation is not feasible. Instead, we would like to construct an alternative training set from a large-scale data server so that a competitive model can be obtained. For this problem, because the target domain usually exhibits distinct modes (i.e., semantic clusters representing data distribution), if the training set does not contain these target modes, the model performance would be compromised. While prior existing works improve algorithms iteratively, our research explores the often-overlooked potential of optimizing the structure of the data server. Inspired by the hierarchical nature of web search engines, we introduce a hierarchical data server, together with a bipartite mode matching algorithm (BMM) to align source and target modes. For each target mode, we look in the server data tree for the best mode match, which might be large or small in size. Through bipartite matching, we aim for all target modes to be optimally matched with source modes in a one-on-one fashion. Compared with existing training set search algorithms, we show that the matched server modes constitute training sets that have consistently smaller domain gaps with the target domain across object re-identification (re-ID) and detection tasks. Consequently, models trained on our searched training sets have higher accuracy than those trained otherwise. BMM allows data-centric unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) orthogonal to existing model-centric UDA methods. By combining the BMM with existing UDA methods like pseudo-labeling, further improvement is observed."

While leveraging abundant Human-Human Interaction (HHI) data presents a scalable alternative, we first demonstrate that standard retargeting fails by breaking the essential contacts. We address this with PAIR (Physics-Aware Interaction Retargeting), a contact-centric, two-stage pipeline that preserves contact semantics across morphology differences to generate physically consistent HHoI data. This high-quality data, however, exposes a second failure: conventional imitation learning policies merely mimic trajectories and lack interactive understanding. We therefore introduce D-STAR (Decoupled Spatio-Temporal Action Reasoner), a hierarchical policy that disentangles when to act from where to act. In D-STAR, Phase Attention (when) and a Multi-Scale Spatial module (where) are fused by the diffusion head to produce synchronized whole-body behaviors beyond mimicry. By decoupling these reasoning streams, our model learns robust temporal phases without being distracted by spatial noise, leading to responsive, synchronized collaboration. We validate our framework through extensive and rigorous simulations, demonstrating significant performance gains over baseline approaches and a complete, effective pipeline for learning complex whole-body interactions from HHI data."

In this work, we present parameter-free first-principles calculations of the electron and hole mobilities in Bi$_2$O$_2$Se, based on iterative solution of the Boltzmann transport equation that includes electron-phonon scattering and ionized impurity scattering on an equal footing. Intriguingly, we find that Bi$_2$O$_2$Se exhibits high electron mobilities in both the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, whereas the hole mobilities are only significant in the in-plane direction, displaying a unique three-dimensional (3D) electron transport and two-dimensional (2D) hole transport behavior.

Due to its large static dielectric permittivity, Bi$_2$O$_2$Se exhibits an exceptionally high low-temperature electron mobilities above $1.0\\times10^5~\\mathrm{cm^2\\,V^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$, and its electron mobilities above 50~K is robust against ionized impurity scattering over a wide range of impurity concentrations.

A significant challenge is to quantify computing power performance under complex dynamics of communication and computing. To address this challenge, we introduce task completion probability to capture the capability of UAV-CPNs for task computing. We further enhance UAV-CPN performance under a hybrid energy architecture by jointly optimizing UAV altitude and transmit power, where fuel cells and batteries collectively power both UAV propulsion and communication systems. Extensive evaluations show significant performance gains, highlighting the importance of balancing communication and computing capabilities, especially under dual-energy constraints.

    "abstract": "Deep Operator Networks are emerging as fundamental tools among various neural network types to learn mappings between function spaces, and have recently gained attention due to their ability to approximate nonlinear operators. In particular, DeepONets offer a natural formulation for PDE solving, since the solution of a partial differential equation can be interpreted as an operator mapping an initial condition to its corresponding solution field. In this work, we applied DeepONets in the context of process modeling for adsorption technologies, to assess their feasibility as surrogates for cyclic adsorption process simulation and optimization. The goal is to accelerate convergence of cyclic processes such as Temperature-Vacuum Swing Adsorption (TVSA), which require repeated solution of transient PDEs, which are computationally expensive. Since each step of a cyclic adsorption process starts from the final state of the preceding step, effective surrogate modeling requires generalization across a wide range of initial conditions. The governing equations exhibit steep traveling fronts, providing a demanding benchmark for operator learning. To evaluate functional generalization under these conditions, we construct a mixed training dataset composed of heterogeneous initial conditions and train DeepONets to approximate the corresponding solution operators. The trained models are then tested on initial conditions outside the parameter ranges used during training, as well as on completely unseen functional forms. The results demonstrate accurate predictions both within and beyond the training distribution, highlighting DeepONets as potential efficient surrogates for accelerating cyclic adsorption simulations and optimization workflows."

Both functionalities share the same physical signal and perceive each other as impairments. The achievable communication rate is expressed as a function of a coupling parameter that links sensing accuracy to phase error accumulation. Under a fixed bandwidth constraint, the sensing and communication figures of merit define a convex Pareto frontier. The optimal bandwidth allocation satisfying a minimum sensing requirement is derived in closed form. The modified Cramer-Rao bound (MCRB) for range estimation is derived in closed form; this parameter must be estimated to compensate for the frequency offset before data demodulation. Frame synchronization is formulated as a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), and the detection probability is obtained through characteristic function inversion, accounting for residual frequency errors from imperfect range estimation. Numerical results validate the theoretical bounds and characterize the trade-off across the operating range."

    "abstract": "We address the problem of sampling from terminally constrained distributions with pre-trained flow-based generative models through an optimal control formulation. Theoretically, we characterize the value function by a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and derive the optimal feedback control as the minimizer of the associated Hamiltonian. We show that as the control penalty increases, the controlled process recovers the reference distribution, while as the penalty vanishes, the terminal law converges to a generalized Wasserstein projection onto the constraint manifold. Algorithmically, we introduce Terminal Optimal Control with Flow-based models (TOCFlow), a geometry-aware sampling-time guidance method for pre-trained flows. Solving the control problem in a terminal co-moving frame that tracks reference trajectories yields a closed-form scalar damping factor along the Riemannian gradient, capturing second-order curvature effects without matrix inversions. TOCFlow therefore matches the geometric consistency of Gauss-Newton updates at the computational cost of standard gradient guidance. We evaluate TOCFlow on three high-dimensional scientific tasks spanning equality, inequality, and global statistical constraints, namely Darcy flow, constrained trajectory planning, and turbulence snapshot generation with Kolmogorov spectral scaling. Across all settings, TOCFlow improves constraint satisfaction over Euclidean guidance and projection baselines while preserving the reference model's generative quality."

    "abstract": "Accurate global medium-range weather forecasting is fundamental to Earth system science. Most existing Transformer-based forecasting models adopt vision-centric architectures that neglect the Earth's spherical geometry and zonal periodicity. In addition, conventional autoregressive training is computationally expensive and limits forecast horizons due to error accumulation. To address these challenges, we propose the Shifted Earth Transformer (Searth Transformer), a physics-informed architecture that incorporates zonal periodicity and meridional boundaries into window-based self-attention for physically consistent global information exchange. We further introduce a Relay Autoregressive (RAR) fine-tuning strategy that enables learning long-range atmospheric evolution under constrained memory and computational budgets. Based on these methods, we develop YanTian, a global medium-range weather forecasting model. YanTian achieves higher accuracy than the high-resolution forecast of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and performs competitively with state-of-the-art AI models at one-degree resolution, while requiring roughly 200 times lower computational cost than standard autoregressive fine-tuning. Furthermore, YanTian attains a longer skillful forecast lead time for Z500 (10.3 days) than HRES (9 days). Beyond weather forecasting, this work establishes a robust algorithmic foundation for predictive modeling of complex global-scale geophysical circulation systems, offering new pathways for Earth system science."

    "abstract": "While LLM-based agents have shown promise for deep research, most existing approaches rely on fixed workflows that struggle to adapt to real-world, open-ended queries. Recent work therefore explores self-evolution by allowing agents to rewrite their own code or prompts to improve problem-solving ability, but unconstrained optimization often triggers instability, hallucinations, and instruction drift. We propose EvoFSM, a structured self-evolving framework that achieves both adaptability and control by evolving an explicit Finite State Machine (FSM) instead of relying on free-form rewriting. EvoFSM decouples the optimization space into macroscopic Flow (state-transition logic) and microscopic Skill (state-specific behaviors), enabling targeted improvements under clear behavioral boundaries. Guided by a critic mechanism, EvoFSM refines the FSM through a small set of constrained operations, and further incorporates a self-evolving memory that distills successful trajectories as reusable priors and failure patterns as constraints for future queries. Extensive evaluations on five multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EvoFSM. In particular, EvoFSM reaches 58.0% accuracy on the DeepSearch benchmark. Additional results on interactive decision-making tasks further validate its generalization."

    "abstract": "Signal prediction is widely used in, e.g., economic forecasting, echo cancellation and in data compression, particularly in predictive coding of speech and music. Predictive coding algorithms reduce the bit-rate required for data transmission or storage by signal prediction. The prediction gain is a classic measure in applied signal coding of the quality of a predictor, as it links the mean-squared prediction error to the signal-to-quantization-noise of predictive coders. To evaluate predictor models, knowledge about the maximum achievable prediction gain independent of a predictor model is desirable. In this manuscript, Nadaraya-Watson kernel-regression (NWKR) and an information theoretic upper bound are applied to analyze the upper bound of the prediction gain on a newly recorded dataset of sustained speech/phonemes. It was found that for unvoiced speech a linear predictor always achieves the maximum prediction gain within at most 0.3 dB. On voiced speech, the optimum one-tap predictor was found to be linear but starting with two taps, the maximum achievable prediction gain was found to be about 2 dB to 6 dB above the prediction gain of the linear predictor. Significant differences between speakers/subjects were observed. The created dataset as well as the code can be obtained for research purpose upon request."

    "abstract": "Recent progress in large language models and multimodal interaction has made it possible to develop AI companions that can have fluent and emotionally expressive conversations. However, many of these systems have problems keeping users satisfied and engaged over long periods. This paper argues that these problems do not come mainly from weak models, but from poor character design and unclear definitions of the user-AI relationship. I present Mikasa, an emotional AI companion inspired by Japanese Oshi culture-specifically its emphasis on long-term, non-exclusive commitment to a stable character-as a case study of character-driven companion design. Mikasa does not work as a general-purpose assistant or a chatbot that changes roles. Instead, Mikasa is designed as a coherent character with a stable personality and a clearly defined relationship as a partner. This relationship does not force exclusivity or obligation. Rather, it works as a reference point that stabilizes interaction norms and reduces the work users must do to keep redefining the relationship. Through an exploratory evaluation, I see that users describe their preferences using surface-level qualities such as conversational naturalness, but they also value relationship control and imaginative engagement in ways they do not state directly. These results suggest that character coherence and relationship definition work as latent structural elements that shape how good the interaction feels, without users recognizing them as main features. The contribution of this work is to show that character design is a functional part of AI companion systems, not just decoration. Mikasa is one example based on a specific cultural context, but the design principles-commitment to a consistent personality and clear relationship definition-can be used for many emotionally grounded AI companions."

    "abstract": "Ultracompact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) are thought to be remnants of stripped galactic nuclei, among which a handful are known to host a central supermassive black hole (SMBH). As in stripped nuclear star clusters, the SMBHs in UCDs may be fed by stellar winds from old stellar populations, in the absence of substantial gas reservoirs and galactic inflows. In this work, we investigate such a wind-fed accretion scenario for M60-UCD1, which harbors a confirmed $2\\times10^7~M_\\odot$ SMBH and exhibits X-ray emission suggestive of SMBH accretion signature. Using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, we simulate the SMBH accreting stellar winds from approximately 1500 asymptotic giant branch stars, and explore the role of ram pressure from the ambient interstellar or intracluster medium. After 5 Myr, the majority of the stellar winds form a cold gas disk ($\\sim1000~M_\\odot$) within $\\sim10~\\rm pc$ as well as the SMBH's gravitational sphere of influence. Within the inner $10^4~r_{\\rm g}$, this disk transitions into a hot ($\\sim10^7-10^9~\\rm K$), geometrically thick corona that dominates the X-ray emission. The SMBH achieves an accretion rate of $\\sim10^{-5}~M_\\odot~\\rm yr^{-1}$, yielding an X-ray luminosity of $\\sim7\\times10^{37}~\\rm erg~s^{-1}$, well consistent with observations. Including ram pressure stripping reduces both the accretion rate and luminosity by about a factor of two. Our results suggest that the X-ray counterpart of M60-UCD1 originates from a weakly accreting SMBH fed by stellar winds, with broader insights into the feeding mechanisms of central massive black holes and the origins of X-ray sources in other UCDs."

According to classical reaction dynamics theory, the probability density associated with a given state obeys the Liouville equation, the probability density associate d with a given state obeys the Li ouville equation, including influx from and efflux to neighboring states. By introducing a Markov approximation for the crossing of boundaries separating the states, tractable integral equations governing the state populations are derived. Once the time-dependent quantities appearing in these equations are evaluated, the population dynamics on long timescales can be obtained. Because these quantities depend only on a few states in the local neighborhood of a given state, they can be computed using a set of short-timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We apply the present method to the binding and unbinding kinetics of CH$_4$/CH$_4$, Na$^+$/Cl$^-$, and 18-crown-6-ether (crown ether)/K$^+$ in water. For both kinetics, the time constants estimated from the present method are almost comparable to those obtained from brute-force MD simulations. The required timescale of each MD trajectory in the present method is approximately two orders of magnitude shorter than that in the brute-force MD approach in the crown ether/K$^+$ system. This reduction in the trajectory timescale enables applications to complex binding and unbinding sy stems whose characteristic timescales a re far beyond those directly acce ssible by brute-force MD simulati ons."

    "abstract": "The parallel Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocol is viewed as a promising solution to address the consensus scalability issue of the permissioned blockchain. One of the main challenges in parallel BFT is the view change process that happens when the leader node fails, which can lead to performance bottlenecks. Existing parallel BFT protocols typically rely on passive view change mechanisms with blind leader rotation. Such approaches frequently select unavailable or slow nodes as leaders, resulting in degraded performance. To address these challenges, we propose a View Change Optimization (VCO) model based on mixed integer programming that optimizes leader selection and follower reassignment across parallel committees by considering communication delays and failure scenarios. We applied a decomposition method with efficient subproblems and improved benders cuts to solve the VCO model. Leveraging the results of improved decomposition solution method, we propose an efficient iterative backup leader selection algorithm as views proceed. By performing experiments in Microsoft Azure cloud environments, we demonstrate that the VCO-driven parallel BFT outperforms existing configuration methods under both normal operation and faulty condition. The results show that the VCO model is effective as network size increases, making it a suitable solution for high-performance parallel BFT systems."

    "abstract": "We investigate vapor-liquid phase separation of an active near critical Lennard-Jones fluid confined within a cylindrical pore using molecular dynamics simulations. Activity is introduced via Vicsek-type alignment interactions, enabling a systematic study of how self-propulsion modifies domain morphology and coarsening kinetics under quasi-one-dimensional confinement. In the passive limit, the system undergoes early-time spinodal decomposition (diffusive growth characterized by the Lifshitz-Slyozov exponent $α= 1/3$), followed by the formation of periodically modulated, plug-like liquid domains along the pore axis. At late times, coarsening becomes kinetically arrested, and the system remains trapped in a metastable striped state. Introducing activity destabilizes this arrested morphology by enhancing collective domain transport, leading to frequent domain mergers and complete phase separation at sufficiently high activity. The late-stage coarsening then exhibits a crossover to faster, ballistic growth with an effective exponent $α= 2/3$, consistent with a cluster-coalescence mechanism. Analysis of two-point correlation functions and structure factors confirms dynamic scaling across all activity regimes. Our results demonstrate that alignment-induced activity can overcome confinement-driven kinetic arrest, providing new insight into phase separation in confined active fluids. The relevant growth laws are analyzed and interpreted using appropriate theoretical frameworks."

We evaluated five widely used GenAI image platforms (Adobe Firefly, DALL-E 3, Google Imagen 3, Microsoft Image Generator, and Midjourney) using 30 architectural prompts spanning styles, typologies, and codified elements. Each prompt-generator pair produced four images (n = 600 images total). Two architectural historians independently scored each image for accuracy against predefined criteria, resolving disagreements by consensus. Set-level performance was summarized as zero to four accurate images per four-image set. Image output from Common prompts was 2.7-fold more accurate than from Rare prompts (p < 0.05). Across platforms, overall accuracy was limited (highest accuracy score 52 percent; lowest 32 percent; mean 42 percent). All-correct (4 out of 4) outcomes were similar across platforms. By contrast, all-incorrect (0 out of 4) outcomes varied substantially, with Imagen 3 exhibiting the fewest failures and Microsoft Image Generator exhibiting the highest number of failures. Qualitative review of the image dataset identified recurring patterns including over-embellishment, confusion between medieval styles and their later revivals, and misrepresentation of descriptive prompts (for example, egg-and-dart, banded column, pendentive). These findings support the need for visible labeling of GenAI synthetic content, provenance standards for future training datasets, and cautious educational use of GenAI architectural imagery."

We propose DP-FedSOFIM, a server-side second-order optimization framework that leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) as a natural gradient preconditioner while requiring only O(d) memory per client. By employing the Sherman-Morrison formula for efficient matrix inversion, DP-FedSOFIM achieves O(d) computational complexity per round while maintaining the convergence benefits of second-order methods. Our analysis proves that the server-side preconditioning preserves (epsilon, delta)-differential privacy through the post-processing theorem.

We prove the existence and non-uniqueness of operator families satisfying these axioms, establishing that multiple distinct aggregation mechanisms conform to the same foundational principles. Within this framework, we establish operator-agnostic guarantees showing that multi-teacher aggregation reduces both stochastic variance and systematic supervisory bias under heterogeneous teachers, while providing Jensen-type bounds, log-loss guarantees, and safety attenuation properties. For aggregation operators linear in teacher weights, we further establish classical ensemble variance-reduction results under standard independence assumptions, with extensions to correlated-error regimes.

These findings highlight the importance of learned nuisance models for capturing natural variability, and suggest a promising path toward more resilient and calibrated models under challenging conditions."

We calculate the spectrum and essential spectrum of $S_z$ on the Beurling type quotient modules induced by rational inner functions, and give a complete characterization for $S_z^*$ to be a Cowen-Douglas operator. Then we extend the concept of Cowen-Douglas operator to be the generalized Cowen-Douglas operator, and show that $S_z^*$ is a generalized Cowen-Douglas operator. Moreover, we establish the connection between the reducibility of the Hermitian holomorphic vector bundle induced by kernel spaces and the reducibility of the generalized Cowen-Douglas operator. By using the geometric approach, we study the reducing subspaces of $S_z$ on certain polynomial quotient modules."

    "abstract": "Neural operator learning accelerates PDE solution by approximating operators as mappings between continuous function spaces. Yet in many engineering settings, varying geometry induces discrete structural changes, including topological changes, abrupt changes in boundary conditions or boundary types, and changes in the effective computational domain, which break the smooth-variation premise. Here we introduce Discrete Solution Operator Learning (DiSOL), a complementary paradigm that learns discrete solution procedures rather than continuous function-space operators. DiSOL factorizes the solver into learnable stages that mirror classical discretizations: local contribution encoding, multiscale assembly, and implicit solution reconstruction on an embedded grid, thereby preserving procedure-level consistency while adapting to geometry-dependent discrete structures. Across geometry-dependent Poisson, advection-diffusion, linear elasticity, as well as spatiotemporal heat-conduction problems, DiSOL produces stable and accurate predictions under both in-distribution and strongly out-of-distribution geometries, including discontinuous boundaries and topological changes. These results highlight the need for procedural operator representations in geometry-dominated regimes and position discrete solution operator learning as a distinct, complementary direction in scientific machine learning."

In this study, we focus on the challenge of achieving exact amplitude amplification for quantum states with arbitrary amplitude distributions and subsequently propose a Distributed Exact Quantum Amplitude Amplification Algorithm (DEQAAA). Specifically, (1) it supports partitioning across any number of nodes $t$ within the range $2 \\leq t \\leq n$; (2) the maximum qubit count required for any single node is expressed as $\\max \\left(n_0,n_1,\\dots,n_{t-1} \\right) $, where $n_j$ represents the number of qubits at the $j$-th node, with $\\sum_{j=0}^{t-1} n_j =n$; (3) it can realize exact amplitude amplification for multiple targets of a quantum state with arbitrary amplitude distributions; (4) we verify the effectiveness of DEQAAA by resolving a specific exact amplitude amplification task involving two targets (8 and 14 in decimal) via MindSpore Quantum, a quantum simulation software, with tests conducted on 4-qubit, 6-qubit, 8-qubit and 10-qubit systems. Notably, through the decomposition of $C^{n-1}PS$ gates, DEQAAA demonstrates remarkable advantages in both quantum gate count and circuit depth as the qubit number scales, thereby boosting its noise resilience. In the 10-qubit scenario, for instance, it achieves a reduction of over $97\\%$ in both indicators compared to QAAA and EQAAA, underscoring its outstanding resource-saving performance."

    "abstract": "Single-domain generalized deep metric learning (SDG-DML) faces the dual challenge of both category and domain shifts during testing, limiting real-world applications. Therefore, aiming to learn better generalization ability on both unseen categories and domains is a realistic goal for the SDG-DML task. To deliver the aspiration, existing SDG-DML methods employ the domain expansion-equalization strategy to expand the source data and generate out-of-distribution samples. However, these methods rely on proxy-based expansion, which tends to generate samples clustered near class proxies, failing to simulate the broad and distant domain shifts encountered in practice. To alleviate the problem, we propose CenterPolar, a novel SDG-DML framework that dynamically expands and constrains domain distributions to learn a generalizable DML model for wider target domain distributions. Specifically, \\textbf{CenterPolar} contains two collaborative class-centric polarization phases: (1) Class-Centric Centrifugal Expansion ($C^3E$) and (2) Class-Centric Centripetal Constraint ($C^4$). In the first phase, $C^3E$ drives the source domain distribution by shifting the source data away from class centroids using centrifugal expansion to generalize to more unseen domains. In the second phase, to consolidate domain-invariant class information for the generalization ability to unseen categories, $C^4$ pulls all seen and unseen samples toward their class centroids while enforcing inter-class separation via centripetal constraint. Extensive experimental results on widely used CUB-200-2011 Ext., Cars196 Ext., DomainNet, PACS, and Office-Home datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our CenterPolar over existing state-of-the-art methods. The code will be released after acceptance."

    "abstract": "Fine-grained labor market analysis increasingly relies on mapping unstructured job advertisements to standardized skill taxonomies such as ESCO. This mapping is naturally formulated as an Extreme Multi-Label Classification (XMLC) problem, but supervised solutions are constrained by the scarcity and cost of large-scale, taxonomy-aligned annotations--especially in non-English settings where job-ad language diverges substantially from formal skill definitions. We propose a zero-shot skill extraction framework that eliminates the need for manually labeled job-ad training data. The framework uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to synthesize training instances from ESCO definitions, and introduces hierarchically constrained multi-skill generation based on ESCO Level-2 categories to improve semantic coherence in multi-label contexts. On top of the synthetic corpus, we train a contrastive bi-encoder that aligns job-ad sentences with ESCO skill descriptions in a shared embedding space; the encoder augments a BERT backbone with BiLSTM and attention pooling to better model long, information-dense requirement statements. An upstream RoBERTa-based binary filter removes non-skill sentences to improve end-to-end precision. Experiments show that (i) hierarchy-conditioned generation improves both fluency and discriminability relative to unconstrained pairing, and (ii) the resulting multi-label model transfers effectively to real-world Chinese job advertisements, achieving strong zero-shot retrieval performance (F1@5 = 0.72) and outperforming TF--IDF and standard BERT baselines. Overall, the proposed pipeline provides a scalable, data-efficient pathway for automated skill coding in labor economics and workforce analytics."

More specifically, our method uses a machine learning model on-the-fly to automatically select the optimal number of threads for a given GEMM task based on the collected training data. Test results on two different HPC node architectures, one based on a two-socket Intel Cascade Lake and the other on a two-socket AMD Zen 3, revealed a 25 to 40 per cent speedup compared to traditional GEMM implementations in BLAS when using GEMM of memory usage within 100 MB."

In this paper, we consider rovers using machine learning to localise themselves in a local aerial map using limited field-of-view monocular ground-view RGB images as input. A key consideration for machine learning methods is that real space data with ground-truth position labels suitable for training is scarce. In this work, we propose a novel method of localising rovers in an aerial map using cross-view-localising dual-encoder deep neural networks. We leverage semantic segmentation with vision foundation models and high volume synthetic data to bridge the domain gap to real images. We also contribute a new cross-view dataset of real-world rover trajectories with corresponding ground-truth localisation data captured in a planetary analogue facility, plus a high volume dataset of analogous synthetic image pairs. Using particle filters for state estimation with the cross-view networks allows accurate position estimation over simple and complex trajectories based on sequences of ground-view images."

    "abstract": "Multi-constraint planning involves identifying, evaluating, and refining candidate plans while satisfying multiple, potentially conflicting constraints. Existing large language model (LLM) approaches face fundamental limitations in this domain. Pure reasoning paradigms, which rely on long natural language chains, are prone to inconsistency, error accumulation, and prohibitive cost as constraints compound. Conversely, LLMs combined with coding- or solver-based strategies lack flexibility: they often generate problem-specific code from scratch or depend on fixed solvers, failing to capture generalizable logic across diverse problems. To address these challenges, we introduce the Scalable COde Planning Engine (SCOPE), a framework that disentangles query-specific reasoning from generic code execution. By separating reasoning from execution, SCOPE produces solver functions that are consistent, deterministic, and reusable across queries while requiring only minimal changes to input parameters. SCOPE achieves state-of-the-art performance while lowering cost and latency. For example, with GPT-4o, it reaches 93.1% success on TravelPlanner, a 61.6% gain over the best baseline (CoT) while cutting inference cost by 1.4x and time by ~4.67x.

By identifying appropriate Born--Infeld type Higgs potentials, we show that the highly nonlinear energy functionals admit exact topological lower bounds saturated by coupled first-order equations. The resulting models accommodate both vortex-vortex and vortex-antivortex configurations and generalize previously known single-species Born--Infeld systems to interacting multi-component settings. Beyond the derivation of the Bogomol'nyi equations, we develop an exact thermodynamic theory for pinned multivortex configurations in both the full plane and compact doubly periodic domains. Owing to the linear dependence of the Bogomol'nyi energy spectrum on topological charges, we obtain closed-form expressions for the canonical partition function, internal energy, heat capacity, and magnetization. In compact domains, the Bradlow type geometric bounds constrain admissible vortex numbers and lead to qualitatively new high-temperature behavior. In particular, vortex-only systems exhibit spontaneous magnetization, while vortex-antivortex systems do not, reflecting the underlying symmetry between opposite topological charges. These results provide a rare analytically solvable framework for studying thermodynamics in nonlinear multi-component gauge theories regulated by the Born--Infeld electrodynamics."

Procrystal has emerged as a new category of solids, featuring a long-range ordered lattice framework tiled with disordered atomic or molecular structures on the lattice sites, arousing great interest due to its novel structural and physical properties. However, the electronic analogue of a procrystal, dubbed as an electronic procrystalline (EPC) state, has never been experimentally observed. Here, we report the observation of an EPC state in a moire superstructure formed between a monolayer metallic NiTe2 and a superconductor NbSe2 with incommensurate lattice wavevectors. The observed EPC state exhibits a long-range periodic charge modulation at the moire scale inlaid with short-range irregular orders within each moire cell. Strikingly, the short-range charge orders inside the moire unit cells have proximately root3*root3 quasi-period, which is absent in pristine NiTe2. Intriguingly, the EPC order is also observed in the superconducting state of the moire superstructure. Furthermore, the emergent EPC state and short-range charge order, coexisting with the proximity induced superconductivity, can be precisely modulated with the thickness of NiTe2. Our findings uncover the potential of moire platform for understanding and tuning novel correlated quantum phases with this exotic procrystalline order."

To reveal the fundamental performance limit of the proposed hybrid sensing mode, we derive closed-form Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for sensing target localization and velocity estimation, as functions of target and UE positions. The results reveal that significant performance gains can be achieved over the purely mono- or bi-static sensing, especially when the BS-target-UE form a favorable geometry, which is close to a right triangle. The analytical results are validated by simulations using effective parameter estimation algorithm and weighted mean square error (MSE) fusion method. Based on the derived sensing bound, we further analyze the sensing coverage by varying the UE positions, which shows that sensing coverage first improves then degrades as the BS-UE separation increases. Furthermore, the sensing accuracy for a potential target with best UE selection is derived as a function of the UE density in the network."

Targeting MIMO detection, a dense, NP-hard problem central to wireless communications, we fit 15 temperature replicas of a 128-node sparsified system (1,920 p-bits) entirely on-chip and achieve bit error rates significantly below conventional linear detectors. We report complete end-to-end solution times of 4.7 ms per instance, with all loading, sampling, readout, and verification overheads included. ASIC projections in 7 nm technology indicate about 90 MHz operation with less than 200 mW power dissipation, suggesting that massive parallelism across multiple chips could approach the throughput demands of next-generation wireless systems. However, sparsification introduces sensitivity to the copy-constraint strength. Employing Two-Dimensional Parallel Tempering (2D-PT), which exchanges replicas across both temperature and constraint dimensions, we demonstrate over 10X faster convergence without manual parameter tuning.

Across SQL correctness, answer groundedness, retrieval effectiveness, and expert evaluation, SpectraQuery demonstrates strong performance: approximately 80 percent of generated SQL queries are fully correct, synthesized answers reach 93-97 percent groundedness with 10-15 retrieved passages, and battery scientists rate responses highly across accuracy, relevance, grounding, and clarity (4.1-4.6/5).

Our work is a significant generalization of a recent result of Rameshwar and Lalitha (2025) that showed that the RPA decoder provably achieves vanishing error probabilities for \"low-rate\" RM codes, over the binary symmetric channel (BSC). While a straightforward generalization of the proof strategy in that paper will require additional, restrictive assumptions on the BMS channel, our technique, which employs an equivalence between the RPA projection operation and a part of the \"channel combining\" phase in polar codes, requires no such assumptions. Interestingly, such an equivalence allows for the use of a generic union bound on the error probability of the first-order RM code (the \"base case\" of the RPA decoder), under maximum-likelihood decoding, which holds for any BMS channel. We then exploit these observations in the proof strategy outlined in the work of Rameshwar and Lalitha (2025), and argue that, much like in the case of the BSC, one can obtain vanishing error probabilities, in the large $n$ limit (where $n$ is the blocklength), for RM orders that scale roughly as $\\log \\log n$, for all BMS channels."

    "abstract": "In fault-tolerant quantum computing, a large number of physical qubits are required to construct a single logical qubit, and a single quantum node may be able to hold only a small number of logical qubits. In such a case, the idea of distributed fault-tolerant quantum computing (DFTQC) is important to demonstrate large-scale quantum computation using small-scale nodes. However, the design of distributed systems on small-scale nodes, where each node can store only one or a few logical qubits for computation, has not been explored well yet. In this paper, we propose network-based quantum computation (NBQC) to efficiently realize distributed fault-tolerant quantum computation using many small-scale nodes. A key idea of NBQC is to let computational data continuously move throughout the network while maintaining the connectivity to other nodes. We numerically show that, for practical benchmark tasks, our method achieves shorter execution times than circuit-based strategies and more node-efficient constructions than measurement-based quantum computing. Also, if we are allowed to specialize the network to the structure of quantum programs, such as peak access frequencies, the number of nodes can be significantly reduced. Thus, our methods provide a foundation in designing DFTQC architecture exploiting the redundancy of many small fault-tolerant nodes."

    "abstract": "Error-mitigation methods for Ising machines are reexamined not merely as noise-suppression techniques but as a structural design problem of replica-coupled Ising models. Using simulated annealing as a hardware-noise-free testbed, we systematically compare the penalty-spin (PS) model, which couples replicas through a centralized auxiliary layer, with the stacked model, which couples adjacent replicas directly. Numerical experiments on the quadratic assignment problem reveal that the ferromagnetically coupled stacked model stably maintains constraint satisfaction and improves solution quality over a broad parameter range, exhibiting favorable scalability with both the number of replicas and problem size. In contrast, the PS model suffers from cooperation collapse at large parallelism: many-replica averaging in the PS layer washes out sparse solution information, preventing effective inter-replica coordination. These findings demonstrate that the topology of inter-replica couplings decisively influences search robustness, and provide practical guidelines for model selection and parameter tuning in constrained optimization."

    "abstract": "Holographic black holes exhibit a striking relation between thermal boundary one-point functions and bulk geodesic lengths. In the large conformal-dimension limit, the one-point function of a primary operator is given by the exponential of the geodesic length from its boundary insertion point to the horizon. We test the robustness of this relation under perturbations by considering an arbitrary radial deformation of an Euclidean BTZ black hole and working to first order in the perturbation. We find that the relation remains robust: the corrected one-point function at large conformal dimension is still governed by an exponent proportional to the modified boundary-to-horizon geodesic length. The result is established using WKB and saddle-point methods, with the validity of the WKB approximation justified by exact analyses."

We completely answer this question over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero or larger than the size of the matrix: An $n \\times n$ matrix $A$ admits a nonzero diagonal matrix $D$ such that $A$ and $A+D$ have the same spectrum if and only if, for some size $k$, the $k \\times k$ principal minors of $A$ are not all equal. This relates to the classical additive inverse eigenvalue problem in numerical analysis and has implications for existence and rigidity results in the theory of Floquet isospectrality of discrete periodic operators in solid state physics. The proof employs new techniques involving Hilbert schemes of points and the infinitesimal structure of the Hilbert--Chow morphism."

The calculations employ chiral semilocal momentum-space regularized two- and three-nucleon interactions, together with consistently regularized one- and two-nucleon electromagnetic charge operators. With the short-range charge density fixed to the $^4$He charge radius, the predicted FFs and the $^6$Li radius show good agreement with available experimental data. We find that two-nucleon charge density contributions are essential for describing the FFs, particularly at intermediate and large momentum transfers. Although their influence on the charge radii is limited, these contributions remain crucial for attaining accurate predictions. The present results highlight the importance of two-nucleon charge operators in addressing the long-standing underestimation of nuclear charge radii in \\textit{ab initio} calculations based on modern chiral interactions."

    "abstract": "The application of Large Language Model (LLM) in healthcare is rapidly advancing from theoretical concepts to practical implementation. However, current development remains largely fragmented, often manifesting as single-point or siloed solutions focused on isolated tasks within specific modalities. This piecemeal approach is reaching its inherent limitations, proving insufficient to fundamentally address the pervasive challenges of complexity, inefficiency, and trust deficits plaguing modern healthcare systems. This paper argues for a critical paradigm shift: from point optimization to systemic reconstruction in LLM-driven healthcare. To achieve this, we propose a systematic, phased tri-pillar architectural blueprint. This comprehensive framework integrates three core components: 1) a personalized life adviser for pre-consultation support, 2) an automatic clinical pathway generation and scheduling engine AutoCLP designed to enhance clinical productivity, and 3) a prediction and simulation engine to facilitate the transition from reactive to proactive and predictive medicine. We detail the composition of this blueprint, and explore the critical technical, ethical, and regulatory challenges that must be overcome for its successful adoption. Ultimately, this paper aims to provide a clear strategic direction and serves as a call to action for the next decade of intelligent healthcare development."

Robotic systems are deterministic, while human-based picker-to-parts warehouses are not.

The dimensionless governing equations of Cu-water nanofluid flow in a square cavity involving oxytactic bacteria under the effect of a magnetic source are numerically solved by radial basis function collocation method. In various values of Rayleigh, bioconvection Rayleigh, Peclet, Hartmann, magnetic numbers and coordinates of location of magnetic source, an iterative system is executed, and the outputs, average Nusselt and Sherwood numbers, density and the mean of bacteria are stored with the associated computed parameter values. The dataset of size 3645 × 11 created by this way is used for neural network modeling. The different train-test set sizes as well as the number of hidden layers, the layer sizes are controlled. In the light of mean squared error metric results, the obtained models show that the one layer neural network using small number of neurons also give good results.

    "abstract": "The design of electromagnetic metamaterials to achieve desired functionalities often presents a challenging inverse problem, where the required structural parameters are sought for a given electromagnetic response. Traditional computational electromagnetic simulation (CEMS) methods can be computationally expensive and inefficient for exploring the vast design space. Over the past several years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool to address these challenges, leading to the development of various deep inverse models (DIMs). These models aim to learn the inverse mapping from a desired spectral response to the corresponding metamaterial geometry. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the different types of DIMs applied in metamaterials design, discusses the inherent difficulties of the inverse problem, including its ill-posed nature, compares the performance of various DIMs based on accuracy and inference speed, and highlights future directions in this rapidly advancing field. We explore the strengths and limitations of different DIM architectures, such as Invertible Neural Networks, Neural Adjoint methods, and Tandem Networks, in tackling the complexities of metamaterial inverse design, particularly the issue of non-uniqueness in solutions."

    "abstract": "As the global energy transition accelerates, the penetration rate of distributed power sources such as photovoltaics, wind power, and micro gas turbines continues to rise within distribution grids. This shift is driving the evolution of distribution grids from traditional radial, unidirectional power supply networks into complex networks characterized by multiple sources and bidirectional power flows. However, the intermittent, fluctuating nature, and output uncertainty of DGs, coupled with the inherent high resistance-to-reactance ratio (R/X) characteristic of distribution grids, have led to increasingly prominent issues such as voltage fluctuations, voltage over-limiting, and transient voltage instability. These problems severely threaten the power supply quality and safe operation of distribution grids. This paper first systematically analyzes the key factors influencing DG integration on distribution grid voltage stability, including DG type, integration location and capacity, load characteristics, and distribution grid topology parameters. Second, it reviews mainstream voltage stability analysis methods, comparing the applicability and advantages/disadvantages of static versus dynamic analysis. Building on this, it proposes a \"local-regionalglobal\" hierarchical cooperative voltage control strategy. This integrates local DG regulation, regional optimization of multiple DGs, and grid-wide dispatch coordination. By incorporating advanced techniques such as model predictive control and distributed consensus algorithms, it achieves precise responses to DG uncertainties and multi-device cooperative control. Finally, a distribution network simulation model incorporating high-penetration PV and energy storage is constructed using MATLAB/Simulink to validate the proposed control strategy's effectiveness in suppressing voltage fluctuations and rapidly restoring voltage stability. Research findings demonstrate that the hierarchical collaborative control strategy maintains voltage deviation within ±5% of rated voltage and reduces transient voltage recovery time to under 0.5 seconds, providing theoretical support and technical reference for voltage stability control in high-penetration DG distribution grids."

    "abstract": "The Log-Structured Merge (LSM) tree is a widely used storage engine in key-value systems, but its compaction process is a major performance bottleneck due to high computational and I/O demands. While GPU-accelerated compaction (GPU Compaction) has emerged as an efficient solution, state-of-the-art approaches rely on CPU-centric GPU-SSD direct I/O stacks, suffering from synchronization overhead between IO and GPU Computation and limited GPU-SSD IO bandwidth. To address these limitations, we propose GCLComp, a GPUCentric LSM Compaction Strategy based on GPU-Initiated Direct Storage (GIDS). It is a computational storage architecture application based on GPU and GIDS. GCLComp introduces MiniFS, an efficient user-space Host-GPU shared-driver file storage system specifically designed for GPU-accelerated LSM compaction. It enables GPU-initiated I/O for compaction and higher GPU-SSD IO throughput. This allows the GPU to independently read the input files required for compaction from the SSD, perform compaction, and write the output to SSD, minimizing CPU involvement. GCLComp further employs a GPU IO-Computation Pipeline using CUDA streams to seamlessly orchestrate I/O and computation, eliminating synchronization overhead. The experimental results show that MiniFS improves read and write throughput by 52 % and 34 %, respectively, over the state-of-the-art. Based on that, GCLComp achieves up to 19.16 % higher compaction throughput, 21.98 % higher average Fillrandom throughput, 17.59 % lower average Fillrandom latency, 97.27 % lower Fillrandom P999 tail latency and 31.85% higher ReadWriteMix throughput under the KV store, compared to SOTA. We also find that compaction throughput scales nearly linearly with pipeline batch size by a sensitivity analysis."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of cryptocurrencies, the demand for cross-chain transactions (CCTx) has increased significantly. Although mainstream approaches, such as notary schemes, hash time-lock contracts (HTLC), and relay chains, can enable cross-chain asset transfers, they generally suffer from low efficiency and high cost issues. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Notary Group-Based Cross-Chain Channel Protocol (NCCP) for secure and scalable interoperable payments, which integrates off-chain payment channels with a notary-based mechanism to achieve efficient and secure CCTx. The protocol facilitates multiple rounds of asset interactions off-chain and submits final settlement to the blockchain only upon channel closure, thereby significantly reducing on-chain overhead. To mitigate security challenges arising from blockchain isolation, a verifiable notary mechanism is designed to ensure consistency of channel states, accompanied by an incentive and penalty scheme to enhance system reliability. A prototype system is implemented on the Ethereum test networks. Security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that NCCP outperforms existing approaches in terms of both performance and security."

However, far-infrared thermopiles lack the format size of bolometers, resulting in limited spectral and spatial resolution. Increasing the absorber area of pixel units in the focal plane array is critical to improve detector sensitivity and increase the spatial resolution. We present here our recent fabrication efforts to increase the absorber area by fabricating a cantilever structure where the thermoelectric lines are under the structure."

To address this problem, we propose an approach that combines the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) with 2-Opt local search. A comparative analysis was conducted against a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solver and standard GRASP variants. The results demonstrate that the GRASP + 2-Opt approach strikes a favorable balance between optimality and execution time.

To address these challenges, we propose Focus, which introduces three key innovations to achieve fault-tolerant scheduling: (1) a dynamic reservation algorithm that leverages cluster-level predictive thresholds to maintain flexible buffer capacity for sudden workload spikes, thus ensuring efficient scheduling under peak demand; (2) a multi-level load-queue architecture that enhances tolerance to task load fluctuations through probabilistic machine selection; and (3) a past information conservative mechanism combined with dynamic weighted drift detection to mitigate prediction degradation. Through the evaluation of 40 million task executions across real-world traces, Focus demonstrates superior load balancing compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, reducing load imbalance by 23.3 % under prediction errors up to 20 %."

    "abstract": "Because of the increasing speed gap between speed of compute and storage, caching is critical for improving the throughput of distributed file systems. It has been shown that prefetching can hide the latency resulted by network communication or disk operations. However, conventional client-based prefetching schemes are not efficient in distributed file systems as the limited computing and memory power of client nodes. In this paper, we present an effective and load-aware server-side prefetching scheme for distributed file systems, name SSPF. As an orthogonal approach, SSPF can be coupled with any existing caching scheme. First, SSPF exploits spatial locality to improve the efficiency of the prefetching cache and minimize memory requirement. Then, for maximizing the efficiency of cache, a multi-queue based cache manager is designed to coordinate between the prefetching blocks and other caching blocks. Furthermore, a heuristic-based request distribution strategy is proposed to optimize the balance between data server nodes and improve the overall performance. Finally, we have implemented and evaluated SSPF on the real distributed file system. Experimental results show that SSPF can significantly improve the read performance with negligible memory over-head."

However, the high mobility of vehicles and dynamic task arrivals lead to uneven load distribution among RSUs, severely impacting system performance. Actually, load balancing as an important evaluation metric for VEC system greatly affects the performance of individual edge servers in terms of latency, energy consumption, and task completion rates. In view of this, we propose a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to determine the task offloading and migration decisions and incorporate the fairness into the constraint, aiming to achieve efficient load-balanced task offloading in VEC. Particularly, we introduce a metric named Load Balancing Metric (LBM) to optimize RSU resource allocation and employ dynamical task migration strategies to optimize the metric. Simulation results demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances load balancing performance, reduces average latency and energy consumption, and provides an efficient resource scheduling solution for VEC systems."

The nonlinear dynamic model of the exoskeleton is derived using the Euler-Lagrange formulation, focusing on planar shoulder and elbow motions.

The data of Air Landings Statistics dataset is used and supervised multiple learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and SGD Classifier are applied. An Ensemble Voting Classifier is used to improve the reliability of these models. After preprocessing, feature selection and normalization, each model is evaluated in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score. Results of experiments show that ensemble model has the best accuracy of 94.7% exceeding other individual classifiers. An accessible interface has been provided to the pilots and analysts for predictions based on the data and also to have a view on their existing flight data. It is shown that proposed approach use of data-driven prediction can support active aviation safety and reduce risks of hard landing."

Motivated by the challenges of traditional underwater vehicles in terms of maneuverability and adaptability, the study aims to leverage bio-inspired propulsion strategies to enhance aquatic navigation in constrained environments. The fish robot is designed and developed with a hydrodynamic structure, incorporating active and passive fins and flexible joints to mimic natural fish movements. The dynamic and kinematic models are derived using Lagrangian mechanics, and a Central Pattern Generator (CPG)-based control scheme is implemented to generate rhythmic joint actuation without requiring precise trajectory planning. Simulation studies conducted in MATLAB/Simulink demonstrate smooth transitions from static to straight-line and turning maneuvers with a maximum lateral deviation of under 2 cm and a root mean square trajectory error of 0.0143 m. Experimental validations, both mid-air and in a water tank, confirm the sinusoidal motion patterns and verify the effectiveness of the control strategy. The results showcase the robot’s capability for stable and lifelike planar swimming, offering a promising platform for further developments in autonomous underwater systems."

While numerous crowd models exist, each possesses distinct strengths and weaknesses, making no single model universally applicable. Consequently, selecting an appropriate model for a specific scenario presents a significant challenge. To address this issue, our research focuses on a method to classify simulation environments into categories and select a suitable crowd model based on this classification. As a key component of this approach, this paper proposes a methodology to evaluate the suitability of crowd models. This involves comparing pedestrian movement trajectories extracted from real-world datasets with those generated by crowd simulations conducted in equivalent virtual environments. Specifically, we represent the variations within sets of movement trajectories as probability distributions. The similarity between the distribution derived from the real-world dataset and the distribution generated by the simulation serves as the evaluation metric. Furthermore, we present evaluation experiments using real-world datasets and a crowd simulator to validate the effectiveness of the proposed evaluation approach."

A brownfield advance is necessary to verify systems where these helpless devices are present: putting in place basic security mechanisms within the system to render the system powerless possibly. Gadgets should cohabit without threatening their security in the same device. IoT network security has evolved into a platform that can segregate a large number of IoT devices, allowing law enforcement to compel the communication of defenseless devices in order to reduce the damage done by its unlawful transaction. IoT network security appears to be doable in well-known gadget types and can be deployed with minimum transparency."

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence applications are developing rapidly, placing higher demands on the efficient use of computational power. Workflow offloading in wide-area environments can effectively utilize resources to improve task execution efficiency. However, cross-domain computational power scheduling and peak business periods often lead to network congestion and computational node overload, resulting in imbalanced utilization of wide-area computational resources. This makes it difficult to ensure the overall stability of the computational network and the fairness of resource utilization. This paper proposes the workflow scheduling method of computing power network based on load balance of voting mechanism. First, a multi-objective optimization model for workflow task scheduling is constructed. Then, a Voting-mechanism-based Multi-objective Optimization Algorithm is proposed, which combines the Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization Algorithm based on Unequal Grid Division (IGEA) and the Multi-objective Artificial Rabbit Optimization Algorithm (MOARO). This method adaptively adjusts the weight of each algorithm during the optimization process to optimize the completion time of computationally intensive and data-intensive workflows, as well as the computational network resource utilization. Finally, experiments are conducted on different workflow combination scenarios. The proposed algorithm is compared with the MOARO and IGEA multiobjective optimization algorithms to validate the effectiveness of the method presented in this paper."

The fire outside the unit may spread inside the unit which may cause a huge fire accident resulting in loss of materials and human lives. This project is designed to prevent the fire accident occur outside the fireworks unit using various sensors and water suppression system. Smoke sensor and temperature sensor detects the surrounding environmental changes and activates the water system at a slower rate when temperature and smoke reach above the threshold. Flame sensor detects the fire occur in surrounding and enables water system at higher rate of speed. It gives alert to the workers through buzzer and sends/call to the owner and rescue team through GSM module. All the sensor data are stored at Thingspeak cloud platform for analysis. These data form the foundation for future development of ML- based predictive model to determine the ignition probability under different climate conditions to provide a better results and safety."

    "abstract": "Maintaining steady oscillations is a requirement for several electromechanical systems such as oral cavity scanners, mechanical object scanners, micro mirror scanners, etc. In this paper, we consider a scanning system based on non-colocated double parallelogram compliant mechanism. The system is idealized as two springs two masses damper system with end mass as the desired stage. The non-colocated actuation is given only to the intermediate mass and goal is to keep the desired end mass in steady oscillations. Under low damping in the system, traditional open loop sinusoidal excitation given as input results in prolonged (more than 100 s) transient response. Moreover, it would take similar long time to recover from even a small ambient disturbance. We propose here a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller along with an observer to overcome this problem. The proposed controller is evaluated through simulation and experimental verification. Experiments are carried out on a double parallelogram resonant displacement amplifying compliant mechanism designed and developed in-house. Along with being robust, effective in disturbance rejection, the proposed control algorithm also features low computational complexity, making it highly suitable for real-time implementation."

In order to realize the high fidelity conversion from BT.2020 color space to RGB color space of ordinary display screen, this study constructs the conversion loss function and optimizes the conversion mapping to minimize the color loss.

    "abstract": "The Zebra Optimization Algorithm (ZOA) is a new metaheuristic inspired by the behaviour of zebra herds during foraging and defensive behaviour. The bio-inspired method is immensely useful in solving challenging, non-linear combinatorial problems such as the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), or the shortest distance possible that visits a list of cities and returns back home again. Due to its stochastic nature, ZOA is better than traditional exact algorithms, as ZOA can efficiently explore a high-dimensional solution space while optimally balancing exploration and exploitation, making it less likely to be stuck in local optima. Performance comparison was shown in testing ZOA against classic metaheuristics such as the Genetic Algorithm (GA), Simulated Annealing (SA), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The result showed that ZOA produced better solutions, as it provided 33.33, which is the superior path length found compared to the optimum values GA, SA, and PSO found. This supports the strength of ZOA as a distance optimization method and the significance of ZOA as a viable alternative for solving TSP and other complex optimization problems."

The prototype consists of a magnetic levitator capable of supporting up to 700 g and a circular array of 12 electromagnets (to be referred to hereinafter as electromagnetic actuators), which, through an on/off controlled sequence, generates angular motion of a levitated platform. The platform is 304.8 mm in diameter and incorporates a neodymium magnet in the center for levitation and four magnets at its ends, which are sequentially activated by the electromagnetic actuators to induce rotation. An adaptive PID control system executed in an ESP32 WROOM-32 microcontroller was implemented, whose feedback is obtained through a Hall effect sensor (LM393 3144). The characterization of the system was performed by identifying a transfer function based on the inverse curve of the deceleration response, which allowed adjusting the gains of the PID controller to achieve a response with an overshoot of 10% and a settling time of 120 s. Experimental tests at 33, 45, and 78 revolutions per minute (RPM) showed that, although the system operates robustly at low speeds, at higher speeds, longer settling times and response variability are evident. The results obtained confirm the feasibility of the proposed approach and open lines of improvement in control optimization for industrial and academic applications. The main contributions of this work are summarized as the development of a functional prototype of a magnetic levitation and rotation system inspired by turntable platforms, integrating permanent magnets and a 12 electromagnet array to enable contactless angular motion and the implementation of an adaptive PI control system using a Hall effect sensor for closed-loop speed regulation for said system."

    "abstract": "The use of imaging data for automated bone health evaluation is indispensable for the early diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis. This research presents the DEXSIT-V2 dataset that contains DEXA scan images of the Anteroposterior (AP) spine, Left Femur (LF), and Right Femur (RF) and a framework to classify the bone health status (Normal, Osteopenia, and Osteoporosis) into three classes. The proposed pipeline integrates preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection, and graph-based deep learning methods. The images are subjected to Phantom Anchored Intensity Standardization (PAIS) during preprocessing. This method normalizes pixel intensities to a reference phantom, thus minimizing variation between different scans and also improving tissue contrast. Wavelet Scattering Texture Encoding (WSTE) is the feature extraction method used to capture texture patterns that are invariant to translations, and stable against deformations and multiscale. These patterns are the reflections of the bone micro-architecture. To address the issue of high-dimensionality, a hybrid feature selection method that combines Graph Spectral Ranking (GSR) and Mutual Information (MI) is used. GSR represents the feature space as a graph and ranks the features depending on the properties of the Laplacian, while MI determines the degree of dependency between the features and the class labels. The chosen features are subsequently fed to a Graph Neural Network (GNN) classifier that applies message passing and neighborhood aggregation techniques to detect structural interactions at both local and global levels. Various hyperparameters tuning of the model, such as learning rate and hidden units, convolutional layers, dropout, and aggregation strategies has been carried out to reach the optimal performance. The overall accuracy of the presented framework is 95.8% along with very high Precision, Recall and F1-Score which signifies its application in clinical practices and also its prospects as an automatic tool for osteoporosis detection and classification."

    "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology are reshaping next-generation wireless networks. In multi-RIS deployments, however, the received signal is a superposition of numerous single- and double-reflection paths, some arrive from different angles while others overlap at the same angle, which makes channel estimation challenging. Conventional approaches attempt to separate these paths by sequentially turning each RIS on and off, but the required switching overhead grows rapidly with the number of channels and becomes impractical. To overcome this limitation, we propose a two-stage channel estimation method for multi-RIS systems. In the first stage, the received signal is projected onto angle subspaces to separate components from different directions. In the second stage, the remaining components that share the same angle are resolved by exploiting the reflection coefficient design of the RISs. Both stages operate on the same superposed received signal, enabling path separation without exhaustive switching. The method further extends beyond the two-RIS case to an arbitrary number of RISs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme maintains estimation accuracy while reducing switching overhead, thereby providing a practical solution for large-scale multi-RIS deployments in future wireless networks."

    "abstract": "Training deep neural networks (DNNs) is a common task in GPU clusters. However, in practical cluster environments, multiple concurrent DNN training tasks often fail to fully leverage GPU resources, resulting in suboptimal GPU utilization. Furthermore, existing GPU sharing frameworks primarily rely on static scheduling and frequently overlook task deadlines, leading to task delays and inefficient scheduling. To address these issues, we propose a dynamic GPU sharing framework (DynGPU) that intercepts GPU kernel executions to perform resource scheduling in multi-task environments. DynGPU incorporates a dynamic task priority adjustment mechanism that adapts task priorities in real time based on task progress, historical data, and remaining time to deadlines. By guaranteeing resources for high-priority tasks while maximizing resource allocation for low-priority tasks, DynGPU reduces resource contention and improves system throughput, enabling more timely task completions. Experiments show that, compared to dedicated GPU execution, DynGPU can reserve up to 97.5 % of throughput for high-priority tasks. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, DynGPU achieves up to an 8.4 % improvement in task completion time."

    "abstract": "The task processing capabilities of mobile edge computing (MEC) networks can be significantly enhanced through the integration of device-to-device (D2D) technology, rendering them particularly suitable for computation-intensive applications in the Internet of Things (IoT). However, the opportunistic behaviors of computation-intensive users (CUs) will reduce the fairness of resource allocation, which will increase the task offloading delay for others inevitably. To cope with this issue, a three-layer collaborative offloading scheme including edge offloading, D2D offloading, and cloud offloading is proposed to provide abundant computing resources, thus improving the fairness. Built on this scheme, the offloading mode selection, channel selection, offloading side selection, offloading ratio allocation, and computing resource allocation are jointly optimized to minimize the task processing delay while ensuring high fairness. Such an optimization problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). Therefore, an evaluation-based distributed task offloading strategy selection (E-DTOSS) algorithm is designed, where the task offloading problem can be decomposed into three sub-problems. The offloading strategy selection problem, which is NP-hard, is proven to be an exact potential game and its pure-strategy Nash equilibrium point can be obtained by the E-DTOSS algorithm. The offloading ratio allocation problem and computing resources allocation problem are solved by dual ascent method. Simulation results verify that the E-DTOSS algorithm can converge to the Nash equilibrium point while ensuring high fairness. As a result, the task processing delay can be reduced compared with the benchmark schemes."

The yoga asanas are step-by-step image sequences that are loaded onto a Micro SD card and provided through a non-touch TFT screen. As users perform the posture, the system verifies the correctness as a function of sensor data; it does not automatically advance to the next asana unless the user assumes the proper alignment. Feedback is delivered in real-time through LED indicators, an audio buzzer and visual feedback. When the yoga session is complete, a GSM module sends a summary of the session’s performance through SMS.

Traditional predictive models often treat behavioral factors in isolation, overlooking their real-world interactions. This study examines whether transforming behavioral features into interaction terms enhances the accuracy and interpretability of machine learning models for predicting academic performance. Using a simulated dataset of 1,000 students, behavioral data such as study hours, sleep duration, social media use, and mental health status were collected. Eight interaction features were engineered to reflect combined effects. Data preprocessing in R included imputation, normalization, and encoding. Nine classification algorithms were tested in Weka, including probabilistic, linear, neural, instance-based, decision tree, and ensemble methods. The results indicate that interaction terms significantly improved prediction accuracy in instance-based methods, with accuracy increases exceeding 14 percentage points. Ensemble models also improved modestly, while linear and neural models showed minor declines. The engineered features revealed meaningful patterns linking academic performance with digital behavior and mental health. The study concludes that interaction-based feature transformation enhances performance and interpretability, supporting a balanced approach that integrates domain expertise and machine learning to address educational challenges."

The Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm is employed to learn vertical thrust commands directly from interaction with the environment, while proportional-integral-derivative (PID) loops handle horizontal positioning. A custom reward penalizes both residual altitude error—including steady-state error—and excessive thrust changes. In MATLAB/SIMULINK simulations, the RL controller maintains precise descent trajectories, drives steady-state error to near zero, and adapts to both severe and mild gusts without retuning, outperforming a conventional PID in all tested scenarios. These results demonstrate the promise of purely RL-based altitude control for robust UAV operations in challenging wind conditions."

By capturing 36 real-time features–including system calls, network traffic, resource usage, directory access, and installation patterns–DySec detects threats like typosquatting, covert remote access activation, dynamic payload generation, and multiphase attack malware. We developed a comprehensive dataset of 14,271 Python packages, including 7,127 malicious sample traces, by executing them in a controlled isolated environment. Experimental results demonstrate that DySec achieves 96% detection accuracy with an ML inference latency of <0.5s after dynamic feature extraction, reducing false negatives by 78.65% compared to static analysis and 82.24% compared to metadata analysis. During the evaluation, DySec flagged eleven packages that PyPI classified as benign. A manual analysis, including installation behavior inspection, confirmed six of them as malicious. These findings were reported to PyPI maintainers, resulting in the removal of four packages. DySec bridges the gap between reactive traditional methods and proactive, scalable threat mitigation in open-source ecosystems by uniquely detecting malicious install-time behaviors."

    "abstract": "Over the past decades, extensive research has been conducted on adversarial attacks and defense mechanisms in deep learning, particularly in real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, etc. Recent studies have revealed that evolutionary algorithms that solve data-driven optimization problems are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, research endeavors to address adversarial attacks in this context have not yet been initiated. Conducting such attacks is more challenging than those on deep neural networks, primarily due to the absence of defined gradients or loss functions in evolutionary algorithms, which complicates the application of existing attack methods. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel adversarial attack model targeting evolutionary algorithms solving data-driven optimization problems. To model real-world malicious behaviors, this paper proposes an attack algorithm that develops perturbation cutoff and subpopulation filtering strategies, while also supporting a new sparse operator to ensure the attack’s destructiveness and imperceptibility. The effectiveness of our proposed model and algorithm is demonstrated through experimental evaluation on datasets for both single- and multi-objective optimization problems. Through these experiments, three key questions are addressed: Can a small perturbation of the dataset significantly degrade evolutionary algorithm performance? If so, are robust evolutionary algorithms more resistant to attacks than conventional ones? Furthermore, can the perturbation generated by one evolutionary algorithm also degrade the performance of other evolutionary algorithms? This study emphasizes the importance of evolutionary algorithm safety in real-world applications and provides valuable insights into the future development of trustworthy evolutionary algorithms."

Indeed existing ERP systems cannot be looked at in the context of predictive intelligence and, therefore, cannot be relied on to furnish necessary information at the precise time it is needed to make critical decisions in the actual sense. The purposed project will present activities within Agile ERP systems throwing up core functionality linked directly to machine learning (ML) models meant for application to these actual operational challenges. Integrated features of this solution will be purchase, stock, production, quality control, and sales-all under a single platform. Enabling ML models will particularly cause the \"smarter\" functions like demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and automated defect detection to boast efficiency. There will be continuous development as well as quick adjustments to changing requirements through the principle of employing an agile method. Expected Outcome-: Minimizing human errors, stock optimization, enhanced production planning, and considerable improvements in overall efficiency. This combined project brings the structure of ERP together with the intelligence of ML to create a highly relevant smart, scalable future solution, both for success in industry and for resource stewardship in society.Global scenarios in fabric industries and much more essential to the economy are the textile industries' intrinsic failings related to demand unpredictability, rampant inefficiency of resources across the globe and really complex issues around quality management. Traditional ERP systems look for offering great capabilities in the area of managing data, but they do not provide the abilities of predictive intelligence for real-time action-based decision-making. In this project, an Agile-based ERP will be proposed with the integration of models based on Machine Learning (ML) to address these operational deficiencies directly. An integrated solution involving the procurement, inventory, production, quality control, and sales core ERP functions will incorporate an integrated apparatus. The efficiency is augmented by using intelligent capabilities such as demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and automated defect detection that strengthen the overall model with the application of ML in its deliverables. An iterative process coupled with real-time stakeholder involvement will allow quick adaptation to changing industry needs by consistent development and adjustment through the principle of adopting the Agile methodology. Expected Outcome-: Minimize human errors, manage stock better, better production planning, and more significant efficiency gains.

The control objective is to drive the system from an arbitrary initial state to the desired final state while minimizing the square of the control force. The optimal feedforward control for the linearized model is first derived. It is then converted into a feedback form to improve robustness to uncertainties. To simplify computations during the motion, a linearized feedback controller is introduced. To prevent the increase of the control force near the end of the control interval, an infinite-horizon feedback controller is applied. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated through numerical experiments in the presence of dynamic and parametric uncertainties. Quasi-optimal trajectories and bounded control effort are achieved, offering a robust and practical solution for finite-horizon control problems."

    "abstract": "Traditional artificial neural networks often face stability challenges in noisy Internet of Things (IoT) environments, owing to their dependence on static weights and deterministic computational frameworks. Spiking neural networks (SNNs), which mimic the spike-based coding mechanisms of biological neurons, present a promising alternative for edge devices due to their inherent temporal dynamics and energy efficiency. However, most existing Spiking neural network (SNN) models utilize fixed neuronal parameters, restricting their ability to adapt to diverse noise conditions commonly encountered in IoT applications. To address this issue, we propose a fractional-order plasticity approach integrated with spatio-temporal backpropagation algorithm. It enables simultaneous updating of synaptic weights and fractional-order parameters during training, allowing neurons to adjust their intrinsic dynamics. By incorporating fractional-order calculus, neurons can effectively integrate historical input information, enhancing their ability to filter out noise and extract relevant features effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly improves classification performance, achieving accuracies of 99.67% on MNIST, 94.50% on Fashion-MNIST, and 93.43% on CIFAR-10, outperforming existing leading methods on all evaluated static datasets, and reaching a competitive accuracy of 97.25% on the DVS-Gesture dataset. The framework also exhibits superior resistance to noise compared to weight-training-only methods. This adaptive mechanism empowers neurons across different network layers to develop optimal fractional-order configurations, thereby enhancing networks’ temporal information processing ability and overall robustness in noisy environments. The proposed framework considerably advances the state of the art in efficient and robust spiking neural network learning for IoT applications."

The ERP System is becoming one of the most popular IT (Information Technology)solutions, but its implementation requires significant attention in terms of human resources, finances, time, and other resources. While the accurate and successful implementation of ERP is crucial, businesses must still deal with a variety of challenges. According to previous studies, 60 to 70 percent of ERP implementations either stop suddenly or completely fail. Studying the success and frustration elements for effective Erp system implementation, Quality-related issues are not looked into when implementing an ERP system. Given this, the current emphasis is on taking value-related concerns into the ERP usage model for the entire life cycle. Along with usability, simplicity of use, implementation,workability, effectiveness, familiarity, feasibility, and documentation, software reliability is a crucial component of software quality. Because software is typically highly adaptable, it is challenging to ensure software reliability. Because of this, big data simulation approaches are used by software companies. This analytical engine, which includes simulation techniques analytics, simulation techniques execution analytics, simulation techniques planning analytics, service analytics, and marketing analytics, is the mechanism of the intelligent system. Analytical engine is based on the master enterprise data base and enterprise knowledge database.

    "abstract": "The accelerated growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Quantum Computing (QC) has unlocked transformative potential for solving complex challenges in climate-adaptive and energy-efficient agriculture. Traditional deep learning frameworks often struggle to manage the massive heterogeneity, temporal variance, and computational intensity inherent in multi-source agro-climatic data. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces AgriQDL (Quantum-Driven Deep Learning for Agriculture) — an advanced hybrid paradigm that combines the superior pattern recognition of deep neural networks with the parallel computational capabilities of quantum circuits. First Objective focuses on integrating Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) with deep architectures to accelerate learning across high-dimensional satellite, soil, weather, and IoT-sensor datasets. The second objective aims to employ quantum-inspired backpropagation and Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs) for efficient feature learning and synthetic data generation in regions with sparse ground-truth samples. The final objective embeds the AgriQDL framework into a Federated Learning (FL) environment to ensure secure, decentralized model training that preserves community data privacy while supporting collaborative intelligence. The proposed AgriQDL architecture integrates quantum-enhanced convolutional and recurrent layers for spatial–temporal feature extraction, where VQCs perform high-speed state transformations and gradient evaluations. The QGAN module supplements limited datasets by generating high-fidelity synthetic samples, thereby mitigating regional data scarcity and improving model generalization. The FL-enabled deployment ensures that each agricultural community trains its local model while contributing encrypted gradients to a global quantum-assisted model aggregator, achieving scalability and confidentiality simultaneously. Comprehensive evaluations were conducted across multiple agro-climatic zones using diverse datasets encompassing satellite imagery, soil moisture indices, humidity, and crop-yield records. Comparative analysis against conventional deep learning baselines — including CNN, LSTM, and hybrid CNN-BiLSTM models — demonstrates that AgriQDL achieves an average accuracy improvement of 18%, reduces training time by up to 45%, and enhances resilience to climate variability and data imbalance. These outcomes highlight AgriQDL’s capability to perform rapid, resource-efficient agricultural analytics while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. The results establish AgriQDL as a robust foundation for next-generation quantum–AI-driven precision agriculture systems."

Recent techniques to sustain nanoscale performance, such as heterojunction S / D engineering (e.g. SiGe), strain and contact resistance engineering, source pocket / underlap optimization and ferroelectric (negative capacitance) gating, have shown promise in suppressing short-channel effects and boosting drive current; however, they face persistent challenges including variability, process complexity for heterogeneous integration, self-heating in confined channels, increased parasitic capacitances, and RF penalties. To solve these problems, our objective is to quantify the benefits and limitations of asymmetric S/D NWFETs relative to their all-Si counterparts by jointly evaluating subthreshold swing, switching ratio, drive current, transconductance, transconductance efficiency and analog metrics. Due to the SiGe source, the asymmetric S/D NWFET demonstrates improved electrostatic integrity with reduced short-channel effects and leakage current, yielding significant improvements in ON current and subthreshold swing. Enhanced electrostatics also translate to better analogue figures-of-merit. However, performance degrades due to increased gate capacitance, which highlights the design trade-off between DC / analog gains and high-frequency response."

    "abstract": "In the design of Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) control systems, one of the most critical considerations is system stability. This is typically addressed in the controller design process through the incorporation of a stability index, often based on frequency domain analysis, to quantify system robustness after controller implementation. This work focuses on analyzing the design of Decentralized Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers for Two-Input-Two-Output (TITO) processes, which are among the most common multivariable systems. The proposed approach evaluates stability margins using the maximum of the sensitivity function, despite robustness also being measurable through the maximum of the singular values. By utilizing the equivalent sensitivity function for multivariable systems, the method provides a direct means of assessing robustness once decentralized controllers are implemented. The feasibility of this approach is examined for a specific level of robustness and is validated employing two benchmark processes."

The experimental results show that the speed of loneliness transmission is highly correlated with the transmission probability and the increase in the recovery probability can significantly inhibit the spread, but the inhibitory effect decreases after the recovery probability under 0.8. Also, under the condition that the recovery probability is fixed at 0.9, the spread shows a three-stage characteristic."

While existing surveys focus narrowly on specific tasks within palmprint recognition—often grounded in traditional methodologies—there remains a significant gap in comprehensive research exploring DL-based approaches across all facets of palmprint recognition. This article bridges that gap by thoroughly reviewing recent advancements in DL-powered palmprint recognition. This article systematically examines progress across key tasks, including region-of-interest (ROI) segmentation, feature extraction, and security and privacy-oriented challenges. Beyond highlighting these advancements, this article identifies current challenges and uncovers promising opportunities for future research.

The pitch and yaw channel autopilots utilize a two-loop design, incorporating a PI (Proportional-Integral) controller in the inner loop to track the angular rate command and a Schmitt trigger in the outer loop. The Schmitt trigger determines the direction of rotation for rapid attitude changes. A precomputed table generates the maximum normal acceleration, which defines the amplitude of the angular rate command. This combination of the Schmitt trigger and the maximum trim command ensures stability and maximizes maneuverability during the initial pitch-over phase. Although the skid-to-turn approach may result in larger tracking errors compared to bank-to-turn methods, it still achieves the primary objective of a fast time response during the initial pitch-over phase. The effectiveness of the autopilot is validated through non-linear 6-DOF simulations and Monte Carlo simulations that account for aerodynamic uncertainties."

Reliable protection of renewable integrated microgrids remains a major challenge due to the presence of harmonics, switching transients, and noise contamination that compromise conventional fault detection schemes. The work in this paper suggests the integration of zero sequence current (ZSC) detection, differential faulty energy (DFE), variational mode decomposition (VMD), and support vector machine (SVM) classification into a novel network fault current signal protection algorithm. The values of the ZSC and DFE indices offer fault signatures and noise, while VMD efficiently decomposes the signals under noisy conditions to extract robust features. These features are further analysed using an SVM supported supported classifier for fault analysis under diverse conditions. Simulation research is performed on a renewable integrated microgrid model with diverse fault scenarios and noise levels. The outcome indicates that a novel scheme provides excellent detection performance, robustness to noise, and better reliability, accuracy, and classification efficiency than typical approaches. The simulation results of the proposed framework show that the proposed scheme achieves 97.2 % fault classification accuracy, detects ground faults down to 0.7 A zero sequence current, and remains robustness at noise levels as high as 39 dB, providing a 20 % improvement in noise-resilient detection performance compared to conventional approaches."

The study develops and validates a predictive pipeline based on structured electronic health records (EHR) data (e.g. demographics, comorbidities, laboratory trajectories, e.g. eGFR, serum creatinine, albuminuria; and longitudinal clinical events) to predict incident CKD-risk and short-to-medium term progression-risk. The missingness is treated, the class imbalance is handled, and feature selection is processed with accuracy in retaining the presented clinically relevant predictors including hemoglobin, serum creatinine, albumin, and blood pressure by resorting to recursive feature elimination and feature selection that is based on stability . We contrast temporally conscious ensemble algorithms (temporal-enhanced gradient boosting against that on static tree-based ensembles and deep neural networks and use SHAP, LIME to match model explanations with nephrology knowledge. Evaluation of Model performance encompasses discrimination (AUC), calibration (Brier score and calibration plot) and decision based measures (precision, recall and F1), alongside temporal stability over a risk horizon of 1-3 years. In retrospective cohorts of EHRs, temporally enhanced gradient boosting and clinically tuned ensembles provided high discrimination and optimal calibration compared with KDIGO-based risk stratification, and corresponding explain ability analyses consistently suggested eGFR decline, albuminuria, hypertension, and metabolic markers as the significant models . The application of such AI tools in the workflow of EHR may allow prompt nephrology consultation and selective screening and risk-stratified management to limit CKD progression and rationalize resource utilization."

    "abstract": "Key-value (KV) storage is widely used in domains such as big data analytics, AI training, databases, and distributed file systems. Traditional KV systems built on DRAM or disk-based architectures struggle to meet the dual requirements of high throughput and strong data persistence demanded by modern applications. Non-Volatile Memory (NVM), with its combination of high bandwidth and persistence, offers a promising foundation for building high-performance, persistent, and largescale KV stores. Consequently, NVM-based KV storage has gained substantial research and industrial interest in recent years. However, directly porting DRAM-or disk-oriented KV designs to NVM devices often yields suboptimal performance. In Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) architectures, frequent NVM persistence operations and high cross-NUMA access latency significantly limit I/O efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose SaneKV, an NVM-optimized KV store. SaneKV introduces a metadata asynchronous persistence mechanism that reduces I/O latency by aggregating metadata write-back operations, and an adaptive NVM data allocation policy to improve throughput. Experimental results show that for small-sized KV workloads, SaneKV achieves up to 75 % higher write throughput and 40 % higher read throughput than state-of-the-art NVM-based KV stores. For large-sized KV workloads, SaneKV achieves comparable peak throughput while requiring up to 40 % fewer threads to reach saturation and delivers over <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$2 \\times$</tex> higher overall performance than prior NVM-based designs, demonstrating superior scalability and resource utilization."

However, when modal delays become frequency-dependent, higher-order modal dispersion effects, such as mode-dependent chromatic dispersion, must be incorporated into propagation models. This work investigates the statistical properties of first- and second-order group-delay operators under strong coupling conditions using a multi-section random matrix model, accounting for both intrinsic (uncoupled) group delays and mode-dependent chromatic dispersion. We show that the asymptotic distributions of these operators are determined by the number of sections, the delay spreads of the uncoupled delays, and mode-dependent chromatic dispersion. For typical graded-index multimode fibers, the uncoupled group delays have a significantly greater impact than the mode-dependent chromatic dispersion. As a result, the complexity of digital signal processing is ultimately dictated by the statistics of the first-order group-delay operator. Additionally, we derive analytical expressions for the expected intensity pulse response to provide a time-domain perspective on the higher-order effects."

The frequency-dependent heterogeneous material properties of the European honey bee at 300 GHz have been derived from our ongoing research on a real honey bee. A comparative analysis between a simplified homogeneous model and a more realistic heterogeneous honey bee model demonstrates that the homogeneous approximation can lead to either overestimation or underestimation of power absorption, depending on the specific body region analyzed."

While overall impressions of the Android were positive—especially among individuals with lower cognitive function—comprehension of robot-delivered speech was significantly lower in the more impaired group compared to speech delivered by a human (p< 0.05). Notably, some participants mirrored the robot’s facial expressions, such as smiling in response, suggesting emotional resonance.

To address these challenges, we formally define the two core subtasks and propose the HMSTC algorithm and CBNet architecture. HMSTC combines semantic similarity, data type consistency, and the Hungarian algorithm to achieve globally optimal matching. CBNet is a dual-branch neural network that integrates self-attention and cross-feature interactions with cross-attention concentration to generate compact representations for accurate row matching between tables. Experiments are conducted using public datasets and a custom Chinese dataset. Results show that our approaches achieve high matching accuracy and perform well across different datasets, with HMSTC also demonstrating strong runtime efficiency."

To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes an advanced signal classification framework to identify drones base on their unique fingerprint. This is done by using spectrogram images of different drones and Wi-Fi devices operating within the 2.4 GHz spectrum which give unique patterns to identify drones fingerprint. The approach combines the features generated by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with a modulation index to enhance classification accuracy and robustness of different machine learning classifiers. Two tasks are considered in this paper: i) multi-class classification of different drone models and ii) binary classification of drones and Wi-Fi signals. The proposed framework is rigorously tested and challenged using different hyperparameters configurations and ablation studies. The results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach in identifying drones accurately."

    "abstract": "Hit-And-run accidents pose a major challenge to modern traffic law enforcement due to the rapid disappearance of suspect vehicles and the limitations of manual surveillance analysis. This project introduces an automated deep learning system that identifies vehicles involved in hit-and-run incidents using a YOLO-based multi-task framework. The model performs real-time detection, attribute classification, and license plate recognition in a single unified process. To compensate for the lack of publicly available datasets, synthetic surveillance videos are generated through simulation environments, allowing the model to train under varied conditions such as lighting, weather, and traffic density. The system also integrates vehicle tracking and behavioral analysis to identify suspicious trajectories, enabling faster and more reliable identification of offending vehicles. Designed to be lightweight, scalable, and deployable in real-world surveillance networks, this approach enhances urban traffic monitoring, supports forensic analysis, and contributes to safer and smarter cities through AI-driven automation."

The evaluation is based on five key performance metrics: data access speed, shock resistance, energy efficiency, write endurance, and compliance with military standards. Using technical documentation, academic literature, and defense guidelines, the research identifies flash memory and SSDs as the most suitable options for deployment in dynamic and high-risk operational environments.

The purpose of this paper is to give a briefoverview of a range of platforms in the field of computer vision and object recognition. For the most part this paper covers a relatively mature service from AWS(Amazon Web Services), Amazon Rekognition which is easy to integrate into other services like Lambda, providing huge volume of details in its analysis. The paper incorporates different viewpoints that have been utilized by various analysts for object spotting and recognition. Rekognition is able to recognise objects and scenarios within photographs in this article, returning a confidence measure ranging from 0 to 100% for each label returned. It accomplishes this by using AWS’ Python client Boto3 and the detect labels method. This works by supplying an image, a limit on the number of labels to return, and a confidence level for filtering out ambiguous results."

Conventional rule based and neural network based EMS fails with dynamic driving cycles, high cost of computation, and less adaptability. To address these limitations, this work presents a EMS model that integrates a Transformer model with the Artificial Protozoa Optimizer (APO). The Transformer is presented for energy demand pattern prediction by capturing long-range temporal dependencies in driving cycles and the APO is exploited for optimizing control parameters for better power allocation among the fuel cell and battery. This hybrid approach increase adaptability under uncertain traffic conditions, reduces unnecessary fuel cell load fluctuations, and improves battery life. The experimentation on standard driving cycles show that the proposed Transformer-Apo achieved superior fuel economy, improved energy utilization, and reduced error compared with existing methods. The outcomes validated that, this approach provides a robust EMS for FCHEVs and supporting the goals of sustainable and eco-friendly transportation."

However, they can hardly be employed in the same accelerator simultaneously because CIM requires structural compute patterns which are disrupted in sparse NNs. In this paper, we partially solve this issue by proposing a bit level weight reordering strategy which can realize compact mapping of sparse NN weight matrices onto Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) based NN Accelerators (RRAM-Acc). In specific, when weights are mapped to RRAM crossbars in a binary complement manner, we can observe that, which can also be mathematically proven, bit-level sparsity and similarity commonly exist in the crossbars. The bit reordering method treats bit sparsity as a special case of bit similarity, reserve only one column in a pair of columns that have identical bit values, and then map the compressed weight matrices into Operation Units (OU). The performance of our design is evaluated with typical NNs. Simulation results show a 61.24 % average performance improvement and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1.51 \\times-2.52 \\times$</tex> energy savings under different sparsity ratios, with only slight overhead compared to the state-of-the-art design."

In practice, detectors built mainly on handcrafted statistics or end-to-end neural classifiers can be sensitive to feature shifts and may underuse the relational information among traffic records. This work therefore builds a two-stage detector that couples graph representation learning with gradient-boosted decision trees: traffic samples are organized as a similarity graph, node features are updated through graph convolutions, and residual links plus a local attention unit are added to reinforce informative neighborhood signals while reducing noise propagation. The pooled graph representation is finally classified by LightGBM to obtain fast and interpretable decisions. Results on public benchmarks confirm consistent gains over common ML/DL baselines across multiple criteria, supporting the use of the proposed GCN - LightGBM design for robust DDoS detection under evolving traffic conditions."

The Informer module utilizes sparse self-attention to extract ultra-long historical features, addressing gradient vanishing and serial processing bottlenecks in RNNs. The BiGRU module bidirectionally refines abrupt change segments, suppressing phase lag in oil temperature jumps. A zero-masking weighted subnetwork filters out cooling intermittent noise. Results show that the model achieves an MAE of 0.084 and SMAPE of 0.128, comprehensively outperforming baseline methods. In local abrupt change segments, the MAE is 0.431 lower than that of LSTM, experimentally confirming the stronger error suppression and curve tracking capability of the proposed method in large fluctuation scenarios. This approach provides a new perspective for ultra-long sequence oil temperature prediction."

Solvers dedicated to solving such instances translate the input formulae into a conjunction of CNF and XOR clauses and use different techniques such as XOR recovery and manipulation and Gaussian elimination. In this paper, we aim to build a solver able to reason directly on ANF formulae derived from attacks using Weil descent on Semaev polynomials of elliptic curves, while integrating dedicated lazy structures inspired from SAT solvers."

    "abstract": "Federated edge learning (FEEL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients over wireless networks without exposing raw data. While most existing studies assume static datasets, in real-world scenarios, clients may continuously collect data with time-varying and non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) characteristics. A critical challenge is how to adapt models in a timely yet efficient manner to such evolving data. In this paper, we propose FedTeddi, a temporal-drift-and-divergence-aware scheduling algorithm that facilitates fast convergence of FEEL under dynamic data evolution and communication resource limits. We first quantify the temporal dynamics and non-i.i.d. characteristics of data using temporal drift and collective divergence, respectively, and represent them as the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) of class distributions for classification tasks. We then propose a novel optimization objective and develop a joint scheduling and bandwidth allocation algorithm, enabling the FEEL system to learn from new data quickly without forgetting previous knowledge. Experimental results show that our algorithm achieves higher test accuracy and faster convergence compared to benchmark methods, improving the rate of convergence by 58.4% on CIFAR10 and 49.2% on CIFAR-100 compared to random scheduling."

This position paper argues that blockchain technology brings new opportunities for collaboration in AI. We first identify and characterize three key challenges in AI collaboration: secure training data sharing, trusted and incentivized model training, and traceable and accountable model distribution. We then examine how blockchain techniques, including both on-chain and off-chain approaches, can be leveraged to address these challenges. Furthermore, we discuss current practices in this emerging field and introduce open challenges for future research and real-world deployment."

However, current research on driver fatigue mainly focuses on detection methods, and there are relatively few studies specifically investigating the relationship between ambient lighting and driver fatigue. Therefore, this study employed eye-tracking technology to explore the changes in driver fatigue states when performing simulated driving tasks under different combinations of color temperature and light. We objectively analyzed the effects of high and low illuminance, as well as high and low color temperatures, on driving fatigue through eye-tracking data, concluding that different illuminance conditions significantly impact driving fatigue. The findings provide scientific evidence for the optimization of in-vehicle lighting design, hoping to contribute to reducing the probability of traffic accidents."

Meanwhile, in practical applications, the system is often disturbed by non-Gaussian noise, e.g., heavy-tailed impulsive noise. This paper studies the Kalman filtering problem of a class of linear discrete stochastic systems affected by the loss of system measurement quantities and non-Gaussian noise. For the state estimation using the real-time known characteristic of the packet dropping variable, Kalman filter with measurement packet dropping can be successfully derived by designing a coefficient matrix. In this study, a random variable obeying the Bernoulli distribution with a known conditional probability is introduced to describe the randomly occurring phenomenon of the loss of system measurement quantities, and the maximum correntropy Kalman filtering algorithm based on the Cauchy kernel is adopted for state estimation. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm are validated by the simulation results of vehicle tracking."

Existing work on PSDP has primarily focused on minimizing memory consumption, such as by offloading model states to CPU, while not enough attention has been paid to poor communication performance. We observe that the imbalanced distribution of model states across GPUs and inter-layer data dependencies lead to severe underutilization of network bandwidth and poor scalability of the current PSDP system. To address these issues, we present Chimera, a system that enhances the communication efficiency of PSDP in both offloading and non-offloading settings. First, Chimera introduces a fine-grained state-sharding strategy to balance both model state and communication load across GPUs, while leveraging tensor fusion to amortize communication launch overhead. Second, we design a multi-stage, fine-grained communication pipelining mechanism that decouples inter-layer dependencies, thereby improving bandwidth utilization. Finally, we develop a practical auto-tuning tensor fusion algorithm to adaptively optimize fusion decisions for end-to-end training performance. We evaluate Chimera on cloud GPU clusters using representative large language models.

Across representative scenarios, the framework achieves effective occlusion times of 1.392 s (baseline), 4.60 s (optimized single munition), 6.24 s (single UAV with three munitions), and 10.518 s (three UAVs, one munition each), demonstrating efficiency, robustness, and interpretable schedules. The resulting approach provides a generalizable, simulation-ready tool for time-critical countermeasure planning and cross-scenario deployment."

    "abstract": "The security of vision-language pre-trained models (VLMs) has become an increasingly critical concern, particularly due to their vulnerability to adversarial attacks in open environments. Most existing methods focus on image perturbations, ignoring image-text structural relationships and the need for dynamic, semantics-aware attack strategies. To address these limitations, we propose a dynamically adaptive framework for generating multi-behavior adversarial patches. A topological neighborhood graph models cross-modal semantic structures, while a lightweight text classifier detects sensitive or jailbreak instructions to switch attack strategies. A two-stage optimization-semantic stripping and target binding-precisely controls perturbations for target-specific outputs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high attack success rates across a variety of tasks, including image-text retrieval, image classification, and multimodal question answering. Moreover, the approach exhibits strong robustness and adaptability, exposing critical security vulnerabilities in current VLM systems and offering valuable insights for future research on the defense of multimodal models."

    "abstract": "A detailed comparative analysis of sawtooth and triangular carrier pulse-width modulation (PWM) techniques for buck chopper systems is presented in this study. The research addresses the need for empirical performance evaluation in motor control applications by systematically examining critical operational parameters, including speed regulation, torque stability, and current dynamics. MATLAB/Simulink is employed for system modeling and simulation, while real-time validation is conducted using RTLAB to ensure practical applicability. The results demonstrate that both techniques achieve fast dynamic response, with overshoot limited to less than $\\mathbf{1 6} \\boldsymbol{\\%}$ and settling time maintained below 0.2 seconds during speed transitions. However, distinct performance characteristics are observed. Superior steady-state performance is exhibited by the sawtooth carrier method, with current oscillations reduced by approximately 30% and torque ripple lowered by 25% compared to the triangular approach, making it particularly suitable for precision applications. In contrast, marginally faster transient response is provided by the triangular carrier, though higher electromagnetic interference is generated due to more pronounced current fluctuations. These findings offer clear selection criteria for engineers based on application priorities, whether for high-precision systems requiring smooth operation or scenarios where rapid response is prioritized. The study contributes to power electronics optimization by establishing validated performance benchmarks and practical implementation guidelines for buck chopper control strategies."

Instead of relying on separate image enhancement stages, the proposed framework enhances feature robustness and multi-scale consistency directly within the detection pipeline. We introduce a Denoise Downsample Layer (D2L) that adaptively suppresses illumination induced noise while preserving fine structural details and a Global Spatial Attention Fusion (GSAF) module that integrates hierarchical features through global contextual and spatial modeling. These designs jointly improve the discriminability of object features and the stability of detection under complex low-light conditions. Extensive experiments on the VisVehicle dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior detection accuracy with minimal computational cost."

    "abstract": "Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are promising alternatives to fully digital (FD) architectures, enabling hybrid beamforming via low-cost reconfigurable metasurfaces. In DMAs, holographic beamforming is achieved through tunable elements by Lorentzian-constrained holography (LCH), significantly reducing the need for radio-frequency (RF) chains and analog circuitry. However, the Lorentzian constraints and limited RF chains introduce a trade-off between reduced system complexity and beamforming performance, especially in dense network scenarios. This paper addresses resource allocation in multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MISO) networks under the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) constraints, aiming to minimize total transmit power. We propose a holographic beamforming algorithm based on the Generalized Method of Lorentzian-Constrained Holography (GMLCH), which optimizes DMA weights, yielding flexibility for using various LCH techniques to tackle the aforementioned trade-offs. Building upon GMLCH, we further propose a new algorithm i.e., Adaptive Radius Lorentzian Constrained Holography (ARLCH), which achieves optimization of DMA weights with additional degree of freedom in a greater optimization space, and provides lower transmitted power, while improving scalability for higher number of users. Numerical results show that ARLCH reduces power consumption by over 20% compared to benchmarks, with increasing effectiveness as the number of users grows."

In case of waveguide transmission lines, the Gaussian-like beam ejected from the gyrotron is coupled to the waveguide via a set of beam conditioning mirrors. Similarly, at the output of the transmission line, the beam is radiated from the open-ended waveguide via focusing mirrors to the launching antenna. This is possible due to the excellent coupling of the HE<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">11</inf> mode to the Gaussian free-space TEM<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">00</inf> mode.

The VAE extracts meaningful latent features while handling missing data, whereas the GRU captures complex temporal dependencies, improving forecasting accuracy. Compared to traditional models such as LSTM, GRU, and 1D CNN, our hybrid VAE-GRU model demonstrates superior predictive performance. Experimental results, based on real-world hospital data, highlight the model’s effectiveness in reducing prediction errors and improving decision-making in dynamic ED environments. Additionally, we compare the proposed model with ARIMA-ML, emphasizing the tradeoffs between computational efficiency and prediction accuracy.

To reduce high hardware complexity for enabling the use of DBI even in applications with low switching cost, a DBI encoder employing the AOI-AOI approximate majority voter has been proposed. However, AOI-AOI suffers from low accuracy in determining the majority decision.

The stability of the proposed PADRC is theoretically analyzed, and it is demonstrated that the estimation error of the designed extended state observer (ESO) and the regulation error of the proposed PADRC exhibit bounded characteristics. To enhance the convenience and operability in practical engineering applications, the quantitative parameter tuning rules of the proposed PADRC for <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\boldsymbol{K/{{\\left(Ts + 1\\right)}^{n}}}$</tex-math> </inline-formula>-type high-order processes are elaborately derived.

Existing methods mainly focus on label distribution shapes and feature distance relationships, while the directional characteristics in the representation space remain underexplored. In this paper, we propose deep orientational representation learning (ORL), aiming to ensure the trajectory of features sequentially connected by ordinal categories approximates a geodesic. We treat the output layer weights as ordinal prototypes and introduce two constraints, the co-directional constraint and the counter-directional constraint. They operate by constraining the angles between pairs of vectors. The former minimizes the angle between vectors with matching start and end categories, while the latter maximizes the angle between vectors whose start categories are the same but whose end categories are on opposite sides. The two constraints optimize the representation from different ordinal directions. ORL is extended to a multi-prototype setting (MORL) to mitigate misalignment between features and oriented prototypes caused by large intra-class variations. Theoretical analysis links ORL to distribution unimodality and distance orderliness, highlighting its advantages. The effectiveness of ORL (MORL) is demonstrated on various tasks including facial age estimation, historical image dating, and aesthetic quality assessment."

Subsequently, generalized additive models (GAMs) employing thin-plate regression splines and generalized cross-validation are constructed to capture nonlinear and interactive relationships among key factors, yielding significantly improved model fit compared to linear regression. Second, a two-stage strategy is adopted for rational grouping and optimal timing determination: K-Means was first applied for unsupervised grouping of key features (cluster number determined via the elbow method). Within the candidate time window, a risk-weighted decision criterion was constructed to compare expected risks across different time points and examine the impact of detection errors on timing stability. Subsequently, random forests were introduced to quantify multi-factor importance, combined with hierarchical clustering to refine groupings, thereby enhancing the interpretability and consistency of timing decisions. Experiments validate the framework's effectiveness using fit and classification metrics (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>, AUC, ROC curves, confusion matrices) under unified data partitioning and evaluation protocols, while identifying primary influencing features.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a real-time quality assessment system for arterial photoplethysmography (PPG) waveforms using a hardware-efficient 1D convolutional neural network (CNN). Carotid PPG signals are highly sensitive to sensor placement, often leading to morphological distortions and degraded signal quality. To address this issue, a depthwise separable 1D CNN was designed and implemented on an FPGA to classify signal quality in real time. The model architecture was optimized through grid search, and fixedpoint quantization was applied to minimize memory usage. Additionally, sequential accumulation techniques were employed to reduce computational overhead. The analog frontend was constructed using commercial components, while the digital inference machine was implemented in Verilog HDL on an FPGA (Artix-7, Xilinx). Experimental results show an inference accuracy of 94.8% and an $F 1$-score of 94.6%, with 50.3% DSP utilization. Real-time tests confirm the system’s ability to adaptively assess signal quality in response to sensor positioning. The proposed system offers a compact and intelligent solution for reliable PPG acquisition and supports future applications such as carotid arterial compliance estimation."

    "abstract": "This paper presents an innovative automated animal deterrent system designed to mitigate the multifaceted challenges posed by wildlife intrusion in agricultural and protected areas. Animal intrusion extends beyond mere crop damage, encompassing critical issues such as food safety risks from fecal contamination, predation on livestock, and the potential for disease transmission between wildlife, domestic animals, and humans. Traditional deterrent methods often prove inadequate due to animal habituation and can pose environmental hazards. The proposed system employs a sophisticated multi-sensor architecture, integrating radar for initial wide-area motion detection and thermal imaging for precise animal verification. A Raspberry Pi serves as the central processing unit, leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) for real-time data analysis and orchestrating adaptive, targeted deterrence responses using acoustic and visual stimuli. Designed for energy independence through solar power and battery storage, the system is suitable for remote deployments. This report details the system's architecture, operational flow, and addresses key technical considerations, including strategies to overcome animal habituation and minimize false positives, thereby promoting effective human-wildlife coexistence through non-lethal means."

This is specifically true for high power (>100W) compact and energy efficient (> 10%) sources of THz radiation.

To address the challenges of multi-class disease diagnosis, this paper proposes AETNet, a novel lightweight and efficient hybrid architecture, evaluated on the ODIR-5K dataset. The model utilizes EfficientNet-B0 as its backbone, integrating an Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module to derive features across multiple scales. The Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) module for channel-wise feature refinement. Its core design enhances the features from EfficientNet-B0 using the ASPP and ECA modules, then transforms them into sequential input for a lightweight TinyTransformer encoder. This process achieves a deep interaction between local textures and global context. For the eight-class classification task on the ODIR-5K dataset, AETNet achieved performance metrics of $97.71 \\%$ for accuracy, $94.97 \\%$ for sensitivity, $96.48 \\%$ for specificity, and an AUC of $88.93 \\%$.The proposed model significantly outperforms several baseline CNN models, demonstrating the effectiveness and advanced performance of this hybrid architecture for complex, multi-class classification of ophthalmic images."

    "abstract": "Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) serves as the gold standard for preventing births of fetuses with chromosomal abnormalities. The precision of the testing window directly impacts diagnostic accuracy—adopting a fixed testing window that disregards individual variations in maternal BMI and age may lead to missed diagnoses, resulting in births of fetuses with chromosomal abnormalities and imposing significant physiological, psychological, and financial burdens on families. To address this issue, this study proposes the KMEP-KAP-MCS algorithm (where KMEP denotes the optimized K-means clustering algorithm, KAP employs linear Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and MCS refers to Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis). This algorithm constructs a three-tiered ensemble framework of ‘grouping-Optimisation-validation’ to achieve precise and personalized timing of testing. By weighting the K-Means algorithm with probability distributions and integrating core features—BMI (weight 0.6), age (weight 0.4), and WHO weight classification standards—pregnant women are stratified into four categories, achieving high-quality stratification. For each group, a ‘gestational week versus cumulative pass rate’ model is established to determine optimal individualized testing timepoints across different BMI cohorts, achieving 100% event detection rates across all groups. Under dataset constraints, the three-group classification model underwent validation through 5,000 Monte Carlo simulations. Results confirmed the algorithm's robustness, providing reliable technical support for personalized non-invasive prenatal testing tailored to maternal weight and age."

To address these issues, we present a novel diffusion-based framework that integrates contrastive learning and frequency-aware modeling to effectively restore old photographs. Specifically, we design a category-guided contrastive encoder to align the latent distributions of synthetic and real old photos, effectively bridging the domain gap. Based on this aligned latent space, a diffusion model is employed to iteratively generate high-quality restorations with strong semantic and structural consistency. Additionally, we introduce a Discrete Cosine Histogram Attention (DCH) block to jointly capture structured (e.g., holes, scratches, blotches) and unstructured (e.g., noise, blur, fading, low resolution) degradations in the frequency domain. Without relying on real paired data, our method generalizes well to real-world old photos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both synthetic and real-world scenarios.

    "abstract": "Many applications rely heavily on configuration tuning to improve throughput and reduce latency. The existing state-of-the-art methods still have some limitations. First, application-centric tuning makes it difficult to generalize to dynamic or mixed application scenarios. Second, they exhibit limited efficacy in high-dimensional parameter space exploration and are susceptible to local optima entrapment. To overcome these issues, this paper introduces BTune, a novel bottleneck-centric configuration parameters tuning method. By dynamically identifying bottlenecks and adjusting relevant parameters, it avoids the inefficiency of blindly tuning all parameters. In addition, inspired by mixture of expert, we present a modular neural architecture that decomposes tuning tasks into specialized subspaces. Each expert module focuses on a subset of parameters relevant to a specific resource bottleneck, while a gating mechanism dynamically routes tuning decisions based on observed system state. Experimental results show that, compared with OPPerTune, BTune not only demonstrates accelerated discovery of near-optimal parameter configurations in singleapplication scenarios, but also achieves much higher optimization efficacy in mixed-application scenarios."

Using the model, we evaluate how the electron travel time through the collector influences the maximum oscillation frequency of state-of-the-art RTDs. The analysis shows that the impact of the traveling electrons is more pronounced in RTDs with high current density, and that a shorter collector spacer is advantageous for high-frequency RTD oscillators. However, if electrons travel ballistically through the spacer, their effect is nearly negligible."

To this end, we have recently introduced broadband all-dielectric guided-wave quasi-optical directional couplers that are enabled by elementary ray tracing principles. However, the splitting ratio becomes increasingly uneven at lower frequencies. Here, we explore a viable external-loading approach in order to divide power more evenly across the directional coupler’s operational bandwidth."

    "abstract": "Addressing the systemic bottlenecks in traditional multi-source time-series data processing—namely \"monolithic cleaning modes, insufficient model collaboration, and missing decision-making loops\"—this study proposes TS-CleanNet, an integrated solution that fuses K-Means clustering with ARIMA/LSTM time-series models. This achieves end-to-end performance enhancement from data preprocessing to decision optimization. TS-CleanNet constructs a three-tier collaborative architecture: First, a hierarchical data preprocessing module repairs data gaps via linear interpolation, reduces noise through moving average smoothing, and detects anomalies using multi-strategy anomaly detection. Combined with k-nearest neighbor interpolation, it standardizes irregular data into hourly-level sequences, solidifying the data foundation. Second, a multi-model collaborative analysis module employs least squares regression models optimized by gradient descent to correct measurement biases. K-Means uncovers multidimensional data correlations, while ARIMA/LSTM hybrid models deliver precise trend forecasting and early warnings. Simultaneously, differential calculations quantify dynamic change indicators. Third, the closed-loop decision optimization module integrates dynamic computation, loss assessment, and multi-objective optimization algorithms to determine optimal processing cycles. This forms a complete \"preprocessing-analysis-decision\" technical chain, minimizing overall processing costs. This research overcomes the fragmented limitations of traditional methods, establishing a systematic new paradigm for multisource time-series data processing. It provides critical technological support for efficient data management and scientific decision-making across multiple domains."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a method for optimizing power allocation within a fleet of Electric Vehicles (EVs), addressing the challenge of achieving cost-effective fleet charging. The proposed Quadratic Programming (QP)–based power splitting approach can handle bidirectional charging (V2G). The QP formulation prioritizes EVs according to their required charging power, defined as the ratio between remaining energy demand and available charging time, while also enforcing power capability constraints at both the system and vehicle levels. As a case study, the method is applied to a fleet of electric city distribution trucks. The fleet is assumed to generate revenues from two Nordic electricity markets: the Day-Ahead (DA) energy market and the Frequency Containment Reserve (FCR) balancing market, where compensation is proportional to the power capacity offered. Revenues from DA and FCR are assessed in parallel. The results indicate that bidirectional charging offers significant economic potential compared to unidirectional charging."

    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation systems aim to predict users' future interests based on their historical interactions and are widely applied in domains such as e-commerce and social media. However, in real-world scenarios, recommendation data often exhibits a long-tail distribution, resulting in extremely sparse interactions for a large number of users. Traditional methods face significant challenges in modeling such user preferences, thereby compromising recommendation performance and personalization. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in sparse scenarios due to their powerful language understanding and generation capabilities, offering new opportunities for user interest modeling. Nevertheless, existing approaches often rely on a single prompt or focus solely on item-side semantic information, neglecting users' multi-interest structures and collaborative behavior signals, which limits the reasoning potential of LLMs. To address these issues, this paper proposes the PERec (Prompt-enhanced Semantic Modeling with Large Language Models for Long-tail Recommendation) framework, aiming to enhance semantic modeling and recommendation performance for long-tail users. PERec builds a prompt-driven multi-interest semantic enhancement structure. Specifically, it first generates multiple personalized prompts from users' behavioral histories to guide LLMs in learning diverse preference-aware semantic representations. It then constructs semantic and collaborative dual-view representations and employs a contrastive alignment mechanism to enhance inter-view consistency. Finally, a view fusion strategy is used to generate robust user representations, thereby improving recommendation performance in sparse longtail scenarios. We conduct empirical studies on three real-world datasets-Amazon Beauty, Amazon Clothing, and Yelp. The results demonstrate that PERec significantly outperforms representative baseline methods in both overall recommendation performance and long-tail user accuracy, verifying its effectiveness and practical value in sparse recommendation settings."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit considerable potential in mathematical reasoning, yet they encounter persistent challenges in solving complex problems requiring precise logical structures, including limited generalization and error propagation. Although recent approaches have enhanced problem decomposition and structural guidance, they lack fine-grained control over reasoning dynamics and optimal path selection. In response to these constraints, we introduce a novel framework named Step-Level Evolutionary Reasoning (SER), which leverages genetic algorithms to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models. SER enhances step-level reasoning by representing fine-grained reasoning steps as genes in an evolvable population, enabling genetic operations (e.g., mutation and crossover) to optimize reasoning paths. Experiments demonstrate that SER significantly improves performance across multiple mathematical benchmarks. On GSM8K, SER@4 boosts the zero-shot accuracy of LLaMA3-8B-Instruct from 79.1% to 97.0%. For Olympiad-level problems (e.g., OlympiadBench), SER achieves 54.0% accuracy, outperforming strong baselines by 22.8%."

Current implementations that rely on Ion-Selective Electrodes (ISEs) for nutrient monitoring face high costs and maintenance, limiting adoption in non-commercial and smallscale setups. This paper reviews these limitations and proposes an alternative: automated colorimetric testing using low-cost sensors or cameras with commercially available freshwater test kits. The approach provides affordable nutrient estimation with acceptable accuracy, though resolution is lower, results are slower than ISEs, and reagents must be periodically replenished. The reduction in cost and maintenance justify this trade-off for general monitoring in compact systems. Implementation considerations, including sensor configuration, lighting, and reagent dispensing, are discussed. The proposed method advances accessible smart aquaponics and supports broader adoption and food security."

X-KAREN-D incorporates user demographic information to mitigate the cold start problem, improving personalization and recommendation accuracy. Additionally, it enhances explainability by leveraging a knowledge graph (KG) structure to provide path-based explanations, allowing users to understand the rationale behind recommendations. Through extensive experiments, we evaluate various Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) techniques to assess their impact on recommendation accuracy. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline, achieving an MAE of 0.030 and an RMSE of 0.041. These findings highlight the significance of incorporating structured knowledge and user demographic data to improve both the performance and interpretability of recommender systems."

    "abstract": "Generating pixel-level annotations for the semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote sensing images is labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, numerous studies attempt to generate pixel-level annotations through automatic or semi-automatic labeling strategies. However, due to the inherent complexity of remote sensing imagery and the presence of unseen classes, achieving both accurate foreground segmentation and precise class labeling remains highly challenging. In this paper, we propose an Unsupervised Multimodal Guided Segmentation (UniMGS) framework that generates pseudo-labels for remote sensing images without requiring any ground-truth annotations or additional prompts. Specifically, We propose a Mask Purification Module (MPM) that refines class-agnostic segmentation masks by applying an area filter and a ring-merging strategy to remove noisy masks and merge over-segmented regions. To assign precise categories to class-agnostic segmentation masks, we propose a Text-Driven Classifier (TDC) module. This module constructs an intra-class maximum spanning tree from a similarity matrix and incorporates cluster size constraints together with a confidence scoring mechanism, ultimately achieving precise class labeling. Experimental results on multiple remote sensing datasets demonstrate that UniMGS outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our source code is available at https://github.com/nanwang0511/UniMGS."

Specific techniques such as Change Point Detection (CPD), particularly algorithms like ChangeFinder, have been successfully applied to segment time series and improve anomaly detection by reducing temporal uncertainty, especially in multivariate environments.In this work, we explored how the integration of segmentation techniques, combined with a heterogeneous ensemble, can enhance anomaly detection in an industrial production context. The results show that applying segmentation as a pre-processing step before selecting heterogeneous ensemble algorithms provided a significant advantage in our case study, improving the AUC-ROC metric from 0.8599 (achieved with a PCA and LSTM ensemble) to 0.9760 (achieved with Random Forest and XGBoost). This improvement is imputable to the ability of segmentation to reduce temporal ambiguity and facilitate the learning process of supervised algorithms.In our future work, we intend to assess the benefit of introducing weighted features derived from the study of change points, combined with segmentation and the use of heterogeneous ensembles, to further optimize model performance in early anomaly detection."

This level of performance is crucial for enabling THz applications like high-speed wireless communications and molecular rotational spectroscopy. However, continuous-wave (CW) photomixed sources generate diminishing power above 300 GHz, which limits their practical utility: dropping from ~100 μW to ~10 nW at 1 THz. Resonant tunneling diodes (RTDs) offer a compact and energy-efficient alternative to photomixed THz sources, spanning the same frequency range. RTDs can generate milliwatts of THz power but are limited in application by a broad linewidth (poor spectral purity), limiting their use in applications requiring high coherence. A hybrid THz source combining the purity of photomixing and the power of RTDs can be realized via injection locking. Here we demonstrate injection locking of a waveguide-coupled RTD to a photomixed source. We characterize the residual phase noise of the injection locking process, the bandwidth limitations of injection locking, and show small-signal amplification of 40 dB. These measurements show a combined photomixed oscillator and waveguide injection-locked RTD amplifier at 260 GHz with state-of-the-art spectral purity. We anticipate these methods will be effective up to 1 THz."

    "abstract": "The multi-agent pathfinding problem seeks to generate low-cost paths for agents to reach their targets, playing a crucial role in advancing the development of smart warehousing. Traditional methods do not utilize neural networks, resulting in high computational costs and poor scalability. In contrast, learning-based approaches leverage reinforcement learning to handle large-scale scenarios more effectively. However, they often depend heavily on expert demonstrations, and their plain reward structures can lead to suboptimal path planning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework: Hierarchical Decision-making Pathfinding Based on Social Value Orientation (HIPS). Specifically, HIPS adopts a hierarchical decision-making structure in which the lower-level interaction policy generates actions to interact with the environment, guided by egoistic rewards to promote low-cost path planning. Moreover, the upper-level policy is environmentoriented, learning dynamic social value orientations that enable agents to plan paths while accounting for interactions with other agents, thereby achieving an adaptive balance between individual self-interest and long-term team benefits. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates that HIPS increases the number of finished targets by at least 6% compared to existing methods without relying on expert experience."

    "abstract": "Ultrasound (US)-guided needle-based interventions have been extensively employed in clinical practice for biopsies, regional anesthesia, and tumor ablation, considering the advantages of real-time imaging, portability, and non-ionizing radiation. Precise localization and tracking of the needle tip are critical for ensuring the successful needle placement while minimizing the risk of injury to surrounding anatomical structures. However, achieving real-time and reliable needle tip tracking remains challenging due to the inherent properties of US images, such as low spatial resolution, speckle noise, and imaging artifacts that obscure the needle tip. This study proposes a hybrid learning-based framework for accurately and robustly localizing the needle tip within the US image plane during robot-assisted interventional procedures. The framework comprises a dual-branch template matching-based detection module, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based detection module, and a “dynamic template selection and updating\" mechanism to enhance overall tracking performance. Additionally, to recover the needle tip invisibility caused by unanticipated movements, an active exploration strategy based on a Gaussian Process (GP) model and Bayesian Optimization (BO) is proposed for efficient and accurate robotic US probe pose adjustment. The effectiveness of the proposed method for needle tip tracking performance has been evaluated through a series of experiments conducted on ex vivo porcine liver samples under varying insertion angles and velocities. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a maximum median localization error of 1.17 mm and an Interquartile Range (IQR) of 1.28 mm across all test conditions. Furthermore, in scenarios requiring needle tip visibility recovery, the proposed BO-based strategy achieved a median localization error of 1.52 mm and an IQR of 0.95 mm."

Existing methods relying on indirect indicators achieve suboptimal recall rates, leading to unacceptable false negative risks in clinical practice. Recent advances in computer technology, such as ensemble learning and adaptive optimization, offer new avenues for analysis, but existing methods have not yet effectively integrated these techniques to overcome the specific challenges of female fetus NIPT. To address this gap, we propose DSE-TV, a Dynamic Strategy Ensemble framework that capitalizes on these advances by integrating heterogeneous machine learning algorithms through computational optimization, addressing these challenges through a two-stage optimization approach: recall-weighted hyperparameter tuning for heterogeneous base learners, followed by adaptive fold-specific ensemble strategy selection using clinically-driven composite scoring. Our framework exploits female-specific biological features including X-chromosome patterns and multi-chromosomal correlations through systematic feature engineering. Evaluated on 597 female fetus samples with 7.71 percent anomaly prevalence via 5 fold cross-validation, DSE-TV achieves 0.589 recall, representing a 12.3 percent improvement over the best individual baseline (0.524), while maintaining competitive precision and the highest F1-score (0.378). This translates to detecting approximately 6 additional anomalies per 100 cases, significantly enhancing prenatal screening effectiveness for female fetuses where missed diagnoses carry severe clinical consequences."

    "abstract": "The three-dimensional arbitrary anisotropic inversion algorithm for direct current (DC) resistivity method is developed based on unstructured meshes and L-BFGS optimization, enabling the simultaneous recovery of all independent anisotropic parameters. To enhance robustness and decrease inversion non-uniqueness, distinct meshes are employed for forward modeling and inversion. A novel mesh-assignment strategy is introduced, where inversion meshes for individual anisotropy parameters are aligned specifically with the directional resolution inherently provided by the surficial data. This approach eliminates the conventional requirement for symmetric surficial configurations in three-dimensional DC resistivity anisotropic inversion based on unstructured meshes. Furthermore, to stabilize inversion updates, a volume-weighted method is implemented to compute the objective function gradient on the coarse inversion mesh by aggregating contributions from the finer mesh. This prevents the gradient of one particular parameter from dominating the optimization process due to unbalanced accumulation, a common issue in traditional direct summation strategy, resulting in a more reasonable update of anisotropy parameters and ensuring the reliable recovery of principal resistivities and orientation angles. Five anisotropic inversions with distinct mesh strategies were performed for each model. Comparative analysis based on synthetic data confirms the effectiveness of the proposed approach in improving anisotropic inversion accuracy and resolution, especially in distinguishing between principal resistivities and angle. These results validate both the practicality and reliability of the proposed approach."

The idea is to make one system that helps both in learning and real protection. The first part of the system uses Power BI to study a cybercrime dataset which contains global information on attacks from different years and sectors. This part help to see patterns, like which countries faced more phishing and which sectors are most affected. The second part is a python based tool named MailGuard that allows a person to check if an email if an email or domain is safe or not by using WHOIS lookup, DNS record check, SPF and DMARC verification, and pattern matching through regular expression. Both parts are made to work together so that one side shows the large picture of global cybercrime and other side checks individual domains in real time. The experiment results show that this mixed setup is easy to use, and gives correct results. It also helps people understanding phishing and improves awareness of cyber threats."

    "abstract": "THE out-of-plane librational band is the most prominent feature in the intermolecular vibrational spectrum of bulk water, and has vital consequences for hydrogen bond dynamics. Excitation of this vibration, which occurs in the 500-800 cm 1 region, has been shown to comprise motions that break and reform hydrogen bonds, and the hydrogen bond breaking process has been shown to be highly local, and largely unaffected by hydrogen bond order. Thus, water clusters present a convenient route for examining details of these hydrogen bond dynamics. Additionally, analysis of the many-body expansion of the water-water interaction potential has shown that the most significant terms are the 2 and 3 body terms, which comprise ∼99% of the interaction energy. Towards the development of improved water models, terahertz vibration-rotation-tunneling (VRT) experiments on water clusters have been shown to accurately probe the short-range interactions. The key distinctions between water clusters and the bulk are the free hydrogens of the clusters. These hydrogens are predicted to have little effect on the librational motions, as evidenced by low-resolution spectroscopy studies of small clusters (n = 10-100). Here we report the high-resolution terahertz VRT spectra of a librational vibration near 15 THz for the water dimer, trimer, pentamer, and hexamer, measured with a far-IR lead-salt diode laser spectrometer employing supersonic beam production of water clusters."

    "abstract": "A novel approximate computing approach has been developed to achieve energy efficient Multiply Accumulate (MAC) operations for error tolerant applications. The proposed architecture employs an interleaved structure of approximate compressors to counterbalance positive and negative errors during accumulation, thereby minimizing cumulative error propagation. In the least significant bit (LSB) region, custom-designed approximate 4:2 compressors are utilized to generate complementary error patterns that maintain balanced accuracy while reducing hardware complexity. To further enhance power efficiency, 5:2 and 7:2 compressors are incorporated in the partial product reduction stage, effectively reducing the number of logic level and overall switching activity. A statistical error modeling technique is applied to optimize the placement of positive and negative compressors, ensuring consistent computational accuracy across all MAC operations. As a result, the proposed design archives over 35% reduction in processor level power consumption compared to existing multiplier architectures. Simulation and synthesis results confirm that the architecture maintains high computational stability and accuracy, making it suitable for applications such as image processing, neural network computation, and digital signal processing. Overall, the proposed interleaved compressor-based MAC unit provides an effective, scalable, and low-power solution for next-generation approximate computing systems, offering an excellent balance energy efficiency and computational precision."

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), for its high soft – tissue contrast, is widely preferred as the optimal imaging technique for brain disorder assessment. Manual assessment is time consuming and often suffers from variability between observers. In this study, we present a Deep Learning framework based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) for automated detection of stroke and TBI using MRI images. By utilizing self-attention mechanisms, the ViT model effectively captures both local and global dependencies across MRI slices, allowing better detection of subtle pathological features often overlooked by traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model was trained on BraTS2020 and Figshare dataset that includes healthy, stroke, and TBI cases. The dataset for our experiment is selected demonstrated that the proposed ViT model achieved an accuracy of 96.4%, sensitivity 0f 95.8%, specificity of 97.2%, and F1 score of 96.0%, which are comparatively high with CNN models. These results demonstrates that transformer based DL methods hold high potential for Computer-Aided Diagnostic (CAD) systems, offering clinicians with an efficient and effective tool for early detection and developed treatment planning in critical brain disorders"

Existing commercial or open-source electrophysiology tools do not offer the broad flexibility desired to enable rapid testing of custom stimulation paradigms and closed-loop algorithms, slowing the path from bench-top insight to patient-ready silicon. To address this we present a flexible platform that integrates four interoperable modes: (1) Experimental validation - for neuroscientists to explore new stimulation protocols and test their efficacy; (2) Software development-to enable realtime closed-loop algorithm testing; (3) Hardware development for translation of proven software code into FPGA-accelerated, power-efficient hardware; (4) ASIC validation - for post-silicon performance testing before deployment in chronic studies. This modular architecture enables parallel, cross-functional collaboration, reduces design spins, and lowers entry barriers for labs lacking end-to-end neuromodulation infrastructure. Preliminary in-vitro results from human brain tissue using microelectrode arrays demonstrate reliable operation, validating the system. By streamlining the transition from neuroscience insight to implant-grade ASIC, our system accelerates therapeutic device development and opens new avenues for fundamental investigations of brain function."

We focus on 2D range images (RIs) as a lightweight format for representing 3D LiDAR observations. Although conventional image compression techniques can be adapted to improve compression efficiency for RIs, their practical performance is expected to be limited due to differences in bit precision and the distinct pixel value distribution characteristics between natural images and RIs. We propose a novel implicit neural representation (INR)–based RI compression method that effectively handles floating-point valued pixels. The proposed method divides RIs into depth and mask images and compresses them using patch-wise and pixel-wise INR architectures with model pruning and quantization, respectively. Experiments on the KITTI dataset show that the proposed method outperforms existing image, point cloud, RI, and INR-based compression methods in terms of 3D reconstruction and detection quality at low bitrates and decoding latency."

    "abstract": "The relationship between climate change and migration has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly regarding its impact on vulnerable regions. This study proposes a novel modeling approach to climate-induced migration by systematically comparing traditional statistical models and machine learning techniques. While most existing research in this field relies on linear models or case-specific analyses, our work explicitly models complex non-linear and multidimensional relationships among environmental and socio-economic drivers of migration. By comparing autoregressive, polynomial, and logarithmic models with a Random Forest model, we demonstrate the added value of machine learning in capturing complex patterns that conventional models often fail to detect. Furthermore, we analyze how variables such as temperature anomalies, the Human Development Index (HDI), water stress, and the agricultural sector’s contribution to the Gross Domestic Product influence migration. This framework is applied to data-scarce and climate-sensitive regions, namely North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia, where robust modeling remains both challenging and urgently needed. Model performance was systematically evaluated through multiple metrics, including correlation, Mean Error (ME), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and their normalized forms (NME and NMAE). Results show that while simpler models exhibit limited explanatory power, the Random Forest model substantially improves predictive accuracy, achieving correlation = 0.81, MAE = 0.95, NME = –0.009, and NMAE = 0.25. These findings demonstrate the model’s effectiveness in capturing migration dynamics, and also provides a replicable methodology that can support targeted adaptation strategies, effective migration management, and climate policies, particularly relevant for data-scarce regions of the Global South."

We identify delocalized plasmon (DLP) and localized plasmon (LP) modes, which arise under weak and strong modulation of the 2D electron gas (2DEG) concentration profile, respectively. Both modes are electrically controllable by gate voltage applied to the grating electrode.In the nonlinear regime, we observe a strong optically selfinduced modulation of THz transmission, with a maximum relative transmission change of 45% at a pump fluence as low as 350 nJ/cm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>, occurring under resonant excitation of the LP mode. This modulation exhibits an ultrafast relaxation time of ~15 ps. Our experimental results are supported by electrodynamic modeling, which takes into account the near-field localization under the grating electrodes, 2DEG heating, and the temperaturedependent effective electron mass. These findings provide insight into the fundamental nonlinear dynamics of plasmonic crystals and their potential for ultrafast THz modulation applications."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses a decision-optimization problem for maximizing missile-target obscuration using UAV-deployed smoke screens in a simulation-based air-defense setting. A computational framework is proposed that couples a geometric visibility model (point-to-segment distance on missile–target sightlines with time discretization and cloud sinking dynamics) with trajectory–timing decision variables for single and multi-UAV deployment. The method integrates a hybrid search (particle swarm global exploration followed by Bayesian optimization refinement) for single-UAV scheduling and a discrete candidate–based integer linear program with constraint compression and set-cover structure for tri-UAV coordination. The objective function is evaluated via vectorized distance computations and adaptive time stepping; the perevaluation complexity is O(NI) for N time steps and I target samples, while the tri-UAV ILP is built on a reduced constraint family to curb combinatorial growth, yielding practical solve times with Top-K candidates per UAV. Experiments demonstrate extended full-occlusion duration over baselines while maintaining low runtime and memory footprint, underscoring robustness and deployability. The study contributes an efficient, scalable computational pipeline for smoke-screen path planning and timing under strict full-occlusion criteria."

Conventional $\\sigma$-LFSRs, though efficient for hardware implementation, exhibit limited linear complexity, making them susceptible to cryptanalytic attacks. The proposed approach extends traditional LFSR-based de Bruijn sequence generation to a vectorized multi-input multi-output (MIMO) framework capable of exploiting the parallelism of modern processors. By inserting an all-zero vector into the state cycle of a primitive $\\sigma$-LFSR and applying nonlinear bijective S-box transformations, the resulting vectorized de Bruijn sequence generators (DBSGs) achieve significantly higher linear complexities. Simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, demonstrating that the component sequences are no longer cyclic shifts of one another, thereby increasing the overall linear complexity. The method offers a simple yet efficient architecture for generating high-complexity pseudorandom sequences suitable for cryptographic and communication applications."

    "abstract": "To address the decision redundancy and poor adaptability of traditional algorithms for edge computing task offloading, this paper proposes a dynamic priority-layered deep deterministic policy gradient (DP-HDDPG) algorithm and constructs a \"perception-decision-execution-feedback\" adaptive task offloading model. This algorithm quantifies the matching degree between tasks and nodes through a dynamic priority evaluation system. It combines a two-level decision-making mechanism of \"task layering-node matching\" to reduce the decision space and optimize experience replay to improve training efficiency. A simulation platform built with NS-3 and TensorFlow is used to compare the performance with DDPG, Q-Learning, and a greedy algorithm based on 200 sets of multimodal experimental data (5-15 edge nodes, 10-50 task rates/second). Results show that under a high load of 50 tasks per second, the average latency of DP-HDDPG tasks was 82ms, a 23.1%, 36.0%, and 41.5% reduction compared to DDPG (106.6ms), Q-Learning (128.3ms), and the greedy algorithm (139.8ms), respectively. The system's total energy consumption was 12.3J (a 40.6% reduction compared to the greedy algorithm), and the task completion rate was 98.2% (3.1 percentage points higher than Q-Learning). During a two-hour stability experiment, latency fluctuation was only 7.7%, and the load balancing degree remained stable at 0.22-0.28, validating the algorithm's efficiency and stability."

Conventional Transformer models struggle to capture the local temporal relationships and essential time-step information present in vibration signals. This research introduces the PEC-GAT Transformer model for predicting the remaining useful life of bearings, which combines multi-scale positional encoding convolutions with a gated attention mechanism to tackle these issues. Multi-scale 1D convolutions capture local temporal data across diverse ranges, while trainable position embeddings and global scaling factors provide adaptive position encoding. A dual-gate attention mechanism amalgamates fundamental traits with overarching contextual information, dynamically modifying attention weights. Experiments demonstrate that the PEC-GAT method significantly improves the accuracy of predicting the remaining useful life of bearings and effectively overcomes the limitations of conventional Transformer models. This methodology offers a comprehensive and efficient intelligent prediction system for the control of industrial equipment health."

However, there are significant mismatches between system-level predictions and gate-level simulations, resulting in low precision when predicting performance during the DSE process for asynchronous neuromorphic hardware. To address this issue, we put forward ANGraph, a graph neural network (GNN)-based performance prediction framework for asynchronous neuromorphic hardware. In the ANGraph framework, we transform the intermediate representation of systemlevel simulations into graphs, collect gate-level circuit simulation results to build benchmarks with over one million samples, and train a GNN model to predict hardware latency for asynchronous neuromorphic hardware. Additionally, we use a residual network (ResNet)-based method to predict the power consumption of asynchronous neuromorphic hardware. We evaluate these two models on additional datasets without extra training across different scales, process nodes, and traffic patterns of input data. Compared to the latency predictions from the state-of-the-art simulator, we improve the R -square score by 0.69 and reduce root mean square error (RMSE) by 76% on average across all datasets. We also achieve an R-square score of 0.98 and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.88% for the power consumption prediction task.

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Dry-type reactors are core components of power systems. Interturn insulation defects in dry-type reactors can easily lead to partial discharge and even insulation breakdown, posing a serious threat to power grid security. However, cross-domain diagnosis challenges caused by different models and complex operating conditions, as well as the small sample size problem in the target domain, restrict the performance of traditional diagnostic models. To address this issue, a dual-branch attention transfer network (BAN-TL) is proposed: the feature extraction branch is based on an improved ResNet-18 and embeds a frequency-domain attention module (FAM). This improves feature recognition by enhancing the 500MHz-1GHz fault frequency band and suppressing the interference frequency band. The domain adaptation branch employs a three-layer fully connected domain discriminator and combines an improved MMD with a center loss to construct a hybrid loss function, balancing cross-domain adaptation and fault classification. The two branches form a collaborative optimization closed loop through a feature interaction layer. A dataset was constructed based on three source domain models (10kV/20kV/35kV, 240,000 data sets) and two target domain models (15kV/25kV, 32,000 small sample sets) to compare the TL-ResNet, DAN, and JAN algorithms. Simulations show that BAN-TL achieves an overall accuracy of 96.2%/95.8% in the 15kV/25kV target domains, a 12.3%/11.7% improvement over TL-ResNet (83.9%/84.1%). The accuracy of local aging conditions reaches 94.1%/93.8%, 15.8%/15.3% higher than TL-ResNet. Even at a noise intensity of 0.2, the accuracy remains at 90.3%/89.7%, with a cross-domain feature distance of only 3.1-3.2. This effectively solves the challenge of cross-domain small-sample diagnosis of dry-type reactor interturn insulation, providing technical support for the safe operation of power grids."

    "abstract": "Traditional voice-controlled switches have disadvantages such as being affected by the environment, limited by voice, safety hazards, and high costs. In order to address these issues, this article aims to research and design an intelligent voice-controlled switch to facilitate people's lives. This switch uses sound and light control and human body sensing technology to automatically control the on/off of the light bulb based on people's voice and movements. The article first introduces the basic principles and applications of sound and light control and human body sensing technology, and then elaborates on the design and implementation process of this intelligent switch in detail, including hardware design and software programming. In terms of hardware design, a PCB board and a series of sensors and actuators are used to achieve the functions of sound and human body sensing.

    "abstract": "The increase in population ageing with increasing lifespan and falling birthrates has produced a demographic shift worldwide. This highlights the need to enhance the number of additional years of life free from chronic disease and disabilities of aging (called \"health-span\"). An important contribution to health and wellbeing is optimal nutrition, but older adults experience anorexia of ageing, causing low food intakes, poor dietary quality, leading to malnutrition. As nations contend with ageing populations, potential AI solutions have been developed for prevention and treatment of malnutrition in old age. This offers pathways to extend health-span as lifespan increases globally. However, adoption of AI solutions is challenging for older adults and their caregivers. The availability and functionality of smart technology are far greater than the evidence base to support user-sensitive design options. AI solutions can play a valuable role in preventing malnutrition among older adults through early detection, personalized nutrition, and remote care coordination. They can also contribute to treatment, with specific interventions, meal planning and medical monitoring but evidence of efficacy is at an early stage. Similarly, our understanding of the social, psychological and biological factors underpinning the anorexia of ageing requires further investigation. As crosstalk between nutrition and computing science improves so the development of AI aids to enhance health-span will increase."

Existing methods often struggle to simultaneously achieve global search capabilities and real-time adaptability. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel hybrid optimization framework that synergizes the strengths of evolutionary algorithms and deep reinforcement learning. The framework is structured around three core components: a multi-objective optimization model to define the problem space, a multi-agent game-theoretic model to capture strategic interactions between system entities, and a spatial-aware resource allocation module. We employ the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) to explore the global Pareto-optimal solution space in an offline stage. Subsequently, a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agent, a form of deep reinforcement learning, is utilized for online, fine-grained policy adjustments in response to real-time system feedback. The framework's efficacy is validated on a complex system simulation, demonstrating its ability to effectively manage system trade-offs, mitigate negative externalities (e.g., congestion or resource depletion), and maintain high operational efficiency. This work provides a robust and generalizable paradigm for solving a significant class of DMOPPs."

Gradient Boosting and Neural Networks are applied to a dataset of HTTP traffic (CIC-IDS2017), which includes features such as request methods, timestamps, response codes, and user agents, extracted for anomaly detection. Gradient Boosting, an ensemble method that builds sequential decision trees, effectively handles class imbalance and complex patterns in the data. Neural Networks, while highly flexible and capable of capturing complex relationships, face challenges with overfitting due to the relatively small dataset. The performance of these two advanced methods is compared with previous results from Random Forest and Support Vector Machines, demonstrating clear improvements in accuracy and F1-score with Gradient Boosting, while Neural Networks demonstrate potential, especially with access to larger datasets. This study highlights the benefits of using more advanced techniques for HTTP traffic analysis and provides a comparison framework to guide future WAF model development."

    "abstract": "As robots are increasingly integrated into industrial applications, robust fault diagnosis is becoming increasingly crucial to ensure operational safety and minimize unplanned downtime. Graph neural networks have emerged as a promising solution for handling multisensor fault diagnosis tasks, but conventional approaches for constructing spatial–temporal graphs from robotic sensor data tend to rely on either static physical knowledge or purely statistical relationships, each with inherent limitations in changing operational contexts. To address these challenges, this article proposes a novel hybrid architecture driven by large language model (LLM), which integrates global physical knowledge with localized statistical patterns to guide the dynamic construction of spatial–temporal graphs. A concrete operational method is further proposed to structure textual inputs for the LLM, allowing it to integrate domain knowledge, task objectives, and fusion logic into graph representations that are physically grounded and responsive to real-time conditions. Building on the outputs of this LLM-driven process, we design a lightweight spatial–temporal graph network that incorporates the dynamically generated graphs into fault inference. Finally, we validate our approach on two real-world robot platforms, and demonstrating notable improvements in diagnostic accuracy, adaptability, and robustness compared with existing state-of-the-art methods."

The proposed method achieves approximately a 5% reduction in repair time compared to conventional redundancy analysis algorithms. By following a Fail-First heuristic that front-loads the highest-constraint faults, it demonstrates consistent reductions in backtracking cost across a variety of parameter settings."

Our primary objective is to ensure robust stability in the face of uncertainties related to plant gain, pole, and time delay. The design of the GPPI controller is founded on a complementary sensitivity approach, and when necessary, it is further developed into a two-degree-of-freedom controller to separate reference tracking from the design aiming for robust closed-loop stability. We validate the effectiveness of our robust stability design through simulations that include both stable and unstable plant models with considerable time delays."

It turns out that by the proposed method a weighted square norm of the estimation error converges to zero for any such disturbance and observation signal loss.

We construct a high-quality dataset by preprocessing and annotating species assessment records into four target categories: species, threats, locations, and conservation measures. The model is fine-tuned with parameter-efficient strategies (LoRA and QLoRA) on this dataset, enabling efficient training on A100 GPU. Experiments show that the fine-tuned model significantly surpasses the baseline, with an F1 gain of more than 18 points under the standard threshold. Case analyses further indicate enhanced semantic accuracy, particularly in species identification and threat extraction.

In this work, we propose a Physics-Informed Token Prediction (PITP) that enables accurate modeling of DEA dynamics and high-speed feedforward tracking control. The PITP framework consists of two key components: a physics-informed encoder and a dynamic decoder. The physics-informed encoder is designed based on a simplified equivalent linear model and trained through the hierarchical optimization training method, which embeds the global dynamic characteristics into tokens, minimizing the need for extensive data and training. Then, the dynamic decoder is developed by using these tokens as state-dependent parameters, capable of describing complex dynamic responses through the autoregressive solution. Finally, by taking advantage of the model's reversibility, a direct inverse compensator is established to linearize the input-output relationship. Experimental results of several DEAs with different configurations and payloads demonstrate that, based on our PITP framework, the complex nonlinear dynamic responses of all DEAs can be precisely described and eliminated within their natural frequency, validating its generality and versatility. By leveraging fast modeling (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$&lt; $</tex-math></inline-formula>30 minutes) and high-speed feedforward tracking control, our PITP framework may accelerate DEAs' practical applications."

While existing research predominantly examines macro-level development status and evaluation systems, this study addresses the micro-level gap by investigating how perceived AI interaction styles (task vs. social) influence citizen experience through a structural equation model (SEM) based on first-hand survey data from more than 300 citizens in smart Guangzhou. The results reveal that citizen adjustment fully mediates both interaction styles’ impact on citizen experience. Brand involvement amplifies these effects, with higher involvement strengthening the mediation pathways. Theoretically, this research integrates Sociotechnical Systems Theory and Brand Community Theory to propose a novel \"Technology – Emotion - Community\" framework, advancing scholarly understanding of human-AI synergy in urban governance. Practically, it guides policymakers to resolve citizen experience dilemmas by advocating differentiated AI strategies, thereby accelerating market-oriented smart city transitions through stakeholder collaboration."

    "abstract": "One of the paths of innovation in the field of photonics and electronics is the strive to increase the integration possibilities for more compact and accessible platforms. For example, wearable biosensors which require compact design and often even flexibility have attracted much attention. In this study, we expand the research on wearable textile devices by exploring wearable and flexible photonics by the development of solution-processed metamaterial-based lenses.Resonant metalenses for 0.3 Terahertz (THz) frequency were designed, fabricated and characterized. Our results show that all the conductive polymer-based metalenses exhibit good focusing capabilities, achieving full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.61λ and focal spot intensities of up to 1.6 times higher than the incident field. Furthermore, focusing properties are preserved under limited mechanical bending.Our findings demonstrate the first ever study on solution processed conductive polymer metalenses in which effective focusing is realized. The proposed design and technological approaches aim to support future advancements in wearable biosensing and other THz optoelectronics."

    "abstract": "Reliable anomaly detection in multivariate time series is essential for distributed sensor networks, industrial IoT platforms, and cloud-edge infrastructures, where failures or attacks must be identified promptly to ensure system reliability and security. The task is challenging due to the scarcity and diversity of anomalies and the limited availability of labeled data in heterogeneous environments. To tackle these challenges, we propose CLASP (Contrastive Learning with Asymmetric Stochastic Patching), a framework that integrates clustering-guided patch mining, asymmetric augmentation, and stochastic patch exchange to provide strong contrastive supervision. This design enables the model to capture subtle and localized anomalies while preserving normal temporal dynamics. Experiments on five benchmark datasets-covering server logs, industrial control systems, and spacecraft telemetry-show that CLASP consistently outperforms competitive baselines, improving the average F1-score by 7.4 %. Well-suited for deployment in real-world distributed and ubiquitous computing environments, CLASP establishes a principled basis for robust anomaly detection, with future work targeting real-time edge deployments."

To further enhance robustness and minimize annotation requirements, we introduce a cross-supervision strategy that promotes consistent predictions, generates pseudo-aligned images, and leverages unlabeled image pairs during training. Extensive experiments across a variety of multimodal settings demonstrate that CrossNet significantly reduces the reliance on aligned training data while achieving state-of-the-art performance in both feature matching and image registration tasks."

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancements in information technologies, global data volumes have increased exponentially. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-based data storage has gained significant attention due to its superior storage capacity and long-term preservation potential compared to traditional media. However, during this process, DNA sequences may be affected by errors such as deletions, insertions, and substitutions, resulting in altered copies of the original sequence. Furthermore, the sequences in the DNA pool lack inherent order, preventing direct access to specific fragments. In this paper, we propose GTree, a trie-based DNA clustering framework tailored for DNA data storage. GTree achieves both high accuracy and low runtime complexity. It introduces a lightweight pre-screening module that combines Q-gram feature extraction, MinHash signatures, and Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) indexing to efficiently reduce the comparison space. A majority-label voting mechanism is also integrated to enhance clustering robustness in the presence of sequencing errors. Finally, we validate the performance of GTree through clustering experiments on both real biological and simulated datasets, demonstrating its superior performance."

    "abstract": "To address the problem of insufficient detection accuracy of traditional YOLO models due to the \"dense small targets, large scale differences, and susceptibility to occlusion\" in remote sensing images, this paper designs an innovative YOLO model integrating multi-scale features. First, a dynamic receptive field multi-scale feature extraction module is constructed, using three parallel branches with differentiated expansion rates and gating units to selectively capture features of targets at different scales. Second, an attention-driven adaptive feature fusion strategy is proposed, dynamically allocating cross-layer feature weights to enhance the utilization of details in small targets and semantic information in large targets. Finally, a small target weight factor and a hard sample mining coefficient are introduced on top of the CIoU loss to optimize the model's learning bias. Experiments are conducted using the NWPU VHR-10 and a self-made UAV remote sensing dataset as test sets, comparing YOLOv5s, YOLOv7-tiny, and YOLOv8s models. Results show that on the NWPU VHR-10 dataset, the proposed model achieves 92.3% mAP@0.5 (a 3.2% improvement over YOLOv8s) and 88.7% mAP-small (a 5.1% improvement); on the self-made dataset, mAP@0.5 reaches 90.5% (a 2.8% improvement), while maintaining an FPS of 28 frames/second (on par with YOLOv8s). This research demonstrates that the proposed model can effectively improve the accuracy of multi-scale target detection in remote sensing images, while also considering real-time performance, making it suitable for scenarios such as land monitoring and agricultural yield estimation."

    "abstract": "Clenbuterol, as an illegal ${\\beta}$-adrenergic agonist, is illicitly used in animal husbandry, leading to residues in meat products that pose a serious threat to public health. Although conventional detection methods (e.g., chromatography-mass spectrometry) offer high sensitivity, they suffer from inherent drawbacks such as complex sample preparation, long detection cycles, being destructive in nature, and the inability to provide spatial distribution information of contaminants. To overcome these limitations, this study proposed and validated a novel method based on high-resolution Raman imaging for the non-destructive, rapid detection and visualization of clenbuterol in pork. Through the systematic optimization of a custom-built Raman imaging system, including adjusting the working distance between the objective lens and the sample to 175 mm and setting the camera pixel binning value to 2, the signal acquisition efficiency and detection sensitivity were significantly enhanced. To counteract the strong fluorescence background from the pork matrix, the adaptive iteratively reweighted penalized least squares (airPLS) algorithm was employed for effective baseline correction. The core innovation of this study is the proposal of a “Pixel Ratio Method,” which establishes a precise quantitative model by identifying and quantifying pixels corresponding to the characteristic Raman peak of clenbuterol at $1600 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$. The results showed that the method exhibited an excellent linear relationship $\\left(R^{2}=0.99\\right)$ within the concentration range of $0.04 \\%$ to $0.2 \\%(\\mathrm{w} / \\mathrm{w})$, with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as $0.04 \\%$ and a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of only $0.0058 \\%$. Crucially, this technique achieved the visualization of the spatial distribution of clenbuterol within pork tissue for the first time. Compared to traditional detection methods, this technique offers significant advantages of being non-destructive, rapid, and accurate, enabling the visualization of clenbuterol distribution in pork and providing a powerful new paradigm for food safety inspection."

Firstly, a reconstructive network is designed to learn the feature distribution of normal patterns. By combining anomaly generation and mapping-reconstruction strategy, it can achieve anomaly simulation without labels. Additionally, a pixel correlation module is introduced to enhance global feature representation and improve the reconstruction fidelity. Then, a discriminative network is constructed to locate anomalous regions by analyzing the residuals between the reconstruction results and the anomalous input. Furthermore, an efficient feature fusion module is introduced to refine detailed information in the discriminative network. Experiments conducted on wood defect dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

With the establishment of an integrated regional electricity market, price convergence is expected, which will impose uneven impacts on provincial industries. This study applies a simulation-based method to evaluate these impacts through the development of an electricity-output elasticity indicator. The results demonstrate that industrial sectors in Shanghai are less affected compared to those in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Anhui. Among these, Anhui experiences the greatest influence across most industries, while Zhejiang and Jiangsu occupy an intermediate position. The findings suggest that higher levels of economic development correspond to weaker sensitivity to electricity price changes. These results imply that policymakers should exercise caution in advancing regional electricity market integration and design differentiated policies to balance the interests of economically stronger and weaker provinces."

To address this challenge, this study proposes a real-time PV output smoothing approach based on an Alpha-Beta filter algorithm. The method forecasts short-term power variations and dynamically regulates the charging and discharging of a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), intervening only when significant deviations occur. This selective control reduces unnecessary cycling, improves State of Charge (SOC) management, and extends battery lifespan. Unlike conventional smoothing techniques, the proposed framework maintains the original PV generation profile while mitigating disruptive fluctuations. Implemented in Python and evaluated using OpenDSS simulations with real PV data from a high-penetration microgrid, the method achieved a 91.7% reduction in power variation and maintained voltage stability within regulatory limits. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the Alpha-Beta filter-based strategy for stabilizing PV output and optimizing energy storage operation in distributed energy systems."

Our proposed method leverages rotation-translation decoupling constraints to enable simultaneous estimation of gyroscope bias, extrinsic rotation, and camera-IMU time offset-even under pure rotational motion. Moreover, we are the first to conduct observability analysis on rotational constraints in rotation-translation decoupling methods, experimentally identifying the unobservable state-space directions under three degenerate motions within our approach. We also perform extensive experiments to delineate practical parameter solution boundaries for our method, with both efforts substantially enhancing the overall practical applicability of decoupling-based methods. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in accuracy and robustness while maintaining computational efficiency.

Due to several reasons and intruders the mechanism of providing security becomes a tedious task. At first conventional passwords are used to provide security to data while storing and transmitting but remembering the password quite confusing and difficult for the user to access the data. After that cryptography methodology is introduced to protect the data from the intruders by converting readable form of data into unreadable data by encryption process. Then the data is processed and received the receiver can access the original data by the reverse process of encryption called decryption. The processes of encoding have broken by intruders using various combinations of keys. In this proposed work strong encryption key can be generated by combining biometric and cryptography methods for enhancing firmness of data. Here biometric face image is pre-processed at initial stage then facial features are extracted to generate biometric-cryptographic key. After generating bio-crypto key data can be encrypted along with newly produced key with 0's or 1's bit combination and stored in the database.

    "abstract": "Composite federated learning provides a comprehensive framework for addressing machine learning tasks that incorporate regularization terms. Nevertheless, numerous established methods within this framework face challenges stemming from data heterogeneity and the high variance induced by stochastic gradients mapping. These issues cause significant deviations in clients' local models, resulting in unstable and slow convergence of the global model and increased communication costs. To address this, we propose a novel algorithm named FedSAGA, designed to solve composite federated optimization problems that include a nonsmooth global regularization term. In FedSAGA, we construct a combination of the latest and historical local model updates without incurring additional communication overhead. This estimate serves as a control variate on the client side to reduce the variance introduced by stochastic gradient mapping and client sampling. To further accelerate convergence, we leverage the inertial extrapolation step locally at the clients. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that FedSAGA attains a sublinear convergence rate under general convex settings and a linear convergence rate under strongly convex settings. Numerical experiments based on both real and synthetic datasets effectively demonstrate the convergence of the proposed algorithm under partial client participation."

    "abstract": "Space weather forecasting is vital to mitigate disruptions in satellite communications, power grids, and navigation systems. Conventional physics-based models struggle with realtime predictions due to the complexity of space weather events. This paper reviews advances in machine learning (ML) methods for space weather prediction, highlighting datasets, techniques, challenges, and future directions. We assess the performance of neural networks, deep learning, and hybrid models in forecasting solar storms, geomagnetic disturbances, and ionospheric changes. Studies show ML enhances predictions-such as solar flares and geomagnetic storms-through large-scale data analysis. Models like Random Forest and LSTM offer improved precision over traditional methods, with promising results in some cases. Key challenges include data quality and model interpretability, alongside efforts to integrate ML with physics-based models for better forecasting."

    "abstract": "The shift from synchronous generators to converterbased sources is reducing system inertia, prompting concerns about frequency stability. In response, synthetic inertia is gaining attention, with supercapacitors emerging as promising technologies because of their specific advantages. However, the most used supercapacitor type, Electric Double-Layer Capacitors, have inherent limitations in voltage and current because of their nature, including internal resistance and capacitance that varies with voltage. Previous studies have typically relied on simplified supercapacitor models, often neglecting critical factors such as equivalent series resistance and voltage-dependent capacitance, resulting in inaccurate energy availability estimations and deviations in determining the appropriate operating voltage range. This paper provides an analytical comparison of how the operating, minimum, and maximum voltages required to deliver a specified amount of energy vary depending on the chosen equivalent circuit model of the supercapacitor."

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification has advanced significantly through transformer-based models that leverage self-attention (SA) to capture global spectral dependencies. However, most existing HSI transformers implicitly assume that SA provides a faithful and discriminative modeling of spectral information, an assumption that has rarely been examined. We examine SA behavior in HSI classification using adversarial perturbations guided by explainable AI (XAI) techniques. By comparing transformer attention distributions with Integrated Gradients (IG) importance scores, we uncover discrepancies between attended bands and decision-driving features. Experiments show that SA often forms redundant clusters across neighboring spectral bands and that attention patterns evolve across layers, shifting from a localized to a broader focus. Such redundancy improves robustness to spectral corruptions but reduces feature specificity and leads to repeated processing of highly similar bands, increasing computational burden. Our findings question the everyday use of raw attention as an explanatory clue and guide the design of more reliable and interpretable attention mechanisms for HSI."

    "abstract": "The increasing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in Earth Observation (EO) applications, such as forest height estimation, has led to a growing need for explainable AI (XAI) methods. Despite their high accuracy, AI models are often criticized for their “black-box” nature, making it difficult to understand the inner decision-making process. In this study, we propose a multifaceted approach to XAI for a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model that estimates forest height from TanDEM-X single-pass InSAR data. By combining domain knowledge, saliency maps, and feature importance analysis through exhaustive model permutations, we provide a comprehensive investigation of the network working principles. Our results suggests that the proposed model is implicitly capable of recognizing and compensating for the SAR acquisition geometry-related distortions. We find that the mean phase center height and its local variability represents the most informative predictor. We also find evidence that the interferometric coherence and the backscatter maps capture complementary but equally relevant views of the vegetation. This work contributes to advance the understanding of the model's inner workings, and targets the development of more transparent and trustworthy AI for EO applications, ultimately leading to improved accuracy and reliability in the estimation of forest parameters."

This applies in particular to real-world settings with constrained hardware performance. With these challenges in mind, the authors have recently presented a collision avoidance strategy based on multiple artificial potential functions (MAPOFs). The strategy overcomes the typical drawbacks of the conventional, popular APOFs approach, such as chattering or deadlock. The main focus of the present paper is on the practical implementation and experimental demonstration of the proposed MAPOF strategy in two real-life outdoor scenarios using a commercial quadrotor and open-source software. The experiments show the effectiveness of the MAPOFs strategy in the presence of stationary obstacles as well as in the presence of another moving UAV. The experiments are complemented by additional simulation results to further illustrate and validate the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "This article investigates the probability-guaranteed distributed fusion estimation (DFE) issue for a class of nonlinear systems with censored measurements over sensor networks. In order to reduce the transmission load and minimize energy consumption, each sensing node sends its censored measurement to the estimator only when a predefined event-triggered media access condition is met. To enhance both the security and reliability of signal transmission, a binary encoding scheme is adopted, which encodes the transmitted information using a limited number of bits. The core objective of the addressed problem is to develop a novel distributed robust fusion estimator capable of maintaining effectiveness in the presence of censored measurements, nonlinear dynamics, and unknown-but-bounded noise, while confining the estimation error to ellipsoidal regions with a prespecified probability. To be specific, sufficient conditions for the existence of the desired fusion estimator, obtained through a weighted matrix fusion technique, are established using mathematical induction, linear matrix inequalities, and set theory. In addition, the estimator parameters and the fusion weights are determined through the solution of a series of optimization problems that are constrained by matrix inequalities. Finally, the efficacy of the DFE scheme developed in the article is confirmed by a ballistic object tracking example."

It operates in continuous-wave mode with a 100% microwave duty cycle, a configuration where multipactor emerges as a critical operational challenge requiring meticulous mitigation. The exponential amplification of secondary electrons within the electron gun may cause power dissipation, cavity material degradation, and beam quality deterioration, ultimately compromising the performance and operational lifetime of the VHF gun. Analysis of electron trajectories inside the cavity reveals that the energy dispersion and angular distribution of emitted electrons significantly affect their subsequent motion. Although the multipactor behavior is non-resonant, multiple resonance modes can still be identified from the statistical distribution of particle flight times. This study examines the influence of radio-frequency (rf) cavity geometry on multipactor behavior, with the underlying mechanisms elucidated through statistical analysis of particle trajectories. The effect of the secondary electron yield of copper on multipactor is also discussed. Finally, an optimized rf cavity profile exhibiting very low multipactor intensity is presented, providing a promising approach to achieving stable VHF electron gun operation."

    "abstract": "In response to the challenges of complex image backgrounds, small target sizes, and low resolution in insulator fault detection, as well as the issues of high computational overhead of existing real-time detection models, we proposes an insulator fault detection model—SPD-DETR, based on SPDConv and attention mechanisms. First, the SPD-FasterNet backbone is constructed, where SPDConv replaces partial convolution to effectively preserve fine-grained spatial information of small targets during feature extraction, thereby reducing information loss at the source. Second, a Spatial-Channel Aggregation Attention (SCAA) is introduced to enhance multi-scale features from the backbone. By jointly optimizing key spatial locations and channel features in parallel, the method suppresses interference from complex backgrounds and improves the discriminative ability for defect features. Finally, the encoder is reconstructed using a HiLo attention that decouples high- and low-frequency information, enabling efficient capture of both global context and local details, while significantly reducing the computational overhead of the Transformer architecture. Experimental results show that compared with the baseline model, SPD-DETR reduces the parameters and computational complexity by 12.4% and 13.2% respectively, while increasing mAP@0.5 and mAP@0.5:0.95 by 3.76% and 5.35% respectively. This significantly improves the detection performance for small-sized insulator faults in low-resolution images. The model is highly suitable for deployment on edge devices such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with limited computational resources."

Currently, only 30 of 44 barangays are connected to the Iligan City Waterworks System (ICWS), with many households either undersupplied or receiving excessive allocations. This study applies a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize barangaypumping station assignments, introducing three key updates: a shift to household-level adequacy thresholds, integration of updated ICWS connection records, and adoption of stratified benchmarks set by the Philippine Institute for Development Studies-108, 58, and 48 liters per person per day for rich, middle, and poor households, respectively. A water supply analysis of the current system revealed pronounced imbalances, including severe undersupply in high-population barangays and extreme oversupply in select areas such as Abuno. Using GA, more than 800 iterations generated an optimized framework that redistributed supply more equitably, minimized oversupply, reduced undersupply, and diversified source dependency. The proposed system achieved near-normal discharge distributions, capped household deficits, and eliminated extreme outliers, demonstrating substantial improvements in adequacy, fairness, and resilience. These findings underscore the potential of optimization models to address water distribution challenges in Iligan City and comparable urban contexts across Southeast Asia."

    "abstract": "Compute Express Link (CXL) enables scalable memory disaggregation, allowing multiple hosts to share a global memory pool. However, existing CXL pooling designs require manual static configuration, underutilize link bandwidth, and suffer from performance unfairness among hosts with diverse memory intensities. This paper presents FAI-CXL, a hardwareaccelerated CXL memory pool unified management architecture that integrates fine-grained, weighted interleaving and adaptive fairness-aware scheduling into the CXL switch. The proposed interleaving mechanism operates at cacheline granularity, improving both link and device bandwidth utilization, while the scheduling policy dynamically adjusts priorities to mitigate unfairness under imbalanced workloads. We implement FAI-CXL in a cycle-accurate ChampSim + Ramulator simulation framework with realistic CXL protocol modeling. Across diverse workload sets, FAI-CXL achieves up to 21 % IPC improvement and 17 % throughput gain compared to conventional pooling approaches, while ensuring fair performance across heterogeneous hosts."

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor network have shown promise in addressing issues in industrial and healthcare applications. Sensor nodes are distributed across the area to measure key environmental parameters. They then transmit the collected data to the base station for further processing and analysis. Efficient topology control plays a crucial role in optimizing resource utilization for data processing. Multi-Sink placement is a key strategy for minimizing energy consumption and extending network lifetime. Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) is suggested for identifying the best sink placements by taking use of grasshoppers' swarming and foraging habits. Node energy and hop count are considered to evaluate the energy efficiency of the sensor network. The experimental findings clearly indicate that the proposed method performs better than both the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) and the Ant Lion Optimizer (ALO). In particular, the new approach extends the overall network lifetime and achieves noticeable reductions in delay and energy usage. These improvements highlight the efficiency and reliability of the proposed solution when compared with existing optimization techniques."

    "abstract": "Traffic congestion remains a critical challenge in urban mobility, necessitating adaptive and intelligent regulation strategies. This paper presents a novel, generic framework that integrates a Multi-Agent System (MAS) layer within a traffic simulator to optimize traffic flow through simulation-driven decision-making. The proposed system allows Dynamic Message Signs (DMS) to function as autonomous agents that assess congestion levels, exchange information, and collaboratively determine rerouting strategies. Unlike conventional approaches, our framework enables agents to negotiate multiple rerouting strategies offline, test them in simulation, and store the most effective ones in a learning module. When congestion occurs in real-world conditions, the agents perform a similarity check within their learning module; if a matching scenario is found, the best prevalidated strategy is immediately applied, eliminating the need for real-time simulations. Otherwise, new rerouting strategies are generated and tested offline for future optimization. The framework ensures that only reliable and effective strategies are deployed, leading to more adaptive and data-driven traffic regulation. Preliminary simulation results demonstrate significant reductions in total waiting time, highlighting the efficiency of integrating MAS-based learning into traffic management systems."

Our analysis reveals that GDP, population size, FTAs, and online search intensity are crucial drivers of import volumes, explaining 83% of the variance; however, geographical distance is insignificant. The strong effect of search intensity validates the role of digital proximity in powering trade, counter to classic gravity expectations. The findings highlight how online activity bridges virtual demand signals and real-world trade outcomes. The study links digitalization to economic growth, offering exporters guidance on digital-first market strategies and providing policymakers with evidence to design trade policies suitable for an era of digital transformation."

For this model, it can be shown that the solution of the time-optimal problem of moving from one point to another through a forest of circular obstacles is one of the locally shortest paths between the two points, with addition of rotations around the starting and the finishing point. Therefore, an algorithm for automatic search of the optimal trajectory is proposed. It creates a graph of connections between the points on the circular obstacles and searches for the optimal trajectory on this graph using Dijkstra’s approach."

This model integrates luminance and chrominance separation properties of YCrCb with the geometric invariance of logarithmic polar coordinates. Through a differentiated quantum encoding strategy, more qubits are allocated to critical luminance information while less sensitive chrominance information is assigned simplified encoding. Corresponding quantum state preparation circuits are also designed. Theoretical analysis indicates that compared to traditional RGB polar coordinate models, this model achieves significant savings in color information encoding resources while maintaining comparable visual fidelity. Furthermore, the model inherently possesses the rotation and scaling invariance of polar coordinates, establishing a robust foundation for developing efficient quantum image processing algorithms."

    "abstract": "Precision motion control systems are frequently challenged by exogenous disturbances and plant uncertainties, which compromise tracking accuracy and operational stability. To address these issues, the extended state observer (ESO) has been developed to estimate both system states and disturbances in real time. However, conventional ESOs rely on an integral-based mechanism, necessitating a high observer bandwidth to handle rapidly varying disturbances. This, in turn, increases noise sensitivity and reduces stability margins. In this article, we introduce a novel error compensation mechanism that dynamically minimizes the estimation errors inherent in traditional ESOs, thus eliminating the need for a high observer bandwidth. Furthermore, we propose a time delay controller, leveraging historical input–output data to mitigate residual disturbances and plant variations. Experimental results validate the efficacy of our approach: settling time is reduced from 49.81 (conventional ADRC) to 2.74 ms (the proposed method), while disturbance convergence time decreases from 49.94 to 2.41 ms. These results underscore its superiority in high-precision applications that require robustness against disturbances and uncertainties."

A metallic grid deposited on the surface of the samples allowed to excite magnetopasmons, the frequency of which was registered as a function of magnetic field up to 16 T. Analysis of the data led to the conclusion that observed magnetoplasmons resulted either from plasma excitation in one QW or coherently in all QWs in the sample. Both types of excitations showed a gap in the dispersion in the region where it crossed the frequency of the second harmonic of the cyclotron resonance, typically referred to as Bernstein modes. We described the observed dispersion relation using the theory of plasma excitation, which takes into account non-local interactions in the plasma."

    "abstract": "As renewable energy continues to penetrate the power grid, the operational demand for synchronous generators has markedly decreased, resulting in many units being retired earlier than expected. However, the limited voltage support capability of renewable generation equipment brings challenges to the secure and stable operation of the power system. To mitigate these issues, this paper proposes an optimal configuration strategy for distributed synchronous condensers (DSCs) in renewable energy stations, considering the incorporation of thermal power units retrofitted into synchronous condensers to strengthen grid voltage support in a more economical manner. First, based on the multiple renewable energy stations short-circuit ratio (MRSCR) as an indicator of voltage support strength, the influence of DSC integration and varying operating modes of thermal power units on the MRSCR is examined. Then, a voltage support demand index is constructed for determining DSC siting, followed by an accurate calculation of DSC capacity requirements for sizing, along with the selection of appropriate economic evaluation indicators. On this basis, an optimal siting and sizing method for DSCs is developed. Finally, a high-renewable-penetration simulation model is established, and comparative analyses under different configuration schemes confirm the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach."

Possible containment measures are linked to human behavior, such as the use of appropriate clothing, mosquito nets, repellents. Other measures concern actions to limit the reproduction of mosquitoes, for example avoiding stagnant water, and, in some cases, they are more invasive, such as acting with targeted disinfestations. The combined action of these strategies, taking into account the limitations related to their applicability and the protection of the ecosystem, is implemented in this work, within the framework of the optimal control theory. The proposed results underline the importance of prevention action and propose suggestions on how to implement the most invasive actions."

    "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks are becoming more and more crucial to the advancement of numerous technologies, particularly when combined with Big Data platforms. Although this connection has a lot of potential, there are challenging security challenges as well. Even though WSNs have been the subject of a lot of research, the security requirements for WSNs functioning in Big Data environments have not yet been thoroughly examined. It is also a crucial use of IoT, allowing sensors to exchange a variety of data. However, because of its inherent unreliability and natural surroundings, such a network is susceptible to numerous types of attacks, including insider attacks. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are commonly used in WSNs to protect against insider assaults by putting in place the right procedures and techniques. However, sensors may produce too much data in the big data era, which could reduce the efficiency of WSN computing. An overview of the security concerns and difficulties facing WSNs in the big data era is provided in this study. In order to improve the detection of insider threats and the overall security posture of WSNs, a literature review on cybersecurity IDS on WSN in the context of big data is finally suggested. It highlights advancements in IDS methodologies, including federated learning, machine learning, deep learning, and big data techniques."

    "abstract": "Latency-sensitive services across the end-edge-cloud continuum require not only low mean latency but explicit control of tail latency and data freshness. We propose Control-Loop Freshness-aware Service Function Chain orchestration (CLFSFC), a freshness-aware orchestration framework for Service Function Chains (SFCs) that jointly selects model variants and function placements. We define a Control-Loop Freshness (CLF) objective that combines 95th/99th-percentile (P95/P99) end-toend latency with an Age of Information (AoI) proxy. To make this objective operational under uncertainty, we allocate per-stage risk budgets via the union bound and convert mean/variance profiles into percentile constraints using Cantelli's inequality, yielding a two-stage greedy solver with interpretable quotas. We implement CLF-SFC with offline profiling of YOLOv5 n/s/m variants across end/edge/cloud devices, and evaluate it with profiling-driven measurements on COCO 2017 under synthesized network regimes. Across bandwidth and round-trip time settings, CLF-SFC reduces P95/P99 latency and Service Level Objective (SLO) violations relative to Edge-only, Cloud-only, and a riskagnostic heuristic; at high bandwidth it remains comparable to the Shortest-Latency-Path (SLP) baseline. The proposed CLF-SFC framework naturally fits embodied-AI pipelines where perception, fusion, and policy modules operate in a closed loop. By explicitly incorporating the Age-of-Information (AoI), our orchestration ties data freshness to control stability, complementing tail-latency minimization."

It also designs a differentiated indexing mechanism (hot-tier hashing, warm-tier improved B+ tree, cold-tier compressed block indexing) and an adaptive compression strategy (numeric difference-Huffman coding, character-based dynamic dictionary encoding). Simulation experiments were conducted on industrial monitoring (520GB, 1 billion records) and financial transaction (410GB, 800 million records) datasets, comparing MySQL 8.0 and InfluxDB 2.0. Results show that after compression, HTDSQ reduces the storage capacity of industrial datasets to 120GB, a 57.1% reduction compared to InfluxDB 2.0 (280GB) and a 73.3% reduction compared to MySQL 8.0 (450GB).

InceptionTime and H-InceptionTime obtained the best performance among all three tasks. The InceptionTime model achieved a mean absolute error of 6.60 years in age value regression, suggesting sufficient accuracy for coarse-grained demographicaware adaptation.

THz nano-slot structured metamaterials (MM) were fabricated to have resonance at specific frequency (1.47 THz) based on the extracted oil paint fingerprints. The oil paint samples were deposited onto the fabricated metasurface, then THz transmittance was measured. The measured THz transmittance spectra were fitted to the Lorentzian function to extract key parameters (A, x<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">c</inf>, w), which were digited and saved into QR codes as secure reference storage. Environmental stimuli such as heat, oxidation and UV exposure was induced to the samples, which would affect to the value of the key parameters. These changes in the parameters were visualized as ΔParameters (%) in 3D plot and its orthogonal projections to each plane, enabling accurate condition monitoring of the oil paints. Moreover, by comparing the reference parameters of the QR codes and extracted parameters from the transmittance of the current sample, our method provides unique perspective for nondestructive/labeling authentication method of the artworks."

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in engineering, including requirements engineering, where it improves consistency, completeness, and traceability. This article hypothesizes that AI can similarly enhance the quality of smart grid requirements engineering and deepen system understanding.

Within a randomized controlled trial, conventional modeling approaches were compared with the AI-assisted method implemented in SGAAIRE. The results demonstrate that integrating AI into the quality assurance process can improve the quality of IEC 62559 Use Cases and SGAM Models, particularly among experienced users.

    "abstract": "The inverter based on fully controlled semiconductor devices is the core of power conversion in PWM rectifiers and the main source of converter losses. Therefore, accurately analyzing and evaluating inverter losses is crucial for optimizing product efficiency. Currently, methods such as simulation software and analytical calculations can obtain loss values of various inverter components, providing data support for preliminary design and component-level guidance for product optimization. However, factors like switching stress, harmonics, contact resistance, and deviations in component rated parameters are difficult to accurately quantify, which affects the precision of loss calculations. Meanwhile, testing methods such as calorimetry often only capture partial component loss data, making it difficult to achieve precise efficiency improvements. This paper takes a cascaded bipolar inverter as an example. First, the theoretical calculation methods for inverter losses are analyzed and explained. Then, a data acquisition model for steady-state operation of the inverter is constructed, and based on experimentally collected data, the calculation methods for losses of various inverter components are derived and decomposed to guide the efficiency optimization of the rectifier system. Subsequently, a steady-state operation model of the entire system is established to estimate inverter losses from a system-level perspective, and the results are compared with the aforementioned loss calculations. Finally, using measured parameters from an actual engineering case, the losses from theoretical calculations and the steady-state operation-based model are compared to analyze the accuracy of the calculations."

Efficient multi-objective task offloading in dynamic network environments has become a key challenge in edge computing. This paper proposes a Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm based on Hybrid Prioritized Experience Replay (HyPER-PPO) for multi-objective optimization of task offloading decisions. The offloading process is modeled as a multi-objective Markov decision process (MOMDP), with a dynamic weight adjustment mechanism to adaptively balance delay and energy consumption. To address sample inefficiency in Proximal Policy Optimization, we introduce a hybrid prioritized replay mechanism based on Temporal Difference (TD) error and Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE), enabling the reuse of high-value historical experiences. Additionally, an Importance Sampling (IS) weight is applied to correct bias caused by non-uniform sampling, improving update stability. Experimental results show that Multi-Objective HyPER-PPO significantly outperforms the UCB1, SPEA/R, and NSGA-III algorithms, achieving <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{7 3 \\%}$</tex> lower task latency and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{5 6 \\%}$</tex> lower energy consumption in complex MEC environments.

The scheduling problem in distributed systems with worker factors is a complex combinatorial optimization problem. In this article, the multiobjective distributed flexible job shop scheduling with worker factors (MO-DFJSPWF), including proficiency and the learning–forgetting effect, is studied to minimize makespan and total resource load (TRL). A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is established according to the degree of proficiency and the rate of learning–forgetting effect of the workers. A tri-stage cooperative optimization algorithm (TSCOA) is designed for the MO-DFJSPWF. First, a knowledge-based initialization method considering worker proficiency, machine load, and job priority is proposed to generate the initial population of the problem. Second, a bi-population cooperative strategy with a dynamic adaptive search strategy (DASS) is developed to balance the convergence speed and candidate diversity of the algorithm. Eight perturbation operators in the second and third stages are introduced to explore and exploit the solution space of the TSCOA. Third, the perturbation operators are selected dynamically via the Q-learning mechanism by leveraging the historical performance data of local search operators. The effectiveness and efficiency of the TSCOA are tested on a benchmark test suite. The experimental results indicated that the performance of the TSCOA outperforms certain state-of-the-art algorithms in solving MO-DFJSPWF."

    "abstract": "Unbalanced grid conditions generate negative-sequence (NS) components in power systems and lead to oscillating output power from converters, posing technical challenges to the fault ride-through (FRT) capabilities of grid-forming (GFM) converters. The current limiter in the GFM converter avoids overcurrent issues during contingencies but it compromises system synchronization stability under grid voltage sags if the power synchronization loop (PSL) is used. This paper proposes a GFM control scheme based on the current synchronization loop (CSL) as a generalized solution for enhancing system synchronization stability under both balanced and unbalanced grid voltage sags. Theoretical analysis informs the selection of power control coefficients to coordinate unbalanced FRT objectives, including oscillating active power elimination and negative-sequence voltage suppression. An adaptive unbalanced limiter for GFM modular multilevel converters (MMCs) is further proposed based on the characteristics of the internal arm current, making full use of the power semiconductor current ratings and improving fault current contribution. The combination of the adaptive current limiter with the CSL-based GFM control allows GFM MMCs to provide additional reactive power to support positive-sequence voltage and suppress NS voltage at the PCC, enhancing their unbalanced FRT capabilities. All these grid supporting functionalities are quantified and validated with hardware experimental results from a laboratory-scale, grid-connected GFM MMC system."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the design and implementation of a compact and highly efficient –10 dB directional coupler based on a half-mode substrate integrated waveguide cavity resonator configuration. The proposed structure is based on stub-loaded cavity resonators that are responsible for coupling the desired energy to the auxiliary port. A four-resonator arrangement is used to realize the desired coupling level of –10 dB while maintaining compact dimensions. Experimental validation demonstrates a reflection coefficient better than –15 dB, insertion loss below 1.56 dB, and isolation exceeding 15 dB across the operational bandwidth 4.341-5.26 GHz (≈919 MHz bandwidth). Furthermore, a 90-degree phase difference between the through and coupled ports is maintained. The coupler also exhibits tunable coupling characteristics at the coupled port, with experimentally verified coupling levels ranging from 5 dB to 10 dB, highlighting its reconfigurability for adaptive microwave applications."

    "abstract": "The boson peak (BP) is an anomalous excess in the vibrational density of states in the terahertz (THz) region of glasses, playing a key role in their low-energy excitations. Understanding BP is essential not only for elucidating the nanoscale mechanical properties of glasses but also for controlling their THz optical properties. In this study, we quantitatively analyzed BP in glycerol, a representative hydrogen-bonded glass, using the heterogeneous elasticity theory (HET). By solving the coherent potential approximation (CPA) equation for the shear modulus, we extracted both the spatial correlation length of elastic heterogeneity and the magnitude of elastic fluctuations, which govern the BP frequency and intensity. Our results demonstrate that the nanoscale elasticity of glycerol significantly affects its BP characteristics, which in turn influence its THz optical response. This study highlights the potential of BP analysis as a framework for tailoring the THz optical properties of glasses, opening new possibilities for the design of functional disordered materials."

However, due to scarce labeled performance data and intricate node interactions, ensuring quality of service (QoS) and optimizing resource allocation remain challenging. To address these limitations, we propose a self-training and semi-supervised learning-based microservice performance prediction method (SMPP). Specifically, SMPP collects limited microservices labeled resource-performance data, and then constructs a self-training and semi-supervised microservice performance prediction model, which predicts the performance of microservice nodes under dynamic resource constraints. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we deploy SMPP on Docker Engine and DeathStarBench, and the experimental results demonstrate that SMPP outperforms conventional methods in predicting critical resource metrics, confirming its efficacy for microservice performance prediction."

    "abstract": "Modern embedded systems are increasingly vulnerable to side-channel threats, which may non-invasively leak sensitive information about their internal operations. While prior studies have validated the feasibility of instruction reverse engineering via side-channel analysis, their effectiveness has primarily been demonstrated under ideal, device-controlled settings. In practical adversarial scenarios, heterogeneity in manufacturing processes and hardware components across devices introduces significant variations in side-channel signals, which impedes effective pattern recognition and limits the scalability of crossdevice attacks. This paper presents FusionDisassembler, a robust and generalizable instruction disassembly framework for cross-device side-channel analysis. FusionDisassembler captures power traces during program execution and identifies the corresponding assembly instructions. To address device-induced signal variability, we employ information-theoretic analysis in the timefrequency domain to extract discriminative features that remain stable across hardware. Moreover, we introduce a MultiExpert Disassembly Network, comprising multiple specialized expert subnetworks trained on different feature domains, and a lightweight router that dynamically selects the most appropriate expert based on input features. This architecture enables effective learn of distribution shifts across devices and enhances generalization in real-world attack settings. We evaluate FusionDisassembler on multiple physical devices across two microarchitectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness, outperforming existing approaches and establishing a new practical benchmark for side-channel-based disassembly."

Advanced systems create a precise digital twin of physical environments that integrate diverse data streams and predictive algorithms to model human behavior and adapt to rapidly evolving situations during crises. This means a huge improvement compared to traditional approaches in evacuation planning, which generally have serious lacks in flexibility and accuracy in such complex urban environments. The concept is important since rapid urbanization coupled with increasing population density and higher frequencies of natural and artificial disasters can pose a serious challenge. Effective evacuation strategies are of prime importance to reduce casualties. Digital twins have the potential to change such practices in enhancing situational awareness, predicting bottlenecks, and optimizing response times. However, the implementation challenges include data accuracy, privacy issues, and socio-behavioral complexities in modeling. By overcoming those barriers through collaborative interdisciplinary approaches, robust data infrastructure, and standardized frameworks, digital twins can prove to be really transformational for emergency management and provide an approach that is more robust and adaptive against crises for the cities."

    "abstract": "The demand for megawatt-class gyrotrons for Electron Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ECRH) of nuclear fusion devices is growing significantly. It goes hand in hand with growing requirements for output power, efficiency, operating flexibility, and reliability of gyrotrons used in nuclear fusion, as well as higher demanding of the manufacturability for serial production. In Europe research and development is ongoing to fulfil that future needs, particularly, with regards to output power and efficiency. It is complemented by the work on gyrotrons for the future EU DEMOnstration power plant which, according to the latest re-design, most probably, will be a device working at a low aspect ratio, hence, with a moderate toroidal magnetic field (~ 4.39 T) requesting for gyrotrons operating significantly below 200 GHz and at a power level of 2 MW CW. That is in line with the fact, that, today, ECRH systems operate at frequencies below 200 GHz, e.g., at 140 GHz for Wendelstein 7-X and 170 GHz for ITER, respectively. In parallel to this, several new start-ups are proposing concepts for compact nuclear fusion devices that shall operate at much higher toroidal magnetic fields. Hence, it will require gyrotrons operating significantly above 200 GHz, even above 300 GHz. That raises the question about the suitable concepts of megawatt-class sub-THz gyrotrons for ECRH in future low-field and high-field fusion devices. Design considerations ongoing in Europe addressing those challenges will be discussed."

While the quartz–air interface reflection was not resolvable, increasing step depths produced a clear shift in the second reflected pulse (from the quartz–metal interface), corresponding to increased apparent thickness of the window. Notably, even a 10 µm air gap resulted in a measurable change in the calculated quartz thickness, demonstrating the method’s sensitivity to delamination layers below the system’s axial resolution, defined as the minimum layer thickness (d<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">min</inf>) that can be resolved based on the temporal separation between two reflected pulses.

To address this challenge, this paper proposes an adaptive intrusion detection framework that leverages federated deep learning to detect malicious activities in SDN environments while preserving data privacy. The proposed model integrates local anomaly detection modules deployed across distributed SDN domains with a federated aggregation mechanism, enabling collaborative training without raw data sharing. To further improve detection accuracy and adaptability, an attention-based feature extraction layer and an online model updating strategy are introduced. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark intrusion detection datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior detection performance compared to conventional centralized and distributed schemes, with improvements in accuracy, recall, and resistance to adversarial attacks. Moreover, the federated learning paradigm reduces communication overhead and ensures compliance with data confidentiality requirements. These findings highlight the potential of combining SDN programmability with federated intelligence to build resilient and privacy-preserving network intrusion defense systems."

The design and performance analysis of a CTFET-based inverter circuit utilising different material combinations-Si-Si, Si-Ge, Si-SiGe, and Si-InGaAs-are shown in this work. By using a Junctionless Double Gate TFET (JLDGTFET) model in a TCAD simulation environment, important performance parameters like as switching and Voltage Transfer Characteristics (VTC) are examined. The findings show that Si-based devices are excellent at reducing OFF-state leakage, while narrower bandgap materials, like Si-InGaAs, produce greater ON-state currents and shorter switching delays. For the design of low-power digital systems based on JLDGTFETs in the future, these insights are essential."

Additionally, we develop a class of multi-threshold event-triggered control strategies that facilitate autonomous controller updates, substantially reducing communication resource consumption. Notably, the self-triggered strategy distinguishes itself from other strategies by obviating the need for continuous real-time monitoring of the controller’s state variables. By accurately forecasting the subsequent activation instance, this strategy significantly optimizes the efficiency of the control system. Moreover, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the semi-global practical fixed-time stability (SPFTS) criterion guarantees both tracking accuracy and closed-loop stability under state constraints, with convergence time independent of initial conditions. Finally, simulation results reveal that the proposed method significantly decreases the frequency of control command updates while maintaining tracking accuracy."

Due to the presence of small biological targets, the phenomenon of biological aggregations to cause overlap and occlusion, and the limited computational resources underwater, general-purpose object detection models cannot meet the practical requirements of underwater target detection tasks. This paper improves the YOLO11 model and proposes the MCC-YOLO algorithm to address the existing specific challenges. This paper proposes a Multi-Scale Feature Extraction module-MSFC, to enhance the model's feature extraction capability. The original C2PSA module is replaced with a redesigned C2PSA_DSM module to improve the model's perception of real samples and enhance its accuracy. Additionally, a CSDC module is constructed and placed before the Head of YOLO11 to strengthen the model's dynamic perception ability. Experimental results on the DUO dataset demonstrate that compared to the YOLO11 baseline model, the MCC-YOLO algorithm achieves a 2.8 % enhancement in Precision, a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1. 1 \\%}$</tex> enhancement in Recall, a 1.8% enhancement in F1-score, and a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1. 6 \\%}$</tex> enhancement in mAP@0.5, showing superior underwater target detection performance."

    "abstract": "As the IoT has mixed and emerged rapidly, a massive spiral of data has now emerged, and the opportunities as well as challenges may be viewed as never before in contemporary computing. It has resulted in a broad set of opportunities- as well as major challenges- to existing systems. Most of this information is generated by small resources constrained devices working at the network edge, implying that we require smarter and adaptable systems which can effectively process and analyze this information. This paper makes an emphasis on integrations between Machine Learning (ML) and Cloud Computing with the IoT. The cloud may be regarded as the brain, which provides the processing power required to have high-capacity ML models trained, whereas the IoT devices are the senses, which provide information regarding the physical environment. We describe the major architectural strategies of integrating ML, IoT, and the cloud, and discuss practical examples of using smart factories and hi-tech farming to learn what this integration can accomplish in reality. Important performance indicators and actual results are also analyzed by us, not just mere theoretical concepts. Of course, there are also some challenges, and we also solve them. Finally, we consider the future of our sphere talking of such new tendencies as TinyML, federated learning, and autonomous systems, which are starting to take their toll on the next phase of progress."

    "abstract": "Mobile gambling applications constitute a significant component of the online black and grey industries. They lure users into illegal activities through covert distribution channels, causing substantial financial losses and social harm. To evade detection, these applications often employ techniques like code obfuscation, frequent domain changes, and rotating developer certificates, rendering traditional detection methods based on single-application features less effective. This paper proposes a collaborative detection framework based on machine learning, innovatively integrating multimodal contrastive learning and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNN) to achieve precise identification of gambling applications and uncover their ecosystems. Firstly, we collect mobile application samples on a large scale and utilize deep learning techniques (e.g., Transformer) to learn deep feature representations from multimodal data including APKs, domains, and certificates. Secondly, we design an association relationship modeling method based on contrastive learning to automatically learn the optimal similarity metric between gambling applications and their resources. Furthermore, we construct a heterogeneous information network comprising four types of nodes: applications, SDKs, domains, and certificates. We apply a Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HAN) for end-to-end representation learning and community discovery, accurately identifying gambling application families and their shared resource networks."

    "abstract": "This study explores the phenomenon of parity-time (PT) symmetry breaking within the polarization domain, utilizing a specially engineered metasurface exhibiting anisotropic absorption characteristics. The designed metasurface interacts asymmetrically with left- and right-circularly polarized (LCP and RCP) light, thereby demonstrating circular dichroism. By systematically tuning the coupling strength between constituent resonators, the system undergoes a phase transition at the exceptional point (EP)—a non-Hermitian degeneracy where both the eigenvalues and eigenstates coalesce into a single circularly polarized mode.This coalescence marks the transition from the PT-symmetric (unbroken) to the PT-broken phase and serves as a critical signature of the EP. Notably, the system's polarization response becomes highly sensitive near this singularity, allowing for enhanced control over polarization dynamics. Our experimental observations confirm that operating in proximity to the EP enables precise manipulation of polarization states and significantly boosts sensitivity, making the platform highly promising for thin-film sensing applications. The demonstrated ability to control and exploit polarization singularities through engineered anisotropy and resonator coupling offers a versatile route toward developing next-generation photonic sensors and polarization control devices."

While conventional European gyrotrons use Raschig rings (RR) cooling, mini-channels (MC) cooling offers superior thermal management, particularly for the 2 MW coaxial longer pulse gyrotron. Experimental campaigns at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) are based on the use of induction heating as heat source and focused on advancing MC cooling performance and testing fabrication methods, including metallic 3D printing additive technique. Calorimetric and cooling tests on a 3D-printed copper mock-up demonstrated comparable performance to conventionally manufactured designs but revealed a ~40% higher pressure drop due to surface roughness, highlighting the need for further optimization for vacuum applications. A major experimental goal was increasing the applied thermal flux to approach real gyrotron operational levels. To achieve this, two high-power induction heating devices were integrated into the test setup. These upgrades allowed for induced thermal loads over six times higher than in previous experiments. Maximum applied heating power reached 41.5 kW, achieving heat fluxes up 1 kW/cm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> based on detailed 3D electromagnetic simulations. Additionally, a vertical mechanical support was developed to improve experimental accuracy by enhancing coolant flow symmetry and replicating the typical gyrotron installation orientation. Those advancements mark a significant step toward experimentally validating advanced cooling concepts under conditions approaching real multi-MW-class gyrotron operation. Ongoing work will further refine the setup and support advanced numerical modeling, aiding the development of optimized cavity cooling solutions for future fusion applications."

However, using personal photos or artistic styles as subjects raises potential issues, such as copyright infringement and DeepFake concerns. While existing methods have made notable strides in attacking personalized models, their effectiveness remains underexplored due to a limited understanding of the inherent vulnerabilities within these models. This paper investigates the issues of ineffective gradients and inadequate global noise addition during attacks, analyzes how certain features contribute to these problems, and identifies specific vulnerable features present across different layers. We propose an Efficient Vulnerability Attack (EVA) leveraging critical features to perform efficient attack. We conducted experiments to analyze model vulnerability and identify that the output features of the cross-attention layer are the most vulnerable. Then, we developed EVA by 1) designing feature loss to guide the attack; 2) applying bi-level optimization to update the parameters of the cross-attention layer; and 3) introducing feature-guided perturbations to enhance the attack. Extensive experiments on facial and artistic style transfers demonstrate that our EVA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack performance, while exhibiting strong generalizability and robustness."

However, conducting multi-contingency simulations is notably challenging, as conventional numerical integrations are computationally intensive, while learning-based methods struggle to accommodate the extensive variability in topology, parameters, and human or automated operations. This paper develops a Physics-Data-Hybrid Mode Decomposition (HyMoD) approach for fast dynamical simulation under multiple contingencies. Contributions are fourfold: (1) An hybrid automaton-based simulation architecture is developed to depict the multi-contingency process, serving as the foundation for integrating HyMoD with multi-contingency simulation; (2) A HyMoD framework is devised to enable the iteration-free multi-contingency simulation, where physical operators respond to discrete events and the Mori–Zwanzig formalism linearly represents continuous-time dynamics via memory terms; (3) Data-free physical operators are derived, along with a physics-guided correction method that update the HyMoD operator to track the evolving dynamics; (4) On-the-fly updating and monitoring techniques are introduced to update HyMoD operators with high efficiency using incremental data and evaluate the simulation accuracy in real time. Numerical studies on real-scale systems with both synchronous generators and inverter-based resources validate the efficacy of HyMoD under diverse multi-contingency and cascading scenarios. The accuracy, efficiency, and reliability of HyMoD are demonstrated."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the performance of a reduced-order fractional dynamic model for representing a large platooning system, with a focus on the relationship between the order of a fractional model and control gains used in the platooning system. For the large platooning system we modeled, each vehicle in the system applies an identical proportional-derivative (PD) controller and only responds to the immediately preceding vehicle. We employ an optimization-based method to find the best-matched model parameters under different PD control gains. Specifically, to avoid artifacts from the optimization process, we apply a hybrid particle swarm and pattern search method to optimize the model parameters. For comparison, we use a second-order differential equation model as a benchmark against our fractional-order model. The results show an intuitive relationship between the model’s fractional order and the control gains. Specifically, increasing the proportional gain kp leads to a higher fractional order, and increasing the derivative gain kd results in a lower fractional order. Moreover, the fractional reduced-order model outperforms the integer reduced-order model when the optimal fractional order lies between 1 and 2, especially in the middle. These results have the potential to lead us to find a better reduced-order model for platooning systems and provide more insight into solving difficult control problems such as string stability."

    "abstract": "With the continuous development of industries such as wind power and construction, the weight and complexity of lifted equipment have significantly increased. These lifting tasks often rely on crawler cranes, and the demand for cooperative lifting using dual crawler cranes has grown. However, current operations remain largely manual, leading to safety risks and low efficiency. While extensive research has been conducted on the coordination of overhead cranes and other lifting systems, studies on cooperative control of crawler cranes are still in their early stages and have received insufficient attention. To address this issue, this paper establishes an accurate model of a dual crawler crane system using Lagrange equations. Motion constraints are incorporated to reduce the original fifth-order dynamics to a third-order system, simplifying control implementation. Given the strong coupling characteristics of the underactuated system, a PID-based coupled error compensation control method is proposed to regulate the load’s position and attitude precisely. By coordinating cable length adjustments, the proposed method ensures stable and accurate positioning while guaranteeing finite time convergence of cable length errors. Finally, a wind turbine installation scenario is simulated to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach."

    "abstract": "As a data center network (DCN) constructed using recursive modules, BCube enables efficient communication for decentralized machine learning systems. Its various variants, such as RCube and RRect, outperform BCube in certain performance metrics. To unify related research, BCube and its variants are integrated into a unified framework known as BCube-based DCNs (BDCN). In practical DCN deployments, efficient fault diagnosis is essential for reliability and stability. However, intermittent faults are more challenging to diagnose than permanent ones due to their randomness and uncertainty. Moreover, existing intermittent fault diagnosis algorithms generally rely on searching for the largest component, which leads to high time complexity. To address this issue, this paper systematically analyzes the intermittent fault diagnosability of BDCN under the PMC model, and proposes a fast intermittent fault diagnosis algorithm (FIFDA). The proposed algorithm significantly improves diagnosis efficiency by avoiding the need to search for the largest component. Extensive experimental results verify the applicability of FIFDA in both BDCN and other high-performance DCNs. Comparative analyses with existing algorithms show that FIFDA achieves higher diagnostic speed. Moreover, under comparable diagnosis times, FIFDA demonstrates superior diagnostic performance. In addition, simulation results demonstrate that FIFDA maintains outstanding performance in large-scale DCNs and under varying noise levels and fault probabilities, fully showcasing its efficiency and scalability in practical DCN environments."

    "abstract": "Sleep apnea is a common sleep-related condition defined by repeated pauses in respiration during sleep, which increases the risk of severe health complications. Polysomnography (PSG) is the diagnostic gold standard; however, its limited accessibility and poor suitability for long-term monitoring necessitate alternative home-based techniques. This study introduces an unconstrained sleep apnea detection system based on a convolutional vision transformer (Conv-ViT) with personalization via low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Data were collected from 121 participants who underwent PSG using a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) sensor placed underneath a mattress topper to capture unconstrained signals. The Conv-ViT model combines CNN for localized features extraction with ViT for global representation learning and was fine-tuned on PVDF signals via transfer learning from PSG-derived airflow data. For personalization, LoRA tuning was applied to reflect the individual physiological variability. The evaluation results showed that Conv-ViT outperformed standalone CNN and ViT models, achieving Cohen’s kappa (KAPPA) of 0.736 and accuracy of 0.903 on a test dataset of 61 participants. Personalization with LoRA improved the performance, increasing the mean participant-level KAPPA from 0.674 to 0.728 and the event-level KAPPA from 0.736 to 0.763. Furthermore, the model effectively classified apnea severity, achieving a KAPPA of 0.73 and an average accuracy of 0.93. These findings demonstrate that an end-to-end Conv-ViT model using unconstrained PVDF signals can reliably detect sleep apnea and assess its severity, offering scalable, long-term, and individualized home-based sleep apnea monitoring."

    "abstract": "The interaction of sugar molecules with water affects the behavior and functionality of simple and complex carbohydrates in their biochemical environments. This study reports on the hydration state of lactose, the primary sugar in milk, at mM concentration level, which is the range relevant for physiological environments. High-intensity THz-TDS using a bright source was used to measure the differential absorption coefficient and differential index of refraction of dilute lactose solutions. At the lowest concentrations investigated, lactose solutions exhibit two-component behavior, indicative of an excluded-volume effect. Above a threshold concentration, lactose molecules begin to perturb the bulk water dynamics appreciably, through the formation of hydration waters that interact strongly with the sugar molecules. The hydration number for lactose in the dilute concentration range was found to be between 14 and 17, corresponding to the primary hydration shell. This observation suggests that lactose does not significantly perturb the water molecules beyond its first hydration shell in the dilute regime, which is contrary to the long-range perturbation observed in concentrated sugar solutions."

The room is thermally controlled with an HVAC system. A first-order resistance-capacitance (RC) model is used to characterize the thermal behavior of the room. The multi-objective problem is solved using a scalarization method, which leads to a constrained quadratic programming (QP) problem. Simulations are carried out over a four-day period, considering dynamic electricity pricing and thermal inertia effects. The results demonstrate how increasing the thermal parameters of the room affects the thermal response and cost minimization. The study identifies optimal HVAC operation strategies that use the building’s thermal storage.

Though the current ensemble CNNs have more than 99% accuracy in diagnosing glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and other retinal diseases, scalability and interpretability remain problematic. This paper presents a novel hybrid quantum–classical approach that combines quantum feature encoding with ensemble CNNs optimised to improve diagnostic accuracy and lower computational burden. The new model exhibits higher feature extraction efficiency and noise robustness than traditional architectures. Through the use of quantum state representations, the system enables better decision-making, prediction, and personalised therapy suggestions. Integrated automated analysis of behaviour in this system also supports real-time identification and adaptive treatment planning.In general, the main innovation is the integration of quantum encoding and ensembles of deep learning for the classification of ophthalmic disease, providing a scalable avenue toward intelligent, real-time healthcare analysis."

Despite the existence of several theoretical papers on the topic, including ours, there are still open questions concerning e.g. proper modeling of the so-called restoring current or the role of depolarization (screening of incident field) and plasmon resonance. Resolution of the outlined issues is significant not only for interpretation of the linear response but becomes crucial when dealing with non-linearities in which different spectral components mix together. To this end, we present our latest results on development of a quantum model of a nanostructure which describes electron relaxation kinetics on a microscopic quantum-mechanical level beyond the Lindblad form and takes into consideration also screening of the external field by dielectric material and free electrons. We discuss the importance of consideration of the charge quantization in nanostructures which is connected not only with the excitonic effect but defines also an additional effective potential for electron motion. We solved the model numerically, including solution of the self-consistent problem of coupling of electrons to the external field. Our numerical simulations reveal a complexity of the plasmon resonance which then cannot be overlooked by means of any theoretical analysis."

    "abstract": "Format-based steganography is more widely used than other text steganography techniques because it exploits document formatting features, such as fonts, spacing, and tags, to embed information with higher capacity and better imperceptibility. This approach is more robust against other text steganography techniques, making it a preferred choice for secure and covert communication. Unfortunately, several studies have explored increasing the capacity of embedding but have failed to maintain imperceptibility and robustness. This study aims to address these problems by proposing a novel perword embedding in data-* attribute of HTML. Based on the result, the problems have been successfully overcome by the proposed approach. This was demonstrated by its capability to increase capacity by 48 bits per embedding location without compromising on invisibility and durability, while the previous method was only 4 bits. The improved imperceptibility was reflected in its subtle visual impact and reduced overhead, as recognized by fellow programmers. Furthermore, the proposed method exhibited greater robustness, remaining resilient against the effects of the minification process."

Detecting fraudulent transactions in real-time is challenging due to the prevalence of valid transactions and the infrequency of fraud within the entire dataset. Moreover, offenders continually alter their methods. This work established the feasibility of developing an ensemble system utilizing machine learning algorithms, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Boost, integrated with the soft voting classifier for the detection of credit card fraud. The algorithms were utilized on both authentic transaction data and generated data to assess their performance according to several metrics, including precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. The experimental results indicated that the ensemble-enhanced outcomes are relatively higher than singular algorithm predictions, reducing false positives while augmenting real positives. This technology is a reliable and adaptable instrument designed to identify probable fraud situations for banks and financial organizations, safeguarding their clients' assets."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the history and evolution of Electron Cyclotron Emission Imaging (ECEI) systems, from its first applications in the mid 1990-ies until the present. ECEI has emerged as a transformative diagnostic tool for magnetically confined fusion plasmas, providing 2D measurements of electron temperature fluctuations with high resolution (centimeter-scale, and microsecond). Deployed globally on major fusion devices (e.g., ASDEX-Upgrade, DIII-D, KSTAR, EAST), ECEI has enabled critical studies of plasma instabilities, including sawtooth crashes, edge-localized modes (ELMs), and energetic particle driven instabilities. Recent breakthroughs with millimeter-wave system-on-chip technology applications have significantly enhanced ECEI performance, achieving 400× higher signal gain, 85% lower noise, and a 2000× footprint reduction. The 2024 development of radiation-hardened GaN-based receiver chips further ensures compatibility with reactor harsh environments. Additionally, AI-driven analysis has expanded ECEI’s diagnostic capabilities, enabling early disruption prediction, plasma shape detection, and locked mode identification with greater accuracy than the conventional diagnostics. These advancements position millimeter-wave diagnostics as the key for next-generation fusion reactors, meeting demands for compact integration, neutron tolerance, and real-time stability control. Future developments will focus on further optimizing ECEI for Fusion Pilot Plant (FPP) applications, solidifying its role in enabling stable, high-performance plasmas."

    "abstract": "Multi-view point cloud registration remains a significant challenge in 3D computer vision due to the sensitivity to outliers. In this paper, we propose a clustering multi-view point cloud registration algorithm based on kernel mean p-power error (KMPE) loss function. Firstly, the 3D point clouds are clustered by using the K-means algorithm, where the centroids of the clusters are regarded as the model point cloud for multi-view point cloud registration. Secondly, the model point cloud is used to estimate the rigid transformation of each point cloud sequentially. Considering that the KMPE loss function can efficiently suppress outliers, a robust point cloud rigid registration optimization model based on the KMPE loss function is established. The Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm is adopted to optimize the optimization model to obtain the optimal rigid transformation between each point cloud and the model point cloud. Finally, the clustering and KMPE-based rigid transformation estimation are iteratively and alternatively applied to all point clouds to realize multi-view point cloud registration. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively suppress the influence of outliers on the multi-view point cloud registration of, and can achieve high accuracy of multi-view point cloud registration."

Since the input affine model formulated has no full relative degree, a diffeomorphic transformation is performed to reduce the internal dynamics to an integration of the steering speed of the vehicle. We then introduce a Lyapunov candidate to ensure asymptotic stability. Incorporating this Lyapunov function, the resulting input-output linearized system is stabilized with a model predictive control (MPC) scheme. The new internal dynamics is posed as equality constraints in the feedback linearized MPC framework. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a satisfactory control performance and takes a significant lower computation time in comparison to a nonlinear MPC based on the original model."

    "abstract": "Proper credit scoring is also crucial for controlling financial risks and targeting customers in the financial technology (FinTech) industry. Although conventional statistical modeling has always been the modeling choice, its successor, modern machine learning (ML) algorithms, demonstrates more outstanding predictive power. However, these models often involve a trade-off between predictive accuracy and interpretability. This study contrasts the results of three well-known ML models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The tools were applied to a real-life dataset of a financial institution, namely, personal loan data. The evaluation metrics used were accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Area Under the Curve (AUC), receiver operating characteristic. According to the results, XGBoost achieves the highest overall performance, with an impressive accuracy of 98.5% and a recall score of 96.9%. Close behind was Random Forest with its competitive performance. Logistic Regression provided better interpretability, but it was not as accurate as recall. This weak point suggests that more people who could actually be creditworthy will be discounted as applicants. These insights enable practitioners to make informed decisions about the most suitable ML methods to adopt in credit scoring tasks, particularly where accuracy and sensitivity are key considerations. In addition, the current analysis will establish a performance reference that will be useful when attempting to enhance transparency and fairness in future credit decision processes driven by AI."

A three-dimensional kinematic model defines a line-of-sight masking metric under motion, timing, and spacing constraints, and a computational framework centered on particle swarm optimization is developed. The framework progressively enriches PSO with genetic mutation and adaptive learning (for multi-munition scheduling) and with chaos-mapped inertia, Gaussian mutation, and hash-table memoization (for multi-UAV coordination), while a union-overlap procedure aggregates discontinuous masking intervals. Across staged scenarios, the approach attains masking durations of 1.4 s (fixed-parameter baseline), 4.80 s (single munition optimization), 7.40 s (three munitions), and 13.20 s (three UAVs), with stable convergence and efficient runtimes under strict feasibility checks. The result is a practical and robust trajectory–timing optimizer that generalizes to countermeasure scheduling problems requiring fast, constraint-aware search in high-dimensional spaces."

However, these models' computational burden, energy consumption, and memory footprint pose significant challenges for distributed and pervasive systems. In this paper, we propose HiPOD, a hierarchical pruning framework designed to prune low-distinction and multi-scale object detection models by jointly learning layer-wise and path-wise pruning strategies. HiPOD balances the accuracy-efficiency trade-off through two novel components: Layer-Adaptive Ratio Learning, named AdaLR, which leverages network structural characteristics and a reinforcement learning-based action-feedback mechanism to adaptively generate balanced layer-wise pruning ratios; and Genetic Path Optimization, named GenPath, which employs crossover and mutation operations to optimize inter-layer kernel pruning paths, preserving critical semantic and spatial information. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HiPOD, with only a 3 % drop in mAP50 and a 2 % drop in mAP50:95 compared to the full models. The ablation studies and impact analysis further validate the effectiveness of each module and highlight the robustness of our framework. Furthermore, evaluations on an edge device demonstrate the practicality of the proposed solution for powerline inspection."

    "abstract": "The manual interpretation of magnetic resonance imaging to identify the presence of cerebral tumors is still a time-consuming and objective task, which in most cases leads to diagnostic delay. To overcome this shortcoming, the current study is initiating a hybrid deep-learning model, which advances in unity with its blended state-of-the-art models, thus making unassisted and precision diagnosis of cerebral tumors. The framework suggested is designed with the help of a three-stage pipeline. A Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) is used first to implement data augmentation and modality synthesis effectively by increasing the limited training corpus with the created realistic synthetic magnetic resonance images. This is followed by an application of a U-Net architecture, which performs high-accuracy pixel-wise segmentation and, therefore, localizes the tumor area and describes a region of interest that entraps non-lethal background data. Finally, the obtained region of interest is classified in a set of DenseNet-121 and VGG16 convolutional neural networks. Their predictions amplitude is then combined to present the final diagnostic result using an ensemble-learning module with more weight given to DenseNet-121 due to its excellent success in terms of feature-extraction capabilities. It is expected that the system will reach a 98% classification accuracy with a high accuracy and recall rate, which highlights the potential of the system as a powerful decision support system that can be utilized to speed up diagnosis and improve patient outcomes in clinical care."

The paper adopts the approaches of utilizing mechanical devices to reduce the position of the coils to lower the vertical distance between the coils and covering the roads with coils to lower the lateral distance between the coils, conducts simulation experiments, draws the conclusion that the approaches can increase the efficiency of energy transmission between the coils in electric vehicles with wireless charging capabilities and the coils on the roads, and finally increase the wireless charging efficiency. The approach of installing wireless charging coils inside the wheels may become one of the ways to optimize the wireless charging technology for electric vehicles."

Historically databases are of various kinds, such as relational, non-relational, and cloud databases. With the HTML5 standardization, local or session-based storage databases have become more popular that are directly included in web browsers. While client-side storage has its advantages like offline usage and server computation offloading, it also has its own drawbacks, such as the need for local space dependency. Historic server-side databases still enjoy scalability advantages.Within this review paper, we examine the performance of client-side local storage databases (IndexedDB and LocalStorage) in Google Chrome 134. We also compare it with server-side databases, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, and the non-relational database MongoDB. Our test cases consist of the most prevalent create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations. Recognizing these differences in performance is important, since optimizing where data is located will yield a better-performing application with seamless user interaction. This comparison hopes to assist developers in choosing the correct database, since the selection ultimately lies with the size and needs of the application."

    "abstract": "Accurate day-ahead forecasting of photovoltaic (PV) power output is critical for ensuring the stability and economic operation of modern power grids. This paper proposes a multi-stage, hybrid forecasting framework designed to enhance prediction accuracy through a systematic integration of physical modeling and advanced machine learning techniques. Firstly, a theoretical power output model based on solar geometry and system parameters was established as an analytical baseline. This model revealed that the actual output is approximately 72% of the theoretical maximum, with distinct and predictable seasonal variations. Secondly, a backpropagation (BP) neural network optimized by the novel GOOSE Algorithm (GOOSE-BP) was developed for time-series prediction. It achieved a goodness-of-fit R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> of 0.91223 and significantly outperformed the traditional BP model by maintaining prediction errors in a tight band around zero. Thirdly, the model’s predictive power was augmented by incorporating numerical weather prediction (NWP) variables, which were systematically selected based on a Random Forest feature importance analysis. This enhancement elevated the model’s R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> to 0.95445. A scenario classification model further demonstrated robust performance under distinct weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, and overcast). Finally, a spatial downscaling feature construction model was implemented to refine the resolution of meteorological inputs, which, when coupled with a multi-model ensemble (GOOSE-BP, XGBoost, Random Forest), further reduced prediction errors. The optimized GOOSE-BP model achieved a final Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.0498 and an R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> of 0.9716.

Sentiment forecasting is carried out with the help of an LSTM model, which proves to be excellent in the capture of how things evolve with time. A real-time sentiment analysis interactive application is developed and users can classify reviews and even evaluate how models perform.

In response, NIST has standardized three foundational PQC algorithms: Module-lattice-based Key-encapsulation Mechanism for key establishment; Module-lattice-based Digital Signature, and Stateless Hash-based Digital Signature algorithms for digital signatures. Meanwhile, FALCON and Hamming Quasi-cyclic (HQC) schemes, both selected as finalists, are expected to join the standards soon. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of these NIST-selected PQC standards, with a dual focus on software implementations and hardware architecture designs. We analyze their mathematical frameworks, distinctive features, and optimization strategies related to performance, security, and resource efficiency. The software review examines algorithmic complexity, memory usage, and programming considerations, while the hardware review discusses FPGA and ASIC implementations, emphasizing modular arithmetic, polynomial operations, and resource efficiency challenges. A comparative analysis highlights the strengths and trade-offs of each algorithm, offering insights into their applicability across various platforms-from resource-constrained internet of things devices to high-performance computing environments. This study provides a foundational understanding of NIST’s selected PQC standards and their practical deployment in securing the post-quantum era."

Moreover, the controller achieves the desired separation between the dynamic and kinematic loops even in the presence of time-varying control coefficients. This separation simplifies controller synthesis and stability analysis and reduces conservatism in controller-gain selection caused by loop coupling. Finally, the asymptotic convergence of the task-space tracking error is established via the Lyapunov stability theory.

These inconsistencies significantly impede the advancement of the field. To address this issue, we introduce MERBench, a unified evaluation benchmark for multimodal emotion recognition. Our goal is to assess the contributions of several key techniques commonly used in prior studies, such as feature selection, multimodal fusion, robustness analysis, fine-tuning, and pre-training.

In addition, we present a new emotion dataset, MER2023, specifically designed for the Chinese language environment. This dataset serves as a benchmark for research in multi-label learning, noise robustness, and semi-supervised learning. and encourage researchers to evaluate their algorithms under the same experimental setup as MERBench for fair comparisons."

Employing a heterostructure made of platinum, a ferromagnet, and a canted antiferromagnet, we demonstrate anisotropic control over these spin-wave bands through spin currents with three-dimensional spin polarizations, covering both resonant and propagating modes. By developing a coupled pendulum model, we establish that the efficiency of frequency modulation is inversely related to the effective potential energy determined by the anisotropy and DM interaction energies. Additionally, by utilizing the confined geometry of our system, we investigate the potential for controlling spin waves across a broad spectral range from tens of gigahertz to sub-terahertz frequencies. Our findings highlight the potential for creating a terahertz wave source with electrical tunability, which could significantly enhance ultrafast, broadband, and wireless communication technologies."

Dissipativity properties are shaped from available input/output trajectories in a data-based manner, to be fault-sensitive (i.e., no longer efficient during fault occurrences). The dissipative properties are determined offline through the solution of an optimization problem, then applied online to design a monitoring algorithm that only involves verifying the inequalities of the input/output trajectories.

    "abstract": "To guarantee the safe operation of electricity grids, insulators on transmission lines must be inspected on a regular basis. The following issues are now the principal obstacles to insulator defect detection: complex detection background, small target size leading to high false negative rates, and existing algorithms struggling to balance precision of identification and performance in real time. In this work, a lightweight insulator defect detection method based on the improved YOLOv11 is presented: HGNet-YOLO. Firstly, the lightweight feature extraction backbone network is an improved SC-HGNetV2. The convolutional modules in the neck network are replaced with lightweight average pooling downsampling ADown modules in order to reduce the amount of parameters in the model. Secondly, to improve the model's capacity to extract features from complicated backdrops, a hybrid multi-scale depth-enhanced fast pyramid module called HMDSPPF-SE is built. The issue of small target feature loss is then successfully resolved by integrating the MSDA attention method into the tiny target detection layer. The Shape-IoU loss function is ultimately presented with the intention of resolving the issues of CIoU's poor adaptability to complex backdrops and sensitivity to minute target position changes. Experimental findings on the built insulator dataset FBDID show that this strategy improves the mAP(0.5) by 3 percentage points, reduces the parameter count by 21.0%, and enhances the accuracy and recall rates by 2.2% and 2.8%, respectively, compared to the original model. Compared to other widely used object detection models, this model strikes a better balance between detection accuracy and lightweight, satisfying the deployment requirements of edge computing devices."

    "abstract": "To enhance multi-load prediction accuracy in integrated energy systems, this paper proposes a load prediction method based on CDA-SynFusion and CPO-VMD, aiming to innovate from three levels: anomaly point identification, feature mining and modal decoupling. First, a CDA-SynFusion (Cross-Domain Adaptive Synergistic Feature Fusion) preprocessing framework is constructed, where a multivariate synergistic anomaly detection algorithm combines temporal fluctuation patterns, load synchrony constraints, and holiday effects to accurately identify and correct outliers, ensuring high-quality input data. Second, a cross-domain temporal feature screening and fusion mechanism is developed to dynamically quantify the correlation between load and meteorological domains, enabling the construction of a feature matrix with strong representational capability. Finally, the CPO (Crested Porcupine Optimizer) is introduced to adaptively optimize key VMD parameters, eliminating empirical dependency and achieving precise decoupling of cross-domain multi-frequency components. Experimental results verify that the proposed CDA-SynFusion-CPO-VMD framework significantly improves prediction accuracy across electrical, cooling, and heating loads, demonstrating its effectiveness in data preprocessing and modal decomposition, as well as its strong applicability to integrated energy system forecasting."

In the proposed scenario the UGV dynamics incorporates exogenous disturbances to capture real-world uncertainties, making the control problem nontrivial. The RNMPC foresees the solution of a min-max optimal control problem, where the goal is to optimize the control input to be delivered to the single UGV in the worst-case scenario. To this end, the Pontryagin-based min-max problem can be viewed as a zero-sum differential game, where the two players are the control input and the uncertainty whose solution is the Nash equilibrium. Additionally, collision avoidance for UGV is enforced through the implementation of artificial potential fields. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control technique have been assessed by means of numerical simulations."

However, optimizing trajectories to maximize coverage while ensuring fairness and minimizing energy consumption remains challenging.

We propose Multi-Modal Dynamic Edge-featured Graph Attention Network (MM-DEGAT), a novel deep reinforcement learning framework that integrates image-based spatial distributions and graph-structured topological relations. Our approach includes: (1) a dynamic edge-featured mechanism for modeling relationships within the network, (2) bi-directional cross-attention for deep image-graph integration, and (3) adaptive gated fusion for dynamic multi-modal weighting. Experiments demonstrate improved communication efficiency and fairness, validating MMDEGAT's effectiveness for UAV coverage applications."

    "abstract": "Well-being in family settings involves subtle psychological dynamics that conventional metrics often , overlook. In particular, unconscious parental expectations termed ideal parent bias, can suppress children’s emotional expression and autonomy. This suppression, referred to as suppressed emotion, often stems from well-meaning but value-driven communication, which is hard to detect or address from outside the family context. Focusing on these latent dynamics, this study explores Large Language Model (LLM)-based support for psychologically safe family communication. We constructed a Japanese parent–child dialogue corpus of 30 scenarios, each annotated with metadata on ideal parent bias and suppressed emotion. Based on this corpus, we developed a role-playing LLM-based multi-agent dialogue support framework that analyzes dialogue and generates feedback. Specialized agents detect suppressed emotion, describe implicit ideal parent bias in parental speech, and infer contextual attributes such as the child’s age and background. A meta-agent compiles these outputs into a structured report, which is then passed to five selected expert agents. These agents collaboratively generate empathetic and actionable feedback through a structured four-step discussion process. Experiments show that the system can detect categories of suppressed emotion with reasonable discrimination, and produce feedback rated highly in empathy and practicality. Moreover, simulated follow-up dialogues incorporating this feedback exhibited signs of improved emotional expression and mutual understanding, suggesting the framework’s potential to support positive transformation in family interactions."

    "abstract": "To address the problems of increased network loss and enhanced operational vulnerability in distribution networks under high-penetration distributed photovoltaics (PV) integration, a two-layer optimization model of \"upper-layer energy storage capacity configuration and lower-layer charging/discharging scheduling\" is proposed. The upper layer takes minimizing the rated capacity of energy storage as the goal, derives the capacity calculation formula, and determines the optimal installation location and capacity. The lower layer aims to minimize the active network loss and operational vulnerability of the distribution network, constructs a vulnerability assessment index integrating voltage deviation and branch thermal stability, and optimizes the 24-hour charging/discharging power of energy storage. Global constraints include power balance, power flow constraints, PV output characteristics, and energy storage charging/discharging limitations. The upper layer adopts the improved Beetle Antennae Search (IBAS) algorithm, which enhances optimization accuracy and convergence speed through adaptive step size and local search enhancement. The lower layer uses the adaptive Genetic Algorithm (AGA), which solves the problems of local optimality and slow convergence of traditional algorithms with adaptive crossover and mutation probabilities. Simulation verification on the IEEE 33-bus system shows that this two-layer optimization strategy can minimize the cost of energy storage configuration while significantly reducing the distribution network loss, improving voltage quality, and lowering the thermal stability risk. It provides theoretical support for the energy storage planning and operation of distribution networks."

This model is an inherently unstable, nonlinear, and multivariable system with coupling effects between two axes. Due to the mentioned characteristics, helicopter control remains a challenging problem, especially in the presence of external disturbances, parameter perturbation and model uncertainties. In order to overcome some of these difficulties, we developed a second order sliding mode controller based on the super-twisting algorithm (STSMC). It represents a modification of the standard SMC with the aim of improving its control capabilities. The effectiveness and robustness of the used STSMC were verified through simulations and experiments. The results obtained were compared with the same achieved by a previously developed PID and adaptive controllers. The STSMC significantly outperforms the PID controller and additionally improves the efficiency of the used adaptive controller in terms of stability of the system, tracking error, and overall control performance in the presence of system uncertainties and coupling effects between two axes, the azimuth and elevation."

When it comes to spectral graph convolutional networks (GCNs), directed graphs suffer from the asymmetric nature of their Laplacian matrices. For such graphs, there is no natural extension of the spectral graph theory well-established for their undirected analogues with inherent symmetric matrices. In this paper, we propose i-DGCN: a spectral GCN approach addressing directed graphs by means of a novel symmetric Laplacian matrix constructed using a quantification of the interaction between the nodes. In order to assess i-DGCN, we undertake two tasks: anomaly detection for graph-structured data (unsupervised) and graph link existence prediction (supervised). Then, we compare the results with other Laplacian alternatives for directed graphs."

    "abstract": "Open-phase fault is a common fault in motor drives and occurs as the phase winding is disconnected or one leg of the converter bridge fails, which may generate significant torque ripple and reduce the output torque of the motor. To enhance the reliability of the system, this article proposes a two-step online diagnosis strategy for open-phase faults in doubly salient electromagnetic motor (DSEM) drives. In the first step, the occurrence of open-phase fault is detected based on the variation of active phase currents under normal and fault conditions. In the second step, the differentiation of two fault types (phase-winding open-circuit faults and two-switch open-circuit faults in the same bridge leg) as well as the localization of the fault phase winding can be realized by analyzing the variation of the zero-sequence voltage component (ZSVC) in the fault sector. And combined with the two-phase energization characteristic of the DSEM, the fault bridge leg can be localized based on the changes of the working phase currents within the fault sector and its subsequent sector. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is experimentally verified on a 12/8-pole DSEM system."

The model accounts for multiple Bismuth active centers (BACs), treated as independent dopants with distinct spectroscopic properties, and incorporates an automatic optimization routine that iteratively refines uncertain input parameters by fitting simulations to experimental data. This approach allows accurate modeling of BAC dynamics while compensating for incomplete or uncertain input data on the characteristics of the different active centers. The model is validated through comparison with experimental results for BDFAs based on phosphosilicate and germanosilicate fibers operating in the O-, O+E-, and E-bands, showing excellent agreement for both gain and noise figure spectra under different pumping conditions. The proposed framework significantly improves the predictive accuracy of BDFA simulations and provides a practical tool for the design and optimization of next-generation wideband optical fiber amplifiers."

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) refers to a complicated neurodevelopmental disorder that influences social interaction, verbal communication, and adaptability of behaviour. This is important because early diagnosis can greatly enhance the long-term. Nonetheless, conventional machine learning methods and traditional approaches to diagnosis are prone to redundancy of attributes, high dimensionality, reduced generalization, and lower diagnostic accuracy. To overcome the difficulties, the current research proposes an ASD detector in the form of Light GBM. As the primary dataset, the ASD Children Traits Dataset, which comprises Behavioral indicators and demographic information, is utilized. During the preprocessing phase, numerical variables are normalized to stabilize and accelerate convergence. The extraction of features is used to realize the underlying Behavioral patterns. Further, the feature selection procedure is applied to extract the most informative features (Sequential Feature Selection (SFS). This helps to reduce redundancy of features and to increase their interpretability. Lastly, LightGBM was used as a classifier option, including Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB) and Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS) to easily work with structured data. The experimental assessment showed good performance with an accuracy of 0.99 %, precision of 1.0 %, recall of 0.99%, F1-score of 0.99 %, and ROC-AUC of 1.0%. These findings substantiate that LightGBM has better predictive performance and can be regarded as an advanced and highly reliable predictive instrument to detect ASD in its initial stages."

    "abstract": "In federated news recommendation, representing each news with a single embedding entangles shared semantics with user-specific preference shifts, which weakens personalization under non-IID users and strains communication when catalogs are large. To address this problem, we introduce FedDEN, a Dual News-Embedding framework that cleanly disentangles the two roles of item representation: a server-maintained global embedding captures cross-user semantics, while a lightweight client residual captures user-dependent deviations only where needed. Based on this core and tailored to the peculiarities of news recommendation, we attach two targeted mechanisms: (i) a minimal cold-start bias that substitutes residuals when histories are scarce, enabling immediate participation without extra rounds; and (ii) an alignment-and-sparsity regularization that keeps residuals complementary to the global table while promoting a compact, communicable global news embedding via proximal updates. Experiments on three real world datasets show consistent gains over strong centralized and federated baselines on metrics, together with robust behavior under cold-start settings, and favorable per-round communication. By solving the conflation of shared semantics and user-specific shifts at its source, FedDEN achieves strong personalization with practical efficiency. Specifically, it outperforms centralized baseline NRMS by 13.61 % and FedRec by 15.59 %."

Yet, the interaction experience between humans and VLMs is degraded by the high latency in such cloud-edge collaboration applications. The latency is caused by both the video transmission process and the heavy VLM inference process. We propose SwiftReTaKe, a two-round transmission framework coupled with a low-latency pre-pruning strategy to reduce both network and inference latency. By first sending keyframes for relevance estimation and then adaptively transmitting informative frames, SwiftReTaKe minimizes data transfer and LLM computation.

However, detecting audio-video deepfakes remains challenging: forgery traces are often subtle, dispersed, and highly resolution-dependent; existing multimodal methods rely on simple concatenation or shallow interactions, leading to insufficient exploitation of cross-modal consistency. To address these issues, we propose a Cross-level Multi-modal Fusion (CLMF) framework that progressively integrates audio cues into visual representations through cross-level attention, adaptively enhancing complementary information while suppressing redundancy. In addition, we design an Adaptive Audio Feature Enhancement module (AAFE) to highlight subtle frequencydomain artifacts often masked by noise, and a Multi-scale Visual Feature Enhancement module (MVFE) to capture both local texture inconsistencies and global structural distortions. These components jointly achieve robust and consistent cross-modal alignment of forgery traces, leading to significant improvements in deepfake detection performance. On the FakeAVCeleb benchmark, AURORA achieves an accuracy (ACC) of 94.32% and an area under the curve (AUC) of 93.66%, demonstrating superior performance."

To address these challenges, this paper originally proposes a novel mixed-frequency magnetic data representation learning-based framework (MixLoc) for accurate and universal localization. Our core idea is to systematically model the multi-scale dynamics-affected pedestrian indoor localization as a location-semantic learning problem based on mixed-frequency magnetic data. First, we propose a data augmentation method to automatically construct a mixed-frequency magnetic dataset. Then, we propose a novel encoder to learn temporal and spatial representations from these data and extract subtle differences among multi-scale sequences. Finally, a novel localization model is proposed to accurately infer locations by capturing significant global and local features from both temporal and spatial representations. The evaluation results based on comprehensive experiments show that the accuracy of MixLoc increases about 42% compared to other state-of-the-art approaches."

    "abstract": "Modern mobile devices now support increasingly complex, interactive applications that demand both low-latency frame rendering and energy efficiency. However, current Android CPU governors and schedulers react only to coarse CPU-utilization and ignore dynamic inter-thread dependencies and the computation demand of frame rendering, therefore, often fail to provide timely CPU resources, leading to missed frame deadlines or unnecessary energy consumption. To bridge this semantic gap, we propose Argus, a lightweight, kernel-integrated framework that dynamically identifies UI-critical threads based on real-time inter-thread interactions, and boosts their priority to ensure responsive user experiences. Furthermore, it incorporates a frame-aware CPU governor that adjusts frequency decisions based on frame deadlines and critical thread load. Comprehensive evaluations on popular mobile applications demonstrate that Argus can reduce the number of frame drops by up to 76.2 % and improve energy efficiency by up to 17.2 % compared to existing CPU governors, with negligible runtime overhead."

The algorithm was evaluated on bioimpedance measurements of ex vivo prostate tissue, where it achieved an AUROC of 0.84 in detecting cancerous regions of 2.33 mm or larger. The proposed AFE and algorithm would occupy an estimated chip area of $4 \\mathrm{~mm}^{2}$, which is small enough for integration into an SMA probe head.

The emulator integrates a separately excited DC motor (SEDCM), a four-quadrant DC-DC converter, a battery emulator, and a mechanical load emulator. The system models tractive effort, aerodynamic drag, and gradient resistance using Newton’s second law. In contrast to conventional graphical modeling tools (e.g., block diagrams and bond graphs), the adopted Energetic Macroscopic Representation (EMR) framework offers clear advantages by explicitly representing energy interactions and facilitating the systematic derivation of control structures. A control strategy developed within this framework governs energy flow across the powertrain, enabling accurate speed control via armature voltage regulation. Experimental tests conducted on a Lucas-Nülle test bench show strong correlation with simulation results. The study also introduces a methodology to compute the maximum admissible vehicle mass—determined to be 13.5 kg for a 180 W motor operating at 1900 rpm—based on acceleration and slope constraints. Furthermore, a switching algorithm for the bidirectional converter ensures reliable four-quadrant operation. Overall, the proposed framework provides a scalable and effective approach for EV emulation, control design, and energy management validation."

    "abstract": "The message routing protocol is essential for the efficient delivery of messages in Delay/Disruption-tolerant networks (DTNs). Messages dispatched by a mobile node are transmitted in a Store-Carry-Forward fashion between mobile nodes in Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs). Current protocols comprise the behavior of mobile nodes, connection data, and movement models to enhance their mechanisms for message exchange during encounters. PRoPHET is one of the protocols attracting attention. It computes the likelihood of encountering other nodes and the message’s destination to regulate message forwarding. When the probability of an encounter diverges from the actual encounter, it cannot transmit messages effectively. We propose LH-PRoPHET, an enhancement of PRoPHET, that not only utilizes the encounter frequency for controlling message forwarding, but also takes into account the trajectory prediction based on the position history of encountered nodes. This approach seeks to maximize node coverage by transferring messages to nodes moving in divergent directions, hence enhancing the delivery ratio without increasing resource expenditure. Our simulation findings indicate that LH-PRoPHET markedly enhances the delivery ratio and latency while concurrently decreasing resource consumption."

Most of the institutions plan and arrange the examination process like examination schedule, faculty details, availability of rooms, etc. manually which results in excessive wastage of time and manpower. A digital solution is needed to streamline the process, improve transparency, and reduce administrative workload. Hence, this system adopts greedy algorithm that develops an invigilation application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. It automates several tasks, including assignment and monitoring of invigilation duties to the faculties. The system offers a streamlined workflow for administrators and faculty through a role-based access mechanism. Administrators perform key tasks such as user registration, login, and duty assignment, while faculty can securely access their individual invigilation schedules. Security is enhanced through Secure JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication which ensures that only the authorized users will be able to access the protected resources. All communication between frontend and backend is handled via Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interfaces (RESTful APIs), ensuring seamless data flow and real-time updates. This system replaces traditional manual processes with a centralized digital platform that reduces human errors, improves scheduling accuracy, and saves significant administrative effort. Overall, it enhances operational efficiency, accountability, and transparency in academic exam management."

Based on the derived model, the key system parameters can be accurately estimated in real time, by simply sampling the primary compensation capacitor voltage and the input voltage. This method eliminates the need for bilateral communication and causes zero interference on normal system operation as no prior or special actions are required.

The recent advance from multi-modal learning provides a new dimension of fusing visual and timeseries sensor data. Although multimodality offers a more holistic view of the environment, it introduces potential conflicts from physical dynamics that conventional fusion methods could simply overlook. This paper identifies and addresses two such challenges: (1) Multimodal Temporal Conflict, which arises when static visual cues correspond to dynamic <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{CO}_{2}$</tex> changes; (2) Cross-Modal Causal Lag, which stems from the physical inertia of air volume that delays the sensor's response to occupancy changes. To address these challenges, we propose a novel physics-informed fusion framework to mitigate inconsistencies during transient physical states and model the time-varying delay between visual events and their corresponding <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{CO}_{2}$</tex> responses.

    "abstract": "Accurate path tracking is one of the main challenges autonomous vehicles have to deal with. It is known that, when dealing with real hardware systems, the presence of parametric uncertainty and unmodelled aspects of the system dynamics affects all model-based control approaches, hindering their nominal performance guarantees. To compensate for this issue, data-driven schemes have drawn significant attention from the scientific community thanks to their inherent ability to learn from experience, thus automatically compensate for system uncertainties and time-varying behaviours. This work aims to develop a reinforcement learning-based longitudinal and lateral dynamics control introducing mismatch and motion penalization metrics, validating the resulting controller in a simulated Formula SAE skid-test scenario employing the Sapienza Fast Charge Formula SAE Electric Racing Team dynamical model."

    "abstract": "The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has emerged as a key enabler of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), IoV faces significant challenges in scalability and security. The growing volume of real-time vehicular data strains network resources, and traditional centralized architectures introduce single points of failure that compromise reliability and data integrity. This paper investigates the integration of IOTA-a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based distributed ledger designed for feeless and scalable transactions-into the IoV system. In the proposed architecture, vehicles operate as lightweight nodes and roadside units function as full nodes, yielding a resource-efficient architecture for secure, tamper-resistant data interaction across vehicular networks. We formally model the latency of transaction propagation and consensus confirmation phases to gain insight into its performance characteristics under high concurrency. We conducted extensive simulations under diverse traffic conditions on a private IOTAenabled vehicular network. Experimental results demonstrate that the IOTA-based IoV system achieves low latency on the order of a few milliseconds and high throughput of hundreds of transactions per second even as vehicle density increases. The system exhibits strong scalability and operational stability, indicating considerable potential for deployment in real-world ITS environments."

The Lithium-ion batteries are very desirable because of their better energy density and long cycle life. Single-phase and non-interleaved converters, which are conventional and linked to fixed CC-CV algorithms have poor energy management, large current ripple, slow charging, and high battery loss rates. In this paper, the interleaved Sepic converter is suggested to be used with an Model Predictive Control (MPC) and a 48 V, 10 Ah Li-ion pack. The converter has an interleaved structure that decreases current ripple, thermal stress and the adaptive algorithm self-adjusts current and voltage set points using real-time state-of-charge (SOC) and temperature feedbacks. The use of MATLAB/Simulink to simulate the proposed charger indicates that the charger would take 23 minutes to charge 50 percent SOC, 37 minutes to charge 80 percent SOC and 56 minutes to charge fully, a 11 percent improvement over the results of CC-CV systems. The findings show that converter topology and algorithm co-design results in fast, safe, and efficient charging that makes them appropriate to the futuristic urban EV charging system."

Neuromorphic computing offers a promising alternative by leveraging biologically inspired neural models-such as Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) that emulate the key dynamics of neural computation. In this paper, we introduce a modeling approach grounded in biological data recorded from live neurons using multi-electrode arrays (MEA). We evaluate LIF and conductancebased LIF models using the MEA data to capture biologically realistic dynamics for machine learning applications. To asses performance, we developed and compared a conductance-based temporal LIF reservoir with a biologically inspired recurrent neural network (RNN) tailored for spatiotemporal classification. Using the same $5 \\times 3$ spatial input layout, the conductive LIF reservoir introduced a more dynamic architecture. With 100 neurons, it achieved 61% accuracy and a loss of approximately 0.23. Scaling the reservoir up to 1000 neurons reduced the loss to 0.15 and increased accuracy to 80%, demonstrating an enhanced ability to capture fine-grained temporal features. To benchmark performance, we employed a memristor-based hardware reservoir, which achieved up to 93% accuracy in multiclass and 95% in binary MNIST digit classification. These results demonstrate the promise of biologically inspired, hybrid neuromorphic systems for developing energyefficient and adaptive AI applications."

We benchmark five RL algorithms PPO, SAC, SAC-HER, DDPG, and DDPG-HER using a UR10 robotic arm in the PyBullet simulator.

    "abstract": "Grid-tied voltage source inverters (VSIs) play the role of a controlled power interface between different power production units and the ac grid. Instead of the usual cascade control scheme of a VSI with current proportional-integral (PI) inner-loops and voltage or even power PI outer-loops, a direct power control (DPC) scheme is considered. DPC is implemented through one stage PI-type controllers that directly regulate the active and reactive power flow. The process does not require a synchronization mechanism, known as phaselocked loop (PLL) but clearly introduces a zero open-loop pole. In the paper, the proposed control scheme realizes PItype direct active and reactive power regulators, stabilized on the left of the imaginary axis by introducing suitable damping terms. Since this has a clear impact in steady-state error, an appropriate mechanism is proposed which allows the damping term action exclusively during the transient period. Another design innovation introduced by the proposed controller is its robustness against ac voltage variations and system parameters since it does not include the conventionally used decoupling terms. The full nonlinear plant and control scheme is extensively analyzed for its stability and convergence characteristics by applying a rigorous Lyapunov based methodology. Further evaluation of the proposed approach is finally provided by suitable simulations."

    "abstract": "Multi-view attributed graph clustering (MAGC) has recently experienced impressive attention in the graph exploration literature. Although several excellent achievements have been made, previous MVAGC approaches merely consider the homogeneous information across different views, easily resulting in the compromised results when faced with the heterogeneous graph scenarios. Further, many of them rely on the static neighborhood connection from original attributed graphs, which ignores the dynamical structural relationship for enhancing cross-view contrastive learning. To deal with these drawbacks, this paper derives a Dual-level Facilitated Multi-view Contrastive Graph Clustering (DF-MCGC) approach. Specifically, we design a hybrid graph filter by considering the homogeneity hidden in individual view. Further, the view-consistent topology invariant matrix is derived to exploit the topological relationship among different embedded representations. This design progressively helps to construct the cluster-wise sample pairs for cross-view contrastive learning. Especially, the overall network is incorporated with a dual-level self-supervised paradigm, among which the self-supervised signals can be efficiently facilitated in a mutually enhanced manner. Experiments on heterogeneous benchmarks have confirmed the advantages of our DF-MCGC approach in comparison with the advanced competitors."

Meanwhile, the system innovatively adopts low-rank adaptation (LoRA) technology for efficient domain fine-tuning of parameters, aiming to achieve high-performance domain adaptation with an extremely low number of training parameters. To verify the effectiveness of the system, we designed comparison and ablation experiments on multiple typical vertical tasks such as medical image report generation, industrial defect detection, financial risk control, and autonomous driving scenarios.

To solve this problem, a Cold Atmospheric Plasma (CAP) system operating with ambient air has been introduced as a non-antibiotic antimicrobial therapy and a woundhealing promoter. The system is based on a plasma jet reactor powered by a low-frequency RF source, which is able to produce a stable, non-thermal plasma plume at room temperature from filtered ambient air instead of medical-grade gases. Such a system generates reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) like ozone (O₃), nitric oxide (NO) and hydroxyl radicals (·OH) that have a strong antimicrobial and healing effect. A specially designed microjet applicator facilitates the targeted plasma delivery and temperature control is carried out in real-time to ensure the patient's safety. In vitro, the device inactivates a >99.9% load of pathogens and multi-drug resistant bacteria such as MRSA and E. coli within 120 seconds of the area exposed to plasma. Besides disinfection, CAP therapy also promoted fibroblast proliferation and cell migration, thus, the wound closure process was faster. The instrument is small, mobile and simple to use, making it a non-invasive, chemical-free solution that is suitable both at home and in a clinic. So, this ambient air CAP system is an effective, safe and inexpensive way to achieve infection control and wound healing."

    "abstract": "Workflow scheduling in cloud data centers faces challenges such as task dependencies, resource heterogeneity, and dynamic workloads. Heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms lack environment awareness and fail to meet real-time scheduling requirements. Existing deep reinforcement learning algorithms exhibit specific environment-aware capabilities; however, their feature modeling capabilities are insufficient, making it challenging to effectively model the nonlinear relationships between tasks and resources. To address these issues, we design a dynamic priority-aware mechanism that computes task priority factors in real time to adjust scheduling strategies adaptively. In low-load scenarios, dependency release is accelerated based on the priority rule of the successor node quantity to improve resource utilization; in high-load scenarios, bottleneck subtasks are prioritized based on the priority rule of the weighted critical path to shorten overall task completion times. We propose a Dynamic Priority-Aware Transformer-based Advantage ActorCritic (DPA-TA2C) scheduling method. The proposed method models the task topology, resource states, and priority factors as a sequence of features via a Transformer encoder. It collaboratively optimizes scheduling decisions using the policy and value functions of the A2C network to achieve end-to-end scheduling. Experimental results show that DPA-TA2C improves resource utilization by 49.5 % on average in low-load scenarios and reduces makespan by 51.6 % in high-load scenarios, demonstrating the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method for scheduling in complex cloud environments."

    "abstract": "Terahertz (THz) waves with controlled spatial structure can enable a broad range of applications from beam focusing to the formation of localized THz magnetic fields and THz vortex beams. Nonlinear optical metasurfaces can facilitate many of those applications by offering a novel approach where the spatial structure is imprinted at the THz pulse generation stage. In this presentation we demonstrate a nonlinear metasurface comprising a full-size (6 mm x 9 mm) binary-phase Fresnel lens design, which efficiently generates and focuses THz pulses when photoexcited by femtosecond optical pulses. The metalens is made of InAs nanoscale resonators and it combines two essential functionalities, THz pulse generation and wavefront engineering, in an ultrathin (130nm) flat device."

The creation of interference through the use of random phase modulation of signals is the subject of numerous studies, each applicable for solving a specific set of tasks. The development and widespread use of radio control systems and satellite navigation for aircraft, which utilize phase-modulated signals, determine the relevance of assessing various possibilities for creating a digital jammer with phase manipulation designed for these systems The object of the study is creation of a possible sample of disruptor with phase manipulation that can be quickly reconfigured to operate in different frequency ranges and with different modulation periods of the generated disturbances. The main results from laboratory and field tests with laboratory samples and a prototype of a multi-channel digital disruptor are presented. Based on this, it is demonstrated that the creation of single-channel and multi-channel disruptors with digitally synthesized signals, which utilize phase manipulation, is possible, along with the capability for rapid reconfiguration across a wide frequency and phase range."

To address this, we propose an on-the-fly TF generation method using a reused butterfly array, which eliminates the need for dedicated TF logic. The design reduces memory usage from ~12.09 MB to only ~0.38 MB, a 96.9% reduction, with zero DSP overhead. Compared to prior designs, it achieves up to 9.6 × better resource efficiency in terms of equivalent normalized slices (ENS), enabling more area- and memory-efficient FHE hardware accelerators."

This study evaluates a hybrid soft-rigid elbow exosuit designed for elbow movement support in dynamic and endurance tasks, focusing on biomechanical impact, user perception, and ergonomics. A theoretical model guided the design, optimizing device dynamics and assistive force delivery. A generic interaction controller, combined with fixed system parameters, provided effective assistance across participants without the need for subject-specific tuning, simplifying deployment in practical settings. During dynamic tasks, the exosuit significantly reduced biceps muscle activity compared to the unassisted condition, with an average reduction of 28.40%. In endurance tasks, it reduced infraspinatus activity by an average of 44.55% and mitigated increased muscle activation during load-carrying. Subjective assessments indicated lower perceived physical demand, while the System Usability Scale confirmed high usability and acceptance. These findings highlight the exosuit's ability to reduce physical effort and improve muscle coordination while maintaining comfort.

EEG signals undergo pre-processing through bandpass filtering $(0.5-30 \\mathrm{~Hz})$ to eliminate noise and Z -score normalization to maintain data consistency. The CNN model differentiates emotions into three groups: positive, negative, and neutral. The system is trained on a labelled EEG dataset and is equipped on the PYNQ-Z2 board with an efficient and low-latency emotion recognition. The overall accuracy of the proposed system is 98%, while the accuracies for individual emotions are 99% for negative, 100% for neutral, and 95% for positive.

The UAV’s control problem is formulated as a linear MPC for nominal control, and a state feedback controller for disturbance rejection, using zonotopes to compute robust invariant sets. The proposed method is tested on a UAV equipped with a Pixhawk 4 flight controller and Raspberry Pi 5, where the system’s robustness is validated in outdoor experiments under disturbances. The results demonstrate both the system’s performance and safety under real-world conditions."

It is progressively replacing traditional electrochemical sensors and gas chromatography techniques. This paper systematically reviews the key technical pathways, current engineering applications, and future challenges of TDLAS in complex coal mine environments. It highlights the performance differences between Direct Absorption Spectroscopy (DAS) and Modulation Spectroscopy (MS), emphasizing the mainstream role of the WMS-2f/1f normalization method in enhancing trace gas detection sensitivity and anti-interference capabilities. For multi-component detection, the paper thoroughly examines the advantages and disadvantages of time-division multiplexing (TDM) Technology, frequency-division multi-plexing (FDM) Technology, and their hybrid strategy (F-TDM). It also explores the potential of overlapping spectral line separation strategies based on single lasers and machine learning algorithms for achieving low-cost, compact multi-component sensing. Although TDLAS has achieved preliminary applications in duct monitoring and in-situ detection, challenges persist, including nonlinear responses to high-concentration gases, laser costs, system complexity, and adaptability to extreme environments (high humidity, high dust, strong vibration). Future research should focus on developing high-concentration correction algorithms, low-cost laser sources, enhanced environmental robustness, and multi-technology integration to advance the comprehensive application of TDLAS in intelligent gas safety monitoring systems for mining environments."

    "abstract": "Due to the ever-changing channel conditions (rain attenuation, Doppler effect, and long delay) in High-Throughput Satellite Communication (HTS), classical Adaptive Coding and Modulation (ACM) technology cannot respond to channel conditions in real-time, resulting in an unreliable system throughput and an increased bit error rate. This paper utilizes a deep prediction model based on GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) and MHSA (Multi-Head Self-Attention). First, the model is given the historical CSI (Channel State Information) sequence, which evaluates real-time Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and bit error rate information. Second, the GRU layer looks to model the long-term time dependence of capturing the long delays and sudden fading of the satellite channel. In addition, MHSA dynamically calculates weight coefficients for each historical time step to be more sensitive to rain attenuation and the Doppler effect. Third, the fully-connected output layer generates an accurate probability distribution of future channel state, including SNR confidence intervals and error rate thresholds. Finally, this distribution drives the ACM module to optimize the modulation order and encoding rate in real-time. The experimental results indicate that the root mean square error of the SNR prediction in the rain attenuation and Doppler composite scene is 6.87 decibels with an error rate of 0.1432, which demonstrates the feasibility and novelty of this method in optimizing communication performance in dynamic channel conditions."

Traditional fault diagnosis relies on post-event detection, making it difficult to meet real-time warning requirements. This paper proposes a fault early warning model for new energy vehicles based on a hybrid XGBoost-LSTM machine learning algorithm. By collecting vehicle operational data from multiple sensor sources, followed by data preprocessing and feature engineering, the model captures nonlinear characteristics while modeling temporal dependencies. Experiments conducted using NASA battery failure datasets and real-vehicle triple-electric system data demonstrate superiority over standalone SVM, Random Forest, and LSTM models in terms of fault prediction accuracy, recall, and F1-score. The proposed hybrid model achieves fault warnings 5–10 minutes earlier than single models, providing technical support for proactive safety protection in new energy vehicles."

By incorporating realistic EEG recon-struction-where each electrode collects a distance-weighted summation of local population activities-we generate multichannel iEEG signals that closely mimic both interictal and ictal patterns. To evaluate closed-loop stimulation strategies, we introduce a cost function comparing the stimulated signal’s spectral content against a normal baseline, thus quantifying seizure suppression effectiveness. Parameter sweeps of bipolar stimulation pulses reveal optimal amplitude-frequency ranges for terminating seizure-like events, demonstrating the potential for personalized, model-driven neurostimulation."

For the purpose of further improving the BER performance under high jamming-to-noise ratio (JNR) cases, this paper proposesa novel JM scheme using jamming elimination and amplification (JM-JEA). Specifically, the JM-JEAuses the PGA to generate the two states: jamming elimination and jamming amplification for transmitting information bits, which enables the reliable detection at the receiver. Moreover, we derive the expression for the BER performance and provide the optimal threshold for decoding the information bits for the JM-JEA.Our analysis shows that the JM-JEA overcomes the BER floor of the traditional AAJ scheme at large JNR, and achieves the significant improvement on the BER performance."

    "abstract": "Cloud inference consumes massive amounts of resources and carbon emissions, which has prompted edge-cloud inference to become a new paradigm. However, constrained by limited edge resources, existing approaches predominantly adopt periodic model switching strategies, overlooking the heterogeneity of application requirements and the highly dynamic nature of task demands in large-scale edge-cloud environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an Adaptive Online Dynamic Model Switching (AODMS) framework, which jointly optimizes real-time model switching, cross-layer resource allocation, and edge-cloud collaborative inference to minimize long-term system cost, including task execution time and carbon emissions. First, an average saving cost evaluation mechanism is developed to determine optimal model switching points, coupled with a matrix-constrained pairwise search strategy for efficient exploration of feasible edge model loading. And then a distributed iterative optimization scheme is proposed for joint resource allocation and edge-cloud task scheduling. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that AODMS can significantly reduce model switching frequency, average inference time, and Carbon Footprint (CF), offering a scalable and adaptive solution for the sustainable edge-cloud system."

    "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have significantly advanced the reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of intelligent systems. As tasks grow more complex, there is an increasing need to shift from single-agent framework to Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for enhanced collaborative performance. Achieving better performance typically requires deploying large-scale LLMs, however, it poses significant challenges on resource-constrained edge devices. In addition, most MAS adopt a fully connected communication topology and require multiple rounds of interaction, resulting in considerable communication redundancy and increased computational overhead. To address the issues, in this paper, we propose a Directed Acyclic Graph-based Multi-Agent System (DAG-MAS) via cloud-edge framework for collaborative reasoning. Specifically, considering the limited resources on the edge, we utilize a 72B-LLM in the cloud finetunes a lightweight Small Language Model (SLM) for edge deployment. To generate a one round interaction graph, the SLM is further employed to analyze task requirements and determine optimal communication topology, minimizing overhead while enabling effective information exchange. Extensive experiments and analyses on four reasoning datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to several benchmark methods, validating the effectiveness in achieving higher reasoning performance with lower communication costs."

    "abstract": "Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) holds critical importance for military security applications. Although U-shaped architectures have improved baseline performance, existing methods still suffer from two key limitations: 1) Insufficient spatial perception for tiny targets leads to target location loss.; 2) Edge degradation and semantic ambiguity in deep feature reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose PQGNet with the following contributions: To enhance capability of spatial perception and improve feature fusion guidance, we introduce the Perceptual Query Supervision Mechanism (PQSM), which utilizes perceptual loss to constrain spatial feature learning of each encoder layer. The Perceptual Feature Construction Module (PFCM) constructs enhanced perceptual features to preserve target localization information, while the Perceptual Query Guidance Module (PQGM) adopts cross-attention to guide global and regional feature queries through skip connections, optimizing target feature extraction.  To mitigate reconstruction degradation and semantic ambiguity, distinct from existing wavelet-based approaches that simply substitute pooling layers, we design a Max pooling-Wavelet Hybrid Layer (MWHL) and High-frequency Enhancement Wavelet Layer (HEWL) that exploit discrete wavelet transform properties to enhance deep semantic representations using shallow high-frequency details. Comprehensive experiments on NUDT-SIRST, NUAA-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K datasets demonstrate that PQGNet significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in detection performance, while maintaining a competitive balance between computational complexity and accuracy. Our code will be made public at https://github.com/PepperCS/PQGNet."

    "abstract": "The rapid development of AI accelerates the implementation and delivery of AI applications in diverse fields. In cloud-edge collaboration, delivering a complete AI application relies on the robust coordination between AI-supporting microservices and AI services. However, most existing studies only coarsely considered monolithic AI service orchestration while neglecting microservice orchestration. Such coarse-grained orchestration severely impacts application performance. To enable diverse high-performance AI applications, fine-grained hybrid orchestration of AI services and microservices (HOAIM) is highly desirable, yet presents formidable challenges. Due to heterogeneous services, call dependencies, and service multiplexing, fine-grained hybrid orchestration modeling is highly non-trivial. Moreover, the tight coupling between deployment and routing results in a complex joint optimization problem. To address this, we first propose a heterogeneous service orchestration network that supports orchestration optimization and automated management. Then, based on queuing networks and multi-instance models, we conduct an accurate analysis of delay and load. Furthermore, to achieve efficient hybrid orchestration, we propose preference-driven resource allocation and instance computation algorithms, along with reinforcement learning with action masking and reward shaping. Finally, extensive trace-driven simulations demonstrate that our algorithms optimize average response delay by up to 41.83%, and achieve significant advantages in load balancing, response success rate, and resource efficiency."

    "abstract": "Control of unstable systems is a pretty challenging task, since even a slight mismatch in controller gains can cause the system to go out of bounds. The control task becomes even more difficult if an unstable system has a zero in the right half-plane (RHP) of the complex s-plane. In this paper, a reinforcement learning (RL) based controller tuning method for non-minimum phase unstable systems is proposed. An adaptive PID controller is designed using RL and a modified Smith predictor structure is used to accommodate any delay in the system. The Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm has been employed along with a long short term memory (LSTM) layer in the actor as well as the critic network to design an RL-based adaptive PID controller. The proposed framework with the modified Smith predictor and RL based PID controller provide improved control performance. The performance has been evaluated against a state-of-the-art PID controller based on Integral Absolute Error (IAE) and Integral Square Error (ISE). Various case studies highlight the applicability of the proposed framework to a wide range of unstable and non-minimum phase systems."

These findings demonstrate the extremely high potential of the proposed approach for ultralow-power operation, indicating that the FeFET–capacitor 1T1C structure constitutes a promising synaptic device architecture for high-density neuromorphic systems and edge AI applications."

    "abstract": "Electric vehicles (EVs) use lithium-ion batteries that function best within the range of $15^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ to $35^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$; deviations cause decreased performance, faster degradation, or thermal runaway. Traditional battery thermal management systems (BTMS), often air or ethylene glycol-based liquid-cooled, usually are not able to provide uniform and effective temperature control under rapid charging or high load conditions. This work introduces the design, simulation, and analysis of a modern BTMS based on nanofluid coolants to improve heat transfer and system efficiency. Nanofluids, which consist of nanoparticles dispersed in the base fluid, have greater thermal conductivity, higher heat absorption capability, and reduced viscosity relative to conventional coolants. A MATLAB/Simulink model was constructed by manually specifying nanofluid thermophysical properties, simulating realistic driving conditions. Tests indicate better temperature regulation throughout battery, motor, charger, inverter, and DC-DC converter components, with temperature decreases of as much as 5.26 % over ethylene glycol. Components were kept within their optimal ranges of operating temperatures, improving safety and efficiency. Cost calculations reveal that even though higher-cost coolants are used, better efficiency makes nano-fluid utilization worth it. The suggested system reveals an efficient solution for future-generation EV BTMS in terms of improved thermal performance, modeling fidelity, and integration capabilities."

The idea of this work is to place a thermoelectric generator (TEG) between the tire and the rim, where a temperature difference consistently develops during driving can be turned into a power. The study is carried out in two parts. First, a thermal analysis of the tire is performed in ANSYS to understand how the temperature builds up at different vehicle speeds. The temperature values from this simulation are then used as inputs for a second model, where a TEG's one side is exposed to the hot-side and and another to the less-side conditions. By doing this, the electrical output of the TEG can be estimated. The findings show that higher speeds of the vehicle lead to a more noticeable temperature gradient inside the tire, which improves the potential for energy harvesting. The generated power is then evaluated considering the TEG’s material properties, size, and electrical loading. This study looks at whether a small, self-powered tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) could run using the heat produced naturally by a spinning wheel."

    "abstract": "Edge intelligence in space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs) can enable worldwide network coverage beyond geographical limitations for users to access ubiquitous and low-latency intelligence services. Facing global coverage and complex environments in SAGINs, edge intelligence can provision large language models (LLMs) agents for users via edge servers at ground base stations (BSs) or cloud data centers relayed by satellites. As LLMs with billions of parameters are pretrained on vast datasets, LLM agents have few-shot learning capabilities, e.g., chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for complex tasks, which raises a new trade-off between resource consumption and performance in SAGINs. In this paper, we propose a joint caching and inference framework for edge intelligence to provision sustainable and ubiquitous LLM agents in SAGINs. We introduce “cached model-as-a-resource” for offering LLMs with limited context windows and propose a novel optimization framework, i.e., joint model caching and inference, to utilize cached model resources for provisioning LLM agent services along with communication, computing, and storage resources.We design “age of thought” (AoT) considering the CoT prompting of LLMs, and propose a least AoT cached model replacement algorithm for optimizing the provisioning cost. We propose a deep Q-network-based modified second-bid (DQMSB) auction to incentivize satellite/ground network operators in real-time, which can enhance allocation efficiency by 23% while guaranteeing strategy-proofness and being free from adverse selection."

    "abstract": "The increasing urgency of climate change mitigation has accelerated the adoption of tools to measure and monitor greenhouse gas emissions at individual, organizational, and infrastructural levels. While these tools enhance the accuracy and accountability of emissions measurement, they also raise privacy concerns due to the sensitive data they collect, the granularity of monitoring, and the potential for secondary use. Despite their growing adoption, no prior study has systematically evaluated the privacy implications of carbon footprint tools across categories or examined how data practices differ between consumer calculators, enterprise systems, and emerging Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and blockchain solutions. This study addresses this gap by conducting a structured, cross-category privacy evaluation of carbon footprint tools, reviewing 46 tools from academic and industry sources. A novel five-dimensional privacy risk framework, encompassing data type, granularity, storage, processing, secondary use, and user agency, is developed and applied across five tool categories: individual calculators, corporate platforms, infrastructure tools, IoT/AI/blockchain systems, and research tools. The findings reveal pronounced privacy–accuracy trade-offs: tools offering higher measurement precision often require more intrusive data collection. The study also identifies category-specific least- and highest-risk tools, showing that simple household calculators present low risk. In contrast, enterprise platforms and IoT/blockchain systems exhibit the highest exposure due to sensitive operational, financial, and real-time data flows. The study is limited by its reliance on literature and public documentation, suggesting the need for empirical field studies and technical audits. Future research should expand on these findings by investigating user perceptions, legal frameworks, and privacy-preserving design strategies for sustainable digital tools."

Although they provide high-frequency and accurate measurements, such sensors are prone to faults, and the presence of foam on the water surface can hinder their measurement capabilities. In contrast, underwater pressure sensors provide more reliable but less accurate measurements of wave characteristics. Furthermore, wave attenuation below the sea surface affects the accuracy of pressure sensors-based measurements of wave motion. This work introduces a procedure for performing transfer learning, aimed at leveraging knowledge acquired from pressure sensor data to train a neural network that provides fault detection capabilities in ultrasonic measurement of sea level. The proposed transfer learning procedure takes advantage of linear wave theory, a description of the motion of small amplitude sea waves, to perform domain adaptation. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is discussed through simulations on a real-world dataset in which three common types of faults are injected."

    "abstract": "AI-based voice synthesis technologies are central to improving human-computer interaction (HCI). Socially assistive robots, which incorporate such voice technology, are emerging as promising tools for enhancing the quality of care for individuals with cognitive decline. However, the development of emotionally expressive artificial voices, particularly for older adults, remains limited. A key challenge is the lack of understanding of how auditory and emotional cues in artificial voices influence perception and behavior in cognitively impaired populations. To address this, it is important to study how deep learning models used for voice synthesis affect behavior in animal models that can translate to human clinical conditions.In this study, we used a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate synthetic vocalizations and compared the behavior of three freely moving marmosets in response to AI-generated and natural vocalizations. We observed a significant main effect of condition on two behaviors (stationary and leg stand - contact), suggesting that vocalization type influenced behavioral responses. However, post hoc pairwise comparisons did not show statistically significant differences between specific conditions, possibly due to limited power or individual variability, suggesting that AI-generated vocalizations were not perceived as equivalent to natural ones. These findings highlight the need for more diverse training datasets to develop VAE models for this species. Despite current limitations, marmosets remain a promising model for advancing synthetic voice technologies to enhance communication and cognitive outcomes in humans."

With an increasing demand for clean energy, we examine the broad applicability of this emerging technique for characterizing densities of solid-state electrolytes (SSEs). In particular, relative densities of NaSICON (Sodium SuperIonic CONductor) pellets prepared at a range of sintering temperatures were quantified and compared against complementary hydrostatic weighing and mercury porosimetry, where results were in close agreement. This therefore shows the THz-TDS as a promising tool for electrolyte characterization."

The numerous energetic MeV fast electrons produced by the high-intensity laser pulses serve as the primary source of the THz radiation. When the forward fast electrons reach the target rear surface, THz radiation is induced via the mechanism of transition radiation. To enhance the THz radiation, a variety of techniques have been employed. These include increasing laser absorption through the use of a preplasma, fabricating nanostructures on the front surface of the target, optimizing the target thickness, applying a CH coating, and employing an additional laser pulse to ablate the target rear. The optimized energy of the terahertz pulses can reach the millijoule to hundreds of millijoules range, depending on the specific parameters of the driving laser pulses. Additionally, we have conducted preliminary studies exploring the nonlinear interaction between the strong terahertz pulses and condensed matters, such as the excitation of biological protein dynamics, water dynamics, and phonons."

In this work, a barrel shifter is implemented in four logic families: CMOS, Two-Phase Adiabatic Static CMOS Logic (2PASCL), Efficient Charge Recovery Logic (ECRL), and Pass-Transistor Adiabatic Logic (PAL)—using a 45 $\\mathbf{n m}$ Cadence flow. The measured power results from these implementations are analyzed in the context of a finite impulse response (FIR) filter modeled in Python to assess the potential system-level impact on DSP workloads.

To address these limitations, this paper proposes an encrypted function-based image fragment management scheme. The method uses cryptographic function mapping to build a computable index management mechanism that generates a main identifier (MID) and multiple subidentifiers (SIDs) across distributed cloud servers, securely linking sensitive and nonsensitive fragments. Moreover, to guarantee fragment authenticity and integrity during reconstruction, an HMAC-based key derivation function (HKDF) is employed to generate unique verification keys for each fragment, ensuring accurate and verifiable image reassembly."

    "abstract": "Automated Crop disease detection and control becomes significant research in agriculture domain as viral, fungal and bacterial types impacts the yield potential of the crop also it generates economic damage to the farmers. Nowadays Humanoid Robots considered as drones has deployed in agriculture field to monitor and interact with crop regions to perform human related tasks. Drones were trained using artificial intelligence and machine learning architecture to perform specialized complex tasks such as crop disease prediction and disease controlling through employment of the specified pesticides and fertilizers. Despite of multiple advantages of machine learning and deep learning model towards predicting crop diseases on monitoring and controlling by applying pesticides and fertilizer faces several challenges in predicting disease due to diversity of the crop diseases with respect to lightening, climatic condition and soil conditions in the agriculture field. In this paper, a new deep learning architecture entitled as multiattention convolution neural network is designed and it is used to train drone which is deployed to predict and control wheat crop diseases against different conditions accurately. Multiattention convolution neural network uses attention mechanism to process the monitored wheat crop images with attention coefficients. Initially Image preprocessing techniques is applied to eliminate the noise and to perform image augmentation. Preprocessed image is processed in the convolution layer to extract disease specific features related to climate and soil. Attention coefficient of attention mechanism is incorporated in the polling layer of the model to determine the anthracnose and other fungal diseases in the crops and obtains saliency map. Finally fully connected layer of the model incorporating the softmax function classifies the saliency map into crop diseases with respect to severity classes and predict the appropriate fertilizer and pesticide to manage specified severity of the crop diseases as control mechanism. Experimental analysis of the model is performed using training data of the Global Wheat Head Detection (GWHD) dataset in python environment. Performance analysis is performed using test data of the GWHD dataset. On evaluation, it is identified that model predict and controls wheat crop disease with 98.8% accuracy while compared to conventional deep learning architectures."

While automated methods have advanced considerably, their performance largely depends on the availability of high-quality ground truth data. Manual segmentation serves as the gold standard for generating reference datasets, offering precise boundary delineation of vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs. In this study, we focus on the creation of a ground truth dataset through detailed manual annotation of adult lumbar vertebrae (L1–L5) and intervertebral discs (T12/L1–L5/S1) using T2-weighted MRI scans. Segmentation was carried out in sagittal planes using the 3D Slicer platform, with cross-validation across axial, and coronal planes to ensure accuracy. A total of 48 cases were annotated, with an average of 3 hours per case. Intra-observer evaluation yielded a high Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC ≈ 0.95), confirming excellent reproducibility of the manual protocol. The resultant dataset offers a clearly defined and validated ground truth, crucial for training and evaluating automated deep learning models for vertebral segmentation. The objective of this study is to document the process and challenges of manual annotation of lumbar vertebrae, emphasizing its critical role in generating high-quality ground truth data, which will serve as the foundation for developing an automated and clinically deployable spine segmentation framework."

However, traditional cloud-based anomaly filtering approaches often suffer from latency, inefficiency, and poor scalability. To address these limitations, this paper presents a framework based on Anomaly Detection and Outlier Screening (ADOS), which is deployed at the LoRaWAN gateway level. ADOS is combined threshold-based filtering model and statistical techniques such as Z-score and Interquartile Range (IQR), to detect both physical and contextual anomalies in sensor data. The framework was practically implemented in a smart greenhouse over a 7-day deployment. A total of 1000 sensor readings were processed, with 28 anomalies detected using rule-based validation and 16 anomalies identified using Z-score analysis. The system achieved a false positive rate of only 2%, real-time responsiveness with 100–120 ms latency, and 25% bandwidth savings compared to traditional systems. Integration with MQTT, ThingSpeak, and Blynk provided seamless visualization and mobile alerts, supporting timely and informed decision-making for precision irrigation and crop monitoring."

Introducing a new framework with mixed semantic code analysis and some intelligent embedding tricks. Instead of simply depending on text-frequency methods such as TF-IDF or Bag-of-Words, we analyze the structure in depth of Verilog code and using lightweight contextual embeddings to really get a feel for both the text and how the hardware's supposed to work. We even built a dataset of 3,900 examples, pulling from standard and injecting Trojans with the help of some refined LLM-guided mutation techniques. After pitting different classifiers and transformer models against each other, we found that our hybrid embedding approach, powered by Gradient Boosting, nailed a 98% accuracy rate. Plus, with some optimized LLM prompts, we reached recall at 99% which is too high, it reduces the number undetected Trojans attacks. This new method is all about being scalable, easy to understand, and rock-solid when it comes to keeping open-source hardware secure."

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based feature matching has showcased great superiority for point cloud registration. While coarse-to-fine matching architectures are prevalent, they typically perform sparse and geometrically inconsistent coarse matching. This forces the subsequent fine matching to rely on computationally expensive optimal transport and hypothesis-and-selection procedures to resolve inconsistencies, leading to inefficiency and poor scalability for large-scale real-time applications. In this paper, we design a consistency-aware spot-guided Transformer (CAST) to enhance the coarse matching by explicitly utilizing geometric consistency via two key sparse attention mechanisms. First, our consistency-aware self-attention selectively computes intra-point-cloud attention to a sparse subset of points with globally consistent correspondences, enabling other points to derive discriminative features through their relationships with these anchors while propagating global consistency for robust correspondence reasoning. Second, our spot-guided cross-attention restricts cross-point-cloud attention to dynamically defined “spots”—the union of correspondence neighborhoods of a query's neighbors in the other point cloud, which are most likely to cover the true correspondence of the query ensured by local consistency, eliminating interference from similar but irrelevant regions. Furthermore, we design a lightweight local attention-based fine matching module to precisely predict dense correspondences and estimate the transformation. Extensive experiments on both outdoor LiDAR datasets and indoor RGB-D camera datasets demonstrate that our method achieves <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">state-of-the-art</i> accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.

To bridge this gap, we establish the discrete-continuous correspondence with a prolate spheroidal wave function (PSWF)-based ergodic capacity analysis framework. Specifically, we state and prove some discrete-continuous correspondence lemmas to establish a firm theoretical connection between discrete information-theoretic quantities to their continuous counterparts. With these lemmas, we apply the PSWF ergodic capacity bound to advanced MIMO architectures such as continuous-aperture MIMO (CAP-MIMO) and extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO). From this PSWF capacity bound, we discover the capacity saturation phenomenon both theoretically and empirically. Although the growth of MIMO performance is fundamentally limited in this EIT-based analysis framework, we reveal new opportunities in MIMO channel estimation by exploiting the EIT knowledge about the channel. Inspired by the PSWF capacity bound, we utilize continuous PSWFs to improve the pilot design of discrete MIMO channel estimators, which is called as the PSWF channel estimator (PSWF-CE). Simulation results demonstrate improved performance of the proposed PSWF-CE, compared to traditional minimum mean squared error (MMSE) and compressed sensing-based estimators."

Take the offshore oil operation field as an example. Currently, this field is faced with three major approval problems: cumbersome processes, incomplete documentation, and slow information exchange. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel heterogeneous integration framework, HEI-DNN (Heterogeneous Ensemble Integration with Deep Neural Network). This framework innovatively integrates the ensemble capabilities of multiple tree-based paradigms and utilizes deep neural networks for feature fusion and nonlinear optimization, making it widely applicable to approval scenarios in various fields. Due to the lack of approval data in the oil industry, this paper conducts experiments using three real-world financial approval datasets instead. The results show that, compared with traditional machine learning and ensemble methods, HEI-DNN demonstrates more competitive performance in key indicators such as accuracy. These experiments indirectly verify the potential of this method for applications in other fields, laying a theoretical and methodological foundation for future application explorations in the oil industry and beyond."

    "abstract": "In recent years, deep learning-based computer vision technology has developed rapidly. The use of computer vision for abnormal behavior detection has become a research focus and has been widely applied in various fields. Using computer vision to recognize student behaviors in the classroom can reduce the teacher’s workload in monitoring students during lectures. At the same time, students’ classroom performance is closely related to their exam results and can also reflect the teaching condition of the instructor. However, existing student behavior detection systems do not yet achieve high enough accuracy in behavior recognition, which cannot meet the current demand for precise detection of classroom behaviors. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an improved model, YOLOv8-SL, based on the YOLOv8 algorithm to recognize and detect student behaviors in the classroom. Here, \"SL\" stands for Swin Transformer and LDConv (Linear Deformable Convolution), which represent the two major improvements incorporated into the baseline model. First, the input images are preprocessed and then fed into the model. In the backbone, the Swin Transformer is introduced to enhance global feature modeling and capture long-range dependencies, while preserving local detail extraction. Meanwhile, LDConv is used to improve the network’s adaptability to different student postures. In addition, a small-object detection head is added to enhance the model’s ability to detect small targets. Finally, a multi-scale feature fusion module is used for classification and regression. Through experiments, the improved model shows better detection performance than the original YOLOv8 on the public dataset SCB-Dataset3. Compared with the original YOLOv8, the proposed model achieved an improvement of 6.8% in mAP@0.5 and 6.6% in mAP@0.5:0.95."

    "abstract": "Among the elderly, Dementia is a crawling illness that is difficult to avoid and it remains a progressive fog gradually blurring cognitive function and memory. As defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), it is a term for several diseases that affects an individuals memory, thinking, and the ability to perform daily activity, this illness leads to significant physical, psychological and social impacts. With no known cure as of the present, the cognitive decline in dementia is irreversible once it starts. However, certain interventions may help in slowing its progression. This study fills a gap in the limited research on methods that shows dementia trajectories in individuals. Current models do not account well for how genetics, lifestyle, and health factors shape each person’s decline. Since the cognitive scores vary based on the multiple factors, the goal of this paper is to show the trajectory of cognitive decline in the dementia patients over time. By integrating Monte Carlo simulation with parallel computing, this study models the probabilistic trajectories of fluctuations in cognitive score under various outcomes with or without interventions. The paper also aligns with the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 which scopes the good health and well being."

    "abstract": "The development of modern industrial intelligence has driven the widespread application of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) flexible sensing networks in fields such as equipment health monitoring and structural safety assessment. However, their complex topology and multi-dimensional monitoring data make it difficult for traditional fault detection methods to effectively mine topological correlations in the data, resulting in limited detection accuracy and robustness. Graph neural networks (GNNs), however, excel at processing graph-structured data and demonstrate excellent feature learning capabilities in fault diagnosis, offering potential for addressing this issue. This study aims to construct a GNN-driven framework for efficient and accurate fault detection in FBG flexible sensing networks, overcoming the application bottlenecks of traditional methods. Methodologically, FBG sensor nodes are first mapped to graph nodes, and the graph structure is constructed by combining the sensor physical connections and signal correlations. After preprocessing the FBG spectral signals with denoising and normalization, a GNN is used to extract node local-global features layer by layer and perform fault classification. A 12-node FBG experimental system is used to simulate typical faults such as sensor failure, signal drift, and noise interference, and the detection performance of traditional threshold methods and support vector machine (SVM) methods is compared. Experimental results show that the proposed GNN method achieves a fault detection rate of 96.2%, a false alarm rate as low as 2.1%, and an F1 score of 0.942, significantly outperforming traditional threshold methods and SVMs. Its average detection time of 45.2ms meets real-time monitoring requirements while also offering excellent fault tolerance. This research provides a new technical path for reliability assurance and intelligent maintenance of FBG flexible sensor networks and offers a valuable solution for fault detection in sensor networks with complex topologies."

    "abstract": "Soft robots' ability to safely navigate complex environments motivates the development of algorithms for accurate environmental interaction assessment, enabling greater autonomy. Specifically, strain-based shape and force estimation of continuum robots with embedded soft sensors poses an open challenge mainly owing to continuous softness, anisotropic deformation, and non-linear properties. Mathematical description of deformable soft bodies and accurate estimation of external forces are crucial for achieving controllable and intelligent behaviors of these robots. In this paper, a kinetostatic strain-based modeling for rod-driven soft robots (RDSR) with embedded stretch sensors is proposed, which incorporates local strains, actuation variables, and external interactions. The strain model enables full shape estimation of the robot and prediction of strain variations in soft bodies. Building on this, we develop a force estimator based on predicted and measured sensor and actuator lengths to evaluate 3D external forces, accounting for both orthogonal and tangential components relative to the backbone. Moreover, we introduce a methodology using a novel ellipsoid representation to handle tangential forces that may become insensitive in certain singular configurations. This estimator allows us to either disregard such forces when they do not influence deformation or estimate them when they become observable. Our simulations and experiments demonstrate how this approach can be used to analyze the robot's configuration and successfully estimate external forces. Finally, it is demonstrated that when the continuum arm follows trajectories with higher strain sensitivity, tangential force estimation is significantly improved."

While Bayesian Kernel Inference (BKI) addresses discontinuities of map inference from sparse sensor data, existing semantic mapping methods suffer from various sources of uncertainties in challenging outdoor environments. To address these issues, we propose an uncertainty-aware semantic mapping framework that handles multiple sources of uncertainties, which significantly degrade mapping performance. Our method estimates uncertainties in semantic predictions using Evidential Deep Learning and incorporates them into BKI for robust semantic inference. It further aggregates noisy observations into coherent Gaussian representations to mitigate the impact of unreliable points, while employing geometry-aligned kernels that adapt to complex scene structures. These Gaussian primitives effectively fuse local geometric and semantic information, enabling robust, uncertainty-aware mapping in complex outdoor scenarios. Comprehensive evaluation across diverse off-road and urban outdoor environments demonstrates consistent improvements in mapping quality, uncertainty calibration, representational flexibility, and robustness, while maintaining real-time efficiency."

Effectively utilizing this data for marketing and customer management is crucial for enterprises. Customer value prediction, a key task, aims to predict the revenue value of customers for the platform. Although various customer value prediction models have been proposed in existing studies, challenges remain in dealing with the complexity of heterogeneous interaction data and quantifying customer value. This is particularly because the process of data collection and obtaining customer value labels heavily relies on extensive manual annotation. To address these challenges, we propose SPHGraph, a self-supervised pre-training framework tailored for heterogeneous graphs, driven by pseudo labels automatically extracted from the data. SPHGraph integrates three core components: a pseudo label initialization module to provide structure-aware supervision, a representation learning module to capture semantic and structural information from heterogeneous interactions, and a label refinement module that iteratively improves learning signals through attention-guided propagation. This design allows the model to learn robust and transferable representations under label-scarce conditions. Extensive experiments across three real-world datasets consistently demonstrate the superior performance of SPHGraph compared to state-of-the-art baselines."

    "abstract": "Transfer-based adversarial attacks craft perturbations on a surrogate and transfer them to black-box models, yet most prior methods diversify perturbations in only one domain, spatial or frequency, which limits overall transferability. We introduce Frequency-Channel-Structure Augmentation, FCSA, a multi-domain attack that jointly enriches perturbations in the frequency, color-channel, and spatial-structure spaces. FCSA couples lightweight frequency masking with Channel Fusion, a stochastic linear mixing across RGB channels, and MultiPattern Structured Perturbation that injects multi-orientation and multi-scale texture fields. The branch gradients are fused with data-dependent nonnegative weights normalized to sum to one, yielding a single update direction and reducing inter-branch conflict. By expanding surrogate diversity across complementary domains, FCSA produces adversarial examples with stronger black-box transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong transferability on both standard and defended models. The method can be combined with a wide range of existing techniques to further improve the transferability of adversarial examples.

    "abstract": "To diagnose the transport-layer fault in RDMA for ensuring the reliability of data center networks (DCN), the existing RDMA pingmesh (R-Pingmesh) technology often requires manual analysis to identify the root causes of faults. However, the fault identification faces challenges in few-shot training for rare faults and prominent fault-normal data imbalance. To address the challenges, this paper proposes an LSTMbased fault classifier: The model pre-training phase captures general fault patterns to alleviate the difficulty of few-shot training for rare faults. To deploy the model in the target DCN, it uses supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with the data obtained from the network to adapt to the different network topological characteristics. Through such training, this classifier enables finegrained RDMA transport-layer fault diagnosis across multiple network topologies, achieving accurate classification of various fault types and fine-grained localization from “abnormal paths” to “fault segments”. This collaborative design of pre-training and topology adaptation achieves key challenges of few-shot learning under data distribution imbalance for accurate distinction and localization of RDMA transport-layer faults. Our experiments show that this method performs excellently on datasets from different typical DCN, providing an effective technical solution for the automated diagnosis of RDMA transport-layer faults."

To address these issues, this paper proposes the AS-Mamba framework, which introduces a Mamba structure with linear complexity into the field of image segmentation. Firstly, an Asymmetric Cross Mamba module is constructed to dynamically integrate complementary information from RGB and X modalities through an attention weight allocation strategy and enhanced cross-modal semantic alignment, enabling crossmodal dynamic interaction and global feature fusion. Secondly, a Spatial Perception Mamba module is designed to enhance fine-grained feature representation through a spatial-channel attention mechanism.

The proposed PINN is trained in order to learn the optimality conditions of the optimal control problem so that, after training, it can provide the solution with no significant computation effort. This one represents a promising alternative to the analytical computation of the optimal control (which is possible only in very simple settings), and to the solution of the optimal control problem with numerical methods, which requires significant time in the more complex and realistic settings. Numerical simulations are presented to evaluate the effectiveness of the trained PINN in solving the optimal control problem."

    "abstract": "This article is based on big data of vegetable sales, using time series machine learning algorithms and optimized mathematical models to study the optimal supply strategy. Firstly, based on big data analysis and the time series prediction machine learning algorithm, the wholesale price and sales volume of each vegetable from August 20 to September 20, 2024 were used to predict the wholesale price and sales volume of each vegetable on September 21. Then, constrained by multiple real-world conditions and with the replenishment quantity and pricing as decision variables, a 0-1 optimization model was established to solve for the purchase quantity and pricing strategy of each product when the supermarket's revenue was maximized on September 21st, ensuring the quality of fresh supermarket vegetables and achieving the maximization of fresh supermarket revenue."

    "abstract": "While integrated memory and computing (IMC) architectures can overcome the storage-computing bottlenecks of traditional architectures, existing mapping algorithms suffer from fixed block partitioning, neglect of load balancing, and difficulty balancing energy efficiency and accuracy. To address this issue, this paper designs a \"computing power-matched\" neural network model and a dynamic block sparse mapping (DBSM) algorithm. This model adapts to IMC characteristics through lightweight network layers, dynamic precision switching, and mixed-bit width quantization. The DBSM algorithm integrates dynamic block partitioning, sparse-aware mapping, and load balancing to achieve deep parameter adaptation to the architecture. An IMC simulation platform built on an FPGA was tested on ResNet-50 and YOLOv5s models, and on the ImageNet-1K and COCO 2017 datasets. The results showed that DBSM reduced inference latency by 17.9%-40.0% compared to traditional layer-by-layer mapping (LM), static block mapping (SBM), and sparse priority mapping (SPM), while increasing throughput by 15.7%-67.9%. Its energy efficiency reached 38.5 GOPS/W (ResNet-50) and 29.8 GOPS/W (YOLOv5s). Its Top-1 accuracy (76.2%) and mean average prediction accuracy (mAP) (56.8%) were less than 0.2% lower than those of the competing algorithms, achieving both performance and energy efficiency improvements while maintaining accuracy."

To deal with these issues, graphical computations are typically offloaded from mobile devices to edge servers. While traditional offloading strategies rely on static optimization or heuristics, this work proposes a multi–input data–driven dynamic control of uplink power and image compression rate, introducing a Policy Broadcasting Deep Reinforcement Learning approach, based on the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm. The proposed solution is aimed at matching the challenging Quality of Service constraints, in terms of maximum round–trip latency and minimum resolution accuracy, while minimizing the energy consumption. Simulations show the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed approach for real–time applications."

    "abstract": "The research on heterogeneous arithmetic scheduling faces two primary challenges: the fragmentation of behavioral and attribute semantics within knowledge graphs, and the absence of a systematic evaluation framework for graph embedding algorithms and the fitness of these algorithms for scheduling tasks. Current models demonstrate inadequacies in effectively integrating temporal information, and end-to-end architectures struggle to align knowledge representation with scheduling objectives. This study introduces the EHCRSM model, designed to enhance heterogeneous arithmetic resource scheduling through first-order connected graph embedding. The model seeks to unify heterogeneous semantics via a dual-stream architecture that incorporates knowledge and attention mechanisms, assess the influence of six distinct graph embedding algorithms, and facilitate personalized resource allocation by integrating the HC3 concept. Our findings indicate that while TransD embedding yields optimal results on the MovieLens dataset, DistMult scheduling demonstrates superior performance, suggesting a non-positive correlation between the two. The EHCRSM model approaches state-of-the-art performance on the MovieLens dataset and enhances personalized responses through adaptive positional encoding. This model establishes a novel paradigm for multi-semantic collaboration, and the fusion mechanism inherent in its architecture, along with the HC3 concept, is applicable across various domains, including intelligent computing and cloud computing."

    "abstract": "With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergencyaware reasoning framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{R}^{3}$</tex>) for heterogeneous intersections. <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{R}^{3}$</tex> adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with environment feedbackbased priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward highreward policies across heterogeneous intersections. On three realworld road networks with 17 to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods."

Most of researchers argue that cloud computing and artificial intelligence are the essential components in 6G and offer the better network automation and stronger communication security. In this paper, we propose a federated learning-empowered 6G network architecture and utilize its intelligence to propose an XAI-based pre-trained data interpretation model for network intrusion detection. At first, we design an architecture of 6G network that utilizes the computation capability of edge cloud and the intelligence of federated learning to enhance communication efficiency and data privacy of the future network paradigm. Then, we propose an efficient data interpretation model based on XAI that evaluates the importance level of datasets from data clients relative to the global model for network intrusion detection in 6G network. We apply the explanation result of the importance level of data clients and adjust the procedure of federated learning to further improve the prediction accuracy and the convergence speed of the global model for network intrusion detection. The results of extensive experiments show that the proposed pre-trained data interpretation model indeed improves the performance of network intrusion detection."

    "abstract": "Cervical cancer is one of the major causes of mortality in the world among women especially in those countries in which early screening and diagnostic methods are not readily available. This paper suggests a hybrid machine learning architecture, called XGB-AEStackNet, to perform low-error and explainable cervical cancer risk estimation via assessments of clinical history and behavioral characteristics. This model also adds a dual-domain autoencoder to encode the clinical and the behaviors features into domains separately into latent representations and later recombined and re-weighted by a SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) into ranks in order to give more weight to informative attributes. The stacked ensemble is made of XGBoost, LightGBM, and meta-learner logistic regression to classify these transformed features. The model was tested using the UCI Cervical Cancer (Risk Factors) Dataset that contained 36 attributes across 858 patient records. With a test accuracy of 92.2 percent, F1-score of 91.4 percent and an AUC score of 94.8 percent, the proposed model showed an improved performance in comparison to baseline models such as CNN, Random Forest and SVM. Moreover, the model recorded a shorter time of inference per sample (1.6 ms) and scores higher in explainability (0.93) in both cases thus showing its translational potential to real-world application in addition to ease of interpretation. SHAP analysis indicated principal characteristics that model decisions were based on to include age, HPV diagnosis, and history of smoking. The study presents a clinically useful, interpretable AI system of cervical cancer screening in its initial stages. Use of feature extraction, interpretability, and decision by ensemble classification area allows both accuracy and clarity, which qualifies the system to be used in public health interventions and telemedicine programs."

Microservice architecture, with its modularity and loose coupling, has emerged as a viable solution. However, the intricate interactions between microservices expose the limitations of existing resource scheduling strategies. This paper proposes a novel resource scheduling approach for microservice container clusters based on resource prediction and user request characteristics. We first build a Kubernetes (K8s)-based Power grid service system and collect datasets through simulation. A Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based time series prediction model, G-TimesNet, is then designed to improve resource prediction accuracy. Then, an intelligent scaling and load balancing strategy is introduced, leveraging both the prediction model and user request features. Experimental results show that our approach can increase the request success rate to more than 95%, reduce response time by about 80%, and significantly outperform traditional algorithms in prediction accuracy."

The different availability of local measurements compared to those coming from the other vehicles in the team can create situations where one vehicle is forced to generate an estimate based on measurements that are heavily unbalanced toward one source. This negatively impacts the numerical balance of the regressor matrix used for the estimation, potentially leading to biased results.

Furthermore, re-association of targets after long-term disappearance remains a bottleneck. To resolve these issues, we propose a multi-layer fusion framework that strategically integrates and transforms hierarchical backbone features, simultaneously enhancing ReID accuracy while mitigating feature conflicts with detection demands. Additionally, a Long-Short-Term Cascaded Matching algorithm reliably associates long-disappeared targets. Comprehensive evaluations on VisDrone-2019MOT and UAVDT datasets substantiate the superior performance of our approach."

However, its ability in capturing comprehensive image features, especially in boundary delineation and fine-grained details, remains limited. While recent studies have explored various architectural enhancements, the potential of frequency domain analysis in complementing state space models has remained largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose FVM-UNet, a framework that integrates the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) with VM-UNet to enhance medical image segmentation. Our approach maintains the computational efficiency of state space models while incorporating frequency domain features to improve feature representation and boundary detection. With carefully designed FFT modules and feature fusion mechanisms, FVM-UNet effectively combines spatial and frequency domain information to achieve superior segmentation accuracy. Extensive evaluation performed on the ISIC2017 and ISIC2018 datasets reveal that FVM-UNet consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving mIoU improvements of approximately 0.58% on ISIC2017 and 0.13% on ISIC2018 over VM-UNet. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our frequency domain integration. Our work establishes a new direction for integrating the Fast Fourier Transform in state space model-based medical image segmentation."

Through the application of diffusion approximation of the inventory level and incorporating intensity-price dependence, we derive a practical approximation for the optimal weight function that remains computationally efficient even for substantial lot sizes. The case of leftovers’ salvage has been considered. For two types of near-optimal weight functions the expected revenues are obtained, and numerical examples of their maximization with respect to an unknown constant are presented."

PCA detects independent major components, and permutation-based feature importance reaffirms that city and cuisine are the most influential predictors. The paper presents a solid case that customer behaviour, culture, restaurant diversity, and the company's recommendation system work together to form a significant part of Swiggy's digital ecosystem, delivering crucial insights for the purveyors, techies, and marketers to tune their approaches, increase the customer satisfaction level, and further develop accurate predictive models for the food delivery sector."

In this work, microneedles made from biodegradable materials are designed and simulated for drug delivery systems. Different materials and dimensions are analyzed through stress and laminar flow studies to evaluate their performance. Biodegradable materials are chosen since they are safer for the environment and suitable for biomedical use. Stress analysis is carried out to study the effect of needle insertion on the skin, while flow analysis helps in understanding the velocity and pressure distribution of the drug. Additionally, micro/nano pumps are designed and simulated to handle small fluid volumes, ensuring controlled drug delivery.

    "abstract": "Accurate wind-power forecasting is essential for grid stability and the reliable integration of renewable energy sources. However, dynamic weather regimes and turbine nonlinearities introduce uncertainties that challenge conventional interval prediction techniques. Traditional conformal prediction methods, despite distribution-free, typically presume data exchangeability and disregard temporal dependencies, heteroscedasticity, and physical constraints on normalized power output. To address these limitations, a Physics-Informed Adaptive Conformal Pre diction (PI-ACP) framework is developed for uncertainty-aware wind-power forecasting. The method introduces a regime-aware, temporally weighted nonconformity scoring mechanism that emphasizes recent residuals and adapts prediction intervals to evolving meteorological conditions, particularly during wind ramp events. Physical feasibility is ensured through physics aware interval constraints that restrict predicted power within the normalized range [0, 1]. Moreover, the framework is extended to multi-step forecasting by employing a multivariate conformity score that enables joint uncertainty calibration across several future horizons. Comprehensive evaluations on two utility-scale wind-farm datasets demonstrate that PI-ACP produces sharper and more reliable prediction intervals than existing state-of-the art baselines while maintaining linear-time computational efficiency. The proposed PI-ACP framework improves probabilistic forecasting performance by up to 44% compared with existing state-of-the-art methods, offering sharper and more reliable prediction intervals for diverse wind regimes. The proposed approach provides physics-consistent and adaptively calibrated uncertainty quantification suitable for real-time operational planning in power systems with high wind-energy penetration."

Unlike prior approaches that rely on explicit recurrent architectures or post hoc extraction methods, our formulation symbolically encodes automaton states as binary vectors, transitions as sparse matrix transformations, and nondeterministic branching—including ε-closures—as compositions of shared thresholded updates. We prove that every regular language can be recognized exactly by such a shared-parameter unrolled feedforward network, with parameter count independent of input length. Our construction yields a constructive equivalence between NFAs and neural networks and demonstrates <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">empirical learnability</i>: these networks can be trained via gradient descent on supervised acceptance data to recover the target automaton behavior. This learnability, formalized in Proposition V.1, is the crux of this work. Extensive experiments validate the theoretical results, achieving perfect or near-perfect agreement on acceptance, state propagation, and closure dynamics. This work clarifies the correspondence between automata theory and modern neural architectures, showing that unrolled feedforward networks can perform precise, interpretable, and trainable symbolic computation."

    "abstract": "Oscillator networks play an important role as abstractions of biological neural networks. As such, electrical implementations of oscillator networks are promising candidates for future computing hardware. The FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillator (FNO) is an example for a bio-inspired oscillator used for implementing electrical neural networks. For the design of oscillator networks for neuromorphic computing, understanding synchronization dynamics is important. Interpretable synchronization criteria contribute to that as they enable the synthesis of e.g. effective coupling circuits and topologies. In this work, we deal with a sufficient synchronization criterion that is applicable to FNOs but framed in the language of control theory. This entails that it is disconnected from physical quantities which complicates interpretation and application. We address this issue by retracing the criterion purely in the electrical domain for the special case of networks of FNOs. This restatement shows that synchronization is guaranteed if the coupling circuit dissipates more incremental power than the locally active nonlinearities of the oscillators inject. We present emulation results of an exemplary setup to illustrate this. The insights gained through this work are an important precursor to formulating a general synchronization criterion for oscillator networks in the electrical domain."

    "abstract": "Continuum robots have shown great potential in unstructured environments due to their inherent compliance and safety. Pneumatic actuation is particularly suitable for such applications, offering high power density and robustness. However, achieving controllable multimodal deformation with adequate load capacity remains challenging, especially for origami-inspired robots whose motion is often passively coupled across all creases. To address this, this paper presents a pneumatically driven continuum robot based on the Yoshimura origami pattern, incorporating active crease control as its core innovation. By strategically arranging rigid and compliant materials and co-optimizing crease parameters, we enable independent and localized actuation of selected folds, transforming origami deformation from globally passive to actively controllable. The fabricated prototype achieves a maximum length of 1.1 m with an extension ratio of 2.6:1, and demonstrates both continuous and segmental deformation for adaptive wrapping around complex objects. Moreover, it exhibits significant load capacity—5 kg horizontally and 20 kg vertically—substantially advancing the practical utility of origami-based continuum robots in real-world tasks."

To establish such a secure system, high-quality and high-speed random numbers are essential. Here, high-quality random-numbers are defined as statistically unbiased, non-reproducible, and unpredictable values. One approach to generating such numbers is to exploit physical random phenomena, such as chaos. In particular, chaos in Josephson junctions (JJs) under radio-frequency (RF) irradiation has been identified as a suitable mechanism for random-number generation. In this study, we considered RF-biased intrinsic Josephson junctions (IJJs) in a mesa-type Bi <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$_{2}$</tex-math></inline-formula> Sr<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$_{2}$</tex-math></inline-formula>CaCu <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$_{2}$</tex-math></inline-formula> O<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$_{8+\\delta }$</tex-math></inline-formula> single crystal. Since the interactions among stacked IJJs must be considered, it is insufficient to evaluate their properties using the conventional resistively and capacitively shunted junction (RCSJ) circuit model. Instead, we numerically investigated the chaotic voltage of an IJJ stack irradiated with higher frequencies than those typically used in conventional RF systems, employing the capacitively coupled JJ model with diffusion current, which incorporates interlayer interactions. Based on the time-series output voltage of the IJJ, we then generated random-numbers and evaluated their quality using statistical tests."

    "abstract": "Traditional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approaches in large language models (LLMs) often miss long-range semantic dependencies. As a result, early reasoning errors may cause subsequent cascading failures. To address these issues, we introduce AACoT, a fine-tuning framework that integrates associative memory and adaptive error correction within the CoT reasoning process. The AACoT memory functions in a dualmode capacity that differentiates entity-level knowledge from relation-level knowledge, facilitating dynamic knowledge interaction and efficient retrieval for reasoning. The adaptive error correction mechanism monitors the reasoning process, backtracks upon error detection, and regenerates the corrected reasoning paths. To improve robustness, a prompt refinement module adjusts short-term memory by collecting frequent error patterns to direct future reasoning, and a memory warm-up strategy loads crucial knowledge in advance of inference to minimize dependency on additional training. In the inference process, AACoT produces several reasoning paths and employs weighted voting to determine the final result. Results from experiments conducted on mathematical reasoning benchmarks reveal significant improvements in accuracy, validating that AACoT provides a clear and effective method for enhancing complex reasoning in foundational LLMs."

Firstly, the Euler discretization method is adopted to establish a discrete-time vehicle-road system model. Key state variables such as lateral error and heading error are incorporated into the system state space, laying a foundation for subsequent control design. Secondly, considering the characteristics of DoS attacks (i.e., randomly triggered and energy-constrained), a Bernoulli random variable is used to model the activation behavior of such attacks, thereby accurately characterizing the intermittent interference caused by attacks on sensor-controller communication links. To ensure the robustness of the system under attacks and disturbances, an appropriate Lyapunov function is selected. Through stability analysis, the sufficient conditions satisfying performance index are derived, which guarantee the asymptotic stability and disturbance rejection capability of the closed-loop system, and realize the effective convergence of trajectory tracking errors. Finally, a co-simulation platform integrating Carsim and Simulink is established, which verifies the effectiveness and engineering applicability of the proposed method."

To linearize RF power amplifiers, the Generalized Memory Polynomial model is widely used as an inverse dynamical function. However, due to its large number of required terms, many studies focus on reducing implementation complexity. This work mainly uses the doubly orthogonal matching pursuit approach to select active terms while incorporating the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to enhance linearization performance. The proposed method achieves a linearity performance nearly equivalent to that of the full model, while significantly reducing the search time for the optimal structure. It’s applied to the linearization of an Open Radio Station for LTE/5G applications, including an asymmetrical two-stage 10W Doherty power amplifier implemented in GaN technology. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art approaches, such as the Gradient method and the Least-Squares algorithm, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better linearization performance in terms of spectral regrowths reduction and lower computational complexity."

Despite their proven effectiveness in commercial applications, IVDR adoption remains limited due to high costs and accessibility issues, with most systems designed for commercial fleets rather than individual consumers. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the impact of IVDR feedback mechanisms on driver performance, integrating both literature review and practical experiments involving smartphone sensors and On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) data. The research combines findings from existing studies with newly collected datasets to analyze driving behavior across various conditions. We examine the influence of real-time feedback on key metrics such as harsh acceleration, braking frequency, speed variation, and fuel consumption through a dual-approach methodology. Our experiments achieved 89.2% classification accuracy using consumer-grade smartphone sensors and successfully extracted critical vehicle parameters from OBD-II ports across different vehicle generations, demonstrating broad compatibility with existing vehicle infrastructure. We developed four real-time feedback algorithms to provide immediate driver guidance, addressing safety, efficiency, and vehicle maintenance. The findings reveal the effectiveness of IVDRs in promoting safer driving habits and highlight opportunities for technological enhancements. Additionally, the research proposes innovative solutions to enhance the accessibility and affordability of IVDR technology, thereby democratizing safer driving practices.

The GLS contains all generated samples (GSs) of the GM, capturing combinations of features and their variations present in the GM's training set, thereby enhancing the comprehensiveness of testing. Moreover, the plane organizes all GSs into a continuous space with regular variations in features, enabling users to conduct cross-scale exploration to understand the DNN's behavior across different levels of feature granularity. Our research focuses on two challenges in achieving and applying the idea. First, the GLS is unvisualizable due to its high dimensionality and unboundedness. We thus project the GLS onto a plane and visualize the DNN's performance on this plane. The plane serves as a surrogate for the GLS, providing rich visual cues for locating regions containing GSs involving performance-relevant patterns. Second, the plane alone is insufficient for performance exploration. To overcome this, we develop a system based on it. The system comprises two main views that integrate interactions, such as panning and zooming, to enable users to observe any plane region and assess the DNN's performance on the corresponding GSs. We also develop three auxiliary views to facilitate pattern exploration and to diagnose factors that lead to specific performance patterns. Experimental results demonstrate the usability and effectiveness of our approach."

    "abstract": "Traditional financial lending systems face ongoing issues. These include too much involvement from middlemen, limited financial inclusion, a lack of transparency, and centralized decision-making. Such problems push unbanked and underbanked populations to the margins. This paper presents a blockchain-based decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) credit system built on the Ethereum network. It uses smart contracts and Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) frameworks that are transparent, secure, and accessible worldwide. Traditional financial institutions still rely heavily on centralized models. These models involve many intermediaries, slow processes, and high operational costs. As a result, many people have restricted access to financial services. According to the World Bank's Global Findex Database, around 1.7 billion adults are unbanked and shut out from essential financial systems. This exclusion often stems from strict eligibility requirements, lack of credit history, and absence of collateral. It not only hampers individual financial growth but also limits broader economic inclusion in developing nations. The proposed model eliminates the need for centralized institutions. It speeds up transactions, increases transparency, and allows for borderless digital lending. The system architecture uses Solidity for smart contract development, Web3.js for blockchain interaction, and a React-based user interface to create a robust full-stack decentralized application (DApp). The framework features automated asset collateralization, AI-driven interest rate modeling, trust-score-based borrower assessment, and community governance mechanisms. Performance comparisons show marked improvements in transaction speed, efficiency, and financial access compared to traditional lending models. The prototype achieves a 65% reduction in infrastructure costs and an 80% faster loan settlement time across different regions."

The N Queens problem is where Queens are to be placed on a N*N matrix that represents a chessboard such that no two queens are able to be in contact with each other. The textbook solution for the problem is to use backtracking, a problem-solving algorithmic technique that involves finding a solution incrementally and reverting to the previous state when one route is blocked. This approach can become computationally infeasible when the value of N is too large. By implementing the solution using a genetic algorithm we see a sharp drop in the complexity and the time taken for higher values of N. We compare and contrast the approach with the backtracking method and conclude the superior efficiency of genetic algorithm for this particular problem."

However, existing architectures often rigidly separate streaming and batch processing, leading to inefficiencies in resource utilization and delayed responses. This paper proposes a novel Adaptive Data Processing Framework (ADPF) that dynamically switches between streaming and micro-batching modes based on real-time contextual factors such as data criticality, network latency, and computational load. By integrating a reinforcement learning (RL)-based decision algorithm, ADPF optimizes the trade-off between latency, cost, and prediction accuracy. Implemented within an Industrial IoT (IIoT) and Big Data ecosystem, the framework improves maintenance scheduling, reduces operational costs by 30%, and ensures timely interventions. The experimental results demonstrate a 25% improvement in the accuracy of failure prediction and a 40% reduction in maximum CPU load compared to static architectures."

Unknown parameters are determined by solving nonlinear equations using the continuous-time Newton’s method. For clarity, the proposed technique is demonstrated through two illustrative examples.

    "abstract": "Nighttime surveillance suffers from degradation due to poor illumination and arduous human annotations. It is challengable and remains a security risk at night. Existing methods rely on multi-spectral images to perceive objects in the dark, which are troubled by color absence. We argue that the ultimate solution for nighttime surveillance is night-to-day translation, or Night2Day, which aims to translate a surveillance scene from nighttime to the daytime while maintaining semantic consistency. To achieve this, this paper presents a Disentangled Contrastive (DiCo) learning method. Specifically, to address the poor and complex illumination in the nighttime scenes, we propose a learnable physical prior, i.e., the color invariant, which provides a stable perception of a highly dynamic night environment and can be incorporated into the learning pipeline of neural networks. Targeting the surveillance scenes, we develop a disentangled representation, which is an auxiliary pretext task that separates surveillance scenes into the foreground and background with contrastive learning. Such a strategy can extract the semantics without supervision and boost our model to achieve instanceaware translation. Finally, we incorporate all the modules above into generative adversarial networks and achieve high-fidelity translation. This paper also contributes a new surveillance dataset called NightSuR. It includes six scenes to support the study on nighttime surveillance. This dataset collects nighttime images with different properties of nighttime environments, such as flare and extreme darkness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing works significantly."

    "abstract": "The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has greatly boosted large-scale crowdsensing, where truth discovery (TD) technique is a feasible solution to extract more reliable data from heterogeneous measurements or noisy environment. However, most existing approaches send raw readings to a centralized server, implicitly fully trusting the server and fog nodes. In practice, these nodes are geographically dispersed, outsourced, and operated by different parties, making such blanket trust untenable. To address these threats, a verifiable, robust, and privacy-preserving truth discovery (VRPTD) framework is proposed. Specifically, VRPTD shields individual reports through a lightweight dual-layer mechanism that combines unbiased expected mask correction with modular arithmetic encryption. Data requesters can publicly audit the result via linear homomorphic hash proof. VRPTD redesigns the weight update step using a Gaussian radial basis function distance, which yields more accurate processing of multidimensional measurements. Security analysis indicates that VRPTD satisfies verifiability under a well-defined threat model. Extensive experiments on real-world IoT datasets demonstrate that VRPTD boosts baseline TD accuracy, halves convergence rounds and reduces communication and computation overhead, all while providing strong privacy and resilience against active attacks."

However, conventional systems often struggle with a single point of failure and insufficient support for intricate voting semantics, especially in ranked-choice elections requiring distinct ranking constraints. Although blockchain technology enhances fault tolerance and auditability, existing blockchainbased solutions primarily focus on simpler voting schemes, encountering difficulties in effectively verifying privacy-preserving ranked ballots. To address this gap, we propose AranVoting, an innovative blockchain-based ranked-choice voting scheme designed to ensure anonymity and fairness through homomorphic encryption. AranVoting employs a structured matrix ballot format alongside zero-knowledge proof to ensure the correctness of the ballot format. Furthermore, we introduce a smart contractdriven counting mechanism that facilitates the availability and transparency of ballot tallying through gradient incentive and committee election algorithms. Our security and performance evaluations demonstrate that AranVoting provides secure rankedchoice voting, effectively guaranteeing essential security properties such as anonymity, correctness, and verifiability while maintaining practicality and reasonable computational overhead throughout the voting process."

We have recently demonstrated coherent, continuous-wave THz detection up to 0.7 THz in multi-layer graphene devices with telecom-wavelength optical lasers. In the case of detection, the bias-free operation allows operation without any dark current.

    "abstract": "Reconfigurability allows robots to create new morphologies to better match their environment or task. This ability is often viewed as a form of robotic intelligence. The process of reconfiguration is typically achieved either by mechatronic modules that disassemble and reassemble themselves, or by malleable bodies, such as soft materials and linkage-like mechanisms with multiple degrees of freedom (DoFs). Despite these advances, the former approach can compromise robustness due to reconnections, while the latter often reduces controllability as the system’s DoFs proliferate. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel reconfigurable robot based on thick-panel rigid origami and exploit kinematic bifurcations, branch points in the configuration space, to realize multiple configurations without module reconnections and without increasing overall DoF. In our framing, the bifurcation mechanism constitutes the element of mechanical intelligence that enables the intelligent behavior of reconfiguration. As a proof of concept, we built a chain of interlinked rigid origami units that morphs among coil, wave-like, and triangular shapes, mimicking the morphology of a millipede. We also observe additional configurations due to compliant joint behavior relative to the ideal model. Furthermore, the robot’s dynamic performance and locomotion modes are explored. The work represents a further step toward real-world deployment of mechanically intelligent robots, illustrating the enabling role of bifurcation-guided reconfiguration."

Initially, a coarse screening is performed locally at the sub-processor using the speed limit method. Subsequently, relevant data is sent to a central processor where the STFTN dynamically generates intelligent thresholds to optimize the correlation range for candidate tracks. Finally, motion features of candidate tracks are extracted and fed into the STGCN in the central processor for secondary intelligent judgment, effectively distinguishing true tracks from false alarms. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves higher track initiation rates and fewer false tracks compared with traditional methods."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed machine learning paradigm, enables collaborative training of a central model across local nodes without sharing private data. However, it faces challenges such as high risks of white-box privacy attacks, large communication overhead, and difficulty in adapting to heterogeneous models. Federated Distillation (FD), which transfers knowledge among clients instead of exchanging parameters, has emerged as an alternative paradigm to address these challenges. Yet, under heterogeneous models and Non-IID data settings, FD suffers from global performance degradation due to knowledge bias, class imbalance, and model heterogeneity. To tackle this degradation issue, this paper proposes FedSDT, an enhanced federated distillation method for heterogeneous NonIID scenarios. Specifically, a dual-teacher distillation mechanism is introduced to alleviate the imbalance between global and local knowledge transfer and to mitigate the problem of “local forgetting”. A bidirectional knowledge filtering strategy is employed to select reliable samples and mine rare classes, preventing local models from losing knowledge of underrepresented categories. Furthermore, a class-aware balancing mechanism is designed to identify potential rare classes and dynamically weight the loss, thereby strengthening the model's focus on minority classes. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only ensures communication efficiency but also significantly improves model performance. It consistently outperforms baseline methods and effectively enhances the generalization capability of the FD framework."

However, previous research has primarily focused on simple rectangular gate structures, limiting further improvements in the antenna factor beneath the gate region. In this work, we overcome this limitation by proposing an asymmetric interdigitated grating gate structure integrated with a split-ring resonator (SRR) metasurface. Using full-wave simulations, we precisely extract the self-mixing electric field and quantify the antenna factor beneath the gate. Compared to conventional SRR-coupled TeraFET detectors, our design achieves a 29.5-fold enhancement in the antenna factor."

    "abstract": "The influence of financial news sentiment on stock market volatility is a critical area of financial research, yet it's predictive power in emerging markets like Indonesia remains underexplored. This paper investigates the short term impact of news sentiment on Indonesian stock prices by developing and evaluating deep learning models. Utilizing a dataset of around 2000 news articles from IDXChannel and corresponding stock data, we engineer a feature set that combines textual sentiment and crucial contexes market variables, including momentum, volume anomalies, and market trends. We employ two transformer models, FinBERT and IndoELECTRA, alongside a stacking ensemble model, to predict binary stock price direct (UP/DOWN) over a 1 hour horizon following a news release. Our results demonstrate that, all models failed to establish a reliable signal. Performance metrics MCC and Brier score, indicate that the model's predictions were no better than random change. The findings suggest that for the Indonesian stock market, impact from news sentiment is either priced in with extreme efficiency, making it undetectable in a short term window, or the signal is too weak to be distinguished from market noise with current situation."

The face recognition system used a multilevel optimisation strategy, primarily involving external model training (OpenCV, Dlib) and real-time inference on the Pi, achieving accurate results suitable for smart home environments, although continuous on-device reinforcement learning proved unfeasible due to hardware constraints. The gesture recognition system, designed for natural humancomputer interaction, supported six static gestures. Four deep learning models, including externally trained (VGG16, MediaPipe) and on-device trained (MobileNet with TensorFlow Lite) options, were evaluated. The model trained on-device using MediaPipe for hand landmark extraction and MobileNet/TensorFlow Lite provided the best balance of speed and efficiency. Ultimately, both projects successfully demonstrated the feasibility of deploying accurate and efficient machine learning applications on low-cost embedded platforms, offering a practical contribution to edge AI."

Therefore, guaranteeing the integrity and confidentiality of messages, as well as the authenticity of the sender's identity, is crucial for establishing reliable communication. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper proposes an improved unforgeable aggregate signcryption scheme for VANETs, where a receiver can efficiently verify the legitimacy of multiple message sources simultaneously. The scheme enhances the security and privacy of VANETs by deploying a mapping between anonymous identities and public keys on a blockchain. Security analysis demonstrated that, under the hardness assumptions of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP) and the Computational Diffie-Hellman Problem (CDHP), this scheme can achieve ciphertext unforgeability and confidentiality. Compared to existing related schemes, our proposed solution significantly reduces computational costs in both the signcryption and unsigncryption (especially in batch processing) phases."

    "abstract": "To address the low accuracy and poor adaptability of distribution network element partitioning at multiple time scales, this paper constructs a multi-time scale element partitioning model and proposes an adaptive adjustment algorithm based on multi-scale dynamic clustering. First, the electrical, topological, and load characteristics of distribution network elements are analyzed, and the network elements are divided into short-term (0-15 minutes), intraday (15 minutes to 24 hours), and long-term (⩾24 hours) scales, and corresponding objective functions and constraints are established. Next, a \"time-feature\" dual-driven algorithm framework is designed to improve performance through data preprocessing, optimized cluster center initialization, and a dynamic adjustment mechanism. Experiments are conducted using Intel Xeon Gold 6348 hardware and Ubuntu 20.04 using measured data from a 10kV distribution network in an eastern city (containing 356 elements) and virtual data of 1000 elements augmented by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The algorithm is compared with K-means and hierarchical clustering. Results show that the proposed algorithm achieves an average segmentation accuracy of 95.4% across all scenarios, improving by 7.7 and 5.6 percentage points compared to K-means (87.7%) and hierarchical clustering (89.8%), respectively. Processing 1,000 network elements takes 2.37 seconds, 18.3% and 32.6% less than K-means (2.90s) and hierarchical clustering (3.52s), respectively. The average adaptability index for scale switching is 0.92, significantly higher than that of the comparison algorithms. This algorithm can support distribution network fault handling, dispatch optimization, and long-term planning."

This system adopts a capacitor-based energy storage architecture, where the capacitor is charged to a desired voltage level and rapidly discharged through solid-state switches to produce nanosecond-scale pulses. A Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is employed as the digital control core, enabling precise and programmable modulation of pulse parameters. All of these contribute to three key features: adjustable pulse width ($80-400 \\mathrm{~ns}$), high output voltage (up to 2.4 kV), and tunable repetition frequency $(1-1000 \\mathrm{~Hz})$. To enhance safety and portability, all functional modules are integrated into a customdesigned plastic enclosure, experimentally validated through electrical measurements. To investigate the biological effect of the generated pulses, cell survival of murine pancreatic cancer (PanC02) was assessed via CCK-8 assay at five post-treatment time points: $0 \\mathrm{~h}, 6 \\mathrm{~h}, 24 \\mathrm{~h}, 48 \\mathrm{~h}$, and 72 h. The results reveal an inverse correlation between pulse width and cell survival, indicating that nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEFs) could serve as an effective and controllable treatment for targeted cancer cells.

However, conventional Lambertian scattering-based PG models typically assume uniform power distribution over scattering area, which can violate the power conservation law in scenarios with large tile sizes or strong scattering, leading to spectral radii exceeding unity and invalid matrix inversion. To overcome this limitation, this study developed a physically consistent PG framework that guarantees power conservation regardless of tile size or scattering coefficient. By deriving a closed-form integration expression based on the Lambertian scattering pattern through a coordinate transformation fixed to the receiving tile, the proposed model performs rigorous power integration on each tile. This formulation enables accurate evaluation of power exchange between arbitrarily oriented tiles while introducing only approximately 0.2% additional computational overhead. Simulation results confirm that the proposed model consistently maintains spectral radii below one under various conditions, ensuring both mathematical convergence and physical power conservation, whereas the conventional model violates the power conservation law in most large-scale scenarios. This improvement enhances the reliability and scalability of PG-based multi-link wireless channel modeling in large-scale environments, without sacrificing computational efficiency."

Convolutional operations are typically achieved using precision multipliers, but they face constraints in terms of power, area and delay, which constrain scalability of design that are limited in resources. This presents the case for introducing a Verilog Sobel design based around high-performance streaming architecture where line buffers process the pixel stream and convolution modules are computing gradients in real time. Subsequently, performance of the traditional precision segmented multipliers is compared with a hybrid approximate method. In this hybrid method, the more significant bits are illustrated as computed exactly for the precision required based on potential errors, and the less significant bits are computed approximately to save logic, power and delay. This balance is essential to manage efficient operation while maintaining errors within acceptable tolerances offers an edge detection task. This architecture was configured to provide scalability, energy savings and design flexibility. Overall, it is very amenable to practical application in the IoT, robotics and other real-time, low-power, embedded platforms."

However, given the inherent vulnerability of GNSS signals to radio-frequency interference (RFI), addressing safety concerns of GNSS-based positioning should be a necessary focus. To support the accurate and effective interference mitigation strategies, this research focuses on the interference nature discrimination, including both interference type and interference power level. Inspired by the profound capabilities of deep learning in image recognition, an improved adversarially-enhanced solution based on Generative Adversarial Network (AeGANet) is proposed, utilizing spectrogram of signals as feeding features. We focus on the pre-correction stage of the receiver, analyzing Intermediate Frequency (IF) signals using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), and feeding the 3-channel spectrogram with power heat mapping into the model. Key innovations of the adversarial model include the label encoding of the generator, the dual-part discriminator design, the detached-objective training approach, as well as the loss function design. These improvements enable the adversarial model to generate and extend the interference dataset, enhancing discriminator training and boosting interference discrimination performance. Evaluated based on a GNSS positioning scenario and an interference test platform with seven signal types across varying interference power levels, the proposed solution demonstrates superior accuracy and performance, laying a solid foundation for the future implementation of effective interference mitigation techniques."

This paper introduces ColorVisionTest, a web-based system using deep learning to evaluate CVD in an easy-to-access and interactive manner. The system utilizes a U-Net model that has been trained on a special synthetic dataset of colored images with varying shapes and colors to accurately perform pixel-level color segmentation. Users engage with the application by selecting particular colors within images, and in accordance with their performance, the system diagnoses particular types of CVD, including red-green deficiencies (protanopia and deuteranopia) or blue-yellow deficiencies (tritanopia). The dataset generation pipeline generates diverse images consisting of red, green, blue, and yellow objects, along with multi-channel masks for supervised learning. Experimental findings indicate the U-Net model performs robust color separation, reaching a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) around 0.95 (following traditional benchmarks for synthetic datasets; actual performance can differ). Developed with Flask, the web application returns real-time feedback, diagnostic results, and accuracy rates, promising a scalable solution for large-scale CVD screening.

At longer pump delays and scaling with excitation fluence, this phonon narrows, opposite to the typical temperature-induced broadening with additional deposited pump energy and consistent with a restoration of phonon degeneracy expected for a transition towards the more symmetric Immm phase. Additionally, above and below all phonon frequencies, dynamics in the optical conductivity align with our previous work suggesting nucleated domains of metallic surface states, in agreement with recent time-resolved ARPES results."

However, they still face two main challenges: 1) insufficient fusion of cross-modal information, leading to low semantic quality of the generated hash codes. 2) limited scalability for deployment in lightweight frameworks. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel cross-modal hashing method based on knowledge distillation, termed Fine-Grained Feature Fusion Knowledge Distillation Hashing (F<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>KDH). Specifically, the teacher model incorporates the AFM that thoroughly fuses heterogeneous information, effectively capturing salient semantic cues in cross-modal data to enhance the weighting of important regions. Moreover, we employ a cross-modal knowledge distillation strategy to transfer the rich semantic knowledge captured by the teacher to a deliberately lightweight student model, enabling it to learn compact yet expressive hash representations while greatly reducing computational complexity. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that, compared to existing cross-modal hashing methods, our approach achieves significant model compression without sacrificing retrieval accuracy."

The differentially heated cavity has straight hot left wall and cold right wall, the top wall is the adiabatic wall and the bottom wall involving the rounded corner is the insulated wall. The numerical results show that the presence of the rounded corner causes convective heat transfer to increase. A dataset involving inputs as Rayleigh number and the radius of the circular corner and output as the average Nusselt number along the hot left wall is collected from the numerical results. The machine learning techniques, neural networks, gaussian process regression and ensemble learning as well as RBF interpolation are deployed for modeling.

To address these challenges, we propose an efficient communication framework for heterogeneous collaborative perception. This framework integrates a shared-private feature decoupling module that disentangles cross-modal features into shared and private components, sharing only shared feature to improve communication efficiency. Additionally, we design a spatial redundancy elimination module to remove background information from transmitted features, further reducing bandwidth consumption. Collectively, these modules enable compact and communication-efficient perception capabilities across heterogeneous modalities, models, and tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly reduces communication overhead in complex heterogeneous scenarios while maintaining perception accuracy."

    "abstract": "Industry 4.0’s quick development and the introduction of 6G connectivity technologies have increased the need for intelligent, adaptable, and safe control systems in remote industrial settings. This research explores a Blockchain-Secured Multi- Agent Digital Twin and Deep Net Framework (BSMDTDF) to enhance real-time collaboration, system reliability, and operational efficiency across decentralized manufacturing networks. The framework utilizes IoT-driven smart manufacturing datasets with preprocessing for noise reduction and normalization. To create dynamic virtual recreations of physical assets and facilitate real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and performance enhancement, the framework makes use of Digital Twin (DT) technology. A Multi-Agent System (MAS) architecture supports decentralized decision-making, allowing autonomous agents to coordinate manufacturing resources and adapt to fluctuating production demands. To ensure data integrity and trust in distributed environments, a Blockchain layer with smart contracts secures inter-agent communication and transaction records. The integration of 6G networks provides ultra-low latency, massive device connectivity, and high-speed data transmission, significantly improving responsiveness and synchronization among distributed agents. Furthermore, Fuzzy PID control enhances process adaptability by dynamically tuning parameters under uncertain and nonlinear operating conditions. To further improve predictive accuracy and control optimization, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model is incorporated to learn temporal dependencies and forecast control behavior for enhanced stability and precision. Experimental simulations demonstrate f1-score (98.41%), accuracy (98.56%), recall (98.23%), and precision (99.53%) compared to conventional methods. The BSMDTDF framework establishes sustainable manufacturing through the convergence of blockchain security, DT intelligence, 6G connectivity, multi-agent coordination, fuzzy adaptive control, and DL framework."

    "abstract": "This paper examines the challenge of recognizing emotions by combining fleeting facial micro-expressions with slower physiological responses, acknowledging that each modality alone often provides an incomplete picture of human affect. To address this, the study adopts an adaptive deep-learning framework designed to align sub-second facial events with incremental physiological signals, adjust its fusion strategy according to real-time reliability and generalize across subjects and datasets. The methodology integrates high-frame-rate micro-expression sequences captured at 200 frames per second with synchronized physiological windows, processed through separate encoders and merged through a gating mechanism that learns how much emphasis each modality deserves at different moments. Using this framework, the fused model achieved an accuracy of 85.2 percent and an F1 score of 0.84, outperforming facial only and physiology only models and maintaining 80.3 percent accuracy even when one modality was intentionally removed during inference. Cross dataset tests further confirmed strong generalization, with the fused model reaching 78.6 percent accuracy on unseen data while preserving stable temporal alignment and improved calibration behavior. The paper concludes that the proposed approach offers a more resilient and trustworthy solution for emotion recognition, especially in settings where signals fluctuate or user conditions vary widely."

All participants supply organic residues (in liquid or solid form), and some are also customers who require to receive and use the co-product. The residues are transported to the plant by two types of truck (tanker and solid bulk) of different capacities, where they are transformed by anaerobic digestion. The resulting co-product, a digestate used as an organic fertilizer, must then be efficiently distributed to the customers. The main objective of this project is to size a fleet of trucks adapted to the needs and capacity of the plant under study and minimize transportation costs. After defining and modeling the problem by using mathematical optimization, several scenarios reflecting different transportation strategies (backhauling and heterogeneous truck fleet configuration) have been tested. This article presents and compares the results of the different scenarios, highlighting the economic benefits and suggesting future research avenues. The preliminary results show that substantial transportation cost savings can be obtained by using backhauling and a heterogeneous fleet, reaching up to 17% when both are combined while decreasing the traveled distance by up to 42%."

Compared with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks commonly employed in similar detection tasks, GRUs offer improved computational efficiency, while NADAM contributes to stable and effective convergence in non-convex optimization settings. Rather than relying on generic neural models, the proposed design explicitly aligns the GRU input structure with the one-sided inter-symbol interference (ISI) span of FTN signaling, enabling the network to learn interference patterns efficiently without incurring unnecessary complexity. This structured integration results in reduced computational burden and enhanced convergence behavior. Simulation results demonstrate that the NADAM-optimized GRU achieves bit error rate (BER) performance close to the optimal BCJR algorithm for <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\tau \\geq 0.7$</tex-math></inline-formula>, while offering superior computational efficiency compared with conventional deep learning-based detectors.

This paper presents a Hierarchical Attention based GRU–Transformer (HA-GRU-T) model that combines Gated Recurrent Units for short-term dependency modeling with Transformer based self-attention for long-range contextual learning. The model employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to provide interpretability at both local and global temporal scales. Four feature selection methodologies Pearson Correlation, Information Gain (IG), Random Forest Importance (RFI), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were carefully assessed alongside advanced deep learning (DL) baselines, including Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Transformer models. Experimental findings on the Credit Card Fraud Detection benchmark dataset demonstrate that PCA consistently provides the most efficient feature representation. The HA-GRU-T model, integrated with PCA, attained an accuracy of 99.0%, precision of 98.6%, recall of 97.8%, and an F1-score of 98.2%, surpassing all baseline models.

For the experimental protocol, 20 participants, 10 young and 10 older adults, were recruited. The test consisted of four basic wrist movements: radial deviation, ulnar deviation, flexion, and extension, which were performed in random order under the guidance of the ULRR GUI. The sEMG analysis indicated that older adults tend to overuse specific muscles and exhibit a higher percentage of compensatory movements $(38.5 \\%)$ than younger participants $(24.25 \\%)$. The study’s findings enable the identification of age-related differences in muscle activation and compensation, aiding the design of personalized rehabilitation programs and improved devices to enhance motor function in older adults."

    "abstract": "Industrial heat processes are one of the most energy-intensive and polluting activities in the industry. Concentrated solar energy could be used to supply thermal energy to industrial processes, however, the intermittency of this energy source makes it difficult to satisfy a specific energy demand. Adaptation to this high variability can be achieved by using real-time control of solar plants in combination with energy storage systems. To address this issue, this paper presents a real-time control strategy of a parabolic trough solar plant used to produce industrial heat. The control strategy uses a Model-based Predictive Control (MPC) method based on an optimization algorithm, with the objective of satisfying a heat demand by modifying the mass flow rate of the heat transfer fluid in the storage system, which is a thermocline tank. In order to determine the behaviour of the solar plant, the optimization algorithm requires forecasts of solar irradiance, however, it is well-known that short-term forecasts of this quantity are difficult to obtain due to atmospheric disturbances. Therefore, the influence of forecast errors has been assessed to ensure the robustness of the control strategy using available forecast models: a smart persistence of incident solar energy and a model relying on the analysis of ground-based sky images. The integration of these predictions has also been studied to reduce the performance loss due to forecast errors by adapting the forecast horizon and integrating measured data."

This approach integrates theory of characteristic modes (TCM) with the fast multipole method (FMM) to accelerate the computation of total scattering contributions, including individual object scattering and mutual coupling effects. To accurately account for mutual coupling effects induced by scattering fields between objects, we introduce a novel coupling modal weighting coefficient (CMWC), extending the conventional modal weighting coefficient (MWC). The total scattering fields are obtained through a linear superposition of dominant modes weighted by both MWC and CMWC. Additionally, a dual-scheme FMM is proposed to enhance computational efficiency. The first scheme employs MLFMA for pairwise electromagnetic coupling calculations, while the second scheme utilizes a K-means clustering algorithm to efficiently manage large multi-object systems. Numerical results confirm the method’s accuracy, demonstrating a significant reduction in memory requirements and computational complexity, achieving approximately <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O(N)</i> scaling observed in numerical simulations."

In order to achieve this, we introduce a direct current (DC)-voltage control scheme consisting of a slow and a very fast controller that allow the cell voltages and the DC-voltages to drop or rise by up to 10% in order to provide an energy reserve for inertia emulation, while protecting the system from over- and undervoltages.

Simulations show the performance of the system to provide inertia when the frequency in the power grid drops. The protection scheme is activated only when the DCvoltage drops below (or rises above) predefined thresholds, and is able to prevent the DC-voltage from leaving the allowed range. The control scheme is validated in simulations and compared to a more standard control scheme, where a fast DC-voltage controller is employed at one terminal."

Existing methods based on static representation learning have limited expressive capabilities in modeling complex traffic semantic relationships, making it difficult to effectively identify hidden advanced threat behaviors. To address this issue, this paper proposes a score- guided diffusion graph contrastive learning framework for network traffic anomaly detection. The framework models network traffic as graph structures, learns traffic representation features through Deep Graph Infomax (DGI), and introduces diffusion models to perform controllable noise perturbations on normal traffic, thereby enhancing the model's ability to characterize normal distributions.The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of Expected Perturbation Score (EPS) as a quantitative indicator of anomaly degree. By training a score network to predict gradient information during the diffusion process, the method calculates expected response values under different perturbation intensities to identify anomalous patterns. Higher EPS values indicate that the traffic sample deviates more significantly from the normal distribution, suggesting a higher probability of anomaly.Experimental results on the CTU-13 dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves excellent performance in detecting complex threats such as botnets and malware communications, with improvements of 5%~6% in accuracy and recall compared to existing methods, validating the effectiveness and robustness of the approach in network anomaly detection scenarios."

    "abstract": "An interferometric optical phase stabilization system is proposed and demonstrated for application in photomixing-based terahertz (THz) generation. The system suppresses phase fluctuations between dual optical paths by utilizing a backward-propagating pilot lightwave in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) configuration. A feedback-controlled piezoelectric fiber stretcher, driven by a proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller, actively corrects phase drift in real time. Time- and frequency-domain analyses confirm that low-frequency noise, specifically a 0.22 Hz drift component, is reduced by over 97% (∼32dB suppression). The stabilization scheme is compact, low-complexity, and directly applicable to photomixing-based THz sources, ensuring improved spectral purity and power stability."

    "abstract": "As smart grids undergo profound evolution towards digitalisation and intelligentisation, the real-time and accurate monitoring and assessment of operational status at smart substations—the core hubs of the grid—become pivotal to ensuring grid security and stability. Traditional monitoring methods suffer from data silos, disconnect between physical and virtual domains, and delayed evaluation, rendering them inadequate for complex operational scenarios. This paper proposes a digital twin-based monitoring and evaluation scheme for smart substation operational status. Firstly, a four-layer architecture system is established, encompassing the physical entity layer, data interaction layer, virtual twin layer, and service application layer, achieving precise mapping across multiple physical domains and dimensions within the substation. Secondly, a multi-source data fusion monitoring mechanism is designed, leveraging edge computing and cloud-based collaborative processing of heterogeneous data—including electrical, mechanical, and environmental—to enhance monitoring timeliness. Finally, a three-tier assessment model— comprising an indicator system, weight allocation, and comprehensive evaluation—is established. Integrating the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) with fuzzy comprehensive evaluation enables quantitative grading of substation operational status. Using a 220kV smart substation as the experimental subject, a digital twin simulation platform was constructed. Through normal operating condition and fault simulation experiments, the system demonstrated: 98.7% accuracy in monitoring data, 96.3% consistency between state assessments and actual operating conditions. This effectively enhances substation operation and maintenance efficiency alongside fault early warning capabilities, providing technical support for the full lifecycle management of smart substations."

The spectral response at higher frequencies originates from the bending vibrations of hydrogen- bonded water molecules. Additionally, we explored the interaction between BP and terahertz light. The frequency dependence of the infrared light-vibration coupling coefficient was found to be nearly linear, which is not typically expected in glassy materials and indicates the need for refinement in current theoretical descriptions."

The transmission system utilizes a \"one-station-one-node\" MEC deployment, combining Kalman filter preprocessing with LZ77 compression (reducing data volume by 60%). A dedicated 5G slice (uplink/downlink bandwidth of 20/10 Mbps) and HARQ+LDPC security are designed, resulting in end-to-end latency of ≤50ms and packet loss rate of ≤0.5%. The ITCN embeds a channel-temporal dual attention mechanism, adds three-scale parallel branches (K=3/5/7), and uses depthwise separable convolution for lightweighting (reducing the number of parameters by 68.3%). A 10,000-set data set (split 7:3) was constructed based on a 10kV reactor platform. Simulations showed that 5G+MEC achieved a latency of 22ms (a 74.1% reduction compared to 4G) and a 1.1% packet loss rate for 25MB of data (compared to 8.7% for 4G). The ITCN test set achieved an accuracy of 98.7%, representing improvements of 6.2%, 10.5%, and 8.3% over traditional TCN (92.5%), CNN (88.2%), and LSTM (90.4%), respectively. The recall rate for mild inter-turn short circuits reached 96.5%, and the inference time was 18ms, meeting the real-time diagnostic requirements of the project."

To assess the material parameters precisely, accurately determining the time origin of time-domain waveforms is indispensable. Here, we propose and demonstrate an analytical method for correcting the shift of the time origin due to temperature change in the fiber-laser-based THz-TDS. Based on the simple criterion that the complex refractive index spectra should be smoothest, the degree of thermal phase shift can be evaluated successfully. Using the proposed method, we can determine the dispersive complex refractive index of poly(lactic) acid thin film. Because our method has no complicated assumptions, the presented method is also applicable to the phase-resolved spectroscopy based on the time-domain measurement in other frequency regions."

    "abstract": "The agricultural sector is a cornerstone of many rural economies, which provides livelihood mainly to local communities, and perhaps to nearby regions. However, in regions like Lanao del Sur, where socio-economic challenges prevail, the ability of farmers to access markets remains a significant barrier to economic growth and development. According to the World Bank (2020), market access is defined not only by physical access to trading centers but also by the ability to meet market demands, access relevant information, and engage in competitive trade practices. This study examines what digital marketplaces must be included in a digitalization framework to support market access for rural farmers, as well as identify the digital marketplaces and related technologies that must be considered in the framework. The research employs mixed methods design to comprehensively explore the experiences, perceptions, and challenges faced by rural farmers in the region. Key findings of the study suggest that farmers in the region need a dedicated digital marketplace tailored specifically for agriculture. Moreover, it also highlights the importance of mobile apps and e-payment tools. Likewise, the framework must address the digital skills gap, connectivity issues, and trust barriers. To ensure the successful implementation and long-term impact of digitalization, the study suggests that policy makers and government agencies must invest in rural internet infrastructure and support technologies like offline-access platform and SMS-based systems. Overall, the framework provides a digitalization model that addresses the real needs of rural farmers in the region."

Manually unwrapping and editing textures proves both laborintensive and inefficient. This paper proposes a GNN-based UV unwrapping method. The approach first simplifies the mesh using a quadratic error metric algorithm with feature weighting. Then, GNN is employed to precisely locate optimal cutting lines based on 3D model features, ensuring UV coordinate continuity. Finally, texture mapping distortion is corrected through inverse deformation of the warping field. The experiment uses daily-use ceramics such as ceramic mugs and vases as objects to compare the traditional algorithm with the manual unwrapping method. The results show that the UV distortion rate of the unwrapping method in this paper is close to the manual method, the unwrapping time is comparable to the traditional algorithm, and the texture secondary editing restoration degree reaches 92.1 %."

    "abstract": "In the field of spectrum situation monitoring, space-based spectrum mapping can overcome the limitations of ground-based monitoring, such as restricted coverage, environmental constraints, and difficulties in equipment deployment. However, current research on radio map reconstruction methods based on space-based satellite data is insufficient. Traditional methods mostly set missing patterns based on the type of data collected on the ground, such as random sampling or strip sampling. These methods can meet the needs of generating spectrum maps for local spectrum monitoring on the ground, but they are hardly adaptable to the task of space-based global spectrum mapping. To address this challenge, we have designed a tensor reconstruction method for radio maps based on local low-rankness. Before conducting global completion, we first identify local regions in the map with more prominent low-rank characteristics for completion. This enables the method to handle radio map reconstruction in the context of space-based wide-area coverage. During the reconstruction phase, targeting the two-dimensional spatial completion problem of space-based spectrum maps, we extend the autoregressive process from the temporal dimension in classical spatiotemporal models to the spatial domain, proposing a low-rank tensor completion model based on dual autoregression (LRTCDAR). By incorporating a dual autoregressive structure to capture spatial correlations and combining it with the inherent low-rank property of radio maps, the model achieves high-precision reconstruction of incomplete radio maps. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, the proposed approach effectively reconstructs radio maps under various conditional backgrounds. Notably, LRTCDAR exhibits greater advantages when applied to satellite data acquisition scenarios."

The controller is developed with a stability proof, and the resulting observer-based controller is applied to an example of a nonlinear fractional-order multi-agent system. Additionally, a nonlinear example is solved analytically in this context. The estimation error is thoroughly analyzed, demonstrating notable convergence to zero based on the Lyapunov stability synthesis."

    "abstract": "Evolutionary multitasking (EMT) endeavors to solve multiple optimization tasks simultaneously via knowledge transfer (KT) among tasks. While several EMT algorithms have obtained promising results, they still encounter uncertainties and challenges in the complex field of multiobjective multitask optimization (MO-MTO). A key limitation of existing approaches is the insufficient attention to manifold structures of the Pareto set (PS), which represent the local regularities of multiobjective optimization problems. Ignoring these structures prevents the algorithm from capturing local features, thereby limiting the efficiency and accuracy of KT. To alleviate this issue, this article proposes a new EMT algorithm for MO-MTO with manifold structure-driven KT, namely EMT-MSKT. EMT-MSKT aims to improve optimization performance by leveraging both global and local structural information. In particular, KT in EMT-MSKT consists of two key strategies: global structure learning (GSL) and local structure learning (LSL). GSL exploits global structural similarity to provide population-level directional information that drives broad exploration across tasks. LSL exploits local structural similarity to support fine-grained exploitation based on manifold features. To implement these two strategies, the global and local search directions are extracted as knowledge, reflecting how solutions evolve within these structures. Moreover, to further enhance transfer efficiency in the LSL process, a local source selection (LSS) strategy is developed to identify relevant knowledge sources based on local manifold similarities. Comprehensive results on four benchmark suites (including a newly constructed suite for complex problems) and three real-world applications demonstrate that EMT-MSKT consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms."

    "abstract": "Water supply networks are essential in supporting efficient water delivery in urban and rural regions. However, problems related to monitoring, leak detection, and optimization of resources have resulted in large water losses due to leaks, unauthorized use, and inefficient distribution and water quality. Conventional water management systems rely on methods and manual inspections, leading to time lags in identifying anomalies and wasting resources. This proposed system offers an intelligent IOT -driven water management system for efficient distribution and leakage mitigation in the cites based on smart flow sensors, water level sensor, and microcontrollers that boost real-time monitoring and control of data. Sensed data is transferred to a focal point or transmitted to controller to detect leaks, predict maintenance needs, and control the division of water. It streamlines functions by transmitting precise data on usage patterns in the water supply and auto-initiating measures against known irregularities. Proposed system achieved 30% reduction in water losses, 93.75% improvement in maintenance response times, and 97.1% system reliability compared to 75% for traditional approaches."

    "abstract": "Adaptive filtering under heavy-tailed non-Gaussian noise remains a challenging task due to the poor robustness of conventional algorithms and the high computational burden for long filter taps. Recently, the spline prioritization optimization lncosh adaptive filter (SPOAF-lncosh) has shown promising robustness by combining spline-based optimization with the lncosh cost function. However, its implementation still suffers from significant complexity when dealing with long adaptive filter taps. To overcome this limitation, we propose a frequency domain variant, termed FDSPOAF-lncosh, which reformulates the SPOAF-lncosh algorithm in the frequency domain. The proposed method leverages the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce the per-iteration complexity from $\\mathrm{O}\\left(\\mathrm{N}^{2}\\right)$ to $\\mathrm{O}\\left(\\mathrm{Nlog}_{2} \\mathrm{~N}\\right)$ with $\\mathrm{N}=2 \\mathrm{M}$, while maintaining the heavy-tailed noise suppression capability of the original algorithm. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the FDSPOAF-lncosh algorithm achieves comparable convergence properties and steady-state performance to its time-domain counterpart. Simulation results under various impulsive noise conditions confirm that FDSPOAF-lncosh significantly shortens runtime for long filter taps."

Although digital devices provide learning flexibility that is not location-bound, it create one significant problem: students research with the same devices as it recreationally do. The reason is that there has been a high possibility of time wastage and reduced efficiency of resources in the academic environment due to the easy accessibility of time-squandering distractions (including social media). This is one of the challenges that should be addressed considering that digital learning environments are set to be prevalent in the future. There is a significant research gap when it comes to the techniques which will find the right way to detect and categorize student behavior on screen and at the same time maintain the privacy of users. To address this problem, the proposed method presents a new privacy-saving scheme based on Federated Learning based on a Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (FLPSO). The design of this structure is aimed at efficiently ascertaining whether the student is using his/her computer time in a productive manner or it is going to waste. An over 4,000 screen shots of various activities of students were used to train and validate the FLPSO model. A comparative analysis was made on the proposed FLPSO approach with many previously pre-trained classification algorithms and it proved to be superior. The method scored well on all the critical measures of assessment such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score and proved to be a safe and efficient measure in sensitivity and optimization of student interest in e-learning."

The analysis of possible approaches and methods for describing the dynamics of the parameters of Smart Grid modes has been carried out. The approaches based on metric geometry and affine geometry have been considered. It has been established that the classical methods used to analyze static processes are not applicable in the Smart Grid. The use of the principles of projective geometry is proposed as a promising approach. The features of the application of projective geometry are shown on the example of a Smart Grid section.

    "abstract": "Blockchain is increasingly integrated in Multiaccess Edge Computing (MEC) to coordinate secure and lowlatency resource provisioning and service orchestration among resource-constrained embodied AI devices. However, conventional blockchains perform costly transaction verification during propagation, which can be exploited by spam transaction attacks and overload resource-limited edge devices. To mitigate the substantial overhead of verification, we propose a two-stage BLS multi-signature backed transaction propagation mechanism for blockchain-enabled MEC: a small-scope random-walk phase with deep verification and signing, followed by a large-scope propagation phase with probabilistic verification. In the first stage, nodes conduct deep verification and sign valid transactions using the BLS multi-signature, then forward the signed transaction to a small and randomly sampled subset of neighbors to rapidly accumulate valid signatures. In the second stage, transactions whose aggregated signature count exceeds a threshold will be broadcast throughout the entire blockchain network and undergo deep verification with a specific probability, relieving edge nodes' verification burden. Moreover, verifiers record signers associated with failed deep verifications. Signers whose failures exceed a system threshold are quarantined to restrain the spread of spam transactions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism reduces energy consumption by at least 60% and 18.6% compared with the original and benchmark mechanisms respectively, while maintaining nearly identical transmission performance and ensuring that the proportion of invalid transactions propagated to honest nodes does not exceed 14%."

Thus, accurately assessing MWL is significant in various fields, including human-computer interaction, aviation, and healthcare, where cognitive overload can lead to unsuitable decisions. The brain computer interface (BCI) based on electroencephalography (EEG) presents a viable, non-invasive option for real-time monitoring of MWL, allowing an adaptive system to improve performance and user experience. However, because EEG patterns vary widely among individuals, it is still challenging to develop a generalized MWL prediction model. Therefore, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) with manually extracted features is proposed. Our analysis was based on the \"STEW\" dataset, which includes two task conditions: \"No task\" and a multitasking activity using the SIMKAP framework. The proposed model achieved an average accuracy of 84.0% (±14.4%) and an average F1-score of 83.1% (±18.2%), showcasing its strong predictive performance while maintaining computational efficiency compared to deep learning methods. These results highlight LightGBM’s potential as a fast, subject-independent MWL classification tool, therefore enabling the design of scalable and flexible cognitive monitoring systems for practical use."

We propose FedGuard, a novel defense framework that verifies the integrity of the local training process. FedGuard requires clients to submit a privacy-preserving proof of their training, encapsulated in a loss trajectory. A two-stage defense at the server filters updates with invalid dynamics and then uses a trajectory-aware anomaly detection algorithm to distinguish attacks from benign Non-IID outliers. Evaluations against backdoor attacks on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show FedGuard reduces the attack success rate to near-zero, significantly outperforming traditional defenses while maintaining high main task accuracy."

The entanglement is quantified using concurrence, and the control objective is formulated as maximizing this measure at the terminal time. Our approach is validated through numerical simulations of Liouville–von Neumann dynamics. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of switching-based control strategies in achieving robust entanglement, offering insights into practical implementations of quantum control for entanglement generation in quantum networks."

    "abstract": "A finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) strategy is investigated for the speed regulation of permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs). A cascaded control structure is implemented, consisting of an inner FCS-MPC current loop, enhanced by a variable structure (VS) approach, and an outer discrete-time VS control (DTVSC) speed loop. The adoption of FCS-MPC for current regulation in industrial PMSMs is driven by its inherent fast dynamic response, ability to enforce constraints, and the potential for modulator-less operation. Furthermore, DTVSC has proven to be an effective PMSM control strategy, particularly valued for its robustness in the face of model inaccuracies and external disturbances. The proposed control methodology, compared to the industry-standard PI cascaded control implemented by Whirlpool in domestic appliances, provides an improvement in control performance and robustness characteristics."

This study presents a THz metasurface-enhanced attenuated total reflection (ATR) sensor by directly placing metallic rod arrays onto a silicon prism. The hybrid configuration significantly improves detection resolution by combining metasurface resonance with ATR technology. Experimental results demonstrate a notable 36 GHz resonance frequency shift when detecting 10 μL of 0.5 mol/L NaCl solution. This approach effectively overcomes water's strong THz absorption, offering a highly sensitive, non-destructive solution for biomedical testing and concentration monitoring of aqueous samples. The compact design achieves high sensitivity while maintaining measurement simplicity, showing great potential for practical applications in liquid analysis."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a machine learning-deep learning hybrid image recognition scheme, focusing on the construction and performance comparison of feedforward neural networks, 1D CNNs, and random forest models. First, a feedforward neural network is constructed. Data are converted into PyTorch tensors, and a binary classification model is designed—comprising an input layer, a 64-neuron hidden layer, and a single-neuron output layer. Binary cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer are employed, with parameter optimization via multiple iterations to achieve image classification. Second, a 1D CNN model is built. Built on the Keras Sequential framework, it incorporates 1D convolutional, max-pooling, and fully connected layers. The sklearn library is utilized to compute evaluation metrics, with ROC curves, loss variations, and confusion matrices visualized for model performance analysis. Finally, a random forest model is established. The image data is standardized and labels are encoded; hyperparameters are optimized using grid search, and the model's performance is evaluated through learning curves, confusion matrices, and other means. This scheme can accurately realize binary image classification. The combination of multiple models and multiple evaluation methods improves the reliability and generalization ability of recognition, and can adapt to image recognition needs in different scenarios."

The paper is a comparative analysis of two popular deep learning architectures, EfficientNet and ResNet-50, which are used as feature extractors with four additional classifiers: Neural Network, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest. Experimentation was done on a dataset of 4,217 fundus images (4 eye conditions, Normal, Cataract, Glaucoma, and Diabetic Retinopathy). The deep features were extracted and they were used to train the classifiers and their performance measured by using accuracy, F1-score, AUC and MCC. It is observed that EfficientNet with a Neural Network gives the best results with an AUC of 0.980 and a precision of 0.888. Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting also score well with the Random Forest always scoring the lowest points. The same tendency is observed in ResNet-50 features, as once again, the Neural Network works better than the rest of the classifiers. The results indicate the significance of a proper choice of a classifier alongside a powerful feature extractor, and reveal how the hybrid deep feature-classical classifier methods can be used to improve the diagnosis of retinal diseases to a considerable degree."

    "abstract": "Model pruning is an effective technique to reduce the dependency of neural networks on hardware resources while maintaining their performance, especially for Large Language Models(LLMs) with ever-increasing parameter scales. However, existing structured pruning methods often struggle to retain satisfactory performance under high sparsity ratios and exhibit inefficiencies when applied to ultra-large models. To address these limitations, we propose a novel structured pruning algorithm, Fusion-Based Parallel Structured Pruning (FUPS), which is simple, efficient, and easy to deploy. Its effectiveness stems from two key innovations: (1) a block-wise mechanism that partitions matrices into smaller sub-blocks to enable finer-grained redundancy identification and enhance parallel processing across accelerators; (2) a fusion mechanism that mitigates the adverse impact of knowledge space fragmentation introduced by the block mechanism, thereby enhancing the robustness and generalization capability of the matrix representation. We conduct extensive experiments on various models, and the results show that FUPS consistently preserves model performance across different sparsity settings and outperforms existing methods such as LLMPruner, Wanda, and FLAP on multiple benchmark tasks. The code is released at https://github.com/Qsiny/FUPS."

This research presents a comparative simulation-based study of six prominent routing protocols: LEACH, Modified LEACH, TLEACH, E-DEEC, Multi-Chain PEGASIS, and MGEAR across various network infrastructures and application environments. Performance analysis employs realistic constraints including energy consumption patterns, network latency measurements, and active round counts to evaluate protocol performance. The comparative study reveals significant performance trade- offs between network connectivity and energy efficiency, with specific protocols demonstrating superior performance under different network conditions. This research provides quantitative performance metrics that enable network designers to make informed protocol selection decisions based on specific WSN constraints and requirements."

However, in the process of generating long texts, the linearly increasing keyvalue (KV) cache imposes a large volume of memory footprint on HBM, resulting in significant time and energy consumption during inference. By retaining only the initial and recent tokens, existing methods ignore the intermediate tokens and the effect of the distance between current tokens and those in the KV cache, which causes significant accuracy degradation and limits the potential for KV cache compression. To overcome the above problems, we propose LISLLM, a KV cache compression mechanism that takes both the difference in importance and the distance between tokens into consideration for efficient inference of LLMs in long-context settings.

    "abstract": "Secure boot is a fundamental mechanism for establishing a hardware-rooted chain of trust in modern computing systems. While formal verification using interactive theorem provers like Rocq offers strong correctness guarantees, existing approaches are often tightly coupled to specific hardware configurations and cryptographic algorithms, making them brittle and difficult to reuse when system components change. In this work, we present a flexible and modular framework for formally verifying secure boot processes in Rocq. Our approach introduces a three-layer abstraction model-Feature, Axiom, and Theorem-that decouples high-level security properties from lowlevel implementation details. We abstract critical components such as storage media and cryptographic primitives (e.g., encryption, signatures, hash functions) as interfaces with welldefined operators and axiomatic correctness properties. All highlevel proofs are conducted based on these axioms, without depending on concrete implementations. When specific algorithms or hardware are chosen, the axioms become proof obligations to be verified locally. This separation ensures that changes in implementation-such as switching cryptographic primitives or storage types-do not invalidate existing proofs, enabling significant proof reuse. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework in modeling a realistic secure boot chain. Our work lays the foundation for scalable and maintainable formal verification of trust-sensitive system initialization processes."

Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that AMMI-GCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings, achieving superior representation diversity and robustness.

A comprehensive state-action representation of UAV dynamics is constructed, and a reward function is designed to jointly encourage precise position holding, energy-efficient control, and disturbance rejection. The proposed policy is trained iteratively in a high-fidelity simulation environment until convergence. To validate its effectiveness, extensive experiments compare the PPO-based controller with two state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning baselines—Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). Results show that the proposed method achieves higher hovering accuracy, improved robustness under wind gusts and sensor noise, and reduced control effort compared with both conventional and DRL baselines. These findings demonstrate the potential of PPO for high-performance autonomous UAV hovering control and provide a solid foundation for real-world deployment and extension to more complex flight tasks."

In this contribution, we present the extension of a recently demonstrated, optoelectronic hybrid locking scheme for the generation of widely tunable phase-locked laser beat signals in the terahertz range by a four-wave mixing approach. We use an optical phase-locked loop (OPLL) to stabilize the difference frequency of two continuous-wave lasers. The laser signals are amplified in tapered semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) to induce four-wave mixing contributions. By selecting the optical signal frequencies in a filter setup, we obtain a wide range of frequency-locked beat signals which can be further employed for the optoelectronic generation and detection of highly stabilized terahertz photomixing signals."

In the case of humanoid robots, arms can be utilized to mitigate impact damage, thereby improving resilience to falls. Although previous work has primarily focused on damage reduction strategies for legged robots, the question of minimizing fall damage in humanoid ballbots remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-policy approach, combining clustering on the initial pose and Reinforcement Learning, to reduce damage resulting from a fall in a commercial humanoid ballbot. We conduct simulations to compare our method against three baselines: (1) a curriculum learning policy, (2) a single-policy approach enhanced by clustering information, and (3) a standard single-policy baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves higher success rates and greater damage reduction compared to existing alternatives."

The optimization of vessel trajectories can achieve decarbonization and sustainability in this sector. This research supports climate finance goals by using data and information to make better decisions that reduce pollution and promote an environmentally friendly approach that improves shipping efficiency. In this methodological study, we review current research on vessel trajectory reconstruction, analyzing their strengths and limitations. We propose a novel approach that combines these current methods with advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques for better accuracy and efficiency in trajectory reconstruction. It is composed of four main steps; First, denoising the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data using Geohash-based Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) then applying U-Net for refining the trajectory grid. Second, extracting the most relevant trajectory features using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). Third, reconstructing the trajectory using Geohash-DTW for long gaps and kinematic interpolation for short gaps. Finally, applying a temporal refinement using Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) and optimizing the hyperparameters by applying a Genetic Algorithm (GA).

    "abstract": "In agent-based evacuation simulations, results are typically presented using macro indicators such as \"number of evacuees who completed evacuation\" and \"average evacuation time.\" However, these indicators do not adequately convey the individual evacuation processes of evacuees, making it difficult for residents and nonexperts to understand and empathize with evacuees’ situations. To address this, this study proposes a method that uses simulation log data as external data and combines large language models (LLMs) with search-enhanced generation (RAG) to automatically generate \"evacuation stories,\" which are intuitive narratives in natural language that represent the individual action histories of each evacuee. When this method was applied to a tsunami evacuation simulation targeting a specific school district in Sakai City, Osaka, Japan, it was confirmed that the LLM could accurately interpret movement histories and delay points based on log data and generate coherent narratives. This method enables the intuitive communication of the background and congestion factors of the evacuation process to residents and nonexperts without specialized visualization literacy and is expected to serve as a new tool for enhancing understanding and presenting scenarios in disaster-prevention education and training."

Pediatric leukemia diagnosis demands accurate and early subtype identification to support precision treatment. In this study, a leakage-free machine learning framework is proposed using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) for genomic feature selection. The CuMiDa leukemia microarray dataset containing 64 samples with 22,283 gene features was used. The dataset was preprocessed using Min–Max normalization and evaluated using an 80/20 stratified train–test split. LASSO reduced the dimensionality to 701 informative genes, mitigating noise and improving model interpretability. Nine classifiers were trained and evaluated using 5×10 Repeated Stratified Cross-Validation, with performance assessed using Balanced Accuracy (BA), macro F1-score, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), which is reliable for imbalanced data. Treebased ensemble models such as Gradient Boosting and XGBoost achieved strong and stable results across folds, while neural networks struggled due to limited samples. Although Random Forest achieved a perfect score on the test set, nested crossvalidation and permutation testing revealed that such results may be affected by dataset size, highlighting a risk of optimistic bias. Overall, the framework demonstrated strong generalization capability with MCC values above 0.90 for top-performing models, confirming reliable subtype separability. Future work will focus on increasing dataset size, incorporating biological pathway relevance, and applying explainable AI to strengthen clinical interpretability."

The dry electrode provides an ideal solution for the wearable fECG monitoring system design. However, input impedance matching and common-mode noise rejection remain significant challenges in the practical implementation of dry electrodes. This paper presents an analog front-end (AFE) integrated circuit specifically aimed at improving the quality of fECG signals detected by the wearable system with dry electrodes. The AFE utilizes bootstrapping circuits and an instrumentation amplifier to achieve high accuracy and stability. A driven-right-leg circuit is incorporated to effectively suppress electromagnetic interference. The AFE is designed and verified using 180 nm CMOS technology. The results demonstrate a high input impedance of $319 \\mathrm{G} \\Omega$ and a high CMRR of 106 dB.

In this article, a porous flexible DBD (PF-DBD) device composed of polyimide and soda-lime glass (SLG) is designed. Driven by a pulse power supply, the discharge characteristics of PF-DBD are similar to traditional DBD discharge; two discharges occur within one pulse cycle. As the voltage increases, the discharge gradually spreads from the edges of the hole toward the center, eventually covering the entire hole. An equivalent circuit model of PF-DBD is established, and plasma discharge power, charge transfer, and discharge efficiency are calculated. As the aperture increases, the plasma distribution at the center of the hole gradually becomes uniform, and the discharge morphology changes from filamentous discharge to glow discharge. Correspondingly, the transfer of charge and discharge efficiency also increased. As the number of holes increases, the electric fields between adjacent holes interact through mutual shielding and cancellation effects, resulting in a more uniform overall electric field distribution. The uniformity of discharge, discharge efficiency, and transfer of charge also increase accordingly. Finally, the emission spectrum at different apertures is analyzed and it is found that the emission spectrum intensity is highest at 14-mm aperture. The molecular vibration stability and rotational temperature are obtained by fitting the emission spectrum. The vibrational temperature under small apertures is significantly higher than that under large apertures, while the rotational temperature remains relatively stable."

Achieving high dynamic ranges (DR) at these bandwidths in coherent detection schemes are significantly challenging. One attractive option for enhancing DR and thus the possible applications of such ultra-broadband systems is the use of high repetition rate driving lasers, enabling for fast averaging methods. This can be achieved by increasing the driving average power using Yb-based sources. However, the generation mechanisms in plasmas are expected to change at high repetition rates due to the short temporal separation of the driving pulses and corresponding accumulation effects. In this study, we investigate repetition rate scaling of these sources up to 100 kHz, and present new ultra-broadband transient measurements spanning up to 23 THz at these high repetition rates using EOS in organic crystals. A maximum average power of 2.8 mW is reached at 100 kHz, and we observe only a moderate loss in optical-to-THz conversion efficiency (19 %) as the repetition rate increases from 1 to 100 kHz. The decrease is consistent with a stationary gas density depression at the filament caused by air hydrodynamics at these high repetition rates, which we confirm by interferometry."

    "abstract": "Obstacle avoidance for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms in complex, dynamic environments is still challenged by sudden obstacles. Existing approaches fall into two categories: rule-based methods (e.g., artificial potential fields, velocity obstacles), which respond quickly but are sensitive to parameters and prone to local minima; and optimization-based methods (e.g., RRT* and genetic algorithms, GA), which offer global feasibility but typically require costly replanning after environmental changes, limiting real-time performance. To address these limitations, we propose a flow-field-driven avoidance algorithm based on the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). By embedding obstacles as boundary conditions in the flow field, each UAV follows the local flow direction and uses PD control to update its heading continuously, without recomputing a full path. Two-dimensional simulations with both static and sudden obstacles compare the proposed method against RRT* and GA. Results show that all three methods avoid obstacles in static settings; however, under sudden obstacles, RRT* and GA collide unless replanning is invoked, whereas the LBM method immediately reroutes and maintains smooth, collision-free trajectories, demonstrating superior real-time responsiveness and robustness. This study provides a new avenue for online safe flight of UAV swarms in complex dynamic environments."

    "abstract": "Remote sensing semantic segmentation must address both what the ground objects are within an image and where they are located. Consequently, segmentation models must ensure not only the semantic correctness of large-scale patches (low-frequency information) but also the precise localization of boundaries between patches (high-frequency information related to boundary components). However, most existing approaches rely heavily on discriminative learning, which excels at capturing low-frequency features, while overlooking its inherent limitations in learning high-frequency features for semantic segmentation. Recent studies have revealed that diffusion generative models excel at generating high-frequency details. Our theoretical analysis confirms that the diffusion denoising process significantly enhances the model's ability to learn high-frequency features; however, we also observe that these models exhibit insufficient semantic inference for low-frequency features when guided solely by the original image. Therefore, we integrate the strengths of both discriminative and generative learning, proposing the Integration of Discriminative and diffusion-based Generative learning for Boundary Refinement (IDGBR) framework. The framework first generates a coarse segmentation map using a discriminative backbone model. This map and the original image are fed into a conditioning guidance network to jointly learn a guidance representation subsequently leveraged by an iterative denoising diffusion process refining the coarse segmentation. Extensive experiments across five remote sensing semantic segmentation datasets (binary and multi-class segmentation) confirm our framework's capability of consistent boundary refinement for coarse results from diverse discriminative architectures.

Our system processes two synchronous video streams: a primary classroom video feed and a secondary screen capture of the instructor's computer screen. The core of our method is a dual-stream processing pipeline. The visual stream performs student detection, classifies seven distinct behaviors using Stu-B-YOLO, an enhanced YOLO-based model, and maintains consistent student identities across 2,700 frames via a coordinate-based tracking algorithm. Simultaneously, the screen analysis stream employs an optical character recognition (OCR) module to detect and temporally localize interactive learning phases, which are identified by specific on-screen elements from the “Rain Classroom” platform. A key contribution is our context-aware fusion module, which dynamically recalibrates the semantic interpretation of certain behaviors—for instance, reclassifying “smartphone usage” as active participation—during these identified interactive intervals. We construct a dataset of 9,000 annotated images to train and evaluate our Stu-BYOLO. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves robust performance in behavior recognition and generates powerful, interpretable visualizations of classroom dynamics, thereby offering a valuable tool for automated educational analytics."

This letter presents a PCB-integrated stress-relief structure: a planar, fourfold-symmetric crab-leg (folded-beam) flexure that forms an “IMU island” via through-slots, attenuating stress transmission regardless of load direction while preserving four-sided routing. Finite-element analysis of a molded IMU package on a clamped–clamped PCB under mid-span deflection shows that the area-averaged von Mises stress at the MEMS anchor interface is reduced to 0.23× compared with a plain PCB. A clamped–clamped bending fixture with a recessed loading pin, load sensing, 3D surface profiling, and a calibration–inference procedure maps measured displacements to a Plain-PCB-equivalent surface stress, enabling fair comparison across layouts over an approximately ±40 MPa range. Measurements confirm that, relative to the plain PCB, accelerometer bias change decreases from 4.9 mG to 1.6 mG on X (0.32×) and from 48 mG to 8.4 mG on Z (0.18×), with no clear reduction on Y. These results demonstrate that board-level flexures reduce assembly-induced bias drift and provide a practical, user-implementable approach to stabilize MEMS IMU accelerometers without altering the device or package."

To improve detection efficiency and sensitivity, large-scale TES arrays are required in combination with multiplexing readout electronics. Compared to other multiplexing schemes, microwave SQUID multiplexing (μMUX), consisting of high-quality microwave superconducting resonators and RF SQUIDs, is most suitable since it provides a wider bandwidth (GHz) and consequently higher multiplexing factor.

    "abstract": "Consensus mechanisms are the core of any blockchain system. However, the majority of these mechanisms do not target federated learning directly nor do they aid in the aggregation step. This paper introduces Proof of Reasoning (PoR), a novel consensus mechanism specifically designed for federated learning using blockchain, aimed at preserving data privacy, defending against malicious attacks, and enhancing the validation of participating networks. Unlike generic blockchain consensus mechanisms commonly found in the literature, PoR integrates three distinct processes tailored for federated learning. Firstly, a masked autoencoder (MAE) is trained to generate an encoder that functions as a feature map and obfuscates input data, rendering it resistant to human reconstruction and model inversion attacks. Secondly, a downstream classifier is trained at the edge, receiving input from the trained encoder. The downstream network’s weights, a single encoded datapoint, the network’s output and the ground truth are then added to a block for federated aggregation. Lastly, this data facilitates the aggregation of all participating networks, enabling more complex and verifiable aggregation methods than previously possible. This three-stage process results in more robust networks with significantly reduced computational complexity, maintaining high accuracy by training only the downstream classifier at the edge. PoR scales to large IoT networks with low latency and storage growth, and adapts to evolving data, regulations, and network conditions."

This work investigates three spiking neuron models-Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF), Izhikevich, and Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire (AdEx)-for converting raw EEG signals into spike trains while preserving temporal and amplitude features. Each model is systematically tuned and evaluated for encoding fidelity, spiking dynamics, and hardware efficiency. The Izhikevich model offers a balance between dynamic range and implementation complexity but exhibits saturation in certain regimes. AdEx achieves the highest temporal fidelity and adaptive modulation, making it most suitable for EEG encoding. Hardware synthesis at 10 kHz in 45 nm CMOS reveals that LIF consumes the least power $(27.5 \\mathrm{nW})$ and area ($0.00117 \\mathrm{~mm}^{2}$), while AdEx provides the best trade-off between accuracy and resource use (186.9 nW, $0.0073 \\mathrm{~mm}^{2}$).

In robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, developing control algorithms that comply with RCM constraints is highly challenging due to the nonlinear nature of robot motion models and the stringent precision requirements necessary for patient safety. This article introduces an enhanced zeroing neural network (EZNN) model for controlling redundant manipulators while maintaining RCM constraints. The proposed model eliminates the need for pseudoinverse matrix computations and features an explicit dynamic form. It guarantees finite-time convergence and demonstrates robustness through the application of nonlinear activation functions (AFs). These properties are rigorously validated using Lyapunov theory. Simulation and experimental results indicate that the EZNN model surpasses Jacobian-based algorithms and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in terms of efficiency and stability, all while ensuring adherence to RCM constraints."

    "abstract": "Deep learning has the potential to address the bottleneck of conventional medical microwave tomography, which is ill-posed and has a high computation cost. However, current physics-guided deep learning methods may fail to capture the imaged object's salient regions, resulting in misdiagnosis. A deep neural network inspired by the distorted Born iterative method (DBIM) is proposed to address this challenge. This method, which avoids using Green’s function, provides a theoretical explanation of why current deep learning methods guided by iterative physics algorithms fail in detecting abnormal tissues, making them unsuitable for real-life clinical applications. The proposed method consists of two main components: a set of forward neural network solvers and a series of inverse neural network blocks for updating the dielectric contrast of the imaging domain. The training of the network, designed to emulate the DBIM framework, is regularized by a hybrid loss function composed of two supervised and one self-supervised function. Each iteration in DBIM is performed using a neural network block with parameters different from those of other blocks, forming a sequential iterative approach. By calculating the perturbations in the electrical properties’ profiles at each iteration, the proposed network can accurately reconstruct abnormal tissues associated with signals masked by those from healthy tissues. Assessments of the proposed method using the relative error, structure similarity index measure, Dice similarity coefficient, and Hausdorff distance show significant enhancements (19%, 18%, 40%, and 72%, respectively) compared to two recent deep learning-based microwave medical imaging algorithms."

However, ViTs are likely to miss local spatial features with fine granularity, while convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel at extracting local patterns but cannot model long-range dependencies. We propose a hybrid framework that combines a 3D Residual CNN and a ViT module to counter these limitations. The CNN component possesses the ability to extract fine-grained local spectral and spatial information, which is passed through the ViT for extracting global contextual dependencies. Experimental evaluation on three benchmark HSI datasets, Indian Pines (IP), Pavia University (PU), and Salinas (SA), confirms the superiority of our approach. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in Hyperspectral image classification tasks, demonstrating good performance and potential application prospects."

As a result, SASet can be regarded as a composite architecture, where the combined behavior of its elements defines the system-level qualities. A methodology for constructing and applying SASet is proposed, including phases of initialization, architecture (or EE) selection, relation definition and interaction mechanisms. The proposed concept has the potential to make a substantial contribution to the evolution of architectural engineering especially toward large scale software systems. The primary objective of SASet is to replace the notion of a single architecture in methodologies, tools and analytical frameworks, thereby enabling them to address systems composed of multiple architectures and EEs."

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in contrastive learning have led to significant progress in multi-modal remote sensing data classification, such as hyperspectral and LiDAR data, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled samples. However, these methods primarily rely on the contrast between positive and negative pairs, which makes them susceptible to interference from negative sample selection, thereby impairing effective multi-modal fusion and ultimately affecting classification accuracy. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel framework for the joint classification of hyperspectral image (HSI) and LiDAR, termed the multi-Positive Matching-enhanced Contrastive Learning (mPMCL). The proposed framework facilitates contrastive training by matching multiple positive pairs across different modalities and hierarchical features of the same object, hence effectively enhancing multi-modal fusion and improving classification performance. Specifically, the HCIF module performs hierarchical and consistency-aware fusion by using a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism to integrate low-level, cross-modal interaction, and high-level semantic features from HSI and LiDAR data. This process gradually aligns heterogeneous representations across stages and captures complementary spectral–elevation cues, leading to more stable and discriminative multimodal features. Additionally, a multi-Positive Matching Strategy (mPMS) is develpoed to construct multiple positive pairs by matching high-level semantic features of the same object with low-level- and cross-modal fusion features from different modalities. By performing contrastive training on these positive pairs, the proposed method avoids the sensitivity of traditional approaches to negative sample selection, while further enhancing the effectiveness of multi-modal information fusion. The pivotal contribution of the proposed framework lies in demonstrating the importance of positive matching enhanced contrastive learning strategies for effective multi-modal information fusion. Experimental results on several publicly available datasets show that the proposed framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

By considering these objectives concurrently, the proposed method aims to strike a balance between minimizing the deployment costs and ensuring a sufficient coverage to meet the users demands. Through simulations conducted on a benchmark example in Tunis, we assess the algorithm’s effectiveness in generating Pareto-optimal solutions that offer trade-offs between cost and coverage. The findings underscore the potential of the bi-objective algorithm in proposing new interesting solutions for the placement of EV chargers, thereby contributing to the development of a sustainable transportation infrastructure in Tunis."

Unlike degeneracies in Hermitian systems, EPs exhibit a range of intriguing features, such as loss-induced transparency and enhanced sensitivity. EPs have been demonstrated in various coupled systems, including coupled metamaterials (MMs) and coupled whispering-gallery-mode cavities. In this work, we investigate the coupling between a C-type complementary MM and a polarized photonic cavity. Both components are polarization-sensitive, and the coupling strength can be tuned by varying their relative orientation. As the coupling strength is gradually reduced, we observe the coalescence of two polariton modes, indicating the presence of an EP. Remarkably, when monitoring the polarization orthogonal to the cavity mode, the EP reveals itself through a transition from two Fano resonances to an electromagnetically-induced-transparency-(EIT-)like feature. This tunable coupled system offers a promising platform for highly sensitive sensing applications."

The application of search techniques to this problem offers insights into algorithmic efficiency and practical performance in constrained environments. Despite extensive research on heuristic search methods, comparative studies involving uninformed and informed search strategies applied to different cube sizes remain limited. This study addresses that gap by evaluating Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and A* Search in solving the NxN Rubik’s Cube. The experiment involves a facelet-based representation of the cube and simulates randomized scrambles of increasing complexity. Each algorithm is implemented in C++ and evaluated on performance metrics including solution length, execution time, and completeness under varied depth limits and cube sizes. Results show that A* Search consistently outperforms both DFS and BFS in terms of execution speed and reliability, achieving optimal or near-optimal solutions without timeouts. BFS demonstrates optimality but suffers from scalability, while DFS offers flexibility with higher time costs. This study provides a practical and measurable comparison of search strategies, highlighting A* as the most balanced approach for real-time puzzle solving within smart systems."

Traditional anomaly detection methods based on statistics and machine learning often fail to comprehensively identify irregularities in the content of transmitted data. To overcome the limitation, this paper proposes an anomaly detection approach for CAN data streams that integrates a heterogeneous Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model with an Attention Mechanism (AM). First, periodic characteristics at the byte level within CAN message fields are statistically analyzed, revealing distinctive inter-byte feature variations. Based on the periodicity of each byte-level data stream, a heterogeneous LSTM model incorporating varied parameters-such as time step size and network width-is designed. A corresponding detection framework leveraging heterogeneous LSTM with AM (LSTMAM) is introduced. Furthermore, a fusion strategy between LSTM and the attention mechanism is developed to weight the influence of different hidden states on prediction outcomes. Finally, comparative experiments under various attack scenarios were conducted utilizing publicly available and vehicle-collected CAN message datasets. Comparative results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves detection accuracy over existing approaches, validating its effectiveness at identifying anomalies in CAN data streams."

However, traditional data lineage analysis methods struggle to meet precise governance needs due to high computational complexity, semantic understanding biases, and high implementation costs. To address these, we propose a multi-dimensional lineage identification framework integrating BERT-based domain semantic modeling, weighted Levenshtein dynamic programming edit distance, and quantitative analysis of table structure field intersections. The framework captures deep semantic associations between data entities via a domain-specific fine-tuned BERT model, optimizes table name matching accuracy using an edit distance algorithm with a common prefix compensation mechanism, and balances evaluation biases from field quantity differences by incorporating core field overlap metrics. Experimental results show this scheme significantly outperforms traditional methods in lineage relationship identification accuracy (F1-score of 95.38%) and cross-domain adaptability, providing a solution with theoretical innovation and engineering practicality for data traceability and quality control in metadata governance."

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference is a key enabler of edge intelligence, but its high computational demands and the imperative to protect the intellectual property of pretrained models present substantial challenges. Although recent research has started using Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) for secure DNN inference, their limited memory and computational resources make it highly challenging to find an optimal balance between performance and security. To address this challenge, we propose Col-TEEs, a secure and efficient collaborative inference framework for heterogeneous TEEs. Col-TEEs strategically partitions the DNN inference process into device-side TEE and cloud-side TEE execution, aiming to maximize inference efficiency while ensuring model and data security. We first propose an optimal secure range determination method, which defines a secure interval by simulating model extraction and input reconstruction attacks, ensuring the confidentiality of pre-trained models and the privacy of user inputs. Furthermore, within this secure range, Col-TEEs employs an adaptive partitioning method that comprehensively evaluates the characteristics of heterogeneous TEE platforms. By combining a precise inference latency prediction model with heuristic algorithms, Col-TEEs dynamically selects the optimal partition point to balance security and inference performance. Additionally, Col-TEEs incorporates an integrity verification mechanism to secure intermediate data during network transmission. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Col-TEEs effectively balances performance and security, achieving an average <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{2. 9 8}$</tex>-fold increase in inference speed and a 63.54 % reduction in power consumption.

Building upon it, a design method based on IEP gain predistortion technique is proposed to achieve a wide and stable scan range across the operating band. To validate the design method, an antenna with ultra-wide beamwidth of 224° and highly flexible beam shaping capability is proposed. Two phased arrays based on it are designed. The first phased array (Array I) achieves a flat-gain ABE, realizing a scan range of up to ±76° with only 1.0 dB gain fluctuation. The second phased array (Array II) achieves an ABE with a scan range of over ±81° throughout the operating band. A prototype of Array II is fabricated and measured, and the measured results agree well with simulations."

Traditional structured pruning methods that rely on magnitude-based metrics, such as L1/L2 norms or geometric median, often produce similar filter rankings. This raises concerns about the uniqueness and informativeness of the resulting importance scores. In this study, we introduce a variance-based pruning method that diverges from conventional magnitude-based approaches by evaluating filter importance through the variance distribution of weights within convolutional layers. Our theoretical analysis shows that weighted variance captures complementary information overlooked by norm-based methods, distinguishing our criterion from existing approaches. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct comprehensive experiments with the ImageNet dataset. We compare our method against multiple baseline pruning techniques – including L1-norm pruning, L2-norm, geometric median, HRank, RASP, AutoSlim, and Taylor-approximation-based pruning.

At the designed operation frequency of 1THz, the power ratio of the metasurface polarizer is around 97%. Compared with the traditional terahertz polarizer implementation method, the selective transmission of arbitrary polarization is achieved only through a single-layer all-dielectric structure. Further studies show that by adjusting the geometric parameters of the two silicon pillars in the cell structure, continuous 2π phase coverage can be achieved, enabling functional integration of polarization selection and wavefront shaping.

    "abstract": "With the widespread adoption of 5G networks, Federated Learning (FL) has gradually become an important paradigm for distributed artificial intelligence. However, clients in FL environments often exhibit significant heterogeneity in computational resources and data distributions, and under Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) scenarios, such heterogeneity not only slows model convergence but also affects the final accuracy. To reduce the computational burden on clients, this study adopts structured pruning by trimming filters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and dynamically adjusting pruning ratios according to client resources. Nevertheless, variations in model structures resulting from different pruning ratios make it difficult for traditional FL aggregation to maintain consistency. To address this issue, we propose FedCHAP (Federated Customized Heterogeneous Aggregation with Pruning), which integrates dynamic pruning with a heterogeneous aggregation mechanism. FedCHAP enables clients to flexibly adjust pruning ratios based on their available resources while ensuring the feasibility of aggregation through padding weight and structural alignment. Experiments conducted on a network traffic classification dataset under multiple Non-IID scenarios demonstrate that, in the most extreme case of quantity-based label imbalance, FedCHAP reduced the overall FL runtime by 8.1% and improved global accuracy by 4% compared with applying a fixed 30% pruning ratio to all clients. Furthermore, we benchmark the performance of FedCHAP against state-of-the-art FL methods and demonstrate its generalizability across various application domains. Overall, the findings validate that FedCHAP can effectively lower resource consumption while preserving model performance and stability."

    "abstract": "In 5G network access, Internet of Things (IoT) resource management is expected to meet extremely strict packet loss and delay requirements, particularly for massive data-driven and delay-sensitive applications. Under highly erratic network conditions and dynamic traffic patterns, standard scheduling rules often fail to satisfy advanced Quality of Service (QoS) demands. To ensure precise, efficient, and collision-free information transmission in deployed IoT networks, a scheduling window is utilized. In this context, the packet scheduler becomes crucial as it allocates user data packets at predetermined intervals, enabling efficient use of resource in constrained environments. Intelligent packet scheduling plays a vital role in reducing consumption of network resources while improving reliability. Although machine learning (ML)-based optimization methods assign higher priority to critical IoT nodes, they risk permanently blocking low-priority communication paths, potentially causing important events to go undetected. To address this, a weight-optimized packet scheduling (WOPS) approach based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) is introduced to improve enhance energy efficiency. The model represents each incoming packet using a temporal feature vector and employs a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to learn sequential patterns, while a dense layer generates priority scores for ranking. For communication paths with limited information, the proposed method minimizes unnecessary packet transmission, contributing to energy consumption reduction and supporting long-term conservation of IoT device power. Simulation results demonstrate that the approach can reduce overall energy consumption by approximately 20%, highlighting its effectiveness in improving both efficiency and sustainability in IoT scheduling."

To optimize the process, models of the arithmetic mean utility function with weighting coefficients have been developed. The models are obtained as a result of a research and modelling of the main response variables (production rate, cutting tool life and surface roughness) of the CNC turning process depending on the cutting conditions. The optimal conditions for implementing the process of CNC turning have been determined, under which the generalized utility function has a maximum for each of the cutting tools used. The determined optimal solutions guarantee the best combination of process production rate, cutting tool life and roughness of the machined surfaces."

    "abstract": "Efficient patient admission scheduling is a key challenge in hospital management, as it directly impacts resource utilization and the quality of care. The Patient Admission Scheduling Problem (PASP) involves assigning patients to hospital beds over a planning horizon while considering medical constraints and hospital capacity. Due to its complexity, heuristic and metaheuristic approaches are often used to find high-quality solutions within a reasonable time. In this work, we propose a Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) metaheuristic to solve the PASP. VNS systematically explores different neighborhoods to escape local optima and improve solution quality. To assess the impact of local search strategies, we implement four versions of VNS, each using a different method for modifying patient assignments. The proposed approach is evaluated on benchmark instances, where we conduct parameter tuning and analyze computational performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, showing that the appropriate choice of local search strategies significantly impact the quality of the results."

Recently, much researches focus on identifying IoT devices with traffic feature extraction and machine learning algorithms. However, existing methods typically design complex features involving packet payloads for high identification accuracy, which leaks user privacy and leads to large computational overhead. In this paper, we propose SecFinder, a privacy protection-based system for fine-grained IoT device identification in smart home. First, SecFinder analyzes the characteristics of network traffic from IoT devices and uses the statistical information of packet size from the traffic flow to characterize various devices in order to protect privacy. To reduce computational overhead and improve recognition accuracy, SecFinder divides traffic with fixed-size time window and extract only six statistical features from each flow. Then a multi-stage classifier is applied to identify IoT and non-IoT devices, IoT device types and the detailed information of each IoT device. SecFinder is evaluated with traffic from a public real-world device dataset and five classifiers. The results validate that SecFinder can achieve higher accuracy and lower latency in identification than existing methods."

The proposed model derives evidence-based allocation standards, transitioning from coarse-grained, experience-based procurement to precise, predictive resource optimization. Descriptive and visual analytics reveal significant geographical imbalances and misalignments between current provisioning strategies and actual operational demand. Among six evaluated algorithms, Bayesian Ridge Regression (BYS) and Ridge Regression (RID) achieve the lowest mean squared error, outperforming linear, ensemble, and non-parametric alternatives. The framework reduces fiscal waste, mitigates premature equipment degradation, and enhances operational readiness.

The framework innovatively combines the temporal modeling capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with the global dependency modeling capabilities of Transformer through a cross-attention fusion mechanism, achieving deep integration of the advantages of both architectures. Experimental results on the CIDDS-002 dataset demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model achieves 99.97% accuracy in traffic classification tasks, representing a 0.33 percentage point improvement over traditional machine learning methods and a 0.46 percentage point improvement over single deep learning methods. Ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of each component, and confusion matrix analysis shows that the model achieves 99.99% accuracy in normal traffic identification, effectively reducing false positive rates. The smooth convergence of loss curves during training indicates the model's stability and efficient learning capability.

Secondly, ciphertext data encoding is carried out to support homomorphic operations. Next, a zero-knowledge proof is used to verify the correctness of the ciphertext intersection calculation. Finally, the protocol is embedded into the federated learning workflow, adaptively adjusting the parameters. Experimental results show that the protocol achieves the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) security level 3, and the privacy leakage rate is less than 1.2%, the communication and computational costs are controllable, and the protocol does not bring great influence to the accuracy of the federated learning model. The experimental results verify that the protocol can provide a reliable protection for the privacy of federated learning data in the quantum era."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is frequently hampered by systemic latency heterogeneity, where client computation and communication speeds can form distinct clusters. Traditional FL approaches, often oblivious to this underlying structure, may struggle to manage stragglers from slower client clusters, potentially leading to notable decreases in training efficiency and model performance. To address this challenge, we propose Federated Learning with Latency-Aware Hierarchical Clustering (FedLAHC), a novel framework designed to identify and leverage these latent client groupings. FedLAHC employs a hierarchical clustering algorithm that groups clients based on latency profiles, followed by a stratified model aggregation process that respects this clustered structure. This design aims to accelerate convergence by mitigating the impact of slower clients on faster ones, while still enabling all clients to contribute to the global model. Our extensive experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets indicate that FedLAHC can accelerate convergence by up to 15.3 % and improve final model accuracy by up to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{2. 3 \\%}$</tex> compared to structure-agnostic baselines. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of FedLAHC's convergence and formally connect its potential performance gains to the quality of the discovered latency clusters. This work suggests that by recognizing and adapting to the clustered nature of client latency, it is possible to build more efficient and effective federated learning systems."

First, a bidirectional search strategy is adopted, in which the search is simultaneously initiated from both the start and goal points. During node expansion, a dynamic five-neighborhood search strategy and a direct-connection mechanism are introduced. Second, the evaluation function is enhanced by integrating a hybrid dynamic weighting mechanism and a dynamic angle-based heuristic function. Finally, a forward optimization strategy combined with a reverse greedy strategy is employed to optimize the path, and the resulting route is refined by applying a cubic uniform B-spline method. Through multiple simulation experiments, the results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm reduces the average number of search nodes by 74% and the number of turning points by 55.2%; the average path length is shortened by 13.75%, and the average planning time is reduced by 66.5%. These experimental results verify that, compared with the traditional A-Star algorithm, the improved algorithm achieves significantly higher path planning efficiency and demonstrates promising applicability and practical value in logistics handling environments."

    "abstract": "Pneumonia is still a big health problem around the world, especially in places where there aren’t many doctors or medical supplies. Fast and accurate diagnosis is important, but many clinics have to rely on chest X-rays because they don’t have regular access to expert radiologists. This can lead to delays or wrong diagnoses. Artificial intelligence shows promise as a way to automatically analyse X-ray images to find pneumonia, but using it in healthcare settings is difficult because of privacy concerns, the need for clear explanations, and the need for efficient models. Federated learning lets hospitals work together to make AI models stronger without having to share private patient information. This keeps patient information private while still improving performance. Trust is still very important, so this framework also has explainability features. For example, it uses heatmaps to show clinicians which parts of an image affected predictions, which helps to connect AI and human reasoning. Lightweight neural network designs make sure that the models can run on any computer or portable device that is used in a variety of healthcare settings, making them easier to access. By integrating clinical background information such as age, gender, or other health indicators into the diagnostic process along with image data, the AI system can provide more tailored and accurate results. This paper presents an all in one approach that blends privacy-preserving learning, explainable artificial intelligence, computational efficiency, and multi-modal input, with the goal of making robust, trustworthy pneumonia detection more widely available in real-world healthcare settings."

First, several machine learning approaches such as Multinomial Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting are implemented to predict and classify patients' care requirements. This categorization not only separates professional-grade nurses from primary-grade nurses but also decides whether one caregiver or two caregivers are to be deployed depending on the condition of the patient (bedridden or semi-dependent). Secondly, we create a Multi-Objective Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (MOVRPTW) to schedule the caregivers efficiently and reduce transport costs. Since the corresponding optimization problem is NP-hard, we take two advanced genetic algorithms Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) and Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA2) to find good-quality solutions. To solve the problems of bedridden patient care with multiple visits per day, our model incorporates synchronization constraints to ensure continuity of care and coordination among single-caregiver teams in case dedicated double teams are not possible. By combining predictive analytics with strong optimization techniques, our framework not only improves resource allocation effectiveness and facilitates timely service delivery but also decreases operating expenses, thus providing a holistic solution to the changing needs of home healthcare logistics."

    "abstract": "Detecting text within natural environments presents a considerable computer vision challenge due to the wide variations in text scale, orientation, and shape. Many current methods are hampered by this diversity, primarily because of two key shortcomings: suboptimal fusion of multi-scale features and inadequate modeling of global context. These issues often lead to compromised detection accuracy. To overcome these problems, this paper introduces a novel network for scene text detection. Firstly, a Channel and Coordinate Attention Module (CCAM) is introduced into the feature pyramid to mitigate information loss during feature fusion by synergizing channel-wise feature selection with precise, direction-aware positional information. Additionally, we design a Shifted Convolutional Transformer Block (SCT-Block) that replaces conventional self-attention with an efficient multi-scale convolutional architecture. This module captures long-range dependencies and learns robust, spatially-invariant representations through a novel feature shifting mechanism, enhancing the model’s ability to distinguish text from complex backgrounds.The effectiveness and robustness of our method are validated by experimental results on public bench-marks, where F-measures of 86.1% and 87.6% were achieved on ICDAR2015 and MSRA-TD500, respectively."

Accurate modulation depth estimation is crucial for selecting optical power and, more importantly, for modeling the sensing matrix used in signal reconstruction. Inaccurate modelling can result in noisy or failed reconstructions. We also observed frequency-dependent modulation depth, varying from 19% to 36% for the 25.95% case for WR 2.2 band.

The slit dimensions are carefully optimized to maximize sensitivity. The sensor’s performance is evaluated by measuring frequency and phase changes in the reflection coefficient for glucose concentrations compared to pure water. Results show a high sensitivity, with a frequency shift of 80 KHz per $1 \\mathrm{mg} / \\mathrm{dL}$ increase in glucose concentration. This work supports the development of costeffective, reliable, and non-invasive glucose sensors that improve patient comfort and reduce infection risk."

    "abstract": "Timely and accurate identification of arrhythmia types in ECG signals is essential for prompt medical intervention in cardiovascular diseases. However, deploying neural networks for ECG classification on energy- and resource-constrained wearable devices remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a lightweight Spiking Neural Network (SNN) model that achieves high accuracy for severity-based ECG classification. To efficiently encode spikes, we enhance traditional delta modulation with a dynamic threshold and apply an OR-pooling operation on non-critical ECG segments. This preserves important signal features while simplifying the SNN model. Furthermore, we introduce a hierarchical SNN-based architecture comprising three classifiers tailored to severity-based ECG classification. These classifiers share a common feature extraction layer, which significantly reduces the overall model size. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves high accuracy, ranging from 97.3% to 99.4%, for severity-based 15-class MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset, with only 8.5k parameters, demonstrating its suitability for wearable ECG monitoring applications."

However, model-based planners may be brittle under these types of uncertainty because they rely on an exact model and tend to commit to a single optimal behavior. Inspired by results in the model-free setting, we propose an entropy-regularized model-based planner for partially observable problems. Entropy regularization promotes policy robustness for planning and objective inference by encouraging policies to be no more committed to a single action than necessary. We evaluate the robustness and objective inference performance of entropy-regularized policies in three problem domains. Our results show that entropy-regularized policies outperform non-entropy-regularized baselines in terms of higher expected returns under modeling errors and higher accuracy in objective inference."

Fully-Decoupled RANs (FD-RANs) are a promising architectural innovation that enables flexible plane separation. However, current architectures have limitations due to ineffective multiple access schemes. To this end, we introduce NomaFdRaN, an innovative Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA)-optimized FD-RAN architecture in order to optimize reliability and MC. To achieve holistic system optimization, NomaFdRaN applies NOMA on all network planes, control plane and user plane, and transmission paths, uplink and downlink. To improve NOMA efficiency, we develop a user pairing optimization approach that minimizes total transmit power while maintaining linear computing complexity. Based on stochastic geometry, we develop analytical models to analyze NomaFdRaN's performance. Subsequently, we analytically derived closed-form expressions for key performance metrics. Our simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the NomaFdRaN architecture and provide insights into the deployment strategies for next-generation FD-RANs."

Hence, image segmentation is significant in the precise identification of tumor regions in mammography. In this regard, this research proposes a Generative Residual Attention U-Net (GRAUNet) model that improves breast tumor segmentation. The proposed approach comprises noise removal and contrast enhancement as preprocessing techniques for enhancing the quality of the image. The proposed approach uses public mammography databases for training the machine learning algorithm, where the databases comprise diverse characteristics of the tumor for the purpose of robustness. To evaluate performance in segmentation, performance assessment is carried based on a number of measures, which are Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Jaccard Index (IoU), Hausdorff Distance (HD95) and Sensitivity (Recall). The results have proved the proposed GRAUNet architecture performs a better segmentation task for getting a dice score of 0.92 than the existing techniques. The proposed model provides excellent detection of the tumor regions when accounting for changes in size, shape, intensity in the tumor, enhancing the diagnostic capabilities. The recommended method improves automated breast cancer detection and assists with clinical diagnosis. Future studies will be directed at additional optimization, realtime execution for the improvement of diagnostic efficiency and accessibility."

Next, we improve the calculation speed of the entire model by fusing the Convolution layer and the Batch Normalization layer. Compared with the PyTorch implementation, the proposed method achieved more than $79 \\%$ of the peak performance in matrix multiplication while maintaining accuracy and succeeded in speeding up inference time by $47.712 \\%$ on the Cityscapes dataset and $39.096 \\%$ on the Visual Navigation dataset."

In this paper, by analyzing two metropolitan scale sensory datasets, we find that city perception data demonstrate strong spatial-temporal correlation. Based on this observation, we propose an innovative deep learning method, called DeepSeer, which can accurately estimate and predict signals at a metropolitan scale with short-term noisy sensory data. To this end, DeepSeer first reconstructs the original short-term data using multi-channel singular spectrum analysis (MSSA) to obtain sufficient training data. Second, because the metropolitan scale data would introduce an unacceptable computational complexity, DeepSeer only selects the sites that are spatially most relevant for prediction and uses a extended Treestructure Long Short-Term Memory (Tree-LSTM) to extract and fuse the features of different sites. We conduct extensive trace-driven simulations on both datasets. The average prediction accuracy of DeepSeer for both datasets can reach 90.75% and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{9 1. 1 9 \\%}$</tex>, respectively.

    "abstract": "Collaborative edge-cloud video analytics is hampered by a fundamental trade-off among accuracy, latency, and resource cost. Cloud-centric processing suffers from prohibitive bandwidth consumption and delay, while edge-only solutions are constrained by limited computational power. To resolve this challenge, we propose an Adaptive Scheduling framework for DNN Models and Resources (ASDMR). ASDMR formulates the problem as a multiobjective optimization aimed at maximizing long-term system utility. The framework intelligently orchestrates key decisions in real-time, including adaptive model selection on heterogeneous edge nodes, dynamic task scheduling (local, edge-to-edge, or cloud), adaptive resolution scaling, content-aware result reuse, and load-based frame filtering. We employ Lyapunov optimization to decompose this long-term stochastic problem into a series of deterministic subproblems that are solved online in each time slot. This approach allows the system to dynamically balance analysis accuracy against resource cost while satisfying latency constraints, without needing to predict future workloads. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ASDMR significantly outperforms baseline methods under diverse conditions, achieving a more effective trade-off across accuracy, cost, and latency. The framework thus offers a robust and practical solution for building efficient, large-scale collaborative video analytics systems."

Taking a 300MW unit at a power plant as the research subject, 26,211 sets of operational data collected from October 2024 to April 2025 were used to construct the MSET model. Residuals were employed to calculate the unit's impeded capacity, with deviation thresholds set based on the 3σ criterion. Multivariate linear regression analysis was then applied to determine parameter contribution rates. Simultaneously, the Analytic Hierarchy Process and entropy weighting method were employed to determine indicator weights, quantifying the reboiler system's impact through a two-level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation. Model validation yielded an average absolute error (MAE) of 0.0241, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0313, and R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> of 0.9545, indicating high fitting accuracy. Analysis of test cases confirmed that contribution analysis indicated the outlet temperature of High-Pressure Heater No. 1 exerted the greatest influence on output loss, demonstrating the method's efficacy in pinpointing root causes. Fuzzy evaluation concluded that the regenerative system exerts a moderate impact on the unit's impedance capacity. This model enables precise prediction of system status and fault source localisation, providing theoretical support for maintenance and energy efficiency management of regenerative systems in thermal power units."

In this paper, we present PStore, a high-performance, integrity-aware storage backend module that provides end-to-end protection through an optimized checksum architecture. By leveraging the structured I/O patterns of CNDs and employing deferred checksum recalculation, PStore significantly reduces both I/O and computational overhead. We implement PStore and evaluate it on real hardware.

To address this, we propose HyDLR, a dynamic, loadaware hybrid deployment scheduling method that dynamically reallocates offline tasks to ensure Quality of Service (QoS) for online services while enhancing overall resource utilization. The bursty nature and stringent QoS demands of online tasks, coupled with the fluctuating resource footprints of offline tasks, can lead to severe resource pressure on nodes and undermine system stability. HyDLR first designs a load-aware rescheduling policy that dynamically identifies resource hotspots by monitoring metrics such as CPU satisfaction degree, memory, and GPU memory utilization. It then leverages eviction and task migration to optimize workload distribution. Furthermore, a two-stage filtering algorithm, guided by a multi-objective optimization model, targets system-wide load balancing and minimal rescheduling overhead. By incorporating a dynamically adjusted priority queue and a cost-feedback mechanism, HyDLR improves scheduling efficiency without compromising stability. Experimental results demonstrate that HyDLR significantly reduces the frequency of task migrations while achieving a well-balanced system load. The rate of cascading rescheduling events is kept below 3%, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches. This work offers an effective solution for resource management in complex, hybrid deployment scenarios, laying a foundation for more efficient data center scheduling and demonstrating strong potential for practical adoption."

However, floor plan parsing still faces challenges such as insufficient data diversity, dense non-structural interference, and difficulties in fine-grained component recognition, making traditional image-processing methods inadequate for high-precision analysis. To address these challenges, a scene-adaptive intelligent floor plan parsing approach is proposed, integrating object detection and semantic segmentation to achieve end-to-end recognition and geometric reconstruction of walls, doors, windows, and interior spaces. On the data side, a multi-source dataset is constructed, covering public drawings, industrial CAD blueprints, and real estate floor plans, with an optimized preprocessing pipeline involving slidingwindow partitioning and primitive cleaning. On the model side, an integrated interference removal and structural segmentation method is designed, in which YOLOv8 is employed to eliminate non-structural graphic elements, and Mask2Former is adopted for high-precision segmentation of walls and room regions. Furthermore, for component recognition and post-processing, a YOLOE-based detector combined with visual prompting achieves accurate fine-grained component detection, while a geometrydriven post-processing module enhances structural closure and usability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 97.6 % wall segmentation accuracy, 98.3 % room mIoU, and 99.1 % component detection mAP, significantly outperforming mainstream baselines in structural connectivity, component recognition, and robustness across diverse architectural scenarios."

Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) can boost KGR by introducing artificial randomness, yet existing schemes only randomize the RIS phase shifts without using environmental priors, failing to maximize the KGR and meet the communication signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirement, causing service outages. To overcome these limitations, we propose the RIS-assisted Integrated Communication and WC-SKG (RICK) scheme. First, we treat the RIS-adjusted channel as a designable random variable and derive its optimal probability density function (PDF) using a novel geometric-algebraic framework to maximize the KGR under the communication SNR constraint. Second, we design a constrained-clustering-based quantization region division scheme tailored to this optimal non-uniform PDF, guaranteeing uniformly distributed secret keys. Simulation results show RICK achieves a KGR approximately 3.5-5 times higher than the state-of-the-art scheme while saving at least 20 dB of transmit power for the same KGR, confirming its effectiveness in quasi-static scenarios."

Fuzzing has emerged as a promising approach, but existing methods often neglect the interplay between map complexity and multi-object mutations, resulting in limited coverage of safety-critical behaviors. To address this gap, we propose a map-aware reinforcement learning fuzzing (MARFT) approach that adaptively tailors fuzzing actions to spatial map features while jointly mutating multiple scenario parameters. Reinforcement learning, guided by undesirable behaviors and trajectory coverage, drives the selection of fuzzing actions to maximize exposure of safety-critical events through a closed-loop cycle of “scenario state perception → fuzzing action decision → driving reward feedback”. Experimental results demonstrate that our adaptive strategy significantly outperforms non-adaptive baselines in ADS failure detection. By combining Q-learning with trajectory coverage and behavior-driven seed selection, MARFT provides a scalable and adaptive solution for ADS testing, advancing the detection of critical behavioral patterns in complex driving environments."

    "abstract": "In the field of code generation, large language models(LLMs) have made significant advancements. In addition to straightforward code generation, the latest research integrates unit testing and debuggers into the code generation process of LLMs. This approach enables the large models to self-improve the generated code by incorporating feedback from test results. However, the current method relies only on a small number of test cases for code debugging, making it difficult to cover various scenarios and edge conditions of the program, especially in cases involving complex logic or extensive data operations. To address this issue, the paper proposes a Test Case Enhanced Self-Iterative code generation framework (TEI). This is a novel solution comprising analysts, designers, developers, and testers. Analysts and designers are responsible for refining code requirements and designing structured solutions, respectively. Developers encode based on the refined requirements and design solutions. Testers are required, firstly, to design multiple comprehensive, detailed, and precise test cases based on a given test case, and secondly, to systematically verify the generated code block by block and report its correctness and any potential errors, in order to provide feedback to the analysts in the next iteration. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework (TEI), when using GPT-3.5 as the agent, outperforms existing code generation models and methods significantly. For instance, our approach achieves an 88.4% pass@1 rate in the HumanEval benchmarks, surpassing the previously state-of-the-art GPT-4, which only achieved 85.4%. We also investigated the accuracy of augmented test cases and their impact on the overall quality of code generation within the framework. “Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently.” Henry Ford"

    "abstract": "Edge Video Analytics (EVA) significantly reduces response time by executing analytical tasks at the edge. However, it inevitably faces accuracy loss when dealing with highly complex analytical scenarios. To overcome this, we propose offloading the most complex video frames to the cloud while processing other frames at the edge. Nevertheless, determining both the quantity and the specific selection of frames for offloading poses challenges due to edge-cloud bandwidth constraints and the dynamic nature of video content. To tackle this problem, we present a Discerning and Elastic Offloading Framework (DEOF), which consists of an Accuracy Predictor and an Offloading Scheduler. The former identifies the detection complexity of each frame by predicting its F1-score gain based on multidimensional information, enabling it to discern and select the most complex frames for offloading. The latter determines the optimal proportion of frames to process in the cloud and at the edge by designing a Lyapunov-optimization-based algorithm, which elastically adjusts this proportion in response to time-varying video content and resource conditions, thus ensuring both adaptability and efficiency. We have implemented DEOF fully based on COTS hardware, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DEOF, showing that our system can reduce offloaded data volume by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$7.1 \\%-36.3 \\%$</tex>, decrease latency by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{2. 6 \\% - 1 9. 5 \\%}$</tex>, and improve accuracy by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{2. 6 \\%}$</tex> 3.2 % compared to alternative methods."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a cooperative edge-caching framework for LEO-assisted vehicular networks, focusing on the joint optimization of content placement and delivery under dynamic conditions. The system is modeled as a dual time-scale Markov Decision Process (DTS-MDP), where slow-scale decisions capture cache placement and fast-scale decisions capture realtime content delivery. Unlike prior work, our formulation introduces a novel triplet-based state representation (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$m, f, s$</tex>) that explicitly captures the mobility of requesting vehicles, the demand characteristics of content files, and the cache status of serving satellites. This modeling choice enables the effective application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to a problem space that involves highly dynamic mobility, intermittent satellite visibility, storage limitations, and latency constraints. To optimize within this framework, we apply a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, which jointly manages discrete caching actions and continuous resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements in content hit ratio, delivery latency, and system cost compared to baseline strategies. While evaluated under a serving single satellite setup, the framework is inherently scalable to larger constellations and denser vehicular networks, providing a solid foundation for future multi-satellite extensions and real-world deployments."

Early diagnosis of the disease is crucial for effective treatment and management. This study proposes a new method using a modified ResNet18 CNN architecture to detect and monitor AD using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. The standard ResNet18 CNN architecture was simplified to use fewer layers and lower filter degrees to expedite the training procedures. In the proposed method, the scalogram images obtained using the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) from 5 sec EEG segments of the AD and control groups are used as input to the modified ResNet18 CNN architecture. 2D time-frequency images of EEG segments are generated using both Bump wavelet CWT and the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), for comparison. Calculated images are used to train the standard ResNet18, and modified ResNet18 CNN architectures to classify the EEG segments. Experimental results show that the CWT approach achieved higher performance compared to the STFT, and the proposed modified ResNet18 CNN architecture (93.74% accuracy) demonstrated more balanced performance than other architectures, exhibiting no overfitting, and completed the training much faster than other models, providing significant time savings."

The VNE problem consists in finding an optimal assignment of virtual demands to physical resources, encompassing simultaneous placement and routing decisions.We study the offline version of the VNE, which arises in the context of decision-making for resource allocation and network slice planning. For large networks, the heuristics of the literature often struggle to find solutions, especially when available resources (on nodes and edges) are sparse.To address these challenges, we explore mathematical programming approaches. Since the classical Flow Formulation provides a weak linear relaxation, we consider a novel formulation, based on a partition of the virtual graph into smaller virtual subgraphs. Since this formulation has an exponential number of variable, its linear relaxation can be solved with Column Generation. We devise a Price-Branch heuristic able to solve large instances, while providing optimality gap. The resulting computational experiments indicate our Price-Branch heuristic is often the only algorithm able to find a solution from a certain instance size, largely outperforming the Flow Formulation or literature heuristics."

In this talk, I will present nanostructured ultra-thin PET membranes that are designed to absorb the THz wave and effectively heat up thus emitting in the infrared.First, we image the heat transfers in the terahertz metasurface from the first time of heating up to the steady states and compare it to finite element modelling coupling electromagnetic and thermal physics. Interestingly, the THz metasurface is easily resolved through an infrared camera leading to the demonstration of far field acquired image of the near field modes of the metasurface.

To address this challenge, we propose a graph convolutional deep residual network for classification. First, a platform–target association matrix is constructed based on the statistical features of radar data. Tag features are then implicitly modeled via tag embedding, and deep signal features are extracted using a deep residual convolutional module. Subsequently, the data and tag features are fused through attention-weighted feature splicing. To fully exploit tag dependencies, the graph convolutional network is enhanced to accept the spliced features as input, enabling the generation of feature maps that yield learnable classifiers. The extracted features and generated classifiers are integrated to produce the final classification results. Experiments on real-world datasets reveal that the proposed method achieves the dynamic fusion and efficient classification of cross-platform multi-tag features. Compared to traditional independent multi-classification approaches, it improves accuracy and computational efficiency by 17% and 9.3%, respectively. Moreover, the integration of implicit tag modeling and feature splicing contributes an additional 8% gain in accuracy, fully meeting the practical application requirements of real-world scenarios."

The original design used AppConnectors in the primary and secondary data centers (Austria and Greece). The final solution however, uses two Azure-hosted Private Service Edges (PSEs) and six Azure-hosted AppConnectors distributed in Ireland, Austria and Greece. During testing, an AppConnector in Washington D.C. (within a Zscaler Beta tenant) managed US traffic, to avoid exposing real production data and applications – this way reducing compliance risk. The DNS services vendor used was MarkMonitor which also provides a geo-location pinning of the queries; Azure Traffic Manager feature was used to optimize and introduce load balancing and additional low-latency optimization. Since Zscaler Digital Experience (ZDX) was already deployed (integrated with the Zscaler Client Connector VPN), we used it to monitor performance and outcomes. Results showed up to 35% improvement in application latency in Europe. For DNS queries (which trigger a \"red\" alert at 500ms), the new production setup eliminated all previously observed latency spikes. We implemented a proof-of-concept traffic steering for Egypt (due to endpoint specifics) and Armenia (due to severe local transfer speed limitations) - we optimized the trans-region transfer speed during DR by nearly 50%."

However, challenges persist due to unique imaging perspectives and wide fields of view, resulting in significant object scale variations and poor detection accuracy for small objects amid complex backgrounds. Although existing methods have made partial progress, limitations remain in enhancing small-object detection and achieving an optimal balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. To address these issues, we propose FSD-YOLO, a novel object detector tailored for remote sensing image analysis, designed to achieve high detection accuracy without compromising efficiency. Our approach introduces two key components: the Feature Complementary Integration Unit (FCU) and the Spatial Mapping Perception Module (SPM), both aimed at improving feature representation and perceptibility of small objects in cluttered scenes. Additionally, we incorporate Dysample to mitigate noise amplification caused by texture artifacts during upsampling. Experimental results on the DIOR dataset show that our method achieves a mAP@0.5 of 75.2%, surpassing the baseline YOLOv8m by 1.8%. Furthermore, FSD-YOLO demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art real-time detectors, effectively balancing accuracy and speed for practical deployment."

    "abstract": "Hybrid modular multilevel converter (H-MMC), which combines half-bridge (HB) and full-bridge (FB) submodules (SMs), offers significant advantages in handling overmodulation conditions and blocking dc fault currents. In H-MMC, redundant SMs are exploited to enhance the fault-tolerant capability. Cold reserve SMs are considered an appropriate option for fault-tolerant operation as they remain bypassed during normal conditions, avoiding additional power losses compared to hot reserve. However, since they are inactive during normal operation, it is essential to properly manage the charging of their capacitors. Inserting a cold reserve SM during MMC operation can cause a high inrush current in the charging phase, potentially damaging the SM. This work presents an approach that facilitates continuous and controlled insertion of cold reserve SMs, avoiding the associated inrush current and is applicable to both HB and FB SMs. The proposed cold reserve charging method charges SM through a parabolic function by exploiting the capacitor voltage balancing control, achieving the goal of controlled insertion without the need for precharging hardware circuits or additional control systems. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed method is compared with other alternatives. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method for using cold reserve SMs in H-MMCs have been validated through simulation and experimental studies."

The complexity stems from temporal dependencies that affect subsequent tasks and from idle-time constraints, where early-arriving UAVs must wait for collaborators. To tackle this, we propose a novel framework based on a geometric visualization of the scheduling problem, introducing the concept of a “skyline” to create a canonical representation of resource availability over time. A provably optimal schedule is found based on this skyline concept, and computational efficiency heuristics that incorporate a lookahead mechanism is proposed for large-scale, practical applications. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that our skyline-based methods consistently and significantly outperform conventional baseline algorithms in solution quality."

However, the proliferation of data scales and the extensive deployment of computational resources have engendered significant privacy concerns for users. In scenarios involving personal sensitive data, the safeguarding of privacy is of utmost importance. Homomorphic encryption technology, particularly the CKKS scheme, is capable of performing computations with minimal computational error while preserving data privacy, and it has been extensively utilized in encrypted neural networks. This paper studies Bit-Flip Attacks (BFAs) on encrypted neural networks under the RNS-CKKS scheme. We empirically analyze the effects of bit flips at different memory locations—covering ciphertext data, model weights, and evaluation keys—and report their observable outcomes (silent misclassification, irregular yet decodable outputs, or computation aborts). Under a realistic threat model where the adversary cannot precisely target bytes nor observe model predictions, BFAs can corrupt results but do not leak additional information. Our findings indicate that key corruption often produces conspicuous anomalies that offer detection potential for defenders."

DDS technology generates a 30MHz signal, which, combined with the AD8307 logarithmic detector and impedance matching network, enables AC attenuation measurement. Finally, a \"layered initialization + modular scheduling + modular execution\" program architecture was designed. EXTI external interrupts trigger button inputs, while a state machine schedules switching between dual-ended/single-ended detection. Each test function is encapsulated as an independent submodule, enabling multi-type cable parameter testing. This system accurately identifies cable types and connection relationships, with DC resistance and AC attenuation measurement errors both below 10%.

To address this challenges, we propose multi-factor Feature and multi-dimensional Reward-driven Adaptive Scheduling Policy (FRASP), an adaptive framework that first employs a Multi-factor feature Representation Graph Attention Network (MGAT) to embed dependency structure, remaining time, and priority into rich node representations, enabling precise identification of critical tasks. It then leverages a Multi-dimensional dynamic rewards Group Relative Policy Optimization (MGRPO) to generate and evaluate candidate schedules in parallel, simultaneously optimizing time-priority penalty, resource utilization, and deadline satisfaction rate. Moreover, FRASP incorporates a preemptive scheduling mechanism to dynamically interrupt lowerpriority tasks and allocate resources to high-priority taskses, ensuring rapid responsiveness in computing. Experimental results demonstrate that FRASP reduces average job completion time, increases deadline satisfaction, and enhances resource efficiency by approximately 5%, confirming its superiority in multiconstraint cloud environments while contributing to sustainable resource use."

However, existing approaches predominantly rely on early fusion strategies that project heterogeneous modalities into unified representations, diminishing modality-specific discriminative capabilities and failing to fully exploit inter-modal complementarity. Unlike prior fusion-based models that merge all modalities into a single latent space, our approach treats each modality as an independent reasoning expert and integrates their complementary outputs through an interpretable ensemble mechanism. To address these limitations, we propose the Multi-Branch Ensemble with Cross-Modal Fusion (MBE-CF) framework, which preserves modality-specific characteristics through independent reasoning pathways while capturing cross-modal interactions via dedicated fusion mechanisms. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a multi-modal attention fusion (MMAF) module that employs multi-head self-attention mechanisms to capture cross-modal interactions and obtain robust fused multi-modal representations, (2) a context triple encoder (CTE) that processes head-relation-tail sequences through modality-specific Transformer encoders to inject relational context into entity representations, and (3) an Ensemble Inference (EI) approach that uses independent Tucker decoders for structural, visual, textual, and multi-modal branches, aggregates per-branch scores at inference, and optimizes during training a Decision Fusion objective that sums branch-specific head and tail losses. The framework maintains architectural symmetry across modalities while facilitating comprehensive integration of heterogeneous reasoning patterns to leverage the complementary strengths of different information sources. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (DB15K, MKG-W, and MKG-Y) demonstrate that MBE-CF achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming 9 baseline methods across multiple evaluation metrics."

Energy-efficient trajectory planning, based on physics-based models, offers a practical alternative when hardware optimization is not feasible. However, existing formulations often model thrust and torque as inputs, leading to trajectories that are difficult to realize in practice. In this work, we reformulate the optimal control problem by using rotor accelerations as control inputs and allowing an open final time, enabling a balance between hover and propulsion energy. Practical constraints on rotor speeds and accelerations are explicitly incorporated, resulting in feasible, least-energy trajectories. Through numerical simulations, we further demonstrate how optimizing rotor parameters can significantly reduce the total energy consumption."

However, it also raises new privacy challenges, as eavesdroppers with advanced semantic models can infer sensitive information from minimal intercepted data. This paper proposes PrunedCBA-DQN, a privacy-preserving SemCom framework that constructs private knowledge by extracting subgraphs from the sender's knowledge graph using source messages as keywords. This private knowledge is integrated into the encoder-decoder pipeline, ensuring that critical semantics remain inaccessible without it. We leverage the Diameter-bounded max-Coverage Group Steiner Tree (DCGST) formulation for expressive keyword-based graph exploration and train deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents to optimize the diameter parameter dynamically. Simulations show that our approach achieves high-quality semantic reconstruction while effectively countering eavesdropping, advancing secure and intelligent 6G SemCom systems."

Although open-source driving simulators such as CARLA offer high flexibility, their adoption is often hindered by the requirement for advanced programming knowledge and complex system configurations. To address this issue, the proposed simulator emphasizes ease of use and intuitive integration, enabling seamless operation without requiring extensive technical expertise. To reproduce Japan-specific driving conditions, including left-hand traffic and right-hand drive vehicles, the system incorporates 3D city models from the PLATEAU project. These models are open-access and feature semantically enriched datasets that accurately reproduce the actual urban structures of Japanese cities. Key features include the integration of a virtual reality environment with a VR headset and steering wheel controller, as well as a modular control system for waypoint-driven vehicles. The resulting simulator contributes to research in fields such as transportation systems, urban planning, road design, and traffic safety, while its accessibility promotes broader academic participation and more cost-effective deployment compared to existing platforms. Experimental evaluations have demonstrated strong usability and high immersive quality, validating its effectiveness as a human-centered simulation platform."

Identifying modulation types in these mixtures is essential for emitter recognition and electromagnetic situation awareness. We present a semi-supervised contrastive learning approach based on cyclostationary analysis to address this problem. Our method extracts features from four domains: cyclostationary statistics, higher-order cumulants, cyclic frequency correlation, and complex envelope dynamics. These domains together capture the periodic structures and statistical properties that distinguish different modulation schemes. We evaluate the approach on a dataset with seven modulation types forming 21 mixed combinations. The method achieves approximately 52% accuracy at 20 dB SNR, with consistent performance across the −10 to 20 dB range. Compared to IQ-based or time–frequency methods, our cyclostationary approach exploits signal-specific properties and works with limited labeled data. The results suggest that cyclostationary features can provide useful prior information for identifying co-channel transmitters in Satellite Signal Monitoring applications."

This optimization process involves making informed decisions about order acceptance based on profitability, processing time, and energy requirements, while considering the cost fluctuations imposed by TOU pricing. To effectively address this problem, a time-indexed formulation is proposed that provides a structured approach to optimizing scheduling decisions under these constraints. In order to further enhance the performance of the proposed MILP model, two families of valid constraints have been developed.

The International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz Waves (IRMMW-THz) is the oldest and largest continuous forum specifically devoted to the field of ultra-high frequency electronics and long-wave electromagnetics. The first conference in this series was held in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, in 1974. In his Foreword to the Conference Digest, Kenneth Button of MIT predicted that the Conference would \"be the first of a long series because the submillimeter wave specialty has become well-defined and moderately well populated.\" This prediction was very prescient. In 2004, the original conference series – The International Conference on Infrared and Millimeter Waves (IRMMW) - joined with The International Conference on THz Electronics to form the Joint 29th International Conference on Infrared and Millimeter Waves and the 12th International Conference on Terahertz Electronics (IRMMW-THz 2004). In 2008, the conference name was shortened to the International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz Waves. In 2009, the conference series was incorporated as a science society registered in the USA, and in 2016 it was converted into a non-profit international science organization. The society hosts the website https://www.irmmw-thz.org/. With this strong foundation, the Conference is sure to continue as an extremely valuable resource for scientists and engineers in our field."

The waveguides were fabricated on a semi-insulating InP substrate, and measurements were performed between 325 GHz to 1100 GHz. We show that by connecting the ground planes using air bridges, the accuracy of the calibration is improved. The probable reason is the suppression of the odd mode; however, secondary effects, such as crosstalk, require further investigation."

This paper proposes a novel fine-tuning method for multimodal Large models that integrates LLaMA, Masked Autoencoder (MAE), and DETR, and constructs the Masked Large Language DEtection (MLLDE) model. The LLaMA model possesses powerful language understanding and generation capabilities, capable of deeply analyzing unstructured semantic information such as device operation logs and alarm texts, and extracting key semantic features. The MAE model effectively extracts key visual features from infrared images and visible light images through a selfsupervised image reconstruction mechanism, identifying surface defects or thermal anomalies of equipment. The DETR model is used for object detection tasks to precisely locate faulty areas in images, such as discharge marks and oil leakage. The results show that MLLDE demonstrates excellent accuracy and generalization capabilities in the tasks of fault type identification and early warning. Compared with traditional single-modal methods, the MLLDE model effectively enhances the accuracy and timeliness of early warning for faults in substation equipment, providing a strong guarantee for the stable operation of the power system."

    "abstract": "With the widespread application of deep neural networks, improving inference efficiency has become increasingly critical. To speed up the inference, deep learning compilers search for high-performance schedules for the DNN tensor programs. During the process, cost models have been extensively studied to evaluate the performance of the schedules, such that high-performance ones can be efficiently obtained. However, existing methods suffer from either high overhead or low accuracy of performance evaluation, both of which limit the efficiency of the final schedule. To address these issues, we propose FASP, a fast and accurate framework for schedule performance evaluation, based on Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). First, we propose a redundancy-aware ASTs reduction method to generate compact ASTs for more accurate feature extraction. Second, we propose a feature extraction method based on compact ASTs, which extracts features by accounting for computation nodes, loop nodes, and their structural relationships. Third, we propose a composition-similarity-driven ASTs classification method and a class-specific cost model architecture for more accurate performance evaluation. FASP overcomes the limitations of prior methods by significantly reducing evaluation errors. Experiments show its excellent performance in both single-model and cross-model evaluation, with errors ranging from 6 % to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 3 \\%}$</tex>.

    "abstract": "In-network aggregation (INA) accelerates gradient aggregation in distributed machine learning (DML) by alleviating communication bottlenecks, but its effectiveness crucially depends on two location decisions: where to deploy INA functions and where to aggregate gradient flows. Most existing methods optimize INA placement and gradient flow routing independently, missing the advantages of joint optimization. This paper presents LLMINA, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the heuristic design for joint INA placement and gradient aggregation, aiming to minimize makespan (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e.</i>, the total time required for all DML jobs to complete gradient aggregation). Directly using LLMs to generate end-to-end solutions is infeasible due to problem complexity and LLM limitations. Instead, LLMINA uses LLMs to generate heuristics for INA placement through an evolutionary process, and then applies an optimization-based heuristic for gradient routing that takes into account DML workload characteristics. Experiments across diverse network topologies and workloads show that LLMINA can significantly reduce makespan compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results underscore that location matters for both INA deployment and aggregation, and highlight the potential of LLM-guided heuristic design for complex network resource optimization."

This work proposes a Digital Twin (DT) enabled monitoring architecture that performs real-time performance evaluation and fault diagnosis for transformer systems. The framework incorporates multiple sensing units such as temperature, oil level, overload, voltage, and current sensors to capture essential operational variables from the physical transformer. The collected data is processed through a microcontroller and synchronized with a Digital Twin representation that models the transformer’s dynamic behavior in a virtual domain. An Augmented Reality (AR)- based interface is integrated to deliver intuitive visualization of transformer health conditions. Deviations in sensor readings or detected faults initiate a color-coded alert mechanism within the AR environment, providing rapid identification of irregularities. Furthermore, MATLAB Simulink is employed to simulate line fault conditions and transformer responses under fluctuating loads, supporting predictive diagnostics and early alert generation. By combining DT technology, AR visualization, and real-time data analytics, the proposed system significantly improves predictive maintenance, enhances fault localization, and elevates situational awareness across power distribution networks. The integrated classification model demonstrates a final accuracy of 98% in health index categorization, ensuring highly reliable diagnostic outcomes. This high accuracy further validates the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed monitoring architecture. This holistic approach contributes to reduced equipment downtime, strengthened system reliability, and proactive fault handling, ultimately promoting safer and more sustainable energy operations."

By using photonic crystals, the receiving efficiency has been improved. Furthermore, the selectivity of wavelength and receiving angle characteristics make it possible to reduce background noise, which is an issue in the mid-infrared range."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a finite-time synchronization framework for a class of nonlinear systems with constant delays. The control strategy utilizes the backstepping technique to design a control input that drives the synchronization error between the master and slave systems to zero within finite time. This framework ensures fast convergence while accounting for the challenges posed by the time delays. The structure of the generalized nonlinear system enables the application of this approach to a wide range of chaotic systems. In particular, in this paper, the Genesio-Tesi chaotic system and Sprott Circuit system are employed to validate the proposed methodology through simulation. The resulting simulations clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy, confirming its capability to achieve finite-time synchronization."

However, existing research mainly focuses on control algorithms but pays insufficient attention to the coupling between internal electromagnetic and external structural responses. To fill this gap, this study proposes a finite element-based electromagnetic modeling method for asynchronous motor controlled operation. First, a control model simulating sudden speed changes is established, which shows excellent dynamic responsiveness with 12% three-phase current harmonic distortion during speed regulation; two 3D models including stator-rotor winding electromagnetic analysis and bearing structural stress models, are also developed. Simulation results show that at steady speed, magnetic energy concentrates in the rotor core, electromagnetic forces are periodic dominated by 150 Hz fundamental frequency, and external stresses are anisotropic. This study clarifies the electromagnetical-structural coupling mechanism during controlled operation, providing a theoretical basis for traction motor structural optimization and operational stability enhancement."

The design implements a core control strategy which seeks to configure approximation modes flexibly to trade off accuracy and energy savings according to task demands. The CIFAR-10 experiments demonstrate that the implemented design is capable of causing a maximum reduction of switching activity (86.5) with a tolerable accuracy in a conservative setting.

The results show that the mixer achieves a conversion gain of -4.2 dB in PT mode and -15.9 dB in resistive mode. In PT mode, with a 5 dBm LO drive, the input third-order intercept point (IIP3) is 1 dBm, and the input 1-dB compression point (IP1dB) is -4 dBm.

    "abstract": "With the accelerating digitalization and automation of cross-institutional financial transactions, accounting fraud is exhibiting typical and widespread characteristics of concealment, intelligence, and cross-domain correlation. Traditional detection methods based on centralized data have significant limitations in terms of data privacy, model generalization, and traceability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a blockchain-based federated Transformer cross-institutional fraud detection system, named BFTChain-Net. This system integrates the Byzantine Fault-Tolerant Blockchain (BFT) consensus mechanism, federated learning (FL), and Transformer coding networks for joint modeling. This algorithm achieves high-precision, traceable, and interpretable fraud detection while protecting the data sovereignty of each institution. In terms of model design, BFTChain-Net establishes a trusted parameter synchronization and anti-counterfeiting verification mechanism through an improved iPBFT consensus protocol. This mechanism ensures the integrity and robustness of the cross-institutional model aggregation process. The federated Transformer sub-network is deployed locally by each participant, using a multi-head self-attention mechanism to model time-series transaction features. This operation achieves global semantic association of heterogeneous features across organizations. Furthermore, the model introduces a graph contrastive learning module. This module combines node attention clustering and anomaly relationship prediction. The experimental section uses data subsets from three independent institutions, and conducts joint validation using the European credit card fraud dataset and the IEEE-CIS fraud detection dataset. Results show that BFTChain-Net achieves an average improvement of 3.4%–6.8% in F1-score and AUC compared to the comparison models. Simultaneously, it reduces the parameter convergence error to 0.014 in cross-institutional consistency detection. Through t-SNE visualization analysis, the model can significantly distinguish between normal transactions and anomalous samples. The detection performance of independent institutions is improved by 1.5%, 2.2%, and 3.7%, respectively. These results comprehensively validate the effectiveness and generality of cross-institutional collaborative learning."

Second, a Hybrid Surrogate Gradient Training (HSGT) method dynamically switches between smooth and sharp surrogate functions over time. Third, we propose a PiecewiseLinear Complementary Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (PCLIF) neuron that employs piecewise linear activation and simplified memory updates to reduce inference cost. Our model achieves 97.57% accuracy on DVS128 Gesture and 80.40% on CIFAR10-DVS using only 10 time steps.

Traditional image enhancement methods face the problem of difficulty in acquiring image-pairing datasets. To address this, this paper proposes an enhancement method based on the Zero-RLDD models, which is applied to coal mine underground image enhancement. The model replaces some of the convolutional layers of the benchmark model Zero-DCE with residual modules, mitigates the gradient disappearance through jump connections, enhances the deep feature extraction capability, and retains more detailed information; proposes a lightweight hybrid attention module (LC-SAM) and introduces a cascading channel-space dual attention mechanism at the jump connections of the shallow, middle, and deep layers, which can focus on the key features and suppress the background noise to solve the problem of localized contrast under non-uniform illumination and the problem of localized contrast under non-uniform illumination. The local contrast imbalance problem under non-uniform illumination is solved; at the end of the model, the discrete wavelet transform Bior6.8 wavelet basis is used to soft-threshold the high-frequency subbands, which effectively suppresses the noise while preserving the integrity of the low-frequency information. The experimental results show that the proposed model is overall better than the typical enhancement model in five indices: MSE, PSNR, SSIM, NIQE, and VIF. Compared with the benchmark model Zero-DCE, MSE is reduced, PSNR is improved by 2.28dB, SSIM is improved by 8.09%, NIQE is reduced by 1.33%, and VIF is improved by 5.25%. The image visualization is significantly improved, preserving the detailed texture while enhancing the image brightness, and the noise reduction effect is outstanding."

These shortcomings make existing DSSs unsuitable as practical file storage platforms, particularly in private cloud scenarios where performance bottlenecks are easily exposed. To address this, we present Haina Storage (HNS), a decentralized storage system redesigned for scalability, efficiency, and security in private clouds. HNS introduces a bi-directional circular linked chain structure in which each file forms an independent chain, eliminating inter-file dependencies and enabling parallel retrieval. We further propose a lightweight consensus mechanism, Proof of Resources, that accounts for both storage capacity and network conditions, ensuring fair and timely data placement. Security is strengthened through dynamic access control, confidential block distribution, and decentralized key protection without trusted third parties. Extensive experiments on both public cloud servers and local clusters demonstrate that HNS achieves performance comparable to IPFS while offering significantly stronger security, theoretical scalability advantages, and an efficient and fair resource-based consensus mechanism.

Traditional data-driven approaches rely on manually engineered features, which require extensive preprocessing and domain expertise, and often lead to information loss and limited adaptability. This study proposes an alternative method that uses wavelet transform (WT)-based scalogram images and a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) for feature representation and data augmentation. Scalograms retain the full time-frequency structure of raw signals, eliminating the need for handcrafted features. The cGAN model synthesizes realistic scalograms, expanding dataset diversity and improving model generalization. Compared with FFT-based numerical features, the proposed method preserves more wear-related information and improves classification performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the cGAN-based approach effectively captures tool wear progression, enhances training robustness, and improves accuracy under limited data conditions. These findings highlight the potential of integrating cGAN-generated features into tool wear monitoring frameworks."

These systems produce disparate and often semantically incompatible data, impeding seamless integration and hindering the realization of holistic energy management strategies. To overcome these challenges, advanced data structuring and AI-based strategies are imperative to ensure semantic interoperability and uninterrupted data continuity across heterogeneous systems. This paper introduces a novel approach for constructing a unified ontology that harmonizes BEM and BMS standards, enabling the seamless fusion of their datasets within a digital twin architecture. By leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we enrich the semantic structuring process, facilitating automated and precise reconciliation of heterogeneous data sources.

To further improve solution quality, we propose a lightweight local refinement technique that perturbs the trained network’s weights, effectively exploring nearby heuristic landscapes without restarting the search process. Computational experiments on synthetic datasets with 50, 100, and 200 cities show that our approach consistently outperforms classical Insertion heuristics and generates solutions within 0–2.4% of optimality. The proposed method combines high computational efficiency with adaptability, demonstrating strong potential for extension to more complex TSP variants and practical logistics optimization tasks."

The approach first performs unsupervised stratification on key covariates via K-means, then trains cluster-specific GBRT sub-models whose outputs are unified as a common decision score. To reduce computational complexity and stabilize generalization, this paper employ feature engineering with mutual information filtering and sequential forward selection, together with Bayesian hyperparameter optimization and early stopping; inference is accelerated via feature binning and quantization to achieve near constant-time computation. On a held-out test set, the method attains an ROC-AUC of 0.934, improving over single global models (GBRT or logistic-regression baseline) at 0.863 by +0.071; the average gain over five-fold cross-validation is +0.066. Training time is reduced by ≈38%, and per-sample inference latency is <10 ms. These results indicate that the unified GBRT × K-means design improves both discriminative accuracy and computational efficiency without increasing deployment burden."

    "abstract": "The rising need for eco-friendly transportation has led to the innovation of solar-powered dynamic wireless charging systems for electric vehicles (EVs). These systems employ wireless power transfer (WPT) technology to recharge EVs while they are moving, with solar energy serving as the primary source. Solar panels installed along highways or specific lanes generate electricity, which is either directly transmitted to coils embedded in the road or stored in batteries. As EVs pass over these coils, receiver units capture the energy wirelessly, enabling battery charging on the move. This approach reduces reliance on the power grid, cuts downtime, and boosts the driving range.However, several challenges hinder the widespread adoption of this technology, including high infrastructure costs, the need for precise alignment, and efficiency limitations in power transfer. Solutions like maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and high-frequency resonant converters are employed to optimize energy delivery, while factors such as coil design, vehicle speed, and operating frequency impact WPT efficiency. Additionally, concerns about electromagnetic safety and overall system reliability must be addressed. For broad implementation, strong government support, clear regulatory guidelines, and cost-effective materials are essential. Nonetheless, integrating adaptive control strategies, machine learning, and IoT-based monitoring systems could significantly improve performance and speed up the transition to sustainable EV transportation."

Moreover, the relations among the number of vehicles, the coverage area of the target’s large maneuver and the coefficient of guidance law are analyzed by designing a non-overlapping coverage strategy.

The NN controller replaces traditional integral control, minimizing steady-state errors, enhancing reference tracking accuracy, and regulating off-axis states with a robust architecture that integrates filtered error signals, passivity-based terms, and system states. Using a forward pass for control generation and a backward pass for real-time weight adjustment via gradient descent, the controller ensures stability and convergence through adaptive gains and tuned learning rates.

Meanwhile, production anomalies occur throughout the entire manufacturing flow, and traditional anomaly management methods—plagued by data fragmentation, delayed feedback, and inflexible scheduling—are increasingly inadequate to meet the practical needs of high-end equipment manufacturing. To address this bottleneck, a framework of digital-intelligent anomaly control in the design and manufacturing of high-end equipment is proposed. This framework establishes a key technological system for a collaborative closed loop of “design-scheduling-control” tailored to complex manufacturing requirements, which includes: a large language model(LLM)-driven design approach; a knowledge- and data-fusion driven proactive-reactive scheduling method for smart workshops; and a cloud-edge-device collaborative digital twin control method. By reshaping conventional anomaly management processes through digital-intelligent technologies, this model effectively supports flexible production and high-precision control in multi-variety, small-batch manufacturing scenarios, thereby enhancing the batch production capability of complex products."

A criterion considering sequential identification performance is also proposed to generate excitation trajectories. The experiments are conducted on a 3-degree-of-freedoms parallel robot of type 2RRU-1RRS. According to the experimental tests, the proposed method improves the accuracy of torque estimation even under insufficient excitation.

This article proposes a joint optimization model for generation and maintenance, based on China’s largest mainstream cascade hydropower system. A mapping between daily average and peak generation is established to identify feasible maintenance windows, enable long-term daily scheduling, and meet hourly load-following requirements. This mapping is incorporated into a 730-days panoramic model which considers critical constraints including cross-year maintenance continuity, seasonal energy allocation, monthly generation trends, maintenance restrictions during peak supply periods, and transmission limits. The model’s complex logic constraints are reformulated by the Big-M method, becoming a tractable mixed-integer linear programming formulation. Case studies show that the proposed approach substantially alleviates current coordination difficulties, increases hydropower generation by 36 million kWh, and eliminates downtime during peak-demand hours. Sensitivity analysis further reveals that tighter peak-shaving requirements significantly reduce maintenance flexibility and increase reserve pressure."

    "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks are key components in modern applications, from monitoring the environment to health-related activities. Because the battery power available to sensor nodes is limited, it is important to reduce the amount of energy used to maintain maximum network performance. Clustering-Based routing protocols have developed over time and have proven to be a viable method of conserving energy and extending the life span of Wireless Sensor Networks. A common and uncomplicated clustering routing protocol was the Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) protocol, which has cluster heads (CHs) rotated periodically, but was problematic because, although the original design was uncomplicated, it falsely assumed that all sensor nodes consume energy evenly. The Threshold Distributed Energy-Efficient Protocol (TDEEC) addresses this flaw by filtering CHs to assess the residual and average energy spent, which means that the nodes left with higher-energy potentials are more likely to become CHs, thus providing lower energy consumption among them to more evenly distribute energy loads and extend network lifetime. This paper investigates LEACH and TDEEC support through key Quality of Service (QoS) parameters, goodput, network lifetime, residual energy, and throughput to compare both protocols. Simulation results shown that the TDEEC outperforms LEACH with a residual energy of 90.5 percent and has a network life span of 60 percent."

However, since the common-mode NRZ signal is transmitted in a singleended manner, it is more susceptible to power supply noise compared to the differential PAM-4 signal. This paper proposes a novel multi-lane CMDM-8 architecture, in which the commonmode voltage of one lane is fixed to address the limitations of conventional single-ended NRZ signal. Although the encoding efficiency slightly decreases-as one of the lanes transmits 2 bits instead of 3-the proposed architecture demonstrates strong tolerance to supply noise. When supply noise is injected, conventional designs using single-ended NRZ exhibit completely closed eyes, whereas the proposed scheme maintains eye openings, showing improved noise immunity."

One specific implementation of a serious game involves generating pseudo-random binary sequences (0 or 1) by observing the behavior of human players during gameplay for quantum research. Notably, the data collection process is often embedded subtly within the gameplay mechanics, potentially without the user’s explicit awareness. In our case, these humansourced bits are intended for use in quantum experiments testing Bell inequality, where unpredictable input plays a key role in addressing the freedom-of-choice loophole. The game serves as a covert interface between intuitive human decision-making and the controlled conditions of a quantum experiment. It is specifically designed to preserve the randomness and independence required for such foundational tests. This paper presents three serious game prototypes and explores how their core mechanics enable the extraction of behaviorally grounded binary sequences suitable for Bell experimental use as well as practicality of their deployment."

To address these issues, we propose RADAR (Reliable Aligned Decoding And Resampling), a framework with a dual-decoder design that produces reliable pseudo-labels via alignment between a supervised decoder and a momentum-driven auxiliary decoder. These labels guide adaptive oversampling to generate semantically consistent nodes for minority classes, improving decision boundaries and representation quality. The original and synthetic nodes are then jointly encoded through a graph contrastive learning backbone. Experiments on imbalanced graph datasets show that RADAR consistently outperforms prior methods across multiple metrics."

To effectively intercept these targets with minimal miss-distance, tactical missiles require a highly efficient control system. Obtaining a high level of accuracy in the aerodynamic characterization of the missile is notably challenging. In addition, the difficulty in modeling external disturbances complicates the autopilot design. As a result, there is a significant need for a robust control system that can handle parametric uncertainties and unmodeled external disturbances. This paper presents a robust roll autopilot based on the ${{\\mathcal{L}}_1}$ adaptive technique. The proposed roll autopilot is designed to handle uncertainties, external disturbances, and unmodeled sensor delays. This approach treats both external disturbances and parametric uncertainties within the roll loop as composite disturbances. A state observer is used to estimate the composite disturbance, and the system states in a unified manner. The estimates obtained from the inner loop uncertainties are used to calculate the adaptive roll control input, which enhances the baseline control input designed for nominal operating conditions. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptive roll autopilot in achieving the specified design objectives."

Conventional techniques, including ultrasonic, optical, and microwave-based methods, often face limitations in terms of resolution, penetration, and sensitivity. Terahertz (THz) imaging systems offer a promising non-invasive alternative due to their high spatial resolution, ability to penetrate non-metallic materials, and sensitivity to variations in refractive index and dielectric properties. This study explores the feasibility of using a THz imaging system for detecting and characterizing gas-liquid two-phase flow. A continuous-wave (CW) THz imaging system has been employed to capture high-resolution images of flow channels within transparent and semi-transparent conduits. By analyzing the THz image acquired from the reflected signals, distinct phase distributions and flow patterns have been identified. The experimental setup includes a controlled test rig with varying gas-to-liquid ratios to simulate different flow regimes, namely, slug, discontinued slug, etc. Image processing techniques have been applied to enhance phase differentiation and improve detection accuracy. Preliminary results demonstrate that THz imaging can effectively distinguish gas and liquid phases based on their absorption and reflection characteristics. The proposed method provides a non-intrusive, high-precision approach to monitoring two-phase flow, offering significant advantages over traditional sensors. Future work will focus on real-time implementation, optimizing imaging parameters, and extending the methodology to optically-opaque pipelines. This research contributes to advancing flow diagnostics in industrial and scientific applications."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a set-theoretic time-based trajectory synchronization method to coordinate the skid-steered units subject to slippage phenomena of a multi-robot system. The closed-loop trajectory tracking error dynamics are expressed in the form of an uncertain system subject to external disturbances and actuation constraints. Collision avoidance and coordination are achieved through synchronization of robot trajectories by imposing delays on platform departures. The procedure exploits the trajectory’s feasibility property by solving optimization problems involving Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) constraints. The algorithm operates in separate offline and online phases. In the offline phase, the time delay intervals useful for synchronization are calculated based on the planned feasible trajectories. Then, in the online phase, the actual delay is calculated by solving an optimization problem that minimizes the occupancy time of the shared operational space. The results of several numerical simulations are presented and discussed to demonstrate the proposed solution’s effectiveness."

Cloud computing has fast computing speed but there are transmission delays and network disturbances. To solve the above problems, this paper constructs a three-tier model consisting of terminal devices, edge computing servers, and cloud computing servers, and models the optimization of computing offload strategy as a comprehensive model to optimize task delay and device energy consumption. In terms of algorithms, the performance of three classic evolutionary algorithms, namely genetic algorithm (GA), differential evolution algorithm (DE), and particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO), in solving continuous optimization problems is analyzed, and the influence of different parameters on performance is analyzed. The simulation results show that when the delay consumption and energy consumption are 1:1, the classical evolutionary algorithm reduces the computational complexity by about 36% to 43% compared to the fully local offloading strategy algorithm in terms of minimum system consumption, and by about 18% to 30% compared to the random strategy algorithm, effectively improving computational efficiency."

    "abstract": "In dynamic wireless environments, fluctuations in user distribution and channel conditions challenge the stability and efficiency of federated learning (FL) systems, especially in multi-UAV-assisted scenarios. UAV-assisted wireless FL has drawn great attention for its flexible deployment and distributed computing capabilities. However, centralized aggregation faces the risk of single-node failure at aggregation nodes, which can severely impact system reliability in dynamic environments. To address these issues, we propose a Decentralized Aggregation in UAV-assisted wireless Federated Learning (DAUFL) framework, which replaces centralized aggregation with a multi-node model aggregation mechanism to maintain stable operation and enhance system reliability under node failures. Furthermore, we develop an Adaptive Interference-aware Resource allocation and Deployment Optimization (AIRDO) algorithm. It first employs Constrained K-means for efficient UAV coverage, then applies Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (RL) for dynamic interference-aware resource allocation and UAV deployment optimization. Simulation results show that DAUFL achieves strong robustness and model performance under both Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) and Non-IID data distributions, maintaining over 90% and 80% accuracy even under a 50% node failure rate. The AIRDO algorithm further accelerates convergence, reduces training latency, and maintains stable performance with large-scale users."

However, it’s difficult for the current micro-robots to go across the complex terrains, and the lifetime is significantly constrained by the power-hungry mechanical actuators. In comparison, rat cyborgs leverage biological locomotion instead of mechanical actuation, exhibiting much longer lifetime in navigating narrow or irregular environment that are inaccessible for conventional wheeled or tracked robots [1]. This work presents a 4 G -remotely-controlled rat-cyborg system driven by a brain-machine interface (BMI) chip featuring a novel unipolar biphasic switched-capacitor (UBSC) stimulator. Fabricated in standard 65 nm CMOS process for low-power consideration, the chip integrates an 8-channel neural-signal acquisition unit [2], a 4-channel electrical stimulator, and a 4channel optical stimulator. Measurement results show that the proposed UBSC stimulator enables $\\pm 4.5 \\mathrm{~V}$ stimulation by only $243 \\mu \\mathrm{~W}$ power consumption (neural-signal acquisition and stimulation), despite the supply voltage constraints of the 65 nm process. The system achieves reliable remote control over a 35 km operator-to-cyborg distance via the 4 G network, demonstrating the movement along various routes of the rat cyborg."

We propose a BioZ readout architecture that performs baseline cancellation using a differential difference current-balancing instrumentation amplifier (DDCBIA). This architecture enables baseline cancellation without requiring a connection to the current generator, thereby allowing the integration of a bias control loop to cancel current mismatch. By eliminating the need for large off-chip high-pass filters, this approach enhances the miniaturization and user comfort advantages inherent to two-electrode systems. However, the combination of the bias control loop and the DD-CBIA structure causes 60-Hz CMI to convert into a differential signal. To address this issue, a 60-Hz CMI rejection loop is introduced. Simulation results demonstrate a 97.9% reduction in 60-Hz differential signal and a 33.5 dB improvement in common-mode rejection ratio. The current generator consumes $10.1-242.9 \\mu \\mathrm{~W}$ when delivering a current input of $3-100 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$, while the BioZ sensing front-end consumes only $14.98 \\mu \\mathrm{~W}$."

The ULM eliminates dependence on complex dynamic models, while ATDE handles lumped uncertainties. PPC confines tracking errors within user-defined boundaries, and CBFs ensure satisfaction of joint limits and collision avoidance constraints.

By integrating a direct current (DC) zero-flux detector, an alternating current (AC) zero-flux detector, and a secondary compensation coil module, a unified design of multi-coil and multi-signal processing circuits is achieved. Compared with conventional three-core fluxgate designs, the proposed approach offers a simplified structure while maintaining high bandwidth and high-accuracy measurement capabilities. A prototype was developed based on the proposed principles, which was subsequently evaluated through experiments. The results demonstrate that the sensor achieves a -3dB bandwidth exceeding 1.6 MHz. Within the frequency range of 10 Hz to 100 kHz, the amplitude response variation remains below 2%, and the phase deviation is within 2°. When benchmarked against a precision shunt resistor, the measurement error of 100 kHz AC current is maintained within 3%. The sensor also exhibits a step-response rise time of approximately 300 ns. These findings indicate that the proposed dual-core fluxgate sensor is well-suited for wideband current measurement applications demanding high dynamic performance and accuracy."

Traditional tonometry methods, though accurate, require direct corneal contact, anesthetic use, and clinical supervision, limiting accessibility and patient compliance. This paper presents a portable, non-invasive, and IoT-enabled device for real-time IOP monitoring using scleral image analysis. The system captures high-resolution images of the sclera through a digital microscope and processes them using grayscale conversion, contrast enhancement, edge detection, and morphological operations to extract vascular features. Vessel density and structural parameters are then analyzed using an embedded algorithm to estimate IOP without physical contact. Designed for both clinical and home-based use, the device features a built-in display for instant feedback and wireless connectivity for remote monitoring. It provides accurate IOP readings in the 10–30 mmHg range, with validation against Goldmann applanation tonometry showing high correlation and low error. The contact-free design improves hygiene, comfort, and usability, especially for rural populations and patients requiring frequent monitoring. By integrating real-time imaging, embedded processing, and telemedicine compatibility, this system offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for early glaucoma detection and preventive eye care."

Conventional tractors are not practical for smaller plots and are better suited for large-scale farming in cities or medium-sized villages. This project offers a cutting-edge, reasonably priced agricultural kit made especially to meet the demands of small farmers. Important farming tasks like plowing, seed feeding, and insecticide spraying are carried out by the suggested system. Because of its easy-to-use design, even people with little technical expertise can use it effectively. Farmers can set instructions like distance, direction, and specific tasks with the kit, which is controlled by a mobile phone. Internet access is not necessary for the system to function automatically based on these inputs. Using a specialized app and positioning the mobile device close to the unit, data is transferred over Wi-Fi. An integrated water pump is included for consistent insecticide application to help farmers even more. This minimizes manual labor and enhances crop care by guaranteeing efficient coverage, even in hard-to-reach places like the underside of leaves. Basic obstacle detection and auto-stop capabilities are also included in the system to improve usability and safety in erratic field conditions. It is perfect for places with little road infrastructure because of its portability and simplicity of deployment. This project provides a scalable way to increase rural agriculture's sustainability and productivity by lowering the cost and increasing access to modern farming equipment.

Current approaches, such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), bear their own limitations. SFT requires substantial computational resources, while RAG is heavily dependent on the availability of high-quality knowledge bases. This paper introduces an innovative method for efficient knowledge injection, providing a balanced trade-off between resource utilization and performance. It extracts knowledge from domain-specific LLMs by storing the context representations and their corresponding target tokens in a datastore and injects it into another LLM by neighbor interfering with the LLM's decoding process. Experimental results with four LLMs reveal that our proposed method yields average gains of 33.1 in ROUGE-L and 16.3 in BLEU-4 on manufacturing specification datasets, and 7.7 in ROUGE-L and 4.5 in BLEU-4 on medical consultation datasets.

The innovation point lies in that during the data preprocessing process, after fully extracting the dependency relationships between source code statements and the semantic information of the statements by constructing the program dependency graph through extracting source code data, the content and location of the source code changes in one submission are determined, thereby inferring the parts that have an impact on the source code in one change. Ultimately, the amount of data is reduced by pruning the dependency graph to remove the parts that do not participate in the change and are not affected by the change, thereby reducing the computational overhead. The processed data is more suitable for defect detection during software update and maintenance, overcoming the problem of excessive quantity caused by the original graph-based preprocessing method, and thus optimizing the effect of the model. Through experimental verification, this method reduces the data volume by approximately <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$58.91 / \\%$</tex> on the dataset constructed with jmeter, lowers the runtime memory usage by approximately 35.89 %, and increases the speed by approximately 41.87 %.

    "abstract": "Next-generation wireless communication systems are expected to adopt recently developed compact terahertz continuous-wave (CW) sources manufactured using nanotechnology. The directivity control of terahertz waves emitted from terahertz CW sources, including resonant tunneling diodes (RTD) and quantum cascade lasers (QCL), is essential to enhance radiation power in the far-field region. Furthermore, achieving radiation power in the 1-W class with a compact volume requires integrating high directivity planar optical elements into a terahertz CW source array. However, terahertz flat optics based on metasurfaces has yet to be commonly adopted in terahertz CW sources because there are few manufacturing methods suitable for metasurfaces composed of multiple meta-atoms in the order of a few hundred micrometers. Here, we fabricate a collimating metalens antenna composed of meta-atoms on both the front and back of a thin dielectric substrate using single femtoliter inkjet printing technology. We also demonstrate that the fabricated collimating metalens antenna enhances the directivity of a single RTD oscillating at 0.312 THz 2.28 times. The collimating metalens antenna converts approximately spherical terahertz waves emitted from the RTD into plane waves with high directivity. Our results suggest that single femtoliter inkjet printing technology offers a powerful method for fabricating planar optical elements based on terahertz flat optics. Integrating high directivity planar optical elements, including our original collimating metalens antennas presented here, into a terahertz CW source array would be pivotal for enabling 6G and beyond wireless communications."

However, current radiogenomic approaches for MGMT status prediction are limited by reliance on invasive biopsy, 2D slice-wise modelling, suboptimal exploitation of multi-modal MRI, and weak model interpretability, all of which hinder robust clinical adoption. To address these gaps, we introduce a multi-modal 3D attention network (MM-3DAttNet) for non-invasive prediction of MGMT promoter methylation status from pre-operative multi-parametric brain MRI. The architecture comprises four modality-specific 3D CNN encoder branches for T1, T1ce, T2, and FLAIR, which are fused via a cross-modality attention mechanism to capture complementary diagnostic information.The model was trained and validated on the BraTS 2021 cohort, including 585 glioma cases annotated with MGMT methylation labels, and achieved an average accuracy of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$91.6\\%$</tex-math></inline-formula>, an F<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$_{1}$</tex-math></inline-formula>-score of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$89.9\\%$</tex-math></inline-formula>, and an area under the ROC curve of 0.925 across five-fold cross-validation. Model interpretability was enhanced through Grad-CAM-based saliency maps, which consistently highlighted clinically meaningful regions, including enhancing tumour margins and peritumoural oedema. A comprehensive ablation study confirmed the importance of both multi-modal integration and the attention-based fusion: removing individual modalities reduced performance relative to the full four-modality model, with the largest drops observed when T1ce or FLAIR was excluded, underscoring their dominant contribution to MGMT-related signal. Taken together, these results demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of MM-3DAttNet as an interpretable radiogenomic framework for MGMT methylation assessment and motivate its prospective evaluation in multi-centre studies and integration into MRI-based decision-support pipelines for glioma management."

    "abstract": "Digital Twin (DT) technology has recently gained significant attention in both industry and academia. By improving efficiency, reducing costs, and enabling predictive maintenance, DT plays a crucial role in control, diagnostics, prediction, and optimization. However, at the definition level, the rapid growth of research has led to a variety of definitions and inconsistent terminology, underscoring the need for a clearer and more unified understanding of the DT concept. At the design stage, two major challenges remain. The first is to develop models that are both accurate and dynamic, capable of supporting optimization and real-time supervision, including control and diagnosis. The second lies in ensuring a reliable link to the physical system through online identification, which is particularly challenging due to the non-stationary nature of real-world processes. This study addresses the definition level and the first challenge at the design level by offering a comprehensive overview of the DT concept, including its definition, development phases, and an illustration of its design carried out in a two-tank system. The research consists of using the Bond Graph (BG) tool as a multi-physical graphical tool for designing a DT not only for dynamic modeling but also for online supervision, including diagnosis and recovery decisions. The results first show the effectiveness of BG in constructing the DT using 20Sim software for dynamic modeling and fault detection and isolation. This BG tool enables DT to monitor the state of the system and provides the health indicators necessary to reconfigure the system controller."

    "abstract": "Deep learning has significantly advanced medical image classification; however, mainstream architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) exhibit notable limitations—CNNs struggle to effectively model long-range dependencies, while ViTs suffer from quadratic computational complexity due to their self-attention mechanisms, which restricts their applicability in computationally sensitive scenarios. Accurate classification of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status, a critical prognostic and therapeutic biomarker in glioma, requires the simultaneous extraction of local fine-grained features and understanding of global contextual relationships from MRI scans. To address these challenges, we propose MedViMamba, a state space model (SSM)-based visual backbone network specifically designed for IDH mutation status classification in glioma. MedViMamba incorporates a novel SS-Conv SSM hybrid module that combines the local feature extraction capability of convolutional operations with the global contextual modeling advantages of selective SSMs, achieving linear computational complexity while maintaining strong representational power. Furthermore, the introduction of grouped convolution and channel shuffling mechanisms reduces parameter overhead and enhances computational efficiency. We evaluated MedViMamba on a multi-center MRI dataset consisting of 562 glioma patients, and experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art approaches while significantly improving the efficiency-accuracy trade-off. This work provides new insights into SSM-based medical visual modeling and offers a robust framework for resource-efficient biomarker classification in glioma."

    "abstract": "In today’s regulated and digitized healthcare environment, securing legacy applications remains a critical challenge. Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools are indispensable in modern DevSecOps pipelines; yet many healthcare systems still rely on outdated platforms that cannot integrate with these tools. This incompatibility creates blind spots that expose sensitive data and critical operations to breaches.This research addresses the urgent gap in risk assessment and mitigation where SAST integration is infeasible. We propose a fallback security framework that combines AI-augmented, human-in-the-loop vulnerability scoring with behavior-based anomaly detection, offering adaptive protection for legacy applications. Our framework also includes a comparative matrix of SAST tool compatibility with legacy technologies and compensating controls tailored to healthcare environments.Through analysis of healthcare compliance requirements, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), case studies from payer and provider systems, and mapping of control gaps, we demonstrate how legacy incompatibility amplifies exposure to cyberattacks, downtime, and regulatory failures. The findings highlight that while modernization is essential, organizations can mitigate risk through the implementation of layered governance, staff training, and phased deployment of security controls.This framework operates transformer-based code translation models and machine learning-driven behavioral anomaly detection, enabling legacy risk remediation to move from theoretical to actionable in real-time DevSecOps pipelines."

This method leverages GA's strong global search capability to generate high-quality initial path populations and integrates ACO's positive feedback mechanism for local path refinement, forming a \"global exploration-local refinement\" two-stage collaborative optimization framework. Comparative simulation experiments were conducted in a 100×100 grid environment with 11 mixed rectangular and circular obstacles, using traditional ACO, Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT), and Artificial Potential Field (APF) as comparison algorithms. The simulation results show that the GA-ACO algorithm exhibits significant advantages in key performance indicators: its collision-free success rate reaches 100%, while traditional ACO and RRT achieve 0%; the average path length is 118.46 units, which is 58.8% shorter than traditional ACO (287.54 units), 79.8% shorter than RRT (585.40 units), and 78.6% shorter than APF (553.82 units); the safety margin is 0.68 units, 33 times higher than APF's 0.02 units. Although its computation time (4.35s) is slightly longer than the contrast algorithms (0.2-0.3s), this minimal cost is fully compensated by the substantial improvements in path quality and safety. The proposed algorithm provides a reliable technical solution for path planning of path-finding robots in complex static obstacle environments."

Methodologically, a hybrid state representation is constructed by fusing lidar point clouds and visual images, and feature extraction is performed. A hierarchical proximal policy optimization algorithm framework is then designed. Finally, a model-based meta-reinforcement learning algorithm is introduced. Results show that in path planning efficiency experiments, the proposed method completes the task in only 41.7 seconds. In defect recognition accuracy experiments, the final measured average approach (MAP) reaches 0.90. In policy adaptation speed experiments, near-optimal performance is achieved with only approximately 100 training steps. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively address dynamic uncertainty and provide solid support for the practical application of intelligent autonomous inspection systems."

There is a notable paucity of research on experienced amateur tennis players, particularly regarding the quantitative comparisons between individuals with a formal tennis education background (hereinafter referred to as the \"tennis-major group\") and those without such a background, which remains extremely limited. To address this research gap, we propose a single-camera-based, non-contact, and markerless analytical approach in which the collected video data are processed using Media Pipe, followed by the application of Mann–Whitney U and Welch t-tests Test to examine differences in forehand and backhand strokes between Amateur tennis players with and without formal tennis education background. Based on these data, we computed and analyzed the differences of four crucial kinematic metrics (hip - shoulder axial rotation, shoulder angle at the instant of impact, elbow angle at the instant of impact, Torso Rotation-Based Kinematic Symmetry Index (°) on experienced amateur players with and without formal tennis Education. The results of Mann–Whitney U and Welch t-tests Test indicate that in the case of forehand strokes, the group with tennis education background exhibits greater rotation amplitudes of the hip and trunk, more notable elbow extension, and more prominent asymmetry between the preparation phase and the follow - through phase. Conversely, for backhand strokes, the results of statistical analysis do not reveal any significant differences. This method can offer amateur tennis players timely feedback for future self-practice, thus contributing to the improvement of their sports performance."

    "abstract": "Bird populations are important bioindicators, as the diversity of their habitats and their outstanding mobility make them sensitive to ecosystem changes. They also contribute to ecosystems by providing valuable services such as pest control, seed dispersal, and pollination, which are vital for maintaining ecological balance. Hence monitoring the composition of bird populations is essential for assessing ecosystem health and guiding conservation efforts. However, traditional observer-based surveys are expensive, time-consuming, and impractical for large-scale and hardly accessible applications. Our study proposes an approach by integrating automated acoustic monitoring with machine learning applications to develop a system that achieves high identification accuracy while keeping the pipeline simple. Our model design emphasizes a balance between efficiency and scalability, enabling deployment in resource-constrained environments. We provide a tool for low-complexity ecological monitoring by prioritizing lightweight and simple architectures. This work bridges the gap between ecological research and practical, scalable conservation technologies."

    "abstract": "To address the heterogeneity and noise interference of multi-source transformer monitoring data (electrical quantities, dissolved gas in oil, and vibration signals), a four-stage closed-loop diagnosis model consisting of \"data preprocessing - feature extraction - attention fusion - fault classification\" is proposed. The preprocessing stage optimizes data quality through spatiotemporal weighted interpolation, improved wavelet threshold denoising, and improved Z-score normalization. The feature extraction stage designs dedicated subnetworks for each data set (1D-CNN for vibration, MLP for gas, and GRU for electrical quantities). The attention fusion stage dynamically aggregates key features through cross-attention. The classification stage outputs fault categories using a fully connected network. Simulation experiments were conducted based on 3500 sets of measured data (including five types of faults) from a provincial power company from 2019 to 2023. The data was partitioned into training, validation, and test sets with a 7:2:1 ratio. Results show that the model achieved a 98.2% accuracy on the test set, a 6.9% improvement over the optimal single-data model (MLP-G, 91.3%) and a 3.6% improvement over the optimal traditional fusion model (Ada-Weight, 94.6%). The recall rate for minor partial discharges reached 96.3%, effectively addressing the traditional model's lack of sensitivity to early faults."

    "abstract": "In range-based SLAM systems, localization accuracy depends on the quality of geometric maps. Sparse LiDAR scans and noisy depth from RGB-D sensors often yield incomplete or inaccurate reconstructions that degrade pose estimation. Appearance and semantic cues, readily available from onboard RGB and pretrained models, can serve as complementary signals to strengthen geometry. Nevertheless, variations in appearance due to illumination or texture and inconsistencies in semantic labels across frames can hinder geometric optimization if directly used as supervision. To address these challenges, we propose <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">AING-SLAM</b>, an Accurate Implicit Neural Geometry-aware SLAM framework that allows appearance and semantics to effectively strengthen geometry in both mapping and odometry. A unified neural point representation with a lightweight cross-modal decoder integrates geometry, appearance and semantics, enabling auxiliary cues to refine geometry even in sparse or ambiguous regions. For pose tracking, appearance-semantic-aided odometry jointly minimizes SDF, appearance, and semantic residuals with adaptive weighting, improving scan-to-map alignment and reducing drift. To safeguard stability, a history-guided gradient fusion strategy aligns instantaneous updates with long-term optimization trends, mitigating occasional inconsistencies between appearance/semantic cues and SDF-based supervision, thereby strengthening geometric optimization. Extensive experiments on indoor RGB-D and outdoor LiDAR benchmarks demonstrate real-time performance, state-of-the-art localization accuracy, and high-fidelity reconstruction across diverse environments."

    "abstract": "This paper offers a thorough framework that combines dual statistical scoring and multi-transform feature extraction to identify brain abnormalities using 256 -channel electroencephalography (EEG). A 640 -dimensional feature vector is produced for each EEG sample using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and the Ramanujan periodic transform (RPT) to extract complementary features. The RPT is highlighted here because of its exceptional ability to isolate integer-valued periodicity and reveal subtle, noise-robust rhythmic signatures in EEG that frequently elude Fourier and wavelet methods. We used two channel-level anomaly detectors on a dataset of 5,000 samples: the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) approach and the Z-score method. Although the MAD detector offered more reliable outlier detection that is less susceptible to extreme values, the $\\mathbf{Z}$-score detector identified 25,388 aberrant channel events throughout the sample. Comparative tests show that the multi-transform feature space performs significantly better than single-transform baselines, providing increased resilience against noise and artifacts, as well as enhanced sensitivity to anomalies."

The filtenna consists of a HMSIRC followed by a parasitic patch that radiates to give circular polarization. The HMSIRC filter passes the desired band which acts as feed to the followed parasitic patch. Additionally, generation of circularly polarized wave is done with the help of truncation at the corners. The proposed filtenna exhibits an impedance bandwidth of $\\mathbf{1 6 0 ~ M H z}$, spanning $2.46-2.62 \\mathrm{GHz}$, while achieving an axial-ratio bandwidth of 20 MHz within the $2.49-2.51 \\mathrm{GHz}$ range. At the center frequency of 2.5 GHz, the antenna produces right-hand circular polarization (RHCP) with a peak realized gain of 6.85 dBi. These results confirm the antenna's suitability for compact, integrated wireless systems requiring simultaneous filtering and circularly polarized radiation characteristics."

    "abstract": "In today’s rapidly evolving technology environment, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into various industries has become a significant driver of innovation. In the context of human resources, artificial intelligence is defined as a wide variety of software algorithms that enable a computer to perform human resource management activities that would normally require human cognition and intervention. This includes data-driven decision making, behavioral analysis, trend prediction and much more. One area that is experiencing a profound impact from AI is human resources management (HRM). By incorporating an AI system into the HR department, the company’s employees will gain increased productivity and experience. AI can assist HR departments in every phase of their professional work, from timely candidate selection to performance evaluation. Integrating artificial intelligence into human resource management can then help a business achieve overall efficiency and gain an edge over its competitors. By leveraging AI technologies, organizations can improve employee’s performance, their productivity, and decision-making processes. AI will eventually have a noticeable and longlasting effect on HR. Since technology is always evolving, AI framework must be adaptable enough to update itself and make adjustments as needed. We can use AI to take away most of the monotonous employee’s tasks, analyze vast amounts of data to make tangible decisions, and create a holistic impact on the organization and its people. According to 76% of HR directors, companies would fall behind in organizational performance if they do not integrate and apply AI technologies like generative AI within the next 12 to 24 months. To effectively decide whether to use new AI solutions for HR, CHROs must evaluate technological trends in an organized manner.HR workers may now employ machine learning and algorithms to expedite work processes, lessen biases, and enhance analysis and decision-making thanks to advancements in AI technology, which has completely changed the HR department. Still, some companies are delaying the use of AI for additional use cases due to existing limits and threats.. Artificial intelligence needs proper data storage and maintenance to function effectively. It collects and analyzes all the necessary data and enables the HR department to make data-based decisions. HR manager can make data-driven decisions that are sustainable and impactful. We’ll discuss in this article and explore the role of AI in HR practices and its implications for the future of work."

    "abstract": "Blockchain technology is gaining popularity today, replacing centralized data storage on a central server with a decentralized network of ledgers, thus ensuring secure information exchange. A smart contract is a program written on the blockchain that runs autonomously within the Ethereum virtual machine: a transparent and secure program, but once deployed on the blockchain network, it cannot be modified. Despite its advantage over other technologies, smart contract has become a prime target for hackers, making it difficult for developers to eliminate all vulnerabilities before its deployment. In this paper, we propose a static analysis approach aimed at reducing vulnerabilities in smart contract. Our method builds upon PASO (Parser for Solidity) and MSmart approaches: we developed a test lifecycle model for smart contracts and created a tool based on ANTLR4's G4 grammar. It involves both syntactic and lexical analysis to effectively detect bugs and vulnerabilities in smart contract. To validate our method, we used FDR (False Discovery Rate) and FNR (False Negative Rate) as evaluation metrics, data collected from SmartBugs and Etherscan. We validated our approach compared with MSmart and SmartCheck. We got higher FDR and improved FNR, indicating enhanced detection capabilities. After thorough analysis and extensive testing, our tool has proven to be both specific and high-performing."

While this proliferation affords developers a wide array of APIs, it simultaneously heightens the challenge of selecting the most suitable ones. Recommendation methods based on correlation graphs aim to help developers discover relevant and compatible Compositions of APIs for mashup creation. However, existing API Composition recommendations suffer from problems such as low recommendation accuracy and significant time overhead when dealing with a large number of keywords. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an extension to traditional correlation graph-based API Composition recommendation algorithms by introducing an Semantic-Integrated Correlation Graph API Composition Recommender (SCGACR) algorithm. This algorithm significantly reduces the algorithmic time and space overhead and improves the recommendation performance to some extent. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that the SCGACR method exhibits lower time overhead and improved recommendation accuracy compared to competing methods."

However, in series-series (SS) type DWPT systems, applying a large step voltage in low-coupling regions causes a Tx-side current overshoot, which consequently requires increased equipment capacity. This study proposes a control method that simultaneously minimizes the current overshoot and settling time by combining bilateral voltage control with receiver (Rx)-side rectifier timing control, employing an active rectifier. The conventional current envelope model is extended to an SS-type DWPT system by approximating the time variation of mutual inductance using a polynomial. It is theoretically shown that voltage trajectories that eliminate oscillatory components while maintaining a constant steady-state current exist, and these trajectories are implemented through voltage control on both the Tx and Rx sides, along with Rx-side rectification timing control. The proposed method was experimentally validated on an 8kW-scale DWPT test bench operating at 20km/h. The results confirm that the proposed method reduces the Tx current overshoot from 207% to 5% and shortens the settling time to 0.14 ms. Consequently, under a 50A current limit, the received energy increased from 22.47 J to 115.8 J."

Experimental electromyography (EMG), metabolic cost, and user preference data were recorded for ten participants evaluated wearing the powered back exosuit versus the backX, a commercially available passive back support exoskeleton, and a no exo baseline. RESULTS: Both exoskeletons significantly reduced (p<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$&lt; $</tex-math></inline-formula>0.05) muscle activation of certain lumbar flexor and extensor muscles when compared to a no exo condition across all conditions tested, though neither significantly reduced the metabolic cost associated with lifting. Users tended to prefer lifting with the powered device as opposed to the passive or no exo condition. CONCLUSION: Despite the increased mass of powered back support exoskeletons, these devices can reduce lumbar muscle activity to a similar degree as passive exoskeletons, and are favored by users over their passive counterparts. SIGNIFICANCE: While current powered back support devices tend to incur the cost of being heavy, rigid, and inconvenient for certain lifting postures, these results show that cable-driven powered devices may minimize these factors to the point that they are favored over the currently popular passive devices on the market."

    "abstract": "Coaxial magnetic gears (CMGs) enable contactless torque transmission, addressing the noise and maintenance drawbacks of mechanical gears. However, the heavy reliance on rare earth permanent magnets (PMs) presents a challenge owing to their unstable supply and fluctuating costs. To mitigate dependence on rare earth PMs, this study proposes and evaluates four CMG configurations combining NdFeB and Ferrite. Each configuration is optimized using two-dimensional finite element analysis (FEA), with axial leakage considered by an equivalent magnetic circuit model instead of three-dimensional (3D) FEA. The suitability of bridge geometry for each PM combination is first assessed, revealing that irrespective of the PM material, the inner bridge provides superior torque density. Comparative analyses of the electromagnetic performance and active material costs were then conducted to evaluate the feasibility of each PM configuration. The results indicate that the difference in residual flux density between the inner and outer rotor PMs influences torque density, material costs, peak-to-peak torque, and efficiency. This difference was also observed in an appropriate gap between the active part and the end cover, at which end cover loss becomes negligible. Ferrite-Nd CMG showed the highest efficiency and lowest price among the combinations of nonrare earth PMs. Finally, electromagnetic performance comparisons of NdFeB-based and Ferrite-Nd CMGs using 3D FEA and experimental validation show that while the Ferrite-Nd CMG has a lower torque density than the NdFeB-based CMG, it offers promising advantages in terms of reduced rare earth dependency, negligible housing loss, and high efficiency."

    "abstract": "Keyphrase extraction involves automatically identifying key phrases that represent the core content within a document. Recent advancements have improved unsupervised methods for keyphrase extraction, enabling efficient operation without requiring labeled training data. As document length increases, effective keyphrase extraction becomes increasingly crucial for information summarization and retrieval. However, existing methods often struggle with long documents due to challenges in capturing global context and semantic relationships across extended text. In this paper, we propose UFORank, a unified framework for unsupervised keyphrase extraction specifically designed for long documents. UFORank integrates three key components: (1) topic importance derived from clustering semantically similar phrases, (2) position-biased weights that consider both relative positions and frequencies of phrases within the document structure, and (3) phrase-to-topic similarity measures for enhanced relevance scoring. Additionally, UFORank employs Glow, a flow-based generative model, to improve the semantic representation quality of both phrases and documents in the embedding space. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark datasets for long document keyphrase extraction demonstrate that UFORank achieves competitive performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, including PromptRank and Attention-Seeker. Specifically, UFORank achieves F1-scores of 17.66%, 20.73%, and 13.17% on the respective datasets. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the individual contributions of each framework component to the overall performance gains."

    "abstract": "Traditional co-polarized metasurface cloaks suffer from limited bandwidth, polarization sensitivity, and mismatched operating bands between near-field (NF) and far-field (FF) responses. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a linear-phase metasurface cloak whose phase response follows the linear law required for broadband cloaking. The cloak is realized using anisotropic unit cells with an 8-mm periodicity and 4-mm thickness, both determined through systematic parametric studies. Surface-current analysis and multi-frequency NF simulations validate its wideband performance. A spin-decoupling strategy is further introduced to enable joint cloaking under both linear and circular polarizations (LP/CP). Multi-frequency experiments under normal incidence demonstrate efficient LP/CP cloaking over a 6.5–10.5 GHz band (47% fractional bandwidth), with a flat 4 dB FF RCS reduction under representative LP excitation across the same frequency range, exhibiting well-aligned NF and FF operating bands without performance trade-offs."

    "abstract": "Field-effect transistors (FETs), monolithically equipped with antennae, are by now well established as rectifying detectors of terahertz radiation (TeraFETs). At such high radiation frequencies, the charge carriers in the channels of the TeraFETs can no longer respond in a quasi-static manner, but instead plasmon polariton waves (electromagnetically coupled charge oscillations in the gate electrode and the two-dimensional chargecarrier gas) are launched at the electrodes which are connected with the antenna. The waves decay rapidly with the momentum scattering time of the charge carriers. But as the speed of the waves is high, one expects for sufficiently short channels that the waves can reach the end of the channel and are reflected back, leading to the formation of a standing wave and possibly giving rise to a Fabry-Perot-like resonance. Indeed, evidence for standing-wave formation was found in the low-temperature responsivity of some TeraFETs. Recently, such standing-wave signatures were observed for the first time even at room temperature. The measurement were performed on graphene TeraFETs exhibiting a very high mobility of the charge carriers. Here, we present s-SNOM measurements, taken at room temperature on a similar graphene TeraFET, but now with a buried channel which allows for the near-field probing of the plasmon polaritons. We report the observation of underdamped polariton waves, propagating all the way through the transistor’s channel and returning after reflection at the end of the channel."

    "abstract": "Manual assembly processes remain a fundamental aspect of the manufacturing industry, primarily due to the dexterity and adaptability of human workers. However, the repetitive and physically demanding nature of these tasks highlights the need for an ergonomic and well-balanced workload, as poor ergonomics can also contribute to errors. This paper aims to automate the assembly line balancing process for a real-world case study. A new multi-objective Assembly Line Balancing Problem (ALBP) formulation is proposed, minimizing both workload variance and variance in workers’ energy expenditure across workstations while accounting for daily fluctuations in the number of operators. The proposed metabolic and time-sensitive assembly line balancing method integrates caloric considerations to reduce long-term risks of Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSDs). Using a graph-based approach, the framework ensures that precedence constraints are met while optimizing task assignments to minimize cycle time and metabolic cost per operator. To improve accuracy in estimating energy expenditure, this study employs the Methods-Time Measurement - Universal Analyzing System (MTM-UAS), which decomposes tasks into standardized motion elements. The methodology is validated through a real-world case study at Bosch Thermotechnology in Portugal, assigning tasks while minimizing the trade-offs between worker fatigue and production goals.

Accurate prelaunch testing of mechanical and control systems is crucial to ensure mission success. Therefore, the ground-based microgravity physical simulation is essential, particularly for accurately replicating its microgravity collision response. However, existing microgravity simulations fail to accurately replicate landing collision response, particularly in the vertical direction. In this article, an air-bearing simulation system with quasi-passive vertical compensation is presented, enabling 6-DOF simulation. The vertical compensation integrates a quasi-zero stiffness unit for passive gravity compensation, complemented by an active following mechanism for extended compensation stroke. The controller is specifically adjusted to generate the vertical virtual mass, ensuring equal added mass in all three directions and eliminating systematic errors. Vertical tests confirm that the system effectively simulates free-floating conditions for the lander simulator up to 1 ton and accurately responds to forces as small as 1 N.

Three different controllers, such as the Proportional Integral Derivative (PID), Tilt Integral Derivative (TID), and Fractional Order PID (FOPID), are investigated for their ability to deliver accurate and robust speed regulation. The tuning of these controllers is carried out using modern metaheuristic optimization techniques, namely the Artificial Rabbit Optimizer (ARO), Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA), and Supply-Demand Optimization (SDO). A statistical analysis is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of each controller-optimizer-cost function combination.

    "abstract": "In recent years, with the growing demand for scenarios such as multilingual voice interaction, intelligent conference recording, and real-time translation, end-to-end speech-to-English translation (S2ET) models have become a key research direction. However, the traditional cascaded ASR-NMT architecture is prone to error accumulation in noisy environments and suffers from high computational complexity and excessive energy consumption on edge devices. This research provides a Transformer-based multi-channel speech-to-English translation model compression and acceleration framework for edge devices in order to overcome these obstacles. Three approaches are used in the methodical construction of this model: structural compression, attention optimization, and signal modeling. A multi-channel observation model based on the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is first built during the signal modeling phase. This approach improves the spatial representation of speech signals by achieving combined feature modeling of amplitude and phase through the use of a complex-domain convolutional network. Second, a dynamic covariance recursive update technique is paired with a minimal variance distortionless response (MVDR) filter in the voice enhancement step. This mechanism ensures distortion-free speech in the target direction while suppressing background noise. Third, we propose an Importance-Guided Aggregation Module (IAM). This substantially reduces redundant attention calculation and improves cross-channel information fusion capabilities by introducing a region-saliency selection technique into the Transformer attention computation. Lastly, we develop a three-phase compression technique that includes distillation, quantization, and pruning. Effective model deployment on platforms with limited resources is made possible by this tactic. The Qujing Multi-Channel Speech-to-English Translation Dataset (QJ-MCT), a proprietary dataset with a variety of environmental noise and reverberation circumstances, is what we experimentally create. Performance tests are conducted on Raspberry Pi 4 and Artix-7 FPGA platforms. Results show that the proposed model significantly reduces model size and latency while maintaining high translation accuracy. In particular, the compressed model is just 68 MB and the inference latency is decreased to 1820 ms, which represents reductions of roughly 85.8% and 56.7%, respectively, when compared to the uncompressed multi-channel Transformer baseline model (480 MB, 4200 ms). Knowledge distillation successfully makes up for the performance loss brought on by compression in terms of BLEU indicators, leading in a compressed model with BLEU 29.0 that is just 0.4 less than the original model. Additional ablation experiments showed that 8-bit quantization is the most consistent between performance and computational overhead, and that a better balance can be reached when the pruning intensity is between 20% and 40%."

In particular, sensor fusion approaches have gained attention for combining complementary information and overcoming the limitations of individual sensing modalities, thereby enabling more robust and reliable systems. Among them, the fusion of surface electromyography (EMG) and A-mode ultrasound (US) is very promising. However, prior solutions rely on power-hungry platforms unsuitable for multi-day use and are limited to discrete gesture classification. In this work, we present an ultra-lowpower (sub- 50 mW) system for concurrent acquisition of 8 channel EMG and $\\mathbf{4}$-channel A-mode US signals, integrating two state-of-the-art platforms into fully wearable, dry-contact armbands.

    "abstract": "As context windows expands, Large Language Models (LLMs) are being more capable of handling long-context tasks. However, long-context inference is hindered by high latency and memory usage due to the linearly growing Key-Value (KV) cache. Prior work has shown that a dynamic subset of the KV cache dominates attention outcomes and selectively loads these subsets instead of the full cache. These methods partition the KV cache into segments (block-wise and token-wise) and identify critical ones for recall. However, for block-wise ones, their recall accuracy is often compromised by semantic inconsistencies among consecutive tokens, and for token-wise ones, they suffer from inefficiency in memory management and offloading. To these ends, we propose Dispenser, a hierarchical KV cache management algorithm inspired by multi-level page tables. Dispenser organizes the KV cache based on token semantic similarity and partitions it into pages and blocks, which enables straightforward integration into modern serving engines such as vLLM. It employs a two-level lookup mechanism to identify and load the most relevant blocks for the current query. Experimental results demonstrate that Dispenser achieves up to a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$5.75 \\times$</tex> speedup in self-attention, reducing inference latency by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$2.1 \\times$</tex> on tasks with long dependencies with negligible accuracy loss."

Previous works have explored the use of different deep learning approaches owing to their high forecasting accuracy compared to traditional machine learning based forecasting methods.

These biologically grounded signals drive a spiking neural network implemented on a mixed-signal neuromorphic processor.

    "abstract": "With growing emphasis on sustainable manufacturing, we address the energy-aware Simple Assembly Line Balancing Problem with Power Peak Minimization (SALB3PM). We propose a metaheuristic to solve the SALB3PM. Our metaheuristic combines (1) a multi-start framework with three neighborhood operators (insertion, swap, delay incrementing) and (2) a dynamic penalty mechanism for handling cycle-time infeasibility. We designed and compared four algorithm variants to evaluate the impact of components. We conducted computational experiments on benchmark instances. The results show that our best variant achieves an average optimality gap of 2.38% when considering known optima, and optimal solutions were achieved in all runs for over 50% of instances. The approach contributes to sustainable manufacturing through energy-efficient production line design."

    "abstract": "Globally, the integrity of online examinations is a paramount concern with the widespread adoption of remote learning and digital assessments. Ensuring fairness and preventing academic misconduct presents a significant challenge for educational institutions, training centers, and certification bodies. Traditional proctoring methods are often resource-intensive or limited in their detection capabilities, leading to potentially inaccurate or insufficient monitoring. This paper introduces Proctonix AI, an intelligent online exam monitoring system designed to enhance academic integrity through real-time, AI-powered surveillance. Leveraging modern web technologies and computer vision techniques, the system captures and processes live webcam feeds and screen activity to detect suspicious behaviors. Key functionalities include face and presence detection, gaze tracking for distraction assessment, and voice activity monitoring. By employing Flask for backend web server and route handling, HTML/CSS/JavaScript for a responsive user interface, and OpenCV with Media Pipe Face Mesh for robust facial and eye landmark detection, Proctonix AI aims to provide a robust framework for identifying potential cheating instances. The system also integrates custom heuristics for behavioral analysis and browser APIs for user alerts, facilitating a more secure and reliable online examination environment. The objective is to offer a streamlined, accessible solution that supports educators in maintaining the credibility of online assessments."
