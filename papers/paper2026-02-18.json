    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) perform strongly on biological benchmarks, raising concerns that they may help novice actors acquire dual-use laboratory skills. Yet, whether this translates to improved human performance in the physical laboratory remains unclear. To address this, we conducted a pre-registered, investigator-blinded, randomized controlled trial (June-August 2025; n = 153) evaluating whether LLMs improve novice performance in tasks that collectively model a viral reverse genetics workflow. We observed no significant difference in the primary endpoint of workflow completion (5.2% LLM vs. 6.6% Internet; P = 0.759), nor in the success rate of individual tasks. However, the LLM arm had numerically higher success rates in four of the five tasks, most notably for the cell culture task (68.8% LLM vs. 55.3% Internet; P = 0.059). Post-hoc Bayesian modeling of pooled data estimates an approximate 1.4-fold increase (95% CrI 0.74-2.62) in success for a \"typical\" reverse genetics task under LLM assistance. Ordinal regression modelling suggests that participants in the LLM arm were more likely to progress through intermediate steps across all tasks (posterior probability of a positive effect: 81%-96%). Overall, mid-2025 LLMs did not substantially increase novice completion of complex laboratory procedures but were associated with a modest performance benefit. These results reveal a gap between in silico benchmarks and real-world utility, underscoring the need for physical-world validation of AI biosecurity assessments as model capabilities and user proficiency evolve."

    "abstract": "LLMs are increasingly being used for complex problems which are not necessarily resolved in a single response, but require interacting with an environment to acquire information. In these scenarios, LLMs must reason about inherent cost-uncertainty tradeoffs in when to stop exploring and commit to an answer. For instance, on a programming task, an LLM should test a generated code snippet if it is uncertain about the correctness of that code; the cost of writing a test is nonzero, but typically lower than the cost of making a mistake. In this work, we show that we can induce LLMs to explicitly reason about balancing these cost-uncertainty tradeoffs, then perform more optimal environment exploration. We formalize multiple tasks, including information retrieval and coding, as sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty. Each problem has latent environment state that can be reasoned about via a prior which is passed to the LLM agent. We introduce a framework called Calibrate-Then-Act (CTA), where we feed the LLM this additional context to enable it to act more optimally. This improvement is preserved even under RL training of both the baseline and CTA. Our results on information-seeking QA and on a simplified coding task show that making cost-benefit tradeoffs explicit with CTA can help agents discover more optimal decision-making strategies."

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data exhibit strong and reproducible statistical structure. This has motivated the development of large-scale foundation models, such as TranscriptFormer, that use transformer-based architectures to learn a generative model for gene expression by embedding genes into a latent vector space. These embeddings have been used to obtain state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on downstream tasks such as cell-type classification, disease-state prediction, and cross-species learning. Here, we ask whether similar performance can be achieved without utilizing computationally intensive deep learning-based representations. Using simple, interpretable pipelines that rely on careful normalization and linear methods, we obtain SOTA or near SOTA performance across multiple benchmarks commonly used to evaluate single-cell foundation models, including outperforming foundation models on out-of-distribution tasks involving novel cell types and organisms absent from the training data. Our findings highlight the need for rigorous benchmarking and suggest that the biology of cell identity can be captured by simple linear representations of single cell gene expression data."

    "abstract": "Agent Skill framework, now widely and officially supported by major players such as GitHub Copilot, LangChain, and OpenAI, performs especially well with proprietary models by improving context engineering, reducing hallucinations, and boosting task accuracy. Based on these observations, an investigation is conducted to determine whether the Agent Skill paradigm provides similar benefits to small language models (SLMs). This question matters in industrial scenarios where continuous reliance on public APIs is infeasible due to data-security and budget constraints requirements, and where SLMs often show limited generalization in highly customized scenarios. This work introduces a formal mathematical definition of the Agent Skill process, followed by a systematic evaluation of language models of varying sizes across multiple use cases. The evaluation encompasses two open-source tasks and a real-world insurance claims data set. The results show that tiny models struggle with reliable skill selection, while moderately sized SLMs (approximately 12B - 30B) parameters) benefit substantially from the Agent Skill approach. Moreover, code-specialized variants at around 80B parameters achieve performance comparable to closed-source baselines while improving GPU efficiency. Collectively, these findings provide a comprehensive and nuanced characterization of the capabilities and constraints of the framework, while providing actionable insights for the effective deployment of Agent Skills in SLM-centered environments."

    "abstract": "Fluid molecular ferroelectrics are a new class of organic materials where ferroelectricity is found in conjunction with 3D fluidity whilst still retaining spontaneous polarization values comparable to their traditional solid state counterparts. One of the major challenges for soft condensed matter physics is predicting whether a fluid molecular material will form ferroelectric phase with nematic or smectic order. Through the synthesis of forty five systematically varied molecules, and by analogy to solid molecular ferroelectrics, is it shown that subtle hydrogen fluorine substitution allows for tuneable syn-parallel pairing motifs resulting in either specific pairings leading too geometrically constrained lamellar order or diversified pairings stabilising nematic ordering. Large-scale, fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations reveal that smectic ferroelectricity emerges from discrete lateral pairing modes, whereas nematic phases arise from a multiplicity of equivalent polar configurations. Together, these findings establish experimentally validated design principles for fluid molecular ferroelectrics and provide a predictive framework for engineering functional polar fluids."

    "abstract": "We propose that the superconducting diode (SD) efficiency can be significantly enhanced near the transition between two superconducting states by choosing parameters where, before the system goes normal with increasing supercurrent, it switches into a different superconducting order for one direction of the current but not for the other. This mechanism for producing high SD efficiency relies on the expectation that the critical current depends sensitively on the superconducting order. We demonstrate this explicitly by performing detailed calculations for a bilayer superconductor with an in-plane magnetic field, which admits the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) and the orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) orders as a function of the strength of the magnetic field. We predict a sharp peak in the SD efficiency in the FFLO state close to the transition, which arises from a complex interplay between the two superconducting orders. An implication of our study is that the measurement of the SD efficiency can provide fundamental insight into the nature of the BCS-FFLO transition both as a function of the magnetic field and the supercurrent."

Measuring the mass and radius of these planets, combined with their moderated irradiation, allows us to estimate their planetary bulk composition, which is a key quantity to comprehend giant planet formation and structure. Aims. We present the discovery of two transiting warm giant planets orbiting solar-type stars from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which were characterized by further spectroscopic and photometric ground-based observations. Methods. We performed a joint analysis of photometric data with radial velocities to confirm and characterize TOI-883 b and TOI-899 b, two sub-Saturns orbiting solar-like stars. Results. TOI-883 b and TOI-899 b have masses of $0.123 \\pm 0.012$ $M_J$ and $0.213 \\pm 0.024$ $M_J$, radius of $0.604 \\pm 0.028$ $R_J$ and $0.991 \\pm 0.044$ $R_J$, periods of $10.06$ d and $12.85$ d and equilibrium temperature of $1086 \\pm 19$ K and $1040 \\pm 19$ K, respectively. Conclusions. While having similar masses, orbital periods and stellar host properties, these planets seem to have different internal compositions, which could point to distinct formation histories. Both planets are suitable targets for atmospheric studies to further constrain formation scenarios of planets in the Neptune-Saturn mass range"

    "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) but has simultaneously created a \"resource divide.\" State-of-the-art legal intelligence systems typically rely on massive parameter counts (7B+) and cloud-based inference, rendering them inaccessible to practitioners in resource-constrained environments and posing significant data sovereignty risks. This paper introduces Quecto-V1, a domain-specific Small Language Model (SLM) engineered to democratize access to Indian legal intelligence. Built upon a custom configuration of the GPT-2 architecture (124 million parameters), Quecto-V1 was trained from scratch exclusively on a corpus of Indian statutes, including the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), and the Constitution of India. Unlike generalist models, which prioritize broad world knowledge, our approach maximizes \"lexical density\" within the legal domain. Furthermore, we address the deployment bottleneck by applying post-training 8-bit quantization (GGUF format), compressing the model to a memory footprint of under 150 MB. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that Quecto-V1 achieves high fidelity in retrieving statutory definitions and penal provisions, outperforming general-purpose SLMs in domain-specific exact match tasks while running entirely offline on consumer-grade CPUs. We further present an ablation study showing that 8-bit quantization yields a 74% reduction in model size with less than 3.5% degradation in retrieval accuracy compared to full-precision baselines. These findings suggest that for specialized, high-stakes domains like law, domain-specific training coupled with aggressive quantization offers a viable, privacy-preserving alternative to monolithic cloud models."

We present a computational framework that analyzes MD trajectories to quantitatively interpret macroscopic transport by decomposing it into additive contributions from physically motivated events. They are defined either through heuristically identified microscopic transitions, capturing events such as single-ion hops, multi-ion hops, and vehicular motion, or through transitions between chemically interpretable coordination macrostates. The construction guarantees that attributed contributions sum exactly to the Onsager transport coefficients estimated via the Green-Kubo/Einstein formalism, while scanning the sampling window exposes characteristic temporal scales at which distinct transport mechanisms emerge and dominate. Applied across three prototypical electrolytes-inorganic crystals, liquids, and polymers-the framework quantitatively resolves long-standing debates (e.g., the role of concerted motion and exchange), identifies dominant mechanisms and rate-limiting steps, quantifies their frequencies and effectiveness, and extracts activation energies for distinct transport modes, thereby distilling design rules for fast conduction. This general and reproducible analysis tool turns MD trajectories into quantitative mechanism maps, enabling the ion-conductor community to adjudicate mechanistic hypotheses and accelerate discovery."

Recent epidemics, particularly COVID-19, highlight the need for models capturing adaptation to perceived risk, social influence, and policy signals. This review synthesizes post-2020 models incorporating behavioral adaptation, examines their theoretical grounding, and evaluates how behavioral constructs modify transmission, vaccination, and compliance. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched Scopus and PubMed (2020-2025), screening 1,274 records with citation chaining. We extracted data on disease context, country, modeling framework, behavioral mechanisms (prevalence-dependent, policy/media, imitation/social learning), and psychosocial constructs (personal threat, coping appraisal, barriers, social norms, cues to action). A total of 216 studies met inclusion criteria. Results: COVID-19 accounted for 73% of studies. Most used compartmental ODE models (81%) and focused on theoretical or U.S. settings. Behavioral change was mainly reactive: 47% applied prevalence-dependent feedback, 25% included awareness/media dynamics, and 19% relied on exogenous policy triggers. Game-theoretic or social learning approaches were rare (less or equal than 5%). Behavioral effects primarily modified contact or transmission rates (91%). Psychosocial constructs were unevenly represented: cues to action (n=159) and personal threat (n=145) dominated, whereas coping appraisal (n=82), barriers (n=36), and social norms (n=25) were less common. Conclusions: We propose a taxonomy structured by behavioral drivers, social scale, and memory to clarify dominant paradigms and their empirical basis. Mapping models to psychosocial constructs provides guidance for more theory-informed and data grounded-integration of behavioral processes in epidemiological modeling."

Secondly, in contrast to the purely Dirichlet case, a key challenge is to establish the non-vanishing of the tangential derivative of $u$ along the Neumann boundary. To address this, we employ local analysis techniques of angular derivatives, as introduced by Hartman and Wintner [Amer. J. Math., 1953]. Thirdly, we identify the signs of directional derivatives of $u$ along sections of the moving line. Using a planar sub-spherical sector as an example, we illustrate how these new innovative techniques and the moving plane method can be combined to derive symmetry and monotonicity results, particularly when the amplitude is less than or equal to $2π/3$."

Such models often require discretization of continuous neural time series data, a process referred to as 'tokenization'. However, the impact of different tokenization strategies for neural data is currently poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of sample-level tokenization strategies for transformer-based large neuroimaging models (LNMs) applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We compare learnable and non-learnable tokenizers by examining their signal reconstruction fidelity and their impact on subsequent foundation modeling performance (token prediction, biological plausibility of generated data, preservation of subject-specific information, and performance on downstream tasks). For the learnable tokenizer, we introduce a novel approach based on an autoencoder. Experiments were conducted on three publicly available MEG datasets spanning different acquisition sites, scanners, and experimental paradigms. Our results show that both learnable and non-learnable discretization schemes achieve high reconstruction accuracy and broadly comparable performance across most evaluation criteria, suggesting that simple fixed sample-level tokenization strategies can be used in the development of neural foundation models.

(2022). Since martingale techniques do not apply, we obtain the convergence of the finite-dimensional distributions through a bespoke version of Slutsky's lemma: First, we overcome the lack of hypercontractivity by an iterated integration-by-parts scheme which reduces the remaining analysis to finite Wiener chaos; crucially, this argument relies on Malliavin differentiability of the nonlinearity but not on chaos decay and, as a consequence, encompasses the centred absolute value function. Second, in the spirit of the law of large numbers, we show that the diagonal of the second-order process converges to an explicit symmetric correction term. Finally, we compute all the moments of the remaining process and, through a fine combinatorial analysis, show that they converge to those of the Stratonovich Brownian rough path perturbed by an antisymmetric area correction, as computed by a suitable amendment of Fawcett's theorem. All of these steps benefit from a major combinatorial reduction that is implied by the original argument of Breuer and Major (1983)."

If both the population index and detection threshold can be determined, observed meteor rates can be converted to fluxes and extrapolated to any desired brightness or size. We argue that the distribution of observed or instrumental meteor magnitudes is best modeled as an exponentially modified Gaussian (exGaussian) distribution. This is for three reasons: first, an exGaussian distribution is the natural result of random variations in detection threshold and/or post-detection measurement errors in magnitude. Second, an exGaussian distribution provides a better fit to the magnitude distribution than all other competing distributions in the literature; we demonstrate this using both a set of faint optical meteor magnitudes and a set of radar meteor echo amplitudes. Finally, the population index, mean detection threshold, and random variation/error terms are easily extracted from the best-fit parameters of an exGaussian distribution."

Existing explainability methods rely on final-layer attributions, capture either local token-level attributions or global attention patterns without unification, and lack context-awareness of inter-token dependencies and structural components. They also fail to capture how relevance evolves across layers and how structural components shape decision-making. To address these limitations, we proposed the \\textbf{Context-Aware Layer-wise Integrated Gradients (CA-LIG) Framework}, a unified hierarchical attribution framework that computes layer-wise Integrated Gradients within each Transformer block and fuses these token-level attributions with class-specific attention gradients. This integration yields signed, context-sensitive attribution maps that capture supportive and opposing evidence while tracing the hierarchical flow of relevance through the Transformer layers. We evaluate the CA-LIG Framework across diverse tasks, domains, and transformer model families, including sentiment analysis and long and multi-class document classification with BERT, hate speech detection in a low-resource language setting with XLM-R and AfroLM, and image classification with Masked Autoencoder vision Transformer model. Across all tasks and architectures, CA-LIG provides more faithful attributions, shows stronger sensitivity to contextual dependencies, and produces clearer, more semantically coherent visualizations than established explainability methods. These results indicate that CA-LIG provides a more comprehensive, context-aware, and reliable explanation of Transformer decision-making, advancing both the practical interpretability and conceptual understanding of deep neural models."

For Abelian TOs under decoherence, we develop a replica field-theory framework based on a doubled-state construction that relates TEN and TMI to the quantum dimensions of domain-wall defects between decoherence-induced topological boundary conditions, yielding general expressions in the strong-decoherence regime. We further compute TEN and TMI exactly for decohered $G$-graded string-net states, including cases with non-Abelian anyons. We interpret the results within the strong one-form-symmetry framework for mixed-state TOs: TMI probes the total quantum dimension of the emergent premodular anyon theory, whereas TEN detects only its modular part."

It remains computationally demanding whether training from scratch, initialising from pre-trained weights, or fine-tuning large models. Although pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP offer rich image representations, existing adaptation or fine-tuning methods often rely on their global image embeddings, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained, localised attributes essential in complex, cluttered street scenes. To address this, we propose CLIP-MHAdapter, a variant of the current lightweight CLIP adaptation paradigm that appends a bottleneck MLP equipped with multi-head self-attention operating on patch tokens to model inter-patch dependencies. With approximately 1.4 million trainable parameters, CLIP-MHAdapter achieves superior or competitive accuracy across eight attribute classification tasks on the Global StreetScapes dataset, attaining new state-of-the-art results while maintaining low computational cost.

In the first stage, a non-parametric kernel regression model constructs state-of-charge trajectory bounds from historical data that satisfy peak-shaving requirements. The second stage utilizes the remaining capacity for energy arbitrage via a transfer learning method. Case studies using New York City commercial building demand data show that our method achieves a 1.3 times improvement in performance over the state-of-the-art forecast-based method, achieving cost savings and effective peak management without relying on predictions."

    "abstract": "Large-scale sharing of dialogue-based data is instrumental for advancing the science of teaching and learning, yet rigorous de-identification remains a major barrier. In mathematics tutoring transcripts, numeric expressions frequently resemble structured identifiers (e.g., dates or IDs), leading generic Personally Identifiable Information (PII) detection systems to over-redact core instructional content and reduce dataset utility. This work asks how PII can be detected in math tutoring transcripts while preserving their educational utility. To address this challenge, we investigate the \"numeric ambiguity\" problem and introduce MathEd-PII, the first benchmark dataset for PII detection in math tutoring dialogues, created through a human-in-the-loop LLM workflow that audits upstream redactions and generates privacy-preserving surrogates. The dataset contains 1,000 tutoring sessions (115,620 messages; 769,628 tokens) with validated PII annotations. Using a density-based segmentation method, we show that false PII redactions are disproportionately concentrated in math-dense regions, confirming numeric ambiguity as a key failure mode. We then compare four detection strategies: a Presidio baseline and LLM-based approaches with basic, math-aware, and segment-aware prompting. Math-aware prompting substantially improves performance over the baseline (F1: 0.821 vs. 0.379) while reducing numeric false positives, demonstrating that de-identification must incorporate domain context to preserve analytic utility. This work provides both a new benchmark and evidence that utility-preserving de-identification for tutoring data requires domain-aware modeling."

These attacks exploit a critical vulnerability in passport enrollment procedures adopted by many countries, where the facial image is often acquired without a supervised live capture process. In this paper, we propose a novel face morphing technique based on Arc2Face, an identity-conditioned face foundation model capable of synthesizing photorealistic facial images from compact identity representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by comparing the morphing attack potential metric on two large-scale sequestered face morphing attack detection datasets against several state-of-the-art morphing methods, as well as on two novel morphed face datasets derived from FEI and ONOT. Experimental results show that the proposed deep learning-based approach achieves a morphing attack potential comparable to that of landmark-based techniques, which have traditionally been regarded as the most challenging. These findings confirm the ability of the proposed method to effectively preserve and manage identity information during the morph generation process."

Law enforcement must identify these businesses within a dense population of lawful establishments, but investigative resources are limited and the illicit status of each location is unknown until inspection. Detection methods based on online reviews offer some insight, yet operators can manipulate these signals, leaving covert establishments undetected. IMBs constitute one of the largest segments of indoor sex trafficking in the United States, with an estimated 9,000 establishments. Mobility data offers an alternative to online signals, covering establishments that avoid digital visibility entirely. We derive features from mobility data spanning temporal visitation patterns, dwell times, visitor catchment areas, and demand stability. Because confirmed labels exist only for establishments identified through advertising platforms, we employ positive-unlabeled learning to address the label asymmetry in ground truth. The model achieves 0.97 AUC and 0.84 Average Precision. Four operational signatures characterize high-risk establishments: demand consistency, evening-concentrated visits, compressed service durations, and locally drawn clientele. The model produces risk scores for each business-week observation. Aggregating to the business level, prioritizing the highest-risk 10% of massage establishments captures 53% of known illicit operations, a 5.3-fold improvement over uninformed inspection. We develop a decision-support system that produces calibrated prioritization scores for law enforcement, enabling investigators to concentrate inspections on the highest-risk venues. The operational signatures may resist strategic manipulation because they reflect actual operations rather than online signals that operators can control."

Axenovich and Walzer showed that, for fixed $\\mathcal P$, $R(\\mathcal P, Q_n)$ grows linearly with $n$. However, for the diagonal question, we do not even come close to knowing the order of growth of $R(Q_n,Q_n)$. The current upper bound is $R(Q_n,Q_n)\\leq n^2-(1-o(1))n\\log n$, due to Axenovich and Winter. What about lower bounds? It is trivial to see that $2n\\leq R(Q_n,Q_n)$, but surprisingly, even an incremental improvement required significant work. Recently, an elegant probabilistic argument of Winter gave that, for large enough $n$, $R(Q_n,Q_n)\\geq 2.02n$. In this paper we show that $R(Q_n,Q_n)\\geq 2.7n+k$, where $k$ is a constant. Our current techniques might in principle show that in fact, for every $ε>0$, for large enough $n$, $R(Q_n,Q_n)\\geq (3-ε)n$. Our methods exploit careful modifications of layered-colourings, for a large number of layers. These modifications are stronger than previous arguments as they are more constructive, rather than purely probabilistic."

Despite its relevance, systematic investigations of Bi$_2$O$_3$ thin films remain scarce. Here, we report a comprehensive, multi-technique study of bismuth oxide grown on Au(111). By combining synchrotron-based x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and diffraction with low-energy electron diffraction and scanning tunneling microscopy, we elucidate the structural evolution of the surface during controlled oxidation and subsequent annealing. We find that Bi deposition induces well-defined surface reconstructions, whereas oxidation triggers the formation of a complex sequence of Bi$_2$O$_3$ domains. High-resolution spectroscopic and diffraction data enable us to propose a structural model consistent with the $(201)$ surface of $β$-Bi$_2$O$_3$. In addition, work function measurements reveal substantial electronic modifications at the interface. These results provide benchmark structural and electronic insights into the Bi oxide/Au(111) system and establish a framework for integrating Bi$_2$O$_3$ in devices in combination to two-dimensional semiconductors exploiting its low contact resistance."

    "abstract": "Click models are a central component of learning and evaluation in recommender systems, yet most existing models are designed for single ranked-list interfaces. In contrast, modern recommender platforms increasingly use complex interfaces such as carousels, which consist of multiple swipeable lists that enable complex user browsing behaviors. In this paper, we study position-based click models in carousel interfaces and examine optimization methods, model structure, and alignment with user behavior. We propose three novel position-based models tailored to carousels, including the first position-based model without latent variables that incorporates observed examination signals derived from eye tracking data, called the Observed Examination Position-Based Model (OEPBM). We develop a general implementation of these carousel click models, supporting multiple optimization techniques and conduct experiments comparing gradient-based methods with classical approaches, namely expectation-maximization and maximum likelihood estimation. Our results show that gradient-based optimization consistently achieve better click likelihoods. Among the evaluated models, the OEPBM achieves the strongest performance in click prediction and produces examination patterns that most closely align to user behavior. However, we also demonstrate that strong click fit does not imply realistic modeling of user examination and browsing patterns. This reveals a fundamental limitation of click-only models in complex interfaces and the need for incorporating additional behavioral signals when designing click models for carousel-based recommender systems."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a class of generalised linear models (GLMs) driven by latent processes for modelling count, real-valued, binary, and positive continuous time series. Extending earlier latent-process regression frameworks based on Poisson or one-parameter exponential family assumptions, we allow the conditional distribution of the response to belong to a bi-parameter exponential family, with the latent process entering the conditional mean multiplicatively. This formulation substantially broadens the scope of latent-process GLMs, for instance, it naturally accommodates gamma responses for positive continuous data, enables estimation of an unknown dispersion parameter via method of moments, and avoids restrictive conditions on link functions that arise under existing formulations. We establish the asymptotic normality of the GLM estimators obtained from the GLM likelihood that ignores the latent process, and we derive the correct information matrix for valid inference. In addition, we provide a principled approach to prediction and forecasting in GLMs driven by latent processes, a topic not previously addressed in the literature. We present two real data applications on measles infections in North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany) and paleoclimatic glacial varves, which highlight the practical advantages and enhanced flexibility of the proposed modelling framework."

This is typically addressed using a Shack-Hartmann sensor, which pairs a high-speed camera with a lenslet array, but such systems add significant cost, weight, and power demands. In this work, we present a hybrid opto-electric neural network (OENN) wavefront sensor that enables ultra-high-speed operation in a compact, low-cost system. Subwavelength diffractive metasurfaces efficiently encode the incoming wavefront into tailored irradiance patterns, which are then decoded by a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP). In simulation and experiment, the hybrid approach achieves average Strehl ratio (SR) improvements exceeding 60% and 45%, respectively, for unseen wavefronts compared to purely electronic sensors with few-pixel inputs. Although larger MLPs allow purely electronic sensors to match the hybrid's SR under static conditions, transient atmosphere modeling shows that their added latency leads to rapid SR degradation with increasing Greenwood frequency, while the hybrid system maintains performance. These results highlight the potential of hybrid OENN architectures to unlock scalable, high-bandwidth free-space communication systems and, more broadly, to advance optical technologies where real-time sensing is constrained by electronic latency."

    "abstract": "Accurate assessment of anthropogenic climate change relies on historical instrumental data, yet observations from the early 20th century are sparse, fragmented, and uncertain. Conventional reconstructions rely on disparate statistical interpolation, which excessively smooths local features and creates unphysical artifacts, leading to systematic underestimation of intrinsic variability and extremes. Here, we present a unified, probabilistic generative deep learning framework that overcomes these limitations and reveals previously unresolved historical climate variability back to 1850. Leveraging a learned generative prior of Earth system dynamics, our model performs probabilistic inference to recover spatiotemporally consistent historical temperature and precipitation fields from sparse observations. Our approach preserves the higher-order statistics of climate dynamics, transforming reconstruction into a robust uncertainty-aware assessment. We demonstrate that our reconstruction overcomes pronounced biases in widely used historical reference products, including those underlying IPCC assessments, especially regarding extreme weather events. Notably, we uncover higher early 20th-century global warming levels compared to existing reconstructions, primarily driven by more pronounced polar warming, with mean Arctic warming trends exceeding established benchmarks by 0.15--0.29°C per decade for 1900--1980. Conversely, for the modern era, our reconstruction indicates that the broad Arctic warming trend is likely overestimated in recent assessments, yet explicitly resolves previously unrecognized intense, localized hotspots in the Barents Sea and Northeastern Greenland. Furthermore, based on our seamless global reconstruction that recovers precipitation variability across the oceans and under-monitored regions, we uncover an intensification of the global hydrological cycle."

To address these limitations, we introduce Framework of Thoughts (FoT)--a general-purpose foundation framework for building and optimizing dynamic reasoning schemes. FoT comes with built-in features for hyperparameter tuning, prompt optimization, parallel execution, and intelligent caching, unlocking the latent performance potential of reasoning schemes. We demonstrate FoT's capabilities by implementing three popular schemes--Tree of Thoughts, Graph of Thoughts, and ProbTree--within FoT. We empirically show that FoT enables significantly faster execution, reduces costs, and achieves better task scores through optimization. We release our codebase to facilitate the development of future dynamic and efficient reasoning schemes."

This discretization preserves nonnegativity at the discrete level and is shown to be convergent under suitable regularity conditions. A rigorous convergence analysis is provided, highlighting the role of mass lumping in ensuring nonnegativity and of operator splitting in decoupling the deterministic and stochastic dynamics. Numerical experiments are presented to confirm the convergence rates and the preservation of nonnegativity. In addition, we examine several numerical examples outside the scope of the established theory, aiming to explore the range of applicability and potential limitations of the proposed method."

We propose DressWild, a novel feed-forward pipeline that reconstructs physics-consistent 2D sewing patterns and the corresponding 3D garments from a single in-the-wild image. Given an input image, our method leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to normalize pose variations at the image level, then extract pose-aware, 3D-informed garment features. These features are fused through a transformer-based encoder and subsequently used to predict sewing pattern parameters, which can be directly applied to physical simulation, texture synthesis, and multi-layer virtual try-on. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach robustly recovers diverse sewing patterns and the corresponding 3D garments from in-the-wild images without requiring multi-view inputs or iterative optimization, offering an efficient and scalable solution for realistic garment simulation and animation."

    "abstract": "Object detection models are critical components of automated systems, such as autonomous vehicles and perception-based robots, but their sensitivity to adversarial attacks poses a serious security risk. Progress in defending these models lags behind classification, hindered by a lack of standardized evaluation. It is nearly impossible to thoroughly compare attack or defense methods, as existing work uses different datasets, inconsistent efficiency metrics, and varied measures of perturbation cost. This paper addresses this gap by investigating three key questions: (1) How can we create a fair benchmark to impartially compare attacks? (2) How well do modern attacks transfer across different architectures, especially from Convolutional Neural Networks to Vision Transformers? (3) What is the most effective adversarial training strategy for robust defense? To answer these, we first propose a unified benchmark framework focused on digital, non-patch-based attacks. This framework introduces specific metrics to disentangle localization and classification errors and evaluates attack cost using multiple perceptual metrics. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art attacks and a wide range of detectors. Our findings reveal two major conclusions: first, modern adversarial attacks against object detection models show a significant lack of transferability to transformer-based architectures. Second, we demonstrate that the most robust adversarial training strategy leverages a dataset composed of a mix of high-perturbation attacks with different objectives (e.g., spatial and semantic), which outperforms training on any single attack."

Probabilistic approaches to global wellposedness problems usually provide ensemble bounds on the solutions. These bounds are the main tools to ensure convergence procedures yielding the existence and uniqueness of global solutions. A question of interest consists in transforming such ensemble bounds into individual controls on the flow ; this, among other uses, gives valuable information on the long-time behavior of the solutions. Toward such question of bounds transformation, Bourgain initiated a successful procedure that exploited the local wellposedness of the PDE, with an estimate of the time of size-doubling. In this note, we construct an estimation procedure which relies on a different local requirement. It turns out that this substitute is flexible enough to be possible to fulfill with the help of the ensemble bound itself. For applications of the procedure, we are able to provide new pathwise controls on solutions to NLS equations."

In addition, we employ three different equations of state (EoSs), including one with a pasta phase, each based on a distinct theoretical framework: the variational method, relativistic Brueckner--Hartree--Fock theory, and relativistic mean-field theory. We emphasize that these approximations require only the TOV solutions for the core and the EoS properties at the core--crust interface; in our approach, only the energy density is needed. Finally, the relativistic approximation, as well as the Newtonian approximation with corrections, shows good agreement with the exact solutions. This indicates that a simple treatment of the crust is sufficient for structural purposes, independently of the uncertainties in the sub-nuclear equation of state, which are not very large. The unified EoS SINPA (relativistic mean-field theory), including the pasta phase, was used to study the thin-crust approximation, while degeneracy in the $M$--$R$ relation is demonstrated through: (i) anisotropic pressure in the modified TOV equations, (ii) the $f(R, L_m, T)$ gravity model, and (iii) dark matter admixture. As demonstrated, modifications to the description of gravitation introduce degeneracies in the mass--radius relation that are challenging to disentangle or quantify precisely."

We demonstrate efficacy of our implementation for benchmarks of C-RASPs in the literature, in particular in connection to the following applications: (1) transformer program optimization, and (2) constrained learning of transformer programs (based on a partial specification)."

    "abstract": "Motivated by recent developments in the theory of gravitation, we revisit the idea of topological variations, originally introduced by Wheeler and Hawking, from a rigorous perspective. Starting from a localized version of the Einstein-Hilbert variational principle, we encode the key aspects of the variational procedure in the form of a topology on a suitable space of variational configurations with low Sobolev regularity. This structure is the final topology with respect to the admissible variational maps and naturally lends itself to generalizations. We rigorously introduce two distinct types of topological variations, corresponding to the infinitesimal addition of disconnected components and to infinitesimal surgeries, both motivated by related physical concepts. Using tools from the theory of Sobolev spaces and precise asymptotics, we establish dimensional obstructions for the continuity and differentiability of the Einstein-Hilbert action with respect to these variations, and show that in the extended variational framework the action does not admit critical points in dimension $n=4$, while higher dimensions are free of this problem. Finally, we demonstrate the non-trivial effect of higher order curvature terms on the critical dimension."

We compare to a previous photolysis comparison exercise, namely PhotoComp 2011. Overall, we find good agreement between our results and previous work, with discrepancies usually caused by the implementation of temperature or pressure dependent quantum yields and updated cross-section data. We provide a new set of benchmark photolysis rates for additional species both for Solar irradiance and when irradiated by an M dwarf host star. In general, the higher actinic flux at far-UV and shorter wavelengths of the M dwarf compared to the Sun drives increased photolysis rates for reactions with high threshold energies. This work provides an updated set of benchmark results for further studies of photolysis in the Earth's atmosphere and that of other planets."

However, achieving long-range interfacial order while maintaining high-quality graphene remains a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of large-area quasi-free-standing monolayer graphene (QFMLG) via the intercalation of a two-dimensional (2D) Sn. While the triangular Sn(1x1) interface exhibits a robust metallic band structure, the decoupled QFMLG maintains charge neutrality, confirmed by photoemission spectroscopy. Using high-resolution Raman spectroscopy and microscopy, we distinguish between direct intercalation and diffusion-driven expansion, identifying the latter as the critical pathway to superior QFMLG crystalline quality. Temperature-dependent analysis reveals dynamical structural coupling between the decoupled QFMLG and the Sn interface, providing a novel degree of freedom for strain engineering. Beyond uncovering the diffusion-driven mechanism, this work establishes metal intercalation as an effective strategy for tailoring durable graphene-metal heterostructures with tunable properties for next-generation quantum materials platforms."

    "abstract": "The pursuit of general-purpose robotic manipulation is hindered by the scarcity of diverse, real-world interaction data. Unlike data collection from web in vision or language, robotic data collection is an active process incurring prohibitive physical costs. Consequently, automated task curation to maximize data value remains a critical yet under-explored challenge. Existing manual methods are unscalable and biased toward common tasks, while off-the-shelf foundation models often hallucinate physically infeasible instructions. To address this, we introduce RoboGene, an agentic framework designed to automate the generation of diverse, physically plausible manipulation tasks across single-arm, dual-arm, and mobile robots. RoboGene integrates three core components: diversity-driven sampling for broad task coverage, self-reflection mechanisms to enforce physical constraints, and human-in-the-loop refinement for continuous improvement. We conduct extensive quantitative analysis and large-scale real-world experiments, collecting datasets of 18k trajectories and introducing novel metrics to assess task quality, feasibility, and diversity. Results demonstrate that RoboGene significantly outperforms state-of-the-art foundation models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro). Furthermore, real-world experiments show that VLA models pre-trained with RoboGene achieve higher success rates and superior generalization, underscoring the importance of high-quality task generation.

    "abstract": "Conventional large language model (LLM) fairness alignment largely focuses on mitigating bias along single sensitive attributes, overlooking fairness as an inherently multidimensional and context-specific value. This approach risks creating systems that achieve narrow fairness metrics while exacerbating disparities along untargeted attributes, a phenomenon known as bias spillover. While extensively studied in machine learning, bias spillover remains critically underexplored in LLM alignment. In this work, we investigate how targeted gender alignment affects fairness across nine sensitive attributes in three state-of-the-art LLMs (Mistral 7B, Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B). Using Direct Preference Optimization and the BBQ benchmark, we evaluate fairness under ambiguous and disambiguous contexts. Our findings reveal noticeable bias spillover: while aggregate results show improvements, context-aware analysis exposes significant degradations in ambiguous contexts, particularly for physical appearance ($p< 0.001$ across all models), sexual orientation, and disability status. We demonstrate that improving fairness along one attribute can inadvertently worsen disparities in others under uncertainty, highlighting the necessity of context-aware, multi-attribute fairness evaluation frameworks."

Furthermore, these outer regions do not reach the conditions necessary for fast $α$-captures in ${^{18}}\\mathrm{O}$ to ${^{22}}\\mathrm{Ne}$, thus being favorable to maintaining a low ${^{16}}\\mathrm{O}/{^{18}}\\mathrm{O}$ ratio."

We describe a construction of the controlled Markov chain, having stochastic transition rates adapted to the observation filtration. By a change of probability measure of Girsanov type, we introduce the so-called separated optimal control problem, where the state is the conditional (unnormalized) distribution of the controlled Markov chain and the observation process becomes a driving Brownian motion, and we prove the equivalence with the original control problem. The controlled equations for the separated problem are an instance of the Wonham filtering equations. Next we present an analysis of the separated problem: we characterize the value function as the unique viscosity solution to the dynamic programming equations (both in the parabolic and the elliptic case) we prove verifications theorems and a version of the stochastic maximum principle in the form of a necessary conditions for optimality."

The asymmetry results from asymmetric coin operations, asymmetric initial states, and asymmetric polarization-dependent losses. By varying these asymmetry factors, the inverse participation ratio and entanglement entropy of the walker are numerically calculated for different coin and loss parameters, both for symmetric and asymmetric initial states. We then experimentally implement a 16-step asymmetric DTQW using a time-multiplexing fiber loop structure. By choosing an asymmetric initial state, both coin-position entanglement and delocalization are simultaneously enhanced under specific coin parameters. Moreover, we observe that with finite asymmetric polarization-dependent loss, the photon probability on the left side decreases significantly, while that on the right side increases and becomes more localized. Interestingly, under specific coin parameters, the entanglement and delocalization exhibit improved robustness against polarization-dependent loss. These results demonstrate that the DTQWs constitute an ideal platform for investigating photonic delocalization and hybrid entanglement."

    "abstract": "Feynman famously asserted that interference is the only real mystery in quantum mechanics (QM). It is concluded that the reason for this mystery, and thereby the related mysteries of complementarity, non-commutativity of observables, the uncertainty principle and violation of Bell's equality, is that the axioms of QM depend vitally on the continuum nature of Hilbert Space, deemed unphysical. We develop a theory of quantum physics - Rational Quantum Mechanics (RaQM) - in which Hilbert Space is gravitationally discretised. The key to solving the mysteries of QM in RaQM is a number-theoretic property of the cosine function, concealed in QM when angles range over the continuum. This number-theoretic property describes mathematically the utter indivisibility of the quantum world and implies that the laws of physics are profoundly holistic. We contrast holism with nonlocality. In theories which embrace the continuum, the violation of Bell's inequality requires the laws of physics to be either nonlocal or not realistic; both incomprehensible concepts. By contrast, holism, as embodied in Mach's Principle or in the fractal geometry of a chaotic attractor, is neither incomprehensible nor unphysical. As part of this, we solve the deepest mystery of all; why nature makes use of complex numbers."

Both methods are evaluated across three ABSA subtasks (Aspect Term Extraction (ATE), Aspect Sentiment Classification (ATSC), and Aspect Sentiment Pair Extraction (ASPE)), four SemEval datasets, and two encoder-decoder models: T5-Base and Tk-Instruct. Our results show that the agentic augmentation outperforms raw prompting in label preservation of the augmented data, especially when the tasks require aspect term generation. In addition, when combined with real data, agentic augmentation provides higher gains, consistently outperforming prompting-based generation. These benefits are most pronounced for T5-Base, while the more heavily pretrained Tk-Instruct exhibits smaller improvements.

Several types of sensors are used to capture dynamic responses and monitor changes during the operation of critical parts of complex systems. Piezoelectric (PZ) materials belong to a class of electroactive materials that convert mechanical deformation into an electrical response. For example, PZ ceramics or PVDF foils are employed for online sensing of the time history of mechanical deformation. This paper focuses on the dynamical response of a cantilever beam structure equipped with a glued PZ sensor and combines experimental and modelling approaches to achieve accurate and reliable results. The time history of the normal velocity at a point on the beam surface was recorded with a laser vibrometer during transient vibrations of the beam, triggered by the sudden removal of a mass load at the beam's free end. Simultaneously, the output voltage of the PZ sensor was measured with an electronic device. An elastodynamic model of a cantilever beam coupled with a piezoelectric sensor is introduced, along with its discretization using the finite element method. The mathematical model includes additional terms that enforce a floating-potential boundary condition to maintain a constant charge on one of the sensor's electrodes and is presented in an extended form suitable for sensitivity analysis or parameter identification. The model implementation is validated using a numerical example corresponding to the experimental setup. The computed results show good agreement with the experimental data. Furthermore, values of the Rayleigh damping parameters were identified based on the experimental measurements."

WPEM models the full profile as a probabilistic mixture density and iteratively infers component-resolved intensities while keeping peak centres Bragg-consistent, producing a continuous, physically admissible intensity representation that remains stable in heavily overlapped regions and in the presence of mixed radiation or multiple phases. We benchmark WPEM on standard reference patterns (\\ce{PbSO4} and \\ce{Tb2BaCoO5}), where it yields lower $R_{\\mathrm{p}}$/$R_{\\mathrm{wp}}$ than widely used packages (FullProf and TOPAS) under matched refinement conditions.

    "abstract": "Continuum manipulators in flexible endoscopic surgical systems offer high dexterity for minimally invasive procedures; however, accurate pose estimation and closed-loop control remain challenging due to hysteresis, compliance, and limited distal sensing. Vision-based approaches reduce hardware complexity but are often constrained by limited geometric observability and high computational overhead, restricting real-time closed-loop applicability. This paper presents a unified framework for markerless stereo 6D pose estimation and position-based visual servoing of continuum manipulators. A photo-realistic simulation pipeline enables large-scale automatic training with pixel-accurate annotations. A stereo-aware multi-feature fusion network jointly exploits segmentation masks, keypoints, heatmaps, and bounding boxes to enhance geometric observability. To enforce geometric consistency without iterative optimization, a feed-forward rendering-based refinement module predicts residual pose corrections in a single pass. A self-supervised sim-to-real adaptation strategy further improves real-world performance using unlabeled data. Extensive real-world validation achieves a mean translation error of 0.83 mm and a mean rotation error of 2.76° across 1,000 samples. Markerless closed-loop visual servoing driven by the estimated pose attains accurate trajectory tracking with a mean translation error of 2.07 mm and a mean rotation error of 7.41°, corresponding to 85% and 59% reductions compared to open-loop control, together with high repeatability in repeated point-reaching tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first fully markerless pose-estimation-driven position-based visual servoing framework for continuum manipulators, enabling precise closed-loop control without physical markers or embedded sensing."

It relies on energy-based regressors to enhance parameter observability, supports both equality and inequality priors on inertial and actuation parameters, enforces dynamically consistent disturbance projections, and augments proprioceptive measurements with energy observations to disambiguate nonlinear friction effects. To ensure scalability, we derive a parameterized equality-constrained Riccati recursion that preserves the banded structure of the problem, achieving linear complexity in the time horizon, and develop computationally efficient derivatives. Simulation studies on representative robotic systems, together with hardware experiments on a Unitree B1 equipped with a Z1 arm, demonstrate faster convergence, lower inertial and friction estimation errors, and improved contact consistency compared to forward-dynamics and decoupled identification baselines. When deployed within model predictive control frameworks, the resulting models yield measurable improvements in tracking performance during locomotion over challenging environments."

However, robots operating in real-world environments face a critical limitation: they cannot anticipate how objects move. Long-horizon mobile manipulation requires closing the gap between semantics, geometry, and kinematics. In this work, we present MoMa-SG, a novel framework for building semantic-kinematic 3D scene graphs of articulated scenes containing a myriad of interactable objects. Given RGB-D sequences containing multiple object articulations, we temporally segment object interactions and infer object motion using occlusion-robust point tracking. We then lift point trajectories into 3D and estimate articulation models using a novel unified twist estimation formulation that robustly estimates revolute and prismatic joint parameters in a single optimization pass. Next, we associate objects with estimated articulations and detect contained objects by reasoning over parent-child relations at identified opening states. We also introduce the novel Arti4D-Semantic dataset, which uniquely combines hierarchical object semantics including parent-child relation labels with object axis annotations across 62 in-the-wild RGB-D sequences containing 600 object interactions and three distinct observation paradigms. We extensively evaluate the performance of MoMa-SG on two datasets and ablate key design choices of our approach. In addition, real-world experiments on both a quadruped and a mobile manipulator demonstrate that our semantic-kinematic scene graphs enable robust manipulation of articulated objects in everyday home environments.

    "abstract": "Two widely-used non-local extensions of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), cellular DMFT (CDMFT) and the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA), both yield self-energies marred by having some unphysical properties: CDMFT yields real-space self-energies that are not translationally invariant, and DCA yields momentum-space self-energies with discontinuities in their momentum dependence. It is often desirable to remove these flaws by post-processing cluster DMFT results, using strategies called periodization for CDMFT and interpolation for DCA -- for brevity, we refer to both cases as interpolation. However, traditional interpolation approaches struggle to capture intricate structures such as hole pockets in the hole-doped square-lattice Hubbard model, as highlighted in Phys. Rev. B 105, 35117 (2022). Further, these approaches interpolate frequency-dependent functions, which may lead to causality violations. Here, we propose Liouvillian interpolation, a novel, intuitive, and robust scheme for interpolating cluster DMFT results. Our key idea is to interpolate frequency-independent matrix elements of the single-particle irreducible part of the Liouvillian, obtained from a continued-fraction expansion of the cDMFT self-energy. We demonstrate that the ingredients of such an expansion possess a more local Fourier expansion than the functions involved in traditional interpolation schemes, and that Liouvillian interpolation inherently conserves causality. We illustrate our method for the one-dimensional Hubbard model using CDMFT, and for the two-dimensional Hubbard model using four-patch DCA. For the latter, we find that L-interpolation can (depending on doping) yield Fermi and Luttinger arcs which together form a closed surface."

We then extend the notion of solution to distributional coefficients and initial data by a Friedrichs-type regularisation procedure. Within this very weak framework, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solution nets and prove consistency with the classical weak solution whenever the coefficients are regular."

    "abstract": "Meshless methods are used to solve partial differential equations by approximating differential operators at a node as a weighted sum of values at its neighbours. One of the algorithms for generating nodes suitable for meshless numerical analysis is an n-dimensional Poisson disc sampling based method. It can handle complex geometries and supports variable node density, a crucial feature for adaptive analysis. We modify this method for parallel execution using coupled spatial indexing and work distribution hypertrees. The latter is prebuilt according to the node density function, ensuring that each leaf represents a balanced work unit. Threads advance separate fronts and claim work hypertree leaves as needed while avoiding leaves neighbouring those claimed by other threads. Node placement constraints and the partially prebuilt spatial hypertree are combined to eliminate the need to lock the tree while it is being modified. Thread collision handling is managed by the work hypertree at the leaf level, drastically reducing the number of required mutex acquisitions for point insertion collision checks. We explore the behaviour of the proposed algorithm and compare the performance with existing attempts at parallelisation and consider the requirements for adapting the developed algorithm to distributed systems."

    "abstract": "Future vehicular networks require continuous connectivity to serve highly mobile users in urban environments. To mitigate the coverage limitations of fixed terrestrial macro base stations (MBS) under non line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions, fleets of unmanned aerial base stations (UABSs) can be deployed as aerial base stations, dynamically repositioning to track vehicular users and traffic hotspots in coordination with the terrestrial network. This paper addresses cooperative multi-agent trajectory design under different service areas and takeoff configurations, where rapid and safe adaptation across scenarios is essential. We formulate the problem as a multi-task decentralized partially observable Markov decision process and solve it using centralized training and decentralized execution with double dueling deep Q-network (3DQN), enabling online training for real-world deployments. However, efficient exploration remains a bottleneck, with conventional strategies like $ε$-greedy requiring careful tuning. To overcome this, we propose the multi-agent meta-advisor with advisor override (MAMO). This framework guides agent exploration through a meta-policy learned jointly across tasks. It uses a dynamic override mechanism that allows agents to reject misaligned guidance when the advisor fails to generalize to a specific scenario. Simulation results across three realistic urban scenarios and multiple takeoff configurations show that MAMO achieves faster convergence and higher returns than tuned $ε$-greedy baselines, outperforming both an advisor-only ablation and a single generalized policy. Finally, we demonstrate that the learned UABS fleet significantly improves network performance compared to deployments without aerial support."

However, their intrinsic biological variability and nonlinearity pose significant challenges for controllability and predictability. To address these issues, this study investigates the application of supervised learning, a form of machine learning, to model and predict the behavior of biohybrid machines (BHMs), focusing on a muscle ring anchored on flexible polymer pillars. First, static prediction models (i.e., random forest and neural network regressors) are trained to estimate the maximum exerted force achieved from input variables such as muscle sample, electrical stimulation parameters, and baseline exerted force. Second, a dynamic modeling framework, based on Long Short-Term Memory networks, is developed to serve as a digital twin, replicating the time series of exerted forces observed in response to electrical stimulation. Both modeling approaches demonstrate high predictive accuracy. The best performance of the static models is characterized by R2 of 0.9425, whereas the dynamic model achieves R2 of 0.9956. The static models can enable optimization of muscle actuator performance for targeted applications and required force outcomes, while the dynamic model provides a foundation for developing robustly adaptive control strategies in future biohybrid robotic systems."

BRachytherapy via artificially Intelligent GOMEA-Heuristic based Treatment planning (BRIGHT) generates multiple treatment plans, each with a different trade-off between tumour coverage and organs-at-risk sparing. BRIGHT was recently extended to cervical cancer brachytherapy. In this study, we present a novel, custom-developed graphical user interface (GUI) that enables plan navigation, pairwise comparisons, dose distribution visualisation, and possibility for adjustments - essential for efficient clinical use of BRIGHT. End-user validation of BRIGHT with the dedicated GUI was conducted for cervical cancer brachytherapy by emulating clinical practice in ten previously treated patients. A multidisciplinary brachytherapy team used BRIGHT to create new treatment plans. GUI usability was assessed using the System Usability Scale (SUS). BRIGHT plan quality was compared to clinical practice via blinded one-on-one comparisons. The GUI offered helpful features for plan navigation and evaluation, giving users quick insight into whether planning aims are achievable and what treatment options are available. The overall SUS score was 83.3, indicating an 'excellent' system. BRIGHT outperformed clinical practice in five out of ten patients regarding the coverage-sparing trade-off and performed equally well in the remaining five. The BRIGHT plan was preferred over the clinical plan in eight out of ten patients, four of which showed clinically relevant differences. The clinical plan was preferred in two patients, neither with clinically relevant differences. In conclusion, BRIGHT, with its dedicated GUI, is a clinically viable and user-friendly tool for treatment planning in cervical cancer brachytherapy."

    "abstract": "Quantum stochastic processes are widely used in describing open quantum systems and in the context of quantum foundations. Physically relevant quantum stochastic processes driven by multiplicative colored noise are generically non-Markovian and analytically intractable. Further, their Markovian limits are generically inequivalent when using either the Ito or Stratonovich conventions for the same quantum stochastic processes. We introduce a quantum noise homogenization scheme that temporally coarse-grains non-Markovian, colored-noise driven quantum stochastic processes and connects them to their effective white-noise (Markovian) limits. Our approach uses a novel phase-space augmentation that maps the non-Markovian dynamics into a higher dimensional Markovian system and then applies a controlled perturbative coarse-graining scheme in the characteristic time scales of the noise. This allows an explicit analytical algorithm to derive effective Markovian generators with renormalized coefficients and enables imposing various physical constraints on them. We thus resolve the Ito-Stratonovich ambiguity for multiplicative colored noise driven quantum stochastic processes, wherein we show that their consistent Markovian limit corresponds to the Stratonovich convention with renormalized coefficients as well as Ito correction terms. By assuming their Markovian limit unravels completely positive, trace-preserving maps, we further characterize a physically relevant family of non-Markovian quantum stochastic processes driven by multiplicative colored noise."

Unlike probabilistic zero forcing, RZF is governed by in-neighborhood structure and can fail to propagate globally due to directionality. The model extends naturally to weighted directed graphs by replacing neighbor counts with incoming weight proportions. We study the expected propagation time of RZF, establishing monotonicity properties with respect to enlarging the initial blue set and increasing weights on edges out of initially blue vertices, as well as invariances that relate weighted and unweighted dynamics. Exact values and sharp asymptotics are obtained for several families of directed graphs, including arborescences, stars, paths, cycles, and spiders, and we derive tight extremal bounds for unweighted directed graphs in terms of basic parameters such as order, degree, and radius. We conclude with an application to an empirical input-output network, illustrating how expected propagation time under RZF yields a dynamic, process-based notion of centrality in directed weighted systems."

In deployed settings, long contexts are typically managed through compaction in token space via summarization. However, summarization can be highly lossy, substantially harming downstream performance. Recent work on Cartridges has shown that it is possible to train highly compact KV caches in latent space that closely match full-context performance, but at the cost of slow and expensive end-to-end optimization. This work describes an approach for fast context compaction in latent space through Attention Matching, which constructs compact keys and values to reproduce attention outputs and preserve attention mass at a per-KV-head level. We show that this formulation naturally decomposes into simple subproblems, some of which admit efficient closed-form solutions. Within this framework, we develop a family of methods that significantly push the Pareto frontier of compaction time versus quality, achieving up to 50x compaction in seconds on some datasets with little quality loss."

    "abstract": "Entanglement is a central and subtle feature of quantum theory, whose structure and operational behavior can change dramatically when additional physical constraints, such as symmetries or superselection rules, are imposed. Such constraints can give rise to striking and counter-intuitive phenomena, including local broadcasting of entangled states and failures of entanglement monogamy. These effects naturally arise in tomographically nonlocal theories (like real quantum theory, twirled worlds, or fermionic quantum theory), where composite systems possess holistic degrees of freedom that are inaccessible to local measurements. In this work, we study entanglement in such theories within the framework of generalized probabilistic theories. We show that the failure of tomographic locality leads to two qualitatively distinct forms of entanglement, which we term $\\textit{tomographically-local}$ entanglement and $\\textit{tomographically-nonlocal}$ entanglement. We analyze the operational consequences of this distinction, proving that tomographically-nonlocal entanglement is useless for Bell nonlocality, steering, and teleportation, but sufficient for dense coding and perfectly secure data hiding. This framework clarifies the origin of several previously puzzling features of entanglement that arise when tomographic locality fails, as can happen even in quantum theory when one considers fermions or fundamental superselection rules."

Word-level embeddings exhibit uniformly contracting dynamics with no positive LE, while answer-level embeddings, in spite of the overall contraction, display a number of positive LEs and higher-dimensional attractors. The resulting LE spectra robustly separate psychotic from healthy speech, while differentiation within the psychotic group is not statistically significant overall, despite a tendency of the most severe cases to occupy distinct dynamical regimes.

We evaluate the impact of input representation by comparing networks trained on raw measurements versus preprocessed features derived from a linearization method. Simulation results show that the learning-based approach consistently outperforms existing linear methods under RSS noise across all noise levels, and matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance under increasing AoA noise.

TNQE first represents each classical input via a TN decomposition and then compiles the resulting tensor cores into an encoding circuit through two complementary core-to-circuit strategies. To make this compilation trainable while respecting the unitary nature of quantum operations, we introduce a unitary-aware constraint that parameterizes TN cores as learnable block unitaries, enabling them to be directly optimized and directly encoded as quantum operators. The proposed TNQE framework enables explicit control over circuit depth and qubit resources, allowing the construction of shallow, resource-efficient circuits. Across a range of benchmarks, TNQE achieves encoding circuits as shallow as $0.04\\times$ the depth of amplitude encoding, while naturally scaling to high-resolution images ($256 \\times 256$) and demonstrating practical feasibility on real quantum hardware."

The control scheme is divided into two steps. The first one is dedicated to the estimation of the leader state by each follower in a distributed way and in a fixed-time. Then, based on the estimate of the leader state, each follower computes its control law to track the leader in a fixed-time. In this paper, two control strategies are investigated and compared to solve the two mentioned steps. The first one is an autonomous protocol which ensures a fixed-time convergence for the observer and for the controller parts where the Upper Bound of the Settling-Time (UBST) is set a priory by the user. Then, the previous strategy is redesigned using time-varying gains to obtain a non-autonomous protocol. This enables to obtain less conservative estimates of the UBST while guaranteeing that the time-varying gains remain bounded. Some numerical examples show the effectiveness of the proposed consensus protocols."

TV regularization has a long history in regression and density estimation, including results on $L^2$ and KL divergence convergence rates. Here, we revisit this task using the Highly Adaptive Lasso (HAL) framework. We formulate a HAL-based maximum likelihood estimator (HAL-MLE) using the log-spline link function from \\citet{kooperberg1992logspline}, and show that in the univariate setting the bounded sectional variation norm assumption underlying HAL coincides with the classical bounded TV assumption. This equivalence directly connects HAL-MLE to existing TV-penalized approaches such as local adaptive splines \\citep{mammen1997locally}. We establish three new theoretical results: (i) the univariate HAL-MLE is asymptotically linear, (ii) it admits pointwise asymptotic normality, and (iii) it achieves uniform convergence at rate $n^{-(k+1)/(2k+3)}$ up to logarithmic factors for the smoothness order $k \\geq 1$. These results extend existing results from \\citet{van2017uniform}, which previously guaranteed only uniform consistency without rates when $k=0$. We will include the uniform convergence for general dimension $d$ in the follow-up work of this paper. The intention of this paper is to provide a unified framework for the TV-penalized density estimation methods, and to connect the HAL-MLE to the existing TV-penalized methods in the univariate case, despite that the general HAL-MLE is defined for multivariate cases."

A data-processing framework, called SeaSpoofFinder, available here: seaspooffinder.github.io/ais_data, was developed to ingest and post-process global AIS streams and to detect candidate anomalies through a two-stage procedure. In Stage 1, implausible position jumps are identified using kinematic and data-quality filters; in Stage 2, events are retained only when multiple vessels exhibit spatially consistent source and target clustering, thereby reducing false positives from single-vessel artifacts. The resulting final potential spoofing events (FPSEs) reveal recurrent patterns in several regions, including the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, Murmansk, Moscow, and the Haifa area, with affected footprints that can span large maritime areas. The analysis also highlights recurring non-spoofing artifacts (e.g., back-to-port jumps and data gaps) that can still pass heuristic filters in dense traffic regions. These results indicate that AIS-based monitoring can provide useful evidence for identifying and characterizing potential spoofing activity at scale, while emphasizing that AIS-only evidence does not provide definitive attribution."

    "abstract": "A pinching antennas (PAs)-aided integrated sensing and multicast communication framework is proposed. In this framework, the communication performance is measured by the multicast rate considering max-min fairness. Moreover, the sensing performance is quantified by the Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound (BCRB), where a Gauss-Hermite quadrature-based approach is proposed to compute the Bayesian Fisher information matrix. Based on these metrics, PA placement is optimized under three criteria: communications-centric (C-C), sensing-centric (S-C), and Pareto-optimal designs. These designs are investigated in two scenarios: the single-PA case and the multi-PA case. 1) For the single-PA case, a closed-form solution is derived for the location of the C-C transmit PA, while the S-C design yields optimal transmit and receive PA placements that are symmetric about the target location. Leveraging this geometric insight, the Pareto-optimal design is solved by enforcing this PA placement symmetry, thereby reducing the joint transmit and receive PA placement to the transmit PA optimization. 2) For the general multi-PA case, the PA placements constitute a highly non-convex optimization problem. To solve this, an element-wise alternating optimization-based method is proposed to sequentially optimize all PA placements for the S-C design, and is further incorporated into an augmented Lagrangian (AL) framework and a rate-profile formulation to solve the C-C and Pareto-optimal design problems, respectively. Numerical results show that: i) PASS substantially outperforms fixed-antenna baselines in both multicast rate and sensing accuracy; ii) the multicasting gain becomes more pronounced as the user density increases; and iii) the sensing accuracy improves with the number of deployed PAs."

In this work, we study the behavior of LLMs as zero-shot annotators for Bangla hate speech, a task where even human agreement is challenging, and annotator bias can have serious downstream consequences. We conduct a systematic benchmark of 17 LLMs using a unified evaluation framework. Our analysis uncovers annotator bias and substantial instability in model judgments. Surprisingly, increased model scale does not guarantee improved annotation quality--smaller, more task-aligned models frequently exhibit more consistent behavior than their larger counterparts. These results highlight important limitations of current LLMs for sensitive annotation tasks in low-resource languages and underscore the need for careful evaluation before deployment."

    "abstract": "Accurate estimation of propagation characteristics of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is crucial for predicting their geoeffectiveness. Stereoscopic techniques to study the kinematics of CMEs generally have been carried out using remote sensing observations from three viewpoints, i.e. STEREO-A, STEREO-B, and SOHO. Since the loss of STEREO-B in 2014, stereoscopic reconstruction of CMEs has been restricted to the observations from only two viewpoints, i.e., STEREO-A and SOHO. When the angle of separation between STEREO-A and SOHO is small, it leads to larger uncertainties in the CME kinematics derived using stereoscopic techniques. In this paper, we demonstrate how this limitation can be addressed and how uncertainties in the estimation of CME kinematics and propagation direction can be reduced. For this purpose, we selected the CME of April 21, 2023, which was observed by two spacecraft, i.e. STEREO-A and SOHO, separated by a small 10 degree angle. Using the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model on the remote-sensing observations near the Sun and the Advanced Drag-Based Model (ADBM) in the heliosphere, we estimated the arrival time of the CME at different locations in the heliosphere and compared it with the actual arrival time obtained from the in-situ measurements taken by three spacecraft, BepiColombo, STEREO-A and Wind. Our analysis reveals a directional uncertainty of approx 20 degree from observations from two viewpoints. These uncertainties significantly affect the arrival-time prediction of the CME. We consider the actual chronology of CME arrival times at STEREO-A and Wind as critical parameters to constrain the direction of propagation, which serves as a key input in the ADBM. The chronology of arrival of the CME ejecta at STEREO-A, which is 4.5 hrs earlier than at Wind, proved essential for resolving directional ambiguities in the GCS reconstruction model"

In real-world edge detection (e.g., floor-plan walls, satellite roads/buildings, and medical organ boundaries), crispness and data efficiency are crucial, yet producing crisp raw edge maps with limited training samples remains challenging. Although image-generation foundation models perform well on many downstream tasks, their pretrained priors for data-efficient transfer and iterative refinement for high-frequency detail preservation remain underexploited for edge detection. To enable crisp and data-efficient edge detection using these capabilities, we introduce an edge-specialized adaptation of image-generation foundation models. To better specialize the foundation model for edge detection, we incorporate an edge-oriented objective with an efficient pixel-space loss. At inference, we introduce guidance based on unconditional dynamics, enabling a single model to control the edge density through a guidance scale. Experiments on BSDS500, NYUDv2, BIPED, and CubiCasa compare against state-of-the-art methods and show consistent gains, particularly under no-post-processing crispness evaluation and with limited training data."

Motivated by the recent observation of superconductivity in nano-flaked IrTe$_2$, we investigate the superconductivity in strain-stabilized two-dimensional (2D) limit of IrTe$_2$ by combining density-functional theory with mean-field solution of spin-fluctuation mediated pairing interaction on a symmetry-constrained ${\\bf k}\\cdot{\\bf p}$ model. The spin-orbit coupled band structure shows $Γ$-centred Fermi sheets with coexistence of band-selective Rashba-like (in-plane) and Ising-like (out-of-plane) superconductivity. Remarkably, the superconducting gaps are odd in spin, orbital, and momentum channels despite the presence of global inversion symmetry. Fermi surface topologies and little-group symmetry enforce distinct irreducible representations to the Rashba and Ising channels, forbidding their mixing. Our findings open up a symmetry-based route to multichannel superconductivity in 2D transition-metal dichalcogenides with unique functionalities."

In complete interaction graphs, optimal space-time trade-offs are known for the leader election and exact majority problems. However, it has remained open if other graph families exhibit similar space-time complexity trade-offs, as existing lower bound techniques do not extend beyond highly dense graphs. In this work, we show that -- unlike in complete graphs -- population protocols on bounded-degree trees do not exhibit significant asymptotic space-time trade-offs for leader election and exact majority. For these problems, we give constant-space protocols that have near-optimal worst-case expected stabilisation time. These new protocols achieve a linear speed-up compared to the state-of-the-art. Our results are based on two novel protocols, which we believe are of independent interest. First, we give a new fast self-stabilising 2-hop colouring protocol for general interaction graphs, whose stabilisation time we bound using a stochastic drift argument. Second, we give a self-stabilising tree orientation algorithm that builds a rooted tree in optimal time on any tree. As a consequence, we can use simple constant-state protocols designed for directed trees to solve leader election and exact majority fast. For example, we show that ``directed'' annihilation dynamics solve exact majority in $O(n^2 \\log n)$ steps on directed trees."

    "abstract": "This paper re-evaluates the relationship between the observed sunward electron cutoff energy and the depth of the Sun's global electrostatic potential. It investigates whether taking into account the effects of local traps formed by magnetic fluctuations provides an alternative explanation for the observed electron deficit. The fluctuations of the highly variable interplanetary magnetic field form a series of shallow magnetic mirror traps that move at approximately the speed of the solar wind. The study investigates the dynamics of electrons as they move outward against an attractive solar electrostatic potential and interact with these traps. By following the motion of the electrons using first-principles calculations, we assess the effect of the traps on the velocity distribution of the particles. Electrons that escape the local trap continue to lose energy as they move outward until they are eventually captured by subsequent traps, preventing them from returning to the observer as sunward-moving particles. We derive a mathematical expression for the cutoff velocity, defined as the limit beyond which particles can no longer overtake the outer endpoint of a local trap. It turns out that the observed cutoff energy characterizes only the local potential drop within a trap, rather than the total depth of the Sun's potential well. The true potential well can be significantly deeper, scaled by the ratio of the radial distance from the Sun to the trap size. Furthermore, electrons captured by these moving traps contribute to the formation of the solar wind core population. The Sun's electrostatic potential is a more significant factor in solar wind acceleration than previously interpreted from cutoff data. The interaction between electrostatic deceleration and moving magnetic traps provides a new framework for understanding the origin and behavior of the solar wind core electrons."

By utilizing GNNs, the proposed model, termed the Collision-captured Network (CN), integrates data assimilation (DA) techniques to effectively learn and predict sea ice dynamics under various conditions. The approach was validated using synthetic data, both with and without observed data points, and it was found that the model accelerates the simulation of trajectories without compromising accuracy. This advancement offers a more efficient tool for forecasting in marginal ice zones (MIZ) and highlights the potential of combining machine learning with data assimilation for more effective and efficient modeling."

This provides an equity-based characterization of the MEWP mechanism, and complements the efficiency-based characterization of the MWEP mechanism known in the literature."

Micron-scale photochromic hybrid films present a particularly attractive platform for these applications, combining straightforward preparation with substantial optical modulation and scalability for high-volume fabrication. However, rational design of such films remains fundamentally constrained by the absence of well-defined optical constants. Unlike homogeneous thin films, micron-scale hybrid photochromic materials comprise active particles dispersed non-uniformly within polymer matrices. Conventional first-principles electromagnetic simulations face substantial computational costs and discrepancies between simulated and experimental particle distributions. Here, we introduce a data-driven framework that extracts effective optical constants directly from minimal experimental transmittance measurements. Our dual-state effective model approximates the complex inhomogeneous photochromic layer as a compressed homogeneous medium characterized by pseudo-refractive indices and pseudo-extinction coefficients for both pristine and UV-irradiated states. Through systematic optimization against experimental data from tungsten oxide-polyvinylpyrrolidone hybrid films, we determine wavelength-dependent pseudo-optical constants and compression ratios that enable accurate prediction of optical modulation within the tested thickness range. Our methodology establishes a framework for engineering hybrid photochromic systems and demonstrates how data-driven modeling can overcome limitations in characterizing complex nanostructured materials."

In addition, we propose an image measurement method to easily acquire the calibration information between the camera coordinate system and the fork coordinate system necessary to apply the measurements in the camera coordinate system to the fork control. In the experiment space, a wide-angle camera was fixed at the backrest of a reach type forklift. The wide-angle images taken by placing a pallet in front of the camera were processed. As a result of evaluating the error by comparing the image measurement value with the hand measurement value when changing the pitch inclination angle of the pallet, the relative height of the pallet and the fork, and whether the pallet is loaded or not, it was confirmed that the error was within the allowable range for safely inserting the fork."

    "abstract": "Training LLMs as interactive agents for multi-turn decision-making remains challenging, particularly in long-horizon tasks with sparse and delayed rewards, where agents must execute extended sequences of actions before receiving meaningful feedback. Most existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches model LLM agents as flat policies operating at a single time scale, selecting one action at each turn. In sparse-reward settings, such flat policies must propagate credit across the entire trajectory without explicit temporal abstraction, which often leads to unstable optimization and inefficient credit assignment. We propose HiPER, a novel Hierarchical Plan-Execute RL framework that explicitly separates high-level planning from low-level execution. HiPER factorizes the policy into a high-level planner that proposes subgoals and a low-level executor that carries them out over multiple action steps. To align optimization with this structure, we introduce a key technique called hierarchical advantage estimation (HAE), which carefully assigns credit at both the planning and execution levels. By aggregating returns over the execution of each subgoal and coordinating updates across the two levels, HAE provides an unbiased gradient estimator and provably reduces variance compared to flat generalized advantage estimation. Empirically, HiPER achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging interactive benchmarks, reaching 97.4\\% success on ALFWorld and 83.3\\% on WebShop with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (+6.6\\% and +8.3\\% over the best prior method), with especially large gains on long-horizon tasks requiring multiple dependent subtasks.

Literary theory identifies uncertainty as a necessary condition for creative expression, while current alignment strategies steer models away from uncertain outputs to ensure factuality and reduce hallucination. We formalize this tension by quantifying the \"uncertainty gap\" between human-authored stories and model-generated continuations. Through a controlled information-theoretic analysis of 28 LLMs on high-quality storytelling datasets, we demonstrate that human writing consistently exhibits significantly higher uncertainty than model outputs. We find that instruction-tuned and reasoning models exacerbate this trend compared to their base counterparts; furthermore, the gap is more pronounced in creative writing than in functional domains, and strongly correlates to writing quality. Achieving human-level creativity requires new uncertainty-aware alignment paradigms that can distinguish between destructive hallucinations and the constructive ambiguity required for literary richness."

Here, we show that non-conservative motion of interfacial dislocations is intrinsically coupled to the nucleation and lateral propagation of nanoscale growth ledges, providing a defect-based kinetic description of lath growth. Phase-field-crystal simulations of a prototypical face-centered cubic/body-centered cubic (FCC/BCC) transformation resolve strongly anisotropic interface kinetics: the end face advances continuously along the lath long axis, whereas facets thicken by discrete ledge sweeps accompanied by mixed glide-climb reactions in a closed dislocation network. Crystallographic analyses predict the dislocation arrangements, rationalize the anisotropy via the geometry of misfit localization, and show how dislocation motion accommodates the transformation strain. In situ transmission electron microscopy of austenite precipitates in duplex stainless steel captures rapid ledge propagation on habit planes, consistent with the predicted migration mode. Our results bridge point-defect transport, dislocation reactions, and interface mobility, enabling quantitative, transferable predictions of precipitate morphology evolution."

A prototype featuring a cluster state cache and an intent analyzer (using AWS Bedrock) was developed. Empirical evaluation demonstrated high LLM parsing accuracy (>95% Subset Accuracy on an evaluation ground-truth dataset) for top-tier models like Amazon Nova Pro/Premier and Mistral Pixtral Large, significantly outperforming a baseline engine. Scheduling quality tests across six scenarios showed the prototype achieved superior or equivalent placement compared to standard Kubernetes configurations, particularly excelling in complex and quantitative scenarios and handling conflicting soft preferences. The results validate using LLMs for accessible scheduling but highlight limitations like synchronous LLM latency, suggesting asynchronous processing for production readiness. This work confirms the viability of semantic soft affinity for simplifying workload orchestration."

    "abstract": "Dockless micromobility systems provide essential flexibility for urban mobility but face significant operational challenges, primarily the supply-demand imbalance where vehicles are unavailable in high-demand areas while remaining idle elsewhere. Although significant research has been conducted in the literature to address this imbalance using spatial optimization models such as the Maximal Covering Location Problem (MCLP), they often fail to accurately model users' walking behavior to access a vehicle. Specifically, existing approaches neglect the combined influence of distance and topographical factors such as slope, leading to suboptimal vehicle placement. This paper proposes a novel Walking Behavior-Based MCLP (WB-MCLP) model. This approach integrates a more realistic representation of user behavior by simultaneously modeling walking characteristics as a function of both distance and slope to optimize vehicle deployment. The proposed WB-MCLP was validated using historical ride data from stationless shared e-scooter systems and benchmarked against existing models, including Distance Tolerance MCLP (DT-MCLP) and slope-aware variant (DT-MCLP+S), as well as genetic algorithm (GA) and random placement (RP) strategies. Results demonstrate that the WB-MCLP achieves superior performance in 14 out of 20 tested scenarios in terms of walking distance and 11 out of 20 scenarios in terms of coverage rate, providing more effective vehicle coverage that aligns with realistic user access behavior. The findings confirm that incorporating both distance and slope provides a more accurate model of user behavior, leading to significant improvements in system efficiency. This research offers a valuable decision support framework for service providers and urban planners to enhance the performance and sustainability of dockless shared mobility systems."

Approaches using generative methods, particularly Diffusion Models, have gained attention due to their ability to model continuous robotic trajectories for planning and control. However, we show that these models struggle with long-horizon tasks that involve complex decision-making and, in general, are prone to confusing different modes of behavior, leading to failure. To remedy this, we propose to augment continuous trajectory generation by simultaneously generating a high-level symbolic plan. We show that this requires a novel mix of discrete variable diffusion and continuous diffusion, which dramatically outperforms the baselines. In addition, we illustrate how this hybrid diffusion process enables flexible trajectory synthesis, allowing us to condition synthesized actions on partial and complete symbolic conditions."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have shown promising results in the identification of malignant lung nodules from computed tomography (CT) scans. However, conventional DL models primarily rely on spatial features and often lack clinical interpretability and the ability to incorporate domain-specific priors. To address these limitations, we integrate Bayesian diameter posterior probabilistic knowledge, allowing the model to leverage the well-established correlation between nodule size and malignancy likelihood. To enhance interpretability, we introduce a new deep-texture-shape (DTS) scoring scheme that offers oncologists a transparent, component-wise justification for malignancy prediction. Furthermore, relying solely on spatial features may overlook critical textural patterns, which play a significant role in malignancy assessment. To overcome this, we utilize local binary patterns (LBP), histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), and gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) to extract rich textural features, capturing the fine-grained patterns that contribute to malignancy characterization. This multi-faceted approach not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances the model’s robustness. The proposed method, probabilistic knowledge-based decision fusion (ProKDF), is evaluated on two public datasets: the Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI) and the International Society for Optics and Photonics and American Association of Physicists in Medicine (SPIE-AAPM). It achieves an F1-score of 87.48% (95% CI: 85.93%–89.03%) and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 92.56% (95% CI: 91.70%–93.42%) on LIDC-IDRI. Our findings suggest that integrating shape-based probabilistic knowledge and texture information enhances model performance and interpretability in detecting nodule heterogeneity."

    "abstract": "Pseudo points offer dimensional alignment between camera and LiDAR data for multi-modal 3D object detection. However, the pseudo points are irregularly and densely distributed, while LiDAR point distribution becomes sparse. Because the aliasing of different distributions can lead to redundancy or deficiency in objects, thereby causing size errors. Existing methods neglect the factor of consistent distribution representation across modalities, which compromises performance. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-phase consolidated fusion (MPCF) framework, a multimodal network favoring consistent feature distribution for 3D object detection. Specifically, we propose a region fusion strategy with cross-modal distribution alignment. This strategy utilizes matrix interactions and parameter sharing to align the inherent spatial distributions of each modality. Subsequently, multiple identical layers are employed to refine the channel distribution. This process organizes the features distribution from different modalities into a consistent representation. Furthermore, we restructured the pseudo-point branch, where conservative color weighting and extraction minimize interference with the feature distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on the KITTI and nuScenes benchmarks have demonstrated the remarkable performance and efficiency of MPCF. In the KITTI 3D detection test leaderboard of car, the MPCF has achieved 1st place among all single-use data methods.

To enhance information freshness while saving energy, we formulate a joint optimization problem to minimize the weighted sum of average age of information (AoI) and total energy consumption by jointly optimizing task offloading decisions, resource allocation, and AIRS configuration including its deployment position, phase shifts, and panel size, subject to offloading quality and computing deadline constraints. To tackle the resulting mixed-integer and nonconvex problem, we develop a hierarchical optimization framework based on the objective priority and variable coupling relations. Under this framework, the problem is solved in two stages using quadratic penalty, numerical analysis, and convex optimization techniques. Specifically, an AoI-aware task offloading policy is first designed to maximize information freshness; subsequently, given the obtained offloading policy, an AIRS configuration and resource allocation scheme is proposed to minimize energy consumption. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms benchmark schemes in reducing both AoI and energy consumption, while exhibiting superior convergence performance."

Improving the vertical resolution of seismic data using deep learning methods often encounters challenges related to unrealistic outputs and limited generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that improves the fidelity and generalization of seismic super-resolution. Our approach begins with the generation of realistic synthetic training data that aligns with the structural and amplitude characteristics of field surveys. We then introduce an enhanced 2D network with 3D awareness, which builds on the 2D Swin-Transformer and 3D convolution blocks to effectively capture 3D spatial features while maintaining computational efficiency. This network addresses the limitations of traditional 2D approaches by reducing stitching artifacts and improving spatial consistency. Finally, we develop a prior-informed fine-tuning strategy using field data without the need for labels, which incorporates a self-supervised data consistency loss and a spectral matching loss based on prior knowledge. This strategy ensures that the super-resolution results preserve the original low frequency information while yielding a spectral distribution as expected. Experiments on multiple field datasets demonstrate the robustness and generalization capability of our method, making it a practical solution for seismic resolution enhancement in diverse field datasets."

    "abstract": "Recently, the integration of the efficient feed-forward scheme into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has been actively explored. However, most existing methods focus on sparse view reconstruction of small regions and cannot produce eligible whole-scene reconstruction results in terms of either quality or efficiency. In this paper, we propose FreeSplat++, which focuses on extending the generalizable 3DGS to become an alternative approach to large-scale indoor whole-scene reconstruction, which has the potential of significantly accelerating the reconstruction speed and improving the geometric accuracy. To facilitate whole-scene reconstruction, we initially propose the Low-cost Cross-View Aggregation framework to efficiently process extremely long input sequences. Subsequently, we introduce a carefully designed pixel-wise triplet fusion method to incrementally aggregate the overlapping 3D Gaussian primitives from multiple views, adaptively reducing their redundancy. Furthermore, given the fused 3DGS primitives with accumulated weights after the fusion step, we propose a weighted floater removal strategy that can effectively reduce floaters, which serves as an explicit depth fusion approach that is tailored for generalizable 3DGS methods and becomes crucial in whole-scene reconstruction. After the feed-forward reconstruction of 3DGS primitives, we investigate a depth-regularized per-scene fine-tuning process. Leveraging the dense, multi-view consistent depth maps obtained during the feed-forward prediction phase for an extra constraint, we refine the entire scene's 3DGS primitive to enhance rendering quality while preserving geometric accuracy. Extensive experiments confirm that our FreeSplat++ significantly outperforms existing generalizable 3DGS methods, especially in whole scene reconstructions. Compared to conventional per-scene optimized 3DGS approaches, our method with depth-regularized per-scene fine-tuning demonstrates substantial improvements in reconstruction accuracy and a notable reduction in training time."

    "abstract": "In this letter, the design of a bandpass filter (BPF) based on substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) filter with sharp roll-off rate and wide stopband is proposed. The frequency selectivity of this SIW-based BPF is enhanced by loading periodic rectangular resonant slots etched on its top metal surface. Bandstop rejection microstrip structures are incorporated at the output end of the BPF to suppress the harmonics outside the passband. This design method is validated with a C-band bandpass filter incorporating an SIW cavity and four units of cycle-mirrored rectangular resonant slots. The measured S-parameters of the designed filter agree with the simulated ones. Leveraging the high-Q SIW cavity and periodic resonant units, the designed filter has achieved desired performance in terms of low insertion loss, sharp roll-off rate and wide stopband."

    "abstract": "The growing use of neural networks in vital industries including healthcare, banking, and government has increased worries about transparency, accountability, and adherence to international laws. There are a number of Responsible AI methods, but they frequently don't have a cohesive system in place to match technological design with moral and legal requirements at every stage of the model lifespan. In this research, we present the Regulation-Aware Neural Network Lifecycle (RANNL), a new five-stage paradigm that directly integrates explainability, bias mitigation, and real-time compliance tracking into neural network development. The Compliance Scoring System (CS) in RANNL, in contrast to previous methods, statistically assesses models according to their interpretability, fairness, and regulatory preparedness. The EU AI Act, UNESCO AI Ethics Recommendations, and OECD AI Principles are just a few of the international policies that are linked to each step of the lifespan by a dynamic Regulation Mapping Matrix.Using deep learning architectures and regulatory toolkits like AI Fairness 360, Captum, and SHAP, we apply RANNL to a real-world healthcare prediction problem in order to validate the scheme. Model openness, fairness metrics, and compliance scores are all improved without sacrificing predictive performance in comparison to traditional ML pipelines. These findings demonstrate how well RANNL may bridge the gap between global AI governance and neural network engineering. This paper offers an interdisciplinary, quantifiable, and scalable method for creating reliable AI systems by fusing technical and policy viewpoints."

The proposed PA consists of a shunt capacitor, a series LC network in shunt, the MSR, and an impedance matching network, enabling simultaneous achievement of high efficiency, high output power, and wide bandwidth. In particular, the MSR is composed of multiple series resonance circuit with different resonance frequencies, which minimizes variations in output power and efficiency across the frequency band. To validate the wideband performance of the proposed MSR, Class-EF<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> amplifier at a center frequency of 13.56 MHz was designed using an LDMOSFET.

Using a pulse with a duty cycle of 0.5, the output power and DE are increased to 59.6–60.2 dBm and 82.8–92.0% across the band, respectively. Thermal scan showed that the temperature maintained below 70 °C even for very high output power of more than 1 kW."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of information technology, massive amounts of multimodal data such as text and images are continuously generated and accumulated at an unprecedented rate. Against this backdrop, how to accurately and efficiently obtain the information required by users from massive data through image-text retrieval has become a core challenge in the field of information retrieval. Existing retrieval models often only attempt to align retrievals within a single semantic space. In this case, the probability of incorrect retrieval increases with the growth of data volume. This paper proposes an alignment method called MPCL(Multi-Plane Contrastive Learning), which tries to project data into different query vectors through cross-attention, enabling data alignment in multiple semantic spaces, thereby greatly improving the accuracy of retrieval. Experimental results show that the retrieval performance of the model improves as the number of query vectors increases."

    "abstract": "The stability evaluation of surrounding rock is a core issue in the safety protection of underground engineering, essentially involving the study of system complexity characterized by multi-factor coupling and non-linearity. Given the limitations of traditional evaluation methods in terms of indicator compatibility, dynamic adaptability, and quantitative expression accuracy, this paper proposes a fractal-interpolation comprehensive evaluation model. First, five key control indicators are selected based on the principles of engineering geomechanics. Second, the fractal characteristic parameters of each indicator are determined using the box-counting dimension method from fractal theory, and an indicator-rating correlation matrix is established through the maximum likelihood criterion. Then, a fractal interpolation function is constructed to transform multi-dimensional indicators into a single fractal dimension evaluation index. Finally, a mapping relationship model between evaluation grades and fractal characteristic values is established. Taking an underground project in a granite area of Tibet as an example, the evaluation results of this method are not only consistent with traditional methods but also enable fine ranking of samples within the same grade through quantitative scoring. The study confirms that this model, by integrating fractal geometric features and interpolation approximation algorithms, effectively addresses the challenges of multi-source uncertainty factor fusion and dynamic evolution law characterization, providing a more accurate basis for decision-making in engineering practice."

    "abstract": "Phishing remains one of the most pervasive and effective techniques in real-world cyberattacks, leveraging human trust as the weakest link in security. Phishing attacks exploit fast, intuitive judgments. Drawing on the Dual Process Theories of Higher Cognition (DPT) of Evans and Stanovich, this original study investigates how cognitive strategies in chess can be applied to cybersecurity threat detection. In this research, chess players significantly outperform non-chess players at phishing detection, building on prior work where the two populations' cognitive abilities, such as cognitive reflection and planning, were studied. Using principles from Signal Detection Theory (SDT), the enhanced accuracy exhibited by chess players in identifying phishing emails appears more attributable to a generalized predisposition toward increased threat anticipation than to a domain-specific capacity to reliably discriminate between phishing and legitimate emails. Framed within the context of the Dual Process Theory and Signal Detection Theory, this perspective offers a novel insight into the cognitive mechanisms underlying cybersecurity decision-making, highlighting a potential role for chess-based cognitive expertise in phishing detection."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel lightweight framework for identifying key events and critical paths in dynamic multiagent system analysis by integrating complex network theory with multi-attribute decision making. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on macro-level statistics or limited centrality measures, our method constructs a comprehensive temporal weighted network from agent-event interactions, computes five complementary centrality dimensions (Degree, Betweenness, Closeness, K-Shell, and PageRank), and employs an entropy-weighted TOPSIS model for dynamic multi-criteria ranking and path extraction.The proposed framework was rigorously evaluated through a two-stage experimental process. First, its general capability for key node identification was validated on a suite of diverse, established complex networks, demonstrating superior performance against several state-of-the-art baselines in propagation tasks. Second, its specific efficacy for behavioral analysis was tested on a substantial corpus of professional multi-agent system simulation records, assessing its performance across the distinct strategic dimensions of agent confrontation, technological development, and resource regulation. Expert validation with domain specialists was conducted to gauge the practical utility and actionable insight of the system’s output.Expert validation confirms the framework’s practical utility, with 83% of identified key nodes receiving professional endorsement and 76% of behavioral suggestions deemed actionable. This work establishes a reproducible benchmark for complex system behavior analytics and demonstrates the effectiveness of combining complex networks with multi-dimensional decision theory for strategic analysis in complex multi-agent environments."

The proposed algorithm employs a hybrid neural architecture that combines a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to enable fault diagnosis detection and prediction for the power switch. MLP is configured to learn the static characteristics at each time step, LSTM is simultaneously to learn the dynamic changes over time. This approach enables high accuracy classification of MOSFET gate oxide degradation, packaging related degradation and normal operating states. In addition, modeling non-linear relationships with a polynomial regression model enables effective prediction of early degradation trends preceding fault occurrence. Based on MATLAB Simulink and NASA’s Open Data-Set, normal, degraded and fault states were collected. Consequently, the proposed algorithm was demonstrated by simulation results with a small gap between training and validation losses and a diagnostic accuracy exceeding 96%."

An integrated shield structure is realized by using vias and a GND layer inside the resin substrate on which other devices can be mounted. The proposed structure could solve both the radiation problem and miniaturization. The prototype showed high rejection characteristics outside the passband, and sufficient steepness.

To address these issues, we propose Mul-DGM, a multi-modal dynamic interaction model for indoor scene recognition. Mul-DGM employs a dual-branch architecture with ResNet-50 for RGB feature extraction and Swin Transformer for normal map feature extraction. A dynamic modality interaction enhancement (DMIE) module adaptively balances modality contributions through bidirectional attention and dynamic routing, while a global adaptive cross-modal attention (GACMA) module leverages multi-head attention to effectively capture complementary characteristics across modalities. Furthermore, a multi-scale modality contrastive loss (MSMCL) is introduced to enforce semantic consistency across different scales. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that Mul-DGM achieves superior accuracy and generalization compared to state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness of the proposed modules in robust multi-modal feature fusion for indoor scene recognition."

However, the six-pulse wave voltage of the matrix rectifier makes the output voltage contain low-frequency pulsations.

This paper proposes a dispatch optimization model for VPPs based on the Humpback Whale Migration Algorithm (WMA), a metaheuristic inspired by whale migration behaviors. The model aims to minimize total operation costs while considering energy balance, generator constraints, start-up/shut-down costs, and market electricity prices. Comparative simulations demonstrate that WMA achieves faster convergence and better global search capability than traditional particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithms (GA), effectively improving the VPP’s economic operation and flexibility."

Facing to these issues, the use of PPO is made, because of its stability and the efficiency of the sample in continuous action spaces to make the adaptive redispatch decisions with the lowest operational costs and the compliance of voltage and thermal constraints. Grid2Op provides a realistic grid simulation environment of dynamic system, contingencies and operator actions where the agent learns robust policies by interactions with the environment in a sequential manner.

Using data covering the timeframe of five years (2021-2025), the objective behind this research is to understand the interdependent nature of the electric demand and different external conditions of the environment. Preliminary analysis indicates that the demand for electricity varies based on the time of the day, the season and the day of the week. Peak demand is at noon in winter at 27,000 units and declines to 22,000 units during post-midnight. Electric demand positively correlated with temperature and humidity, where a notable increase in demand was detected when temperature increased from 5°C to 8°C and when humidity increased from 60% to 66% The wind speed variation of the demand shows that the demand is less than <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$2 ~\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{s}$</tex> and higher than <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$5 ~\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{s}$</tex>.

This paper proposes a comprehensive data-driven optimization framework that leverages machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance dynamic comparator performance across key metrics. The framework introduces a four-stage pipeline comprising feature extraction from simulation and measurement data, supervised learning for offset voltage prediction, reinforcement learning (RL) for adaptive calibration, and Bayesian optimization for automated sizing of circuit components.

The proposed method incorporates three key optimization strategies: (1) the introduction of the ADown module into the backbone as a down-sampling component, which reduces parameter count while mitigating feature loss during extraction; (2) the replacement of the original neck with a more efficient ASF network, enabling effective multi-scale feature fusion; and (3) structural modifications involving the removal of the large-scale detection head and its associated neck layers, along with the addition of a P2 detection layer, which substantially improves small-object detection performance. Experimental results on the DUT ANTI-UAV dataset demonstrate that AAP2-YOLO outperforms YOLOv11n, achieving an 11.6% increase in Recall and a 9% improvement in mAP50, while simultaneously reducing parameter count by 36%. To further validate the generalization ability of the proposed model, we included additional inference experiments on the TIB-Net UAV dataset in the comparative analysis. The results further demonstrate that, for small-object detection, the proposed model achieves superior performance compared with mainstream approaches. Although inference complexity increases, the overall frame rate remains within the real-time range, making the method suitable for deployment on embedded devices."

Utilizing the publicly available HMS EEG dataset, both models are assessed on classification accuracy and computational efficiency. Results show that WaveNet outperforms CatBoost in classification accuracy, achieving a cross-validation score of 0.81 versus 0.74, though it incurs significantly higher computational cost. Conversely, CatBoost offers faster inference and enhanced model interpretability, making it more suitable for real-time clinical deployment. The study highlights key trade-offs between performance and efficiency, suggesting potential for hybrid approaches that leverage the strengths of both models to advance reliable, explainable, and scalable EEG-based epilepsy diagnosis systems."

While chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is a valuable diagnostic modality for early TB screening, the manual interpretation of radiographs often introduces variability. It depends heavily on the availability of skilled radiologists. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network (CNN) designed to classify CXR images as TB-positive or TB-negative automatically. The architecture integrates a residual-style framework comprising dual-branch convolutional layers featuring both 3 × 3 and 1 × 1 convolutions to facilitate effective feature extraction and enhance representational depth. LeakyReLU (LR) activation functions and batch normalization (BN) are employed throughout the model to improve training stability and mitigate gradient degradation. A global average pooling (GAP) layer is used for spatial dimension reduction, followed by a fully connected classification head. The model is trained and evaluated on publicly available TB CXR datasets using standard performance metrics, including accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and F1-score. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance compared to prior methods. Given its computational efficiency and reliability, the model shows promise for integration into real-time, low-resource diagnostic settings as a supportive tool for TB screening."

First, an accurate multi-GFM modeling framework is established: a control-aware dq-domain small-signal model for each converter, positive/negative-sequence impedance representations, and a network-coupled nodal-admittance formulation are integrated into a global state-space model that enables eigenvalue and participation-factor analysis. Using this framework, we identify and classify dominant oscillation modes—device-level (200–230 Hz), cluster-interaction (≈35–55 Hz), and global power oscillations (≈1–10 Hz)—and quantify how virtual inertia J, damping D, line impedance/Short-Circuit Ratio(SCR), and controller dispersion shape modal damping and energy participation.

This task is particularly important for the analysis of hormone receptors in breast cancer, where the status of the progesterone receptor (PR) plays a key role in determining the response to treatment. However, because of differences in nuclear morphology, staining intensity, and overlapping structures, nucleus segmentation in PR-IHC images is still difficult. In order to separate PR-expressing nuclei from high-resolution breast cancer histopathology images, we present an automated instance segmentation frame-work in this work that is based on the Cellpose deep learning model, supported by an entirely novel ground truth (GT) dataset produced by a hybrid pipeline. In order to create the GT, 250 high-resolution PR-IHC images with trustworthy binary nuclei masks were combined with automated segmentation (StarDist), extensive manual corrections, and multiround pathological validation. On the test set, our Cellpose-based approach consistently performs properly, achieving an average F 1 score of 0.8535, precision of 0.8882, recall of 0.8215, and IoU of 0.7445. Strong segmentation of extracted and overlapping nuclei is confirmed by visual results. This study offers a useful resource for future research in hormone receptor quantification and computational pathology, as well as the first automated segmentation benchmark for the PR-IHC dataset."

The mobile robots communicate locally, when they encounter each other in the exploring field, to share the map information to enhance the efficiency of the entire mapping system. Even if some unexplored areas remained, another shape-fitting technique will be applied to the incomplete information obtained, and it enables the system to output the most-likely environment map for the subsequent principal task, such as intended rescue mission.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have gained enormous popularity for processing and generating text. They are a subset of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) that require higher availability of graphical processing unit (GPU) resources for inference services. However, making GPU resources available in a centralized infrastructure is quite challenging. Therefore, recent works have focused on decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) to utilize idle GPU resources, enabling scalable LLM inference services across the decentralized network. These inference services may experience inherent latency (i.e., measured in time per output token (TPOT)) due to communication overhead or time between GPU resources responsible for generating consecutive tokens. The task scheduling algorithm is crucial in decentralized LLM inference services to minimize TPOT and maximize GPU resource utilization, particularly when GPU resources are constrained by computational capacity. This paper introduces two task scheduling algorithms, the improved greedy heuristic shortest path algorithm (IGHSPA) and the dynamic programming-based task scheduling algorithm (DPTSA), for decentralized LLM serving to achieve these objectives. Each task involves assigning a layer to a GPU resource, which IGHSPA and DPTSA accomplish using greedy heuristic and dynamic programming. Both algorithms are extensively simulated and compared with one of the recent algorithms, namely the greedy heuristic shortest path algorithm (GHSPA), in terms of TPOT and execution time (ET). Our simulation results demonstrate that DPTSA improves TPOT up to 47.50% and 35.50% and ET up to 99.95% and 35.00%, compared to GHSPA and IGHSPA."

However, developing high reliability in operational environments is still a significant challenge. Poor weather conditions, partial occlusion by other cars or obstacles, and the small appearance of traffic signs tend to face many challenges and fail to provide consistent detection. Such issues may reduce system performance and undermine safety-critical decisions. This model introduces SignSight, a strong deep learning framework for real time perception of traffic sign and recognition framework to address and direct these challenges through a hybrid deep learning architecture. The approach combines conventional CNNs with Keras for initial classification complemented with a YOLOv8 detection pipeline for accurate spatial localization and real-time prediction. Compared to state-of-the-art models, SignSight includes weather-robust preprocessing methods and taps into small-object detection improvements. Taking cues from recent research such as YOLO-BS and MASG-Net, our approach utilizes multiscale feature learning along with context-aware modules to enhance detection of small sized and blurred traffic signs. Our unified system reached a highest classification accuracy of 97.4%, with real-time performance ensured."

Despite the government's efforts to tackle the issue through enhanced legislation and enforcement, the challenge remains. Biak-na-Bato National Park is a protected area in the country impacted by poaching. The objective of the study is to develop a device that combines PIR sensors and cameras to detect human intrusions and alert local authorities. The collected data will be transmitted wirelessly through internet connectivity for distant observation and analysis. A web server from the ESP32 CAM Module was employed to surveil the remote area, and its incorporation into the PyCharm programming environment facilitated image analysis for the identification of unauthorized individuals. Consequently, real-time alerts and alarms were generated simultaneously, allowing users to make informed decisions regarding the need for on-site involvement. These applications served as the primary interface for assessing the security of the remote area safeguarded by the prototypes and the data gathered from the system, utilizing Arduino and Python programming languages. The system's accuracy was assessed utilizing three cameras and ten trials across six variables, yielding results ranging from 83.33 percent to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 0 0}$</tex> percent.

Moreover, all real-time testing data was systematically archived within the system, meeting the design specifications and providing a feasible solution for combating poaching activities. The results validate the system's dependability in incursion detection, data transfer, and remote monitoring, offering a cost-efficient and scalable alternative to bolster conservation initiatives in protected regions.

The study investigates the opportunity of leveraging these two technologies to provide a more efficient and transparent way of managing resources and optimizing supply chain transactions. Combining AI-based predictive models with the transparent and secure features of blockchain will allow for further in-depth analyses of demand forecasting, inventory management, production scheduling, and risk assessment which reduce inefficiencies, and enhances decision-making from end-to-end supply chain processes. We examine the roles of blockchain-based AI-powered predictive analytics to carry out different applications such as demand forecasting, fraud detection, route selection, and supplier selection, which are all key components to improve the performance of an effective supply chain operation. For cutting-edge data analysis, algorithms based on AI make predictions about future trends and behaviors in order to optimize decision-making to take place in such a way that avoids risk and maximizes the effectiveness of resource allocation. Being able to record all transactions transparently and securely on the distributed ledger of the blockchain is a powerful feature by itself that ensures the integrity of the data and increases the trust of all supply chain participants, enhancing collaboration and allowing for more accurate forecasting. In addition, the combination of these technologies provides solutions to traditional problems like counterfeiting, data manipulation, and delay in transaction confirmation. It prepares us to delve into the potential and limitations of AI and blockchain in enhancing compatibility, actual trade activity with cryptocurrencies and financial arrangements, the appropriate utilization of money related valuables and contrasts in decentralized ID and records, and secure exchanges in various settings.

However, most public datasets, such as the Waymo Open Motion Dataset and Argoverse, are collected in Western road environments and do not reflect the unique traffic patterns, infrastructure, and driving behaviors of other regions, including South Korea. This domain discrepancy leads to performance degradation when state-of-the-art models trained on Western data are deployed in different geographic contexts. In this work, we investigate the adaptability of Query-Centric Trajectory Prediction (QCNet) when transferred from U.S.-based data to Korean road environments. Using a Korean autonomous driving dataset, we compare four training strategies: zero-shot transfer, training from scratch, full fine-tuning, and encoder freezing. Experimental results demonstrate that leveraging pretrained knowledge significantly improves prediction performance. Specifically, selectively fine-tuning the decoder while freezing the encoder yields the best trade-off between accuracy and training efficiency, reducing prediction error by over 66% compared to training from scratch. This study provides practical insights into effective transfer learning strategies for deploying trajectory prediction models in new geographic domains."

    "abstract": "Recently, federated learning (FL) has gained momentum because of its capability in preserving data privacy. To conduct model training by FL, multiple clients exchange model updates with a parameter server over the Internet. To accelerate the communication speed, it has been explored to deploy a programmable switch (PS) in lieu of the parameter server to coordinate clients. The challenge to deploy the PS in FL lies in its scarce memory space, prohibiting running memory consuming aggregation algorithms on the PS, like TopK. To overcome this challenge, we propose Federated Learning In-Network Aggregation with Global TopK Model Updates (Fed-GTopK) algorithm, consisting of two phases: voting and aggregating. In the voting phase, clients efficiently upload their votes for top model updates to the PS for selecting global top ones. Note that the voting phase consumes little memory or communication resources by only exploring the sparsity of top model updates without transmitting any model update values. In the aggregating phase, clients can reach the consensus to upload global top model updates such that the PS can swiftly aggregate global top model updates in a streamline manner without consuming much memory cost. Compared with existing works, our study is the first one accelerating in-network aggregation for FL by sparsifying model updates, and hence achieving the highest compression rate and the best learning performance. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments by using public datasets to demonstrate that Fed-GTopK remarkably surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both model accuracy and communication traffic."

    "abstract": "In industrial scenarios, noise interference and feature overlap often result in blurred classification boundaries, compromising the reliability of rolling bearing fault diagnosis. An adaptive distribution-aware discriminative loss (ADADL) is introduced, through which intraclass thresholds are dynamically adjusted and interclass boundaries are optimized, thereby enhancing compactness and separability in the feature space. By integrating it with the cross-entropy loss, ADADL yields marked gains in diagnostic accuracy on both the Case Western Reserve University benchmark and real-world datasets, particularly under conditions of class imbalance and high noise. Visualization analyses further confirm its ability to sharpen clustering boundaries, suppress feature overlap, and effectively mitigate blurred decision regions."

    "abstract": "This work explores the electroluminescence performance and long-term stability of silver contact nanostructured silicon Schottky junction LEDs under prolonged DC bias. Si-based LEDs are increasingly sought for all-silicon integrated photonic circuits due to their compatibility with monolithic CMOS integration technology. Although their external quantum efficiency remains lower than that of commercial LEDs, NSi-based LEDs show promise for applications in quantum optics, including quantum random number generation and high-speed on-chip optical communication systems. While numerous studies have addressed factors influencing electroluminescence in nanostructured silicon devices, such as work function and transparency of the contact, injection, radiative recombination, and light extraction efficiencies, long-term spectral stability remains largely unexplored. A key factor is the non-stoichiometric native oxide layer that forms on nanostructured silicon and gets modified due to Joule heating under prolonged electrical bias. This alteration influences charge injection dynamics and affects overall device performance over time. In this study, we systematically investigate how this oxide layer governs injection efficiency and temporal stability of EL emission, including peak energy and intensity. A simple equivalent circuit is employed to account for current components associated with injection and heating. Our results indicate that the oxide layer modulates carrier injection as well as plays a stabilizing role in the output spectrum over extended operation. The calculated luminescence characteristics of the LEDs qualitatively align with experimental findings that offer valuable insights into mechanisms affecting the performance and reliability of silicon nanodevices."

The working electrode comprises a multilayer stack of Ag nanoparticles, multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), and Ag, capped with a Nafion–Ru(NH₃)₆³⁺/²⁺ anti-interference film. An active reduction-bias cleaning (RBC) scheme is implemented to electrochemically reduce surface silver sulfide (Ag₂S) back to metallic silver, thereby mitigating sulfur-induced electrode fouling and preserving sensor sensitivity. The sensor exhibits a linear detection range of 0.05–800 μM, a sensitivity of approximately 251.6 nA·μM⁻¹·cm⁻², and a limit of detection (LOD) of ~0.03 μM, corresponding to a 150% increase in sensitivity and a 75% reduction in LOD, respectively. The signal degradation after 20 consecutive exposures is less than 3.5%. These results demonstrate the potential of this RBC-enabled sensor for reliable, low-cost, real-time biomedical H₂S monitoring."

Nonetheless, the presence of actuator dynamics and of significant delays, particularly in the steering actuation, can significantly hamper the applicability of this technique. This article proposes an extension to an input-output linearization approach presented in the literature, which allows for including the actuator dynamics into the linearization law, and to compensate for the effect of delays and nonidealities on the linearized system, introducing a further control action, designed with the advanced gain scheduling technique. As a result, a linear time-invariant decoupled system is obtained, which allows us to design the trajectory tracking controller using linear control tools. Simulation results, based on three different vehicle simulators, ranging from a single-track model with linear and nonlinear tire models to a dual-track model, are also presented. The performance and robustness of the inner controller, composed of the linearizing law and the advanced gain scheduling controller, are thoroughly analyzed and compared with the results obtained using the former input-output linearization available in the literature. Furthermore, the results of the application of the proposed control framework as part of a trajectory tracking controller show the efficacy of the proposal."

    "abstract": "Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) collaboration constitutes an emerging paradigm for advancing autonomous driving. However, the integrated collaboration of perception, communication, and computation within V2I system remains a critical challenge. To address it, we propose a Software-Defined Network (SDN)-based collaborative approach for Autonomous Vehicle and Road Infrastructure Network (AVRIN). The architecture designates road infrastructures as road nodes and autonomous vehicles as dynamic vehicle nodes, establishing AVRIN through SDN. The control plane dynamically maintains global network topology and distributed flow tables by continuously evaluating node accessibility, while the forwarding plane is responsible for packet transmission via the OpenFlow protocol. In the perception module, road nodes divide the perception range into spatial units, whereas vehicle nodes dynamically align these units with their drivable areas across temporal sequences. Through coordinated communication and computation modules, road nodes strategically allocate dedicated bandwidth and computational resources. Building on this approach, we develop a particle swarm-based multi-objective optimization algorithm to achieve balanced co-optimization across perception, communication, and computation. Experimental validation demonstrates its superior collaborative Bird's Eye View (BEV) detection performance on the V2X-Sim 2.0 dataset, outperforming existing approaches by 10.37% in mean Average Precision. Furthermore, evaluations on the newly collected Jiading dataset, from a real-world urban roadway, confirm the approach's robustness with 1.823-second computation time under dynamic network conditions."

    "abstract": "High-precision mapping of soybeans, a globally significant oil and protein crop, has long been constrained by the limitations of traditional remote sensing methods, particularly regarding their inefficiency in fusing spatio-temporal information and suboptimal classification accuracy. Consequently, the rigorous demands of modern precision agriculture for crop monitoring have often not been adequately addressed. To address these challenges, a novel hybrid model was developed in this study for soybean identification using multi-temporal remote sensing imagery. This model is built upon an improved three-dimensional (3D) U-Net architecture, which synergistically integrates Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks and Random Forest (RF) algorithms. This integration enables the effective extraction of multi-level features and subsequent integrated classification. A notable innovation of this research involves the incorporation of the Greenness-Water Content Composite Index (GWCCI) into the feature set. GWCCI quantifies canopy greenness and water status, improving discrimination of soybean phenology. Experimental validation was conducted within the primary soybean production region of Hailun City, Heilongjiang Province. The results demonstrated that the proposed model significantly outperformed 10 baseline methods (including standard 3D U-Net, CNN, and RF) across four key metrics: Overall Accuracy (OA), User Accuracy (UA), F1-score, and Kappa coefficient. Specifically, when benchmarked against a standard 3D U-Net, the developed model exhibited a 3.2% increase in OA, a 9.3% increase in UA, a 2.6% improvement in F1-score, and a 6.4% increase in the Kappa coefficient. These quantitative improvements highlight its enhanced capability in distinguishing soybeans from background crops. Ultimately, this research not only provides a novel methodological framework for precise crop classification but also contributes a viable multi-dimensional feature fusion strategy directly applicable to crop monitoring and intelligent agricultural management."

    "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) exposes heterogeneous and resource-constrained devices to an increasingly diverse and evolving range of network attacks. Conventional centralized intrusion detection systems (IDS) and complex machine learning models often experience high computational and communication costs while lacking the capability to detect unknown threats. This paper proposes a lightweight distributed IDS framework that integrates multi-stage data compression, including feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and clustering-based sample compression, with lightweight classifiers and ensemble-based decision fusion. The framework is evaluated under two scenarios: (i) an extreme seven-client setting, where each client is trained on a single attack type, and (ii) a realistic five-client setting with heterogeneous attack distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces training cost and energy consumption while maintaining high detection performance. In the seven-client case, recall remains above 90% even with only 10% of samples retained under extreme heterogeneity, whereas in the five-client case, recall exceeds 97% under the same compression level. On the Raspberry Pi platform, total energy consumption decreases from 0.002015 kWh (without compression) to 0.000145 kWh, corresponding to a 92.8% reduction, while the prediction throughput reaches 7,117 to 173,005 samples per second across the five clients, ensuring real-time applicability. Ensemble strategies further improve robustness and enable effective detection of rare and zero-day attacks. These findings highlight the framework’s ability to balance performance, power consumption, and efficiency, making it well-suited for practical lightweight IoT deployments."

    "abstract": "This article studies the optimal cluster synchronization (OCS) problem for multiagent systems (MASs) with the unknown perturbation under a multicluster game (MCG) framework. To estimate the unknown perturbation, a novel perturbation observer nested with a parameter adaptive law is first designed. Subsequently, a coupling performance index function relevant to the synchronization error and the control policy with the quadratic form is constructed. By utilizing the distributed adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) technology with a single-critic architecture, the optimal control policy is designed by solving the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation associated with the coupling performance index function. Meanwhile, an adaptive OCS control policy with a single-critic neural network (NN) updating law is further proposed, and it is proven that the designed adaptive OCS control policy constitutes the generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) point of the MCG. Based on the Lyapunov extension theorem, all signals of the closed-loop MASs are ensured to be bounded. Finally, a simulation example is presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive OCS control method."

    "abstract": "Underwater object detection plays an important role in marine safety and defense, particularly in identifying explosive-like or hazardous materials lying on the seabed. This study proposes a knowledge distillation (KD) framework to enhance the underwater object detection performance of sonar systems by leveraging an additional sensing modality. High-resolution camera images act as the teacher modality, whereas sonar images serve as the student modality. The proposed method was designed to handle heterogeneous modalities with fundamentally different structures, resolutions, and geometric representations. A YOLOX-based detection architecture equipped with a Cross-Model Object-Level Distillation (CMOLD) module was employed to transfer the object-level knowledge from the camera to the sonar. A key motivation of this study is that sonar-based detection alone often struggles with low-contrast, ambiguous, or noisy underwater returns. Although cameras may fail in deep, dark, or turbid environments, the availability of paired camera–sonar data during training enables the sonar model to learn richer high-level feature representations that cameras naturally provide. As a result, the distilled sonar model becomes more capable of detecting targets in real-world conditions where no camera input is available at inference time. This capability is particularly valuable for defense and security applications, where Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) must operate reliably in visually degraded environments. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model improves the performance of the sonar compared to conventional sonar-only baselines and sonar-based KD methods. These findings highlight the potential of multimodal knowledge distillation to enhance the operational performance of underwater sensing systems and provide a practical solution for real-time autonomous underwater applications."

A consortium-based permissioned blockchain is an optimal solution to provide the security of healthcare data. However, ensuring privacy and scalability is important and challenging as well. For scalability, different Layer-2 blockchain approaches have been discussed.
