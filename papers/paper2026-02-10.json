    "abstract": "Equational reasoning is central to quantum circuit optimisation and verification: one replaces subcircuits by provably equivalent ones using a fixed set of rewrite rules viewed as equations. We study such reasoning through finite equational theories, presenting restricted quantum gate fragments as symmetric monoidal categories (PROPs), where wire permutations are treated as structural and separated cleanly from fragment-specific gate axioms. For six widely used near-Clifford fragments: qubit Clifford, real Clifford, Clifford+T (up to two qubits), Clifford+CS (up to three qubits) and CNOT-dihedral, we transfer the completeness results of prior work into our PROP framework. Beyond completeness, we address minimality (axiom independence). Using uniform separating interpretations into simple semantic targets, we prove minimality for several fragments (including all arities for qubit Clifford, real Clifford, and CNOT-dihedral), and bounded minimality for the remaining cases. Overall, our presentations significantly reduce rule counts compared to prior work and provide a reusable categorical framework for constructing complete and often minimal rewrite systems for quantum circuit fragments."

    "abstract": "Building on recent advances in video generation, generative video compression has emerged as a new paradigm for achieving visually pleasing reconstructions. However, existing methods exhibit limited exploitation of temporal correlations, causing noticeable flicker and degraded temporal coherence at ultra-low bitrates. In this paper, we propose Free-GVC, a training-free generative video compression framework that reformulates video coding as latent trajectory compression guided by a video diffusion prior. Our method operates at the group-of-pictures (GOP) level, encoding video segments into a compact latent space and progressively compressing them along the diffusion trajectory. To ensure perceptually consistent reconstruction across GOPs, we introduce an Adaptive Quality Control module that dynamically constructs an online rate-perception surrogate model to predict the optimal diffusion step for each GOP. In addition, an Inter-GOP Alignment module establishes frame overlap and performs latent fusion between adjacent groups, thereby mitigating flicker and enhancing temporal coherence. Experiments show that Free-GVC achieves an average of 93.29% BD-Rate reduction in DISTS over the latest neural codec DCVC-RT, and a user study further confirms its superior perceptual quality and temporal coherence at ultra-low bitrates."

    "abstract": "Clustering heterogeneous relational data remains a central challenge in graph learning, particularly when interactions involve more than two types of entities. While differentiable modularity objectives such as DMoN have enabled end-to-end community detection on homogeneous and bipartite graphs, extending these approaches to higher-order relational structures remains non-trivial. In this work, we introduce a differentiable formulation of tripartite modularity for graphs composed of three node types connected through mediated interactions. Community structure is defined in terms of weighted co-paths across the tripartite graph, together with an exact factorized computation that avoids the explicit construction of dense third-order tensors. A structural normalization at pivot nodes is introduced to control extreme degree heterogeneity and ensure stable optimization. The resulting objective can be optimized jointly with a graph neural network in an end-to-end manner, while retaining linear complexity in the number of edges. We validate the proposed framework on large-scale urban cadastral data, where it exhibits robust convergence behavior and produces spatially coherent partitions. These results highlight differentiable tripartite modularity as a generic methodological building block for unsupervised clustering of heterogeneous graphs."

For a pair of points p, q, the disjointness gap G(p; q) measures the shortfall when we optimize length over pairs of disjoint paths from p to q versus optimizing over all pairs of paths. Any spatial marginal of G is simply the gap between the top two lines in an Airy line ensemble. In this paper, we show that when the start and end time are fixed, the disjointness gap fully encodes the set of exceptional geodesic networks. The correspondence uses simple features of the disjointness gap, e.g. zeroes, local minima. We give a similar correspondence relating semi-infinite geodesic networks to a Busemann gap function. The proofs are deterministic given a list of soft properties related to the coalescent geometry of the directed landscape."

As a virtual sandbox, the GUI World model empowers agents with human-like foresight by enabling action-conditioned prediction.

To this end, we propose Code2World, a vision-language coder that simulates the next visual state via renderable code generation. Specifically, to address the data scarcity problem, we construct AndroidCode by translating GUI trajectories into high-fidelity HTML and refining synthesized code through a visual-feedback revision mechanism, yielding a corpus of over 80K high-quality screen-action pairs. To adapt existing VLMs into code prediction, we first perform SFT as a cold start for format layout following, then further apply Render-Aware Reinforcement Learning which uses rendered outcome as the reward signal by enforcing visual semantic fidelity and action consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Code2World-8B achieves the top-performing next UI prediction, rivaling the competitive GPT-5 and Gemini-3-Pro-Image. Notably, Code2World significantly enhances downstream navigation success rates in a flexible manner, boosting Gemini-2.5-Flash by +9.5% on AndroidWorld navigation.

Note that a closed bounded star-shaped set in a locally convex space is convex if and only if alpha=1, and we extend a Brouwer's type fixed-point theorem on compact star-shaped sets in Banach spaces in a more concise manner to locally convex spaces, thereby this is a simplification and an improvement of the Tychonoff fixed-point theorem to compact star-shaped sets."

These results are obtained using a theoretical framework that we developed, which combines DFT single-particle states with screened configuration interaction, a quasi-2D dielectric screening model, and an efficient Coulomb-cutoff scheme that eliminates periodic-image interactions and enables accurate Coulomb and exchange integrals at low computational cost.

    "abstract": "Stochastic minimax optimization on Riemannian manifolds has recently attracted significant attention due to its broad range of applications, such as robust training of neural networks and robust maximum likelihood estimation. Existing optimization methods for these problems typically require selecting stepsizes based on prior knowledge of specific problem parameters, such as Lipschitz-type constants and (geodesic) strong concavity constants. Unfortunately, these parameters are often unknown in practice. To overcome this issue, we develop single-loop adaptive methods that automatically adjust stepsizes using cumulative Riemannian (stochastic) gradient norms. We first propose a deterministic single-loop Riemannian adaptive gradient descent ascent method and show that it attains an $ε$-stationary point within $O(ε^{-2})$ iterations. This deterministic method is of independent interest and lays the foundation for our subsequent stochastic method. In particular, we propose the Riemannian stochastic adaptive gradient descent ascent method, which finds an $ε$-stationary point in $O(ε^{-6})$ iterations. Under additional second-order smoothness, this iteration complexity is further improved to $O(ε^{-4})$, which even outperforms the corresponding complexity result in Euclidean space. Some numerical experiments on real-world applications are conducted, including the regularized robust maximum likelihood estimation problem, and the robust training of neural networks with orthonormal weights. The results are encouraging and demonstrate the effectiveness of adaptivity in practice."

In order to characterize the effect of mobility and Doppler shift in low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, we performed BER comparisons over four different NTN tapped-delay-line (TDL) models, TDL-A, TDL-B, TDL-C, and TDL-D, as specified in the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) technical report TR 38.811. After channel equalization, a minimum mean squared error with successive detection (MMSE-SD) algorithm was used to enhance the BER performance. It was found that AFDM and OTFS consistently outperformed OCDM across all TDL models, while AFDM performed better than OTFS in TDL-B and TDL-C, in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. The complete simulation framework is made available as an open-source code for quick validation and further development."

We investigate whether reasoning generated by LLMs can be used to predict the correctness of a model's own predictions. We analyze 30,300 teacher utterances from classroom dialogue, each labeled by multiple state-of-the-art LLMs with an instructional move construct and an accompanying reasoning. Using human-verified ground-truth labels, we frame the task as predicting whether a model's assigned label for a given utterance is correct. We encode LLM reasoning using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and evaluate five supervised classifiers. A Random Forest classifier achieves an F1 score of 0.83 (Recall = 0.854), successfully identifying most incorrect predictions and outperforming baselines. Training specialist detectors for specific instructional move constructs further improves performance on difficult constructs, indicating that error detection benefits from construct-specific linguistic cues. Using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) framework, we examine four linguistic markers of correctness: Causation, Differentiation, Tentativeness, and Insight. Correct predictions exhibit grounded causal language (e.g., because, therefore), while incorrect reasoning is substantially more likely to rely on epistemic hedging (e.g., might, could) and performative metacognition (e.g., think, realize). Syntactic complexity does not distinguish correct from incorrect reasoning, and longer reasoning is not more reliable. These findings demonstrate that reasoning-based error detection offers a practical and scalable approach to quality control in automated educational dialogue analysis."

We calculate the precise maximal order types of this class of wqos as a function of the maximal order type of the labels $Q$. In the process, we sharpen some recent results of Friedman and Weiermann. Furthermore, we show a correspondence with indecomposable transfinite sequences with finite range, over elements of the wqo $Q$, of length less than $ω^ω$. Nash-Williams proved that arbitrary transfinite sequences with finite range are also well-quasi-ordered, but there are no known methods to extract bounds on the maximal order type from the proof. More concrete proofs for sequences of length less than $α$ for some $α< ω^ω$ were given by Erdős and Rado. Using the correspondence, we obtain precise bounds for the entire collection of transfinite sequences with finite range of length less than $ω^ω$."

Specifically, to internalize complex reasoning capabilities into a single efficient model, we first design a multi-agent teacher system capable of multi-turn tool usage and reflection. This teacher utilizes a Collaborative Signal Translation mechanism to explicitly convert latent behavioral patterns into descriptive natural language evidence to enhance reasoning accuracy. Subsequently, a trajectory-driven distillation pipeline transfers this agentic logic, including planning, tool usage, and self-reflection, into the compact STAR model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STAR surpasses its teacher by 8.7% to 39.5% while eliminating iterative latency, paving the way for real-time, reasoning-enhanced recommendation."

In particular, we predict that the cutoff wave number increases linearly with increasing ITG for sufficiently large values of the ITG. Direct numerical solutions of the gyrokinetic dispersion relation using a purpose-built solver confirm the predicted scalings at large ITG values and find a weaker power-law scaling for intermediate ITG values. Combining these wave number scalings with a simple diffusive estimate for turbulent fluxes produces a scaling prediction for the ITG heat flux in SWITG-driven turbulence. Applying the critical balance conjecture additionally provides scalings for the aspect ratio of the SWITG turbulent eddies."

However, current graph-based SI methods rely on pre-trained models, lack adaptation to larger and unseen graphs at test-time, and overlook test data utilization. To address these issues, we propose PlugSI, a plug-and-play framework that refines test-time graph through two key innovations. First, we design an Unknown Topology Adapter (UTA) that adapts to the new graph structure of each small-batch at test-time, enhancing the generalization of SI pre-trained models. Second, we introduce a Temporal Balance Adapter (TBA) that maintains a stable historical consensus to guide UTA adaptation and prevent drifting caused by noise in the current batch. Empirically, extensive experiments demonstrate PlugSI can be seamlessly integrated into existing graph-based SI methods and provide significant improvement (e.g., a 10.81% reduction in MAE)."

Existing research mainly focuses on model improvements and sentence-level pruning, but often overlooks global structure, leading to disrupted coherence and weakened downstream performance. Some studies employ large language models (LLMs), which achieve higher accuracy but incur substantial resource and time costs. To address these issues, we introduce GloSA-sum, the first summarization approach that achieves global structure awareness via topological data analysis (TDA). GloSA-sum summarizes text efficiently while preserving semantic cores and logical dependencies. Specifically, we construct a semantic-weighted graph from sentence embeddings, where persistent homology identifies core semantics and logical structures, preserved in a ``protection pool'' as the backbone for summarization. We design a topology-guided iterative strategy, where lightweight proxy metrics approximate sentence importance to avoid repeated high-cost computations, thus preserving structural integrity while improving efficiency. To further enhance long-text processing, we propose a hierarchical strategy that integrates segment-level and global summarization. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that GloSA-sum reduces redundancy while preserving semantic and logical integrity, striking a balance between accuracy and efficiency, and further benefits LLM downstream tasks by shortening contexts while retaining essential reasoning chains."

Hence, to improve the reliability of coronal density measurements, it is highly desirable to explore other complementary methods. In this study, we estimate the coronal electron densities in the middle corona, between approximately $1.7-3.5R_\\odot$, using low-frequency radio observations from the recently commissioned Long Wavelength Array at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO-LWA). The results demonstrate consistency with those derived from white-light coronagraph data and predictions from theoretical models.

To address this challenge, we introduce a hierarchical Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework for environment design. Our framework features a teacher agent that leverages student policy representations derived from discovered evaluation environments, enabling it to generate training environments based on the student's capabilities. To improve efficiency, we incorporate a generative model that augments the teacher's training dataset with synthetic data, reducing the need for teacher-student interactions. In experiments across several domains, we show that our method outperforms baseline approaches while requiring fewer teacher-student interactions in a single episode.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a critical method for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, continuous training often leads to policy entropy collapse, characterized by a rapid decay in entropy that results in premature overconfidence, reduced output diversity, and vanishing gradient norms that inhibit learning. Gradient-Preserving Clipping is a primary factor influencing these dynamics, but existing mitigation strategies are largely static and lack a framework connecting clipping mechanisms to precise entropy control. This paper proposes reshaping entropy control in RL from the perspective of Gradient-Preserving Clipping. We first theoretically and empirically verify the contributions of specific importance sampling ratio regions to entropy growth and reduction. Leveraging these findings, we introduce a novel regulation mechanism using dynamic clipping threshold to precisely manage entropy. Furthermore, we design and evaluate dynamic entropy control strategies, including increase-then-decrease, decrease-increase-decrease, and oscillatory decay. Experimental results demonstrate that these strategies effectively mitigate entropy collapse, and achieve superior performance across multiple benchmarks."

    "abstract": "The existence of Galactic optical cirrus poses a challenge for observing faint objects within our Galaxy and dim extragalactic structures. To investigate individual cirrus filaments in the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program public data release 3 (HSC-SSP DR3) we use a technique based on convolutional neural networks and ensemble learning. This approach allows us to distinguish cirrus filaments from foreground and background objects across the entire HSC-SSP, using optical images in the $g$, $r$, and $i$ wavebands. A comparison with previous work using deep Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe~82 (SDSS Stripe~82) data reveals that the cirrus clouds identified in this study are highly consistent in location within the overlapping survey region. However, in the deeper HSC-SSP dataset, we were able to detect $4.5$ times more cirrus clouds. Our study indicates that the sky background in HSC-SSP coadd images is over-subtracted, as evidenced by the surface brightness distribution in cirrus filaments and surrounding regions. Objects with surface brightness of $m = 29~\\mbox{mag~arcsec}^{-2}$ near large filaments can be dimmed by over-subtraction of $0.5$ magnitude in the $r$ band. This suggests that cirrus clouds should be taken into account in algorithms for estimating the sky background. For practical use, we provide a catalog of filaments and a framework that allows one to train neural network models for segmenting cirri in HSC-SSP coadd images."

If the thickness of the nematic layer exceeds this threshold, there is a global-in-time suitable weak solution converging exponentially to a nontrivial equilibrium state as time tends to infinity. If the thickness is no more than the threshold, the global-in-time suitable weak solution has a trivial long-time asymptotic limit. Our results rigorously justify the P-HAN transition discussed in the physics literature."

    "abstract": "Most self-supervised learning (SSL) methods learn continuous visual representations by aligning different views of the same input, offering limited control over how information is structured across representation dimensions. In this work, we frame visual self-supervised learning as a discrete communication process between a teacher and a student network, where semantic information is transmitted through a fixed-capacity binary channel. Rather than aligning continuous features, the student predicts multi-label binary messages produced by the teacher. Discrete agreement is enforced through an element-wise binary cross-entropy objective, while a coding-rate regularization term encourages effective utilization of the constrained channel, promoting structured representations. We further show that periodically reinitializing the projection head strengthens this effect by encouraging embeddings that remain predictive across multiple discrete encodings. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over continuous agreement baselines on image classification, retrieval, and dense visual prediction tasks, as well as under domain shift through self-supervised adaptation. Beyond backbone representations, we analyze the learned binary codes and show that they form a compact and informative discrete language, capturing semantic factors reusable across classes."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "In this paper, the wave-particle turbulent simulation (WPTS), a recently developed multiscale, non-equilibrium turbulence modeling approach, is coupled with a turbulence characteristic-time closure derived from Prandtl mixing-length hypothesis and applied to spatially developing round jets. In WPTS, fluid elements in strongly turbulent regions are represented by Lagrangian particles that travel a finite distance before interacting with the background flow field represented in a wave-like (Eulerian) form. This mechanism bears conceptual similarity to the discrete fluid parcels invoked in the Prandtl mixing-length picture. WPTS differs from conventional mixing-length-based turbulence models in two key respects. First, particle evolution follows a non-equilibrium transport mechanism, rather than the equilibrium assumptions typically embedded in eddy-viscosity closures. Second, WPTS advances the wave and particle components in a coupled manner, with the particle fraction governed primarily by the modeled turbulence characteristic time, enabling laminar and turbulent regimes to be represented within a unified framework. Because spatially developing jets provide a canonical test case with well-established similarity behavior, they are used here for evaluation. Specifically, this work (1) develops a mixing-length-based characteristic-time model tailored to jet flows and (2) incorporates it into WPTS to assess predictive performance. The resulting WPTS framework accurately reproduces the jet similarity solution and other characteristic features at Reynolds numbers of 5,000 and 20,000, demonstrating the promise of WPTS as a practical tool for turbulence modeling and simulation."

Hierarchies of rational solutions of the discrete equations are derived in terms of the generalised Laguerre and generalised Umemura polynomials.

    "abstract": "The Weyl exceptional nodal lines usually occur in 3D topological semimetals, but also emerge in the parameter space of 1D systems. In this work, we study the impact of dissipation on the nodal ring in a 3D topological semimetal. We find that the energy spectrum becomes fully complex in the presence of dissipation, and the original nodal ring is split into two exceptional rings. We introduce a vortex field in the momentum space, which is generated from the spectrum, to characterize the topology of the exceptional rings. This provides a clear physical picture of the topological structure. The two exceptional rings act as two vortex filaments of a free vortex flow with opposite circulations. In this context, the 3D topological semimetal is the boundary separating two quantum phases identified by two configurations of exceptional rings. We also propose a 1D model that has the same topological feature in the parameter space. It provides a simple way to measure the topological invariant in a low-dimensional system. Numerical simulations indicate that the topological invariant is robust under the random perturbations of the system parameters."

    "abstract": "We investigate the fracture behavior of pre-cracked triangular beam-lattices whose elements have failure stresses drawn from a Weibull distribution. Through a statistical analysis and numerical simulations, we identify and verify the existence of three distinct failure regimes: (i) disorder is effectively suppressed, (ii) disorder manifests locally near the crack tip, modifying the crack morphology, and (iii) disorder manifests globally, leading to initially diffuse failure. Our model naturally reveals the key parameters governing this behavior: the Weibull modulus, quantifying the spread in failure thresholds, and a geometric quantity termed the Slenderness Ratio. We also reproduce the disorder-induced toughening reported in previous experimental and numerical studies, further demonstrating that its manifestation depends non-monotonically on disorder. Crucially, our results indicate that this toughening cannot be simply connected to the amount of damage in the lattice, challenging interpretations that attribute increased fracture energy solely to enhanced crack tortuosity or diffuse failure. Overall, our results establish geometry as a powerful control parameter for regulating how disorder is expressed during fracture in beam-lattices, with broader implications for the disorder-induced toughening in engineered materials."

In particular, automated detection of craquelure in digitized paintings is crucial for assessing degradation and guiding restoration, yet remains challenging due to the possibly complex scenery and the visual similarity between cracks and crack-like artistic features such as brush strokes or hair. We propose a hybrid approach that models crack detection as an inverse problem, decomposing an observed image into a crack-free painting and a crack component. A deep generative model is employed as powerful prior for the underlying artwork, while crack structures are captured using a Mumford--Shah-type variational functional together with a crack prior. Joint optimization yields a pixel-level map of crack localizations in the painting."

    "abstract": "High-order moving-mesh methods can effectively reduce numerical diffusion, but their formal accuracy typically relies on the regularity of the mesh velocity. This dependency creates a fundamental conflict in the numerical solution of hyperbolic conservation laws, where solution-driven adaptation may induce nonsmooth mesh motion, thereby degrading convergence order. We introduce \\emph{transport polynomial exactness} (TPE($k$)), a mesh-motion-independent criterion that generalizes classical free-stream preservation (TPE(0)) to the exact advection of degree-$k$ polynomials. We show that the classical geometric conservation law (GCL) is insufficient to ensure TPE($k$) for $k \\ge 1$ due to mismatches in higher-order geometric moments. To resolve this, we propose \\emph{evolved geometric moments} (EGMs), obtained by solving auxiliary transport equations discretized compatibly with the physical variables. We rigorously prove that second-degree EGMs evolved via the third-order strong stability preserving Runge--Kutta (SSPRK3) method coincide with the exact geometric moments. This exactness arises from a \\emph{superconvergence} mechanism wherein SSPRK3 reduces to Simpson's rule for EGM evolution. Leveraging this result, we construct a third-order conservative finite-volume rezoning moving-mesh scheme. The scheme satisfies the TPE(2) property for \\emph{arbitrary mesh motion} and \\emph{any pseudo-time step size}, thereby naturally accommodating spatiotemporally discontinuous mesh velocity. Crucially, this \\emph{breaks the efficiency bottleneck} in the conventional advection-based remapping step and reduces the required pseudo-time levels from $\\mathcal{O}(h^{-1})$ to $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ under bounded but discontinuous mesh velocity. Numerical experiments verify exact quadratic transport and stable third-order convergence under extreme mesh deformation, demonstrating substantial efficiency gains."

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning has been able to solve various tasks successfully, however, due to the construction of policy gradient and training dynamics, tuning deep reinforcement learning models remains challenging. As one of the most successful deep reinforcement-learning algorithm, the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm (PPO) clips the policy gradient within a conservative on-policy updates, which ensures reliable and stable policy improvement. However, this training pattern may sacrifice sample efficiency. On the other hand, off-policy methods make more adequate use of data through sample reuse, though at the cost of increased the estimation variance and bias. To leverage the advantages of both, in this paper, we propose a new PPO variant based on the stability guarantee from conservative on-policy iteration with a more efficient off-policy data utilization. Specifically, we first derive an extended off-policy improvement from an expectation form of generalized policy improvement lower bound. Then, we extend the clipping mechanism with segmented exponential functions for a suitable surrogate objective function. Third, the trajectories generated by the past $M$ policies are organized in the replay buffer for off-policy training. We refer to this method as Extended Off-policy Proximal Policy Optimization (ExO-PPO). Compared with PPO and some other state-of-the-art variants, we demonstrate an improved performance of ExO-PPO with balanced sample efficiency and stability on varied tasks in the empirical experiments."

Aggregated from 12 online biblical libraries and one preexisting corpus, each translation is manually annotated with metadata that maps the text to a standardized identifier for the work, its specific edition, and its year of revision. This canonicalization empowers researchers to define \"uniqueness\" for their own needs: they can perform micro-level analyses on translation families, such as the KJV lineage, or conduct macro-level studies by deduplicating closely related texts.

In this paper, we present the first systematic benchmark of lightweight SNNs obtained by converting compact CNN architectures into spiking networks, where activations are modeled with Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons and trained using surrogate gradient descent under a unified setup. We construct spiking variants of ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, MnasNet, and MixNet, and evaluate them on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, measuring accuracy, F1-score, parameter count, computational complexity, and energy consumption. Our results show that SNNs can achieve up to 15.7x higher energy efficiency than their CNN counterparts while retaining competitive accuracy. Among these, the SNN variant of SqueezeNet consistently outperforms other lightweight SNNs. To further optimize this model, we apply a structured pruning strategy that removes entire redundant modules, yielding a pruned architecture, SNN-SqueezeNet-P. This pruned model improves CIFAR-10 accuracy by 6% and reduces parameters by 19% compared to the original SNN-SqueezeNet. Crucially, it narrows the gap with CNN-SqueezeNet, achieving nearly the same accuracy (only 1% lower) but with an 88.1% reduction in energy consumption due to sparse spike-driven computations. Together, these findings establish lightweight SNNs as practical, low-power alternatives for edge deployment, highlighting a viable path toward deploying high-performance, low-power intelligence on the edge."

    "abstract": "Sustaining long-term interactions remains a bottleneck for Large Language Models (LLMs), as their limited context windows struggle to manage dialogue histories that extend over time. Existing memory systems often treat interactions as disjointed snippets, failing to capture the underlying narrative coherence of the dialogue stream. We propose TraceMem, a cognitively-inspired framework that weaves structured, narrative memory schemata from user conversational traces through a three-stage pipeline: (1) Short-term Memory Processing, which employs a deductive topic segmentation approach to demarcate episode boundaries and extract semantic representation; (2) Synaptic Memory Consolidation, a process that summarizes episodes into episodic memories before distilling them alongside semantics into user-specific traces; and (3) Systems Memory Consolidation, which utilizes two-stage hierarchical clustering to organize these traces into coherent, time-evolving narrative threads under unifying themes. These threads are encapsulated into structured user memory cards, forming narrative memory schemata. For memory utilization, we provide an agentic search mechanism to enhance reasoning process. Evaluation on the LoCoMo benchmark shows that TraceMem achieves state-of-the-art performance with a brain-inspired architecture. Analysis shows that by constructing coherent narratives, it surpasses baselines in multi-hop and temporal reasoning, underscoring its essential role in deep narrative comprehension. Additionally, we provide an open discussion on memory systems, offering our perspectives and future outlook on the field.

    "abstract": "Compared to theoretical frameworks that assume equal sensitivity to deviations in all features of data, the theory of anomaly detection allowing for variable sensitivity across features is less developed. To the best of our knowledge, this issue has not yet been addressed in the context of isolation-based methods, and this paper represents the first attempt to do so. This paper introduces an Extended Isolation Forest with feature sensitivities, which we refer to as the Anisotropic Isolation Forest (AIF). In contrast to the standard EIF, the AIF enables anomaly detection with controllable sensitivity to deviations in different features or directions in the feature space. The paper also introduces novel measures of directional sensitivity, which allow quantification of AIF's sensitivity in different directions in the feature space. These measures enable adjustment of the AIF's sensitivity to task-specific requirements. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm by applying it to synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that the AIF enables anomaly detection that focuses on directions in the feature space where deviations from typical behavior are more important."

Here I assess the role of young massive clusters (YMC) evolving into old open clusters (OC) -- the YMC/OC channel -- to the GW merger population. A homogeneous grid of 90 N-body evolutionary model star clusters, spanning initial masses of $10^4M_\\odot\\leq M_{cl}(0)\\leq10^5M_\\odot$, half-mass radii of 1-3 pc, and metallicities between 0.0002-0.02 is computed with the direct, post-Newtonian N-body code NBODY7. The N-body simulations include primordial binaries, delayed stellar-remnant model forming black holes (BH) and neutron stars (NS), BH spin prescriptions, and GW recoil kicks, and they are evolved until BH depletion. Most GW mergers from the cluster models are dynamically assembled binary black holes (BBH) that merge within their host clusters. Merger mass ratios reach down to 0.1-0.2 despite an overall bias toward nearly symmetric pairs. The GW merger efficiency varies non-monotonically with cluster mass, peaking around $M_{cl}(0)=7.5\\times10^4M_\\odot$ and also for $M_{cl}(0)\\leq3.0\\times10^4M_\\odot$. The computed mergers reproduce some of the key features of the latest observed GW event catalogue, including asymmetric low-mass mergers, misaligned events among highly spinning, massive BHs, and an excess of $30M_\\odot$ primaries, though they under-produce $10M_\\odot$ primaries, hinting at contributions from other channels. The model merger rate density accounts for 25%-33% of the observed rate; it increases with redshift somewhat faster than the cosmic star formation, consistently with LVK's inferences. The model effective spin distribution is positively asymmetric at zero redshift and broadens with redshift. The models yield field BH- and NS-main sequence star binaries with parameters consistent with the Gaia-discovered candidates. [Abgd.]"

Here, we investigate the photovoltaic potential of bulk-stacked GeSe$_{2}$ chains using first-principles calculations within the $GW0$ approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) to capture quasiparticle and excitonic effects. The bulk GeSe$_{2}$ exhibits indirect GW band gaps of 1.92 eV (type-I) and 1.08 eV (type-II). Optical calculations show markedly stronger visible-light absorption in type-II, yielding a spectroscopically limited maximum efficiency (SLME) of ~25.6% at a 0.5 $μ$m thickness. Phonon and room-temperature ab initio molecular dynamics analyses indicate that type-II is dynamically stable, whereas type-I shows imaginary phonon modes, suggesting a propensity for structural distortion. These results identify type-II GeSe2 as a promising stable absorber for thin-film photovoltaics with enhanced flexibility compared to typical 2D vdW systems."

    "abstract": "In today's connected world, the generation of massive streaming data across diverse domains has become commonplace. In the presence of concept drift, class imbalance, label scarcity, and new class emergence, they jointly degrade representation stability, bias learning toward outdated distributions, and reduce the resilience and reliability of detection in dynamic environments. This paper proposes SCIL (Streaming Class-Incremental Learning) to address these challenges. The SCIL framework integrates an autoencoder (AE) with a multi-layer perceptron for multi-class prediction, uses a dual-loss strategy (classification and reconstruction) for prediction and new class detection, employs corrected pseudo-labels for online training, manages classes with queues, and applies oversampling to handle imbalance. The rationale behind the method's structure is elucidated through ablation studies and a comprehensive experimental evaluation is performed using both real-world and synthetic datasets that feature class imbalance, incremental classes, and concept drifts. Our results demonstrate that SCIL outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art methods. Based on our commitment to Open Science, we make our code and datasets available to the community."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unique opportunities for scientific tasks, yet their ability to reason over complex numerical data remains largely unexplored. We propose a simple mechanism to introduce domain-specific physical knowledge into LLMs by fusing pre-trained latent physical features with a pre-trained language model. Our method employs a teacher-student knowledge distillation framework where a large LLM (teacher) generates synthetic question-answer supervision to transfer physical reasoning to a smaller LLM (student). The student is conditioned on latent physical features and trained via a lightweight adapter and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We demonstrate that this approach, applied to models with 1B, 8B, and 32B parameters, enables effective reasoning over real scientific data. Our models substantially outperform strong baselines, such as Gemini 3 Pro, across multiple downstream tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. We show that the model combines latent information with general physical understanding to predict complex properties and can be \"steered\" by identifying physically meaningful directions in the latent space. This allows for explicit physical manipulation and natural language interpretation of latent structures. While our experiments focus on astrophysics, the framework is domain-agnostic and applicable to various scientific fields. Our main contribution is a general framework for using LLMs as interpretable interfaces to scientific latent spaces, enabling a single model to perform diverse tasks through natural language guidance. This work marks a step toward developing scientifically capable and useful LLMs."

    "abstract": "The transition toward low-inertia power systems demands modeling frameworks that provide not only accurate state predictions but also physically consistent sensitivities for control. While scientific machine learning offers powerful nonlinear modeling tools, the control-oriented implications of different differentiable paradigms remain insufficiently understood. This paper presents a comparative study of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs), and Differentiable Programming (DP) for modeling, identification, and control of power system dynamics. Using the Single Machine Infinite Bus (SMIB) system as a benchmark, we evaluate their performance in trajectory extrapolation, parameter estimation, and Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) synthesis. Our results highlight a fundamental trade-off between data-driven flexibility and physical structure. NODE exhibits superior extrapolation by capturing the underlying vector field, whereas PINN shows limited generalization due to its reliance on a time-dependent solution map. In the inverse problem of parameter identification, while both DP and PINN successfully recover the unknown parameters, DP achieves significantly faster convergence by enforcing governing equations as hard constraints. Most importantly, for control synthesis, the DP framework yields closed-loop stability comparable to the theoretical optimum. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NODE serves as a viable data-driven surrogate when governing equations are unavailable."

Analytically, we show that a burst becomes probabilistically rare after a long time.

These predictions can be tested with programmable quantum simulators."

The presence of HCOOH suggests that oxygen-bearing molecules may be directly involved in the chemical and physical evolution of star formation regions, particularly in hot molecular cores. This paper presents the first detection of the rotational emission lines of the $trans$-conformer of HCOOH toward the hot molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1, located in the massive star formation region G358.93$-$0.03. This study employed high-resolution observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Band 7. The column density and excitation temperature of $t$-HCOOH are determined as $(8.13\\pm0.72)\\times10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $120\\pm15$ K, respectively. The fractional abundance of $t$-HCOOH relative to H$_{2}$ is $(2.62\\pm 0.29)\\times 10^{-9}$. The column density ratios of $t$-HCOOH/CH$_{3}$OH and $t$-HCOOH/H$_{2}$CO are $(1.56 \\pm 0.12)\\times 10^{-2}$ and $(1.16 \\pm 0.12)$, respectively. We computed a three-phase warm-up chemical model of HCOOH using the gas-grain chemical code UCLCHEM. We found that the observed and modelled abundances of HCOOH are almost identical, within a factor of 0.89. Based on chemical modelling, we showed that HCOOH may be formed through the reaction between HCO and OH on the grain surface, which is further released in the gas-phase."

First, we introduce HealthRubrics, a dataset of 7,034 physician-verified preference examples in which clinicians refine LLM-drafted rubrics to meet rigorous medical standards. Second, we distill these rubrics into HealthPrinciples: 119 broadly reusable, clinically grounded principles organized by clinical dimensions, enabling scalable supervision beyond manual annotation. We use HealthPrinciples for (1) offline alignment by synthesizing rubrics for unlabeled queries and (2) an inference-time tool for guided self-revision. A 30B parameter model that activates only 3B parameters at inference trained with our framework achieves 33.4% on HealthBench-Hard, outperforming much larger models including Deepseek-R1 and o3, establishing a resource-efficient baseline for clinical alignment."

We propose Time2General, a DGVSS framework built on Stability Queries. Time2General introduces a Spatio-Temporal Memory Decoder that aggregates multi-frame context into a clip-level spatio-temporal memory and decodes temporally consistent per-frame masks without explicit correspondence propagation. To further suppress flicker and improve robustness to varying sampling rates, the Masked Temporal Consistency Loss is proposed to regularize temporal prediction discrepancies across different strides, and randomize training strides to expose the model to diverse temporal gaps. Extensive experiments on multiple driving benchmarks show that Time2General achieves a substantial improvement in cross-domain accuracy and temporal stability over prior DGSS and VSS baselines while running at up to 18 FPS.

Although recent experiments have demonstrated dark cavity effects for electronic material phases, like superconductivity, ferroelectricity and charge density waves, a smoking gun experiment for magnetic systems is lacking. Largely, this comes from the focus on phase transitions, where a large critical light-matter coupling is needed to observe cavity modifications. Here, we propose spiral magnets, where even a small cavity-mediated change in magnetic interactions is reflected in a change of the spiral wavelength, as a promising platform to observe cavity effects. We focus on the single-layer multiferroic NiI$_2$, interacting with electric field fluctuations from surface phonon polaritons of the paraelectric substrate SrTiO$_3$. With decreasing substrate-material distance, the ratio of nearest and third nearest neighbor exchange interactions reduces, leading to an increase of the spiral wavelength and an eventual transition into a ferromagnetic state. Our work identifies a realistic platform to observe cavity vacuum renormalization effects in magnetic systems."

A high-order nodal discontinuous Galerkin method is employed to solve the governing equations on the generated mesh. Three different inflow profiles are evaluated to represent the nozzle-exit conditions, namely, inviscid, steady viscous, and unsteady viscous profiles. Velocity and shear stress tensor component profiles obtained from the simulations are compared with experimental data. Among the investigated profiles, the steady viscous inflow shows the most significant deviation from the inviscid case, particularly in the near-field region of the jet inlet. The steady viscous profile also leads to reduced peak velocity fluctuations, showing better agreement with experimental results. Further downstream, the influence of the inflow condition diminishes, with all three profiles converging toward the experimental reference. In addition, power spectral density analyses of streamwise velocity fluctuations reveal that the inflow conditions have little effect on spectral distributions, with numerical results showing consistent agreement with experimental data within the accessible Strouhal range. Beyond these findings, the study provides a highly detailed, high-fidelity database of supersonic jet flow simulations, encompassing six large-eddy computations with different meshes, polynomial refinements, and inflow conditions. The database includes high-frequency data in relevant regions of the jet flow field and is openly available in the Zenodo repository, ensuring accessibility and reusability for the scientific community."

Conventional FS methods such as Extra Trees, Variance Threshold, Tree-based models, Chi-Squared tests, ANOVA, Random Selection, and Sequential Attention rely primarily on statistical heuristics or model-driven importance scores, often overlooking the semantic context of features. Motivated by recent progress in LLM-driven FS, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can guide feature selection in a zero-shot setting, using only feature names and task descriptions, as a viable alternative to traditional approaches. We evaluate multiple LLMs (GPT-5.0, GPT-4.0, Gemini-2.5 etc.) on the EMBOD dataset (a fusion of EMBER and BODMAS benchmark datasets), comparing them against established FS methods across several classifiers, including Random Forest, Extra Trees, MLP, and KNN. Performance is assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC, MCC, and runtime. Our results demonstrate that LLM-guided zero-shot feature selection achieves competitive performance with traditional FS methods while offering additional advantages in interpretability, stability, and reduced dependence on labeled data. These findings position zero-shot LLM-based FS as a promising alternative strategy for effective and interpretable malware detection, paving the way for knowledge-guided feature selection in security-critical applications"

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning relaxes the need of large pixel-wise labeled datasets for image segmentation by leveraging unlabeled data. The scarcity of high-quality labeled data remains a major challenge in medical image analysis due to the high annotation costs and the need for specialized clinical expertise. Semi-supervised learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing this bottleneck, with pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization emerging as two predominant paradigms. Dual-task collaborative learning, an emerging consistency-aware paradigm, seeks to derive supplementary supervision by establishing prediction consistency between related tasks. However, current methodologies are limited to unidirectional interaction mechanisms (typically regression-to-segmentation), as segmentation results can only be transformed into regression outputs in an offline manner, thereby failing to fully exploit the potential benefits of online bidirectional cross-task collaboration. Thus, we propose a fully Differentiable Bidirectional Synergistic Learning (DBiSL) framework, which seamlessly integrates and enhances four critical SSL components: supervised learning, consistency regularization, pseudo-supervised learning, and uncertainty estimation. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate our method's state-of-the-art performance. Beyond technical contributions, this work provides new insights into unified SSL framework design and establishes a new architectural foundation for dual-task-driven SSL, while offering a generic multitask learning framework applicable to broader computer vision applications. The code will be released on github upon acceptance."

T Pyx is a primary progenitor candidate for Type Ia supernovae (SNIa).

The operators are defined by the quadratic form method and are described by continuity across each shell together with the usual jump condition for the radial derivative. Using a boundary integral approach based on the free Green kernel and single--layer potentials, we derive an explicit resolvent representation for an arbitrary number of shells with bounded coupling strengths. This yields a concrete Kreĭn--type formula and a boundary operator whose noninvertibility characterizes the discrete spectrum, and it is compatible with a partial--wave reduction under rotational symmetry. We then specialize to the two--shell case with constant couplings and obtain a detailed description of the negative spectrum. In particular, we show that the ground state (when it exists) lies in the $s$--wave sector and derive an explicit secular equation for bound states. For large shell separation, each bound level approaches the corresponding single--shell level with exponentially small corrections, while a genuine tunneling splitting appears when the single--shell levels are tuned to coincide. As a simple calibration, we relate the two--shell parameters to representative core--shell quantum dot scales. At the level of order--of--magnitude and qualitative trends, Type~I configurations yield a relatively strongly confined state, whereas Type~II configurations produce a comparatively shallow outer--shell state."

    "abstract": "We propose LaPha, a method for training AlphaZero-like LLM agents in a Poincaré latent space. Under LaPha, the search process can be visualized as a tree rooted at the prompt and growing outward from the origin toward the boundary of the Poincaré ball, where negative curvature provides exponentially increasing capacity with radius. Using hyperbolic geodesic distance to rule-verified correctness, we define a node potential and assign dense process rewards by potential differences. We further attach a lightweight value head on the same shared latent space, enabling self-guided test-time scaling with almost no additional overhead. On MATH-500, LaPha improves Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B from 66.0% to 88.2%. With value-head-guided search, LaPha-1.5B reaches 56.7% accuracy on AIME'24, and LaPha-7B further achieves 60.0% on AIME'24 and 53.3% on AIME'25."

    "abstract": "In our previous paper with Tudor Pădurariu, we introduced the notion of limit categories for moduli stacks of Higgs bundles and formulated the Dolbeault geometric Langlands correspondence. These limit categories are expected to provide an effective ``classical limit'' of the categories of D-modules on the moduli stack of bundles, and our formulation links categorical Donaldson-Thomas theory with the geometric Langlands correspondence. In this paper, we prove the above Dolbeault geometric Langlands correspondence for $\\GL_2$ over the locus in the Hitchin base where the spectral curves are reduced. This is the first non-trivial case in which the relevant moduli stacks are not quasi-compact, and the use of limit categories is essential to the formulation and proof of the correspondence. Our approach also outlines a strategy for proving the correspondence in greater generality and explains the current obstructions to such an extension."

    "abstract": "We study coalition formation for data sharing under differential privacy when agents have heterogeneous privacy costs. Each agent holds a sensitive data point and decides whether to participate in a data-sharing coalition and how much noise to add to their data. Privacy choices induce a fundamental trade-off: higher privacy reduces individual data-sharing costs but degrades data utility and statistical accuracy for the coalition. These choices generate externalities across agents, making both participation and privacy levels strategic. Our goal is to understand which coalitions are stable, how privacy choices shape equilibrium outcomes, and how decentralized data sharing compares to a centralized, socially optimal benchmark. We provide a comprehensive equilibrium analysis across a broad range of privacy-cost regimes, from decreasing costs (e.g., privacy amplification from pooling data) to increasing costs (e.g., greater exposure to privacy attacks in larger coalitions). We first characterize Nash equilibrium coalitions with endogenous privacy levels and show that equilibria may fail to exist and can be non-monotonic in problem parameters. We also introduce a weaker equilibrium notion called robust equilibrium (that allows more widespread equilibrium existence by equipping existing players in the coalition with the power to prevent or veto external players from joining) and fully characterize such equilibria. Finally, we analyze, for both Nash and robust equilibria, the efficiency relative to the social optimum in terms of social welfare and estimator accuracy. We derive bounds that depend sharply on the number of players, properties of the cost profile and how privacy costs scale with coalition size."

    "abstract": "We study two central qubits interacting with a transverse-field Ising chain that serves as their environment. The environment is driven linearly in time across its quantum critical points (QCPs) and, during the evolution, is subjected to quantum reset (QR), where it is returned at random times to its initial state. We investigate how such QR of the environmental spin chain modifies the dynamics of entanglement and quantum discord between the qubits. Our results show that in the strong-coupling regime, entanglement and discord exhibit pronounced revivals within the interval bounded by the Ising QCPs, but these revivals diminish as the QR rate increases. In contrast, weak coupling leads to a monotonic reduction of quantum correlations. Numerically, we find that the revival peaks of concurrence decay and scale exponentially with the QR rate, while quantum discord shows no clear scaling behavior. In the weak-coupling regime without QR, the correlations decay monotonically as the driven field crosses the second QCP. When QR is applied, however, both entanglement and discord undergo oscillatory suppression, with the oscillation period increasing as either the QR rate or the ramp time scale is reduced."

Treating LLMs as virtual informants, we probe their dialectal knowledge using two survey-style question formats: Yes-No questions and multiple-choice questions. To this end, we exploited a large-scale, expert-curated database of Spanish lexical variation. Our evaluation covers more than 900 lexical items across 21 Spanish-speaking countries and is conducted at both the country and dialectal area levels. Across both evaluation formats, the results reveal systematic differences in how LLMs represent Spanish language varieties. Lexical variation associated with Spain, Equatorial Guinea, Mexico & Central America, and the La Plata River is recognized more accurately by the models, while the Chilean variety proves particularly difficult for the models to distinguish. Importantly, differences in the volume of country-level digital resources do not account for these performance patterns, suggesting that factors beyond data quantity shape dialectal representation in LLMs. By providing a fine-grained, large-scale evaluation of geographic lexical variation, this work advances empirical understanding of dialectal knowledge in LLMs and contributes new evidence to discussions of Digital Linguistic Bias in Spanish."

    "abstract": "AI agents are increasingly deployed in multi-tenant cloud environments, where they execute diverse tool calls within sandboxed containers, each call with distinct resource demands and rapid fluctuations. We present a systematic characterization of OS-level resource dynamics in sandboxed AI coding agents, analyzing 144 software engineering tasks from the SWE-rebench benchmark across two LLM models. Our measurements reveal that (1) OS-level execution (tool calls, container and agent initialization) accounts for 56-74% of end-to-end task latency; (2) memory, not CPU, is the concurrency bottleneck; (3) memory spikes are tool-call-driven with a up to 15.4x peak-to-average ratio; and (4) resource demands are highly unpredictable across tasks, runs, and models. Comparing these characteristics against serverless, microservice, and batch workloads, we identify three mismatches in existing resource controls: a granularity mismatch (container-level policies vs. tool-call-level dynamics), a responsiveness mismatch (user-space reaction vs. sub-second unpredictable bursts), and an adaptability mismatch (history-based prediction vs. non-deterministic stateful execution). We propose AgentCgroup , an eBPF-based resource controller that addresses these mismatches through hierarchical cgroup structures aligned with tool-call boundaries, in-kernel enforcement via sched_ext and memcg_bpf_ops, and runtime-adaptive policies driven by in-kernel monitoring. Preliminary evaluation demonstrates improved multi-tenant isolation and reduced resource waste."

This allows us to assume, without loss of generality, that rules considered by us are stable canonical ones. The idea turns out to be useful. In particular, using stable canonical rules, we get an alterna tive proof of the Blok-Esakia theorem for intuitionistic modal logics which was first proved in [3] and generalize it to multi-conclusion consequence re lations. We also prove the Dummett-Lemmon conjecture for intuitionistic modal multi-conclusion consequence relations, which, as far as we know, is a new result."

Existing diversity metrics, such as feature-space dispersion and metric-space magnitude, primarily capture distributional variation or entropy, while largely neglecting the geometric structure of datasets. To address this gap, we introduce a framework based on topological data analysis (TDA) and persistence landscapes (PLs) to extract and quantify geometric features from data. This approach provides a theoretically grounded means of measuring diversity beyond entropy, capturing the rich geometric and structural properties of datasets. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities, we demonstrate that our proposed PLs-based diversity metric (PLDiv) is powerful, reliable, and interpretable, directly linking data diversity to its underlying geometry and offering a foundational tool for dataset construction, augmentation, and evaluation."

    "abstract": "The consistent embedding of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) effects within the Standard Model requires a rigorous understanding of how Planck-scale deformations manifest at low energies. While phenomenological approaches often introduce canonical deformations with multiple free parameters to capture these effects, the physical requirement of gauge symmetry in the framework of a covariant Effective Field Theory (EFT) imposes strict conditions on the allowed interaction structure. In this paper, we demonstrate that these conditions act as physical selection rules for admissible quantum gravity models. By applying non-Abelian Ward identities and a covariant operator mapping to the dimension-six operator basis, we derive a fundamental on-shell equivalence between kinetic and cubic interaction terms. As a paradigmatic application, we show that the Levy-Helayel-Neto (LHN) framework, a candidate effective description of LQG, satisfies this physical requirement only when its parameters obey the specific algebraic relation: theta_3 / theta_8 = -1/2 * [ 1 + theta_7 * (ell_P / L)^(2 + 2 Upsilon) ] + O(ell_P). It must be highlighted that this result advances the physical understanding of LQG phenomenology by revealing that the apparent freedom in defining the Hamiltonian is illusory; the parameters are bound by the necessity of preserving the gauge structure of the Standard Model."

To enhance CNN performance, feature stacking techniques have been explored to aggregate complementary acoustic descriptors into richer input representations. In this paper, we investigate CNN-based models employing various stacked feature combinations, including Log-Mel Spectrogram (LM), Spectral Contrast (SPC), Chroma (CH), Tonnetz (TZ), Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), and Gammatone Cepstral Coefficients (GTCC). Experiments are conducted on the widely used ESC-50 and UrbanSound8K datasets under different training regimes, including pretraining on ESC-50, fine-tuning on UrbanSound8K, and comparison with Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) models pretrained on large-scale corpora such as AudioSet. This experimental design enables an analysis of how feature-stacked CNNs compare with transformer-based models under varying levels of training data and pretraining diversity. The results indicate that feature-stacked CNNs offer a more computationally and data-efficient alternative when large-scale pretraining or extensive training data are unavailable, making them particularly well suited for resource-constrained and edge-level sound classification scenarios."

To mitigate these limitations, we propose GAFRNet, a robust and interpretable Graph Attention and FuzzyRule Network specifically engineered for histopathology image classification with scarce supervision. GAFRNet constructs a similarity-driven graph representation to model intersample relationships and employs a multihead graph attention mechanism to capture complex relational features across heterogeneous tissue structures.Concurrently, a differentiable fuzzy-rule module encodes intrinsic topological descriptorsincluding node degree, clustering coefficient, and label consistencyinto explicit, human-understandable diagnostic logic. This design establishes transparent \"IF-THEN\" mappings that mimic the heuristic deduction process of medical experts, providing clear reasoning behind each prediction without relying on post-hoc attribution methods. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets (BreakHis, Mini-DDSM, and ICIAR2018) demonstrate that GAFR-Net consistently outperforms various state-of-the-art methods across multiple magnifications and classification tasks. These results validate the superior generalization and practical utility of GAFR-Net as a reliable decision-support tool for weakly supervised medical image analysis."

While in specific settings, Shampoo and Muon reduce to spectral descent analogous to how Adam and Signum reduce to sign descent, their general relationship and relative data efficiency under controlled settings remain unclear. Through extensive experiments on language models, we demonstrate that Shampoo achieves higher token efficiency than Muon, mirroring Adam's advantage over Signum. We show that Shampoo's update applied to weight matrices can be decomposed into an adapted Muon update. Consistent with this, Shampoo's benefits can be exclusively attributed to its application to weight matrices, challenging interpretations agnostic to parameter shapes. This admits a new perspective that also avoids shortcomings of related interpretations based on variance adaptation and whitening: rather than enforcing semi-orthogonality as in spectral descent, Shampoo's updates are time-averaged semi-orthogonal in expectation."

    "abstract": "Applying dynamic logics to program verifications is a challenge, because their axiomatic rules for regular expressions can be difficult to be adapted to different program models. We present a novel dynamic logic, called DLp, which supports reasoning based on programs' operational semantics. For those programs whose transitional behaviours are their standard or natural semantics, DLp makes their verifications easier since one can directly apply the program transitions for reasoning, without the need of re-designing and validating new rules as in most other dynamic logics. DLp is parametric. It provides a model-independent framework consisting of a relatively small set of inference rules, which depends on a given set of trustworthy rules for the operational semantics. These features of DLp let multiple models easily compared in its framework and makes it compatible with existing dynamic-logic theories. DLp supports cyclic reasoning, providing an incremental derivation process for recursive programs, making it more convenient to reason about without prior program transformations. We analyze and prove the soundness and completeness of DLp under certain conditions. Several case studies illustrate the features of DLp and fully demonstrate its potential usage."

To address this, we introduce a structure-preserving two-stage training strategy that decouples distribution learning from physics enforcement by freezing the coefficient decoder during physics-informed fine-tuning. We further propose a two-step residual objective that enforces physical consistency on refined, structurally valid generative trajectories rather than noisy single-step predictions. The resulting framework enables stable, high-fidelity inference for both unconditional generation and forward problems. We demonstrate that forward solutions can be obtained via a projection-based zero-shot inpainting procedure, achieving consistent accuracy of diffusion baselines with orders of magnitude reduction in computational cost."

However, there is still a lack of rigor in describing controlled experiments, hindering reproducibility and transparency. Registered Reports (RR) have been discussed in the ESE community to address these issues. A RR registers a study's hypotheses, methods, and/or analyses before execution, involving peer review and potential acceptance before data collection. This helps mitigate problematic practices such as p-hacking, publication bias, and inappropriate post hoc analysis. Objective: This paper presents initial results toward establishing an RR template for Software Engineering controlled experiments using the Open Science Framework (OSF). Method: We analyzed templates of selected OSF RR types in light of documentation guidelines for controlled experiments. Results: The observed lack of rigor motivated our investigation of OSF-based RR types. Our analysis showed that, although one of the RR types aligned with many of the documentation suggestions contained in the guidelines, none of them covered the guidelines comprehensively. The study also highlights limitations in OSF RR template customization. Conclusion: Despite progress in ESE, planning and documenting experiments still lack rigor, compromising reproducibility. Adopting OSF-based RRs is proposed. However, no currently available RR type fully satisfies the guidelines. Establishing RR-specific guidelines for SE is deemed essential."

We introduce an extended TE-QPINN (x-TE-QPINN) architecture that supports both classical and fully quantum embeddings, enabling a controlled comparison between feedforward neural network-based feature maps and parameterized quantum circuit embeddings. The first architecture is the classical embedding feed-forward neural network-based TE-QPINN (FNN-TE-QPINN), while the latter variant is a purely quantum one, referred to as quantum embedding neural network-based TE-QPINN (QNN-TE-QPINN). The proposed framework employs hardware-efficient variational quantum circuits and species-specific readout operators to approximate coupled multi-field dynamics while enforcing governing equations, boundary conditions, and initial conditions through a physics-informed loss function. By isolating the embedding mechanism while keeping the variational ansatz, loss formulation, and optimization procedure fixed, we analyze the impact of embedding design on gradient structure, parameter scaling, and quantum resource requirements. Numerical experiments on one- and two-dimensional RD equations demonstrate that quantum embeddings can replace classical embeddings without degradation in solution accuracy and, in certain regimes, exhibit improved optimization behavior compared to classical PINNs and hybrid quantum models with fixed embeddings. These results provide architectural insight into hybrid quantum PDE solvers and inform the design of resource-efficient quantum physics-informed learning methods."

We consider measurement models where each sensor collects a single-snapshot measurement. This covers sensor placement for inverse problems governed by linear steady PDEs or evolution equations with final-in-time observations. It is well-known that in the finite-dimensional (discretized) formulations of such inverse problems, EIG is a monotone submodular function. This also entails a theoretical guarantee for greedy sensor placement in the discretized setting. We extend the result on submodularity of the EIG to the infinite-dimensional setting, proving that the approximation guarantee of greedy sensor placement remains valid in the infinite-dimensional limit. We also discuss computational considerations and present strategies that exploit problem structure and submodularity to yield an efficient implementation of the greedy procedure."

    "abstract": "High-quality medical imaging datasets are essential for training deep learning models, but their unauthorized use raises serious copyright and ethical concerns. Medical imaging presents a unique challenge for existing dataset ownership verification methods designed for natural images, as static watermark patterns generated in fixed-scale images scale poorly dynamic and high-resolution scans with limited visual diversity and subtle anatomical structures, while preserving diagnostic quality. In this paper, we propose X-Mark, a sample-specific clean-label watermarking method for chest x-ray copyright protection. Specifically, X-Mark uses a conditional U-Net to generate unique perturbations within salient regions of each sample. We design a multi-component training objective to ensure watermark efficacy, robustness against dynamic scaling processes while preserving diagnostic quality and visual-distinguishability. We incorporate Laplacian regularization into our training objective to penalize high-frequency perturbations and achieve watermark scale-invariance. Ownership verification is performed in a black-box setting to detect characteristic behaviors in suspicious models. Extensive experiments on CheXpert verify the effectiveness of X-Mark, achieving WSR of 100% and reducing probability of false positives in Ind-M scenario by 12%, while demonstrating resistance to potential adaptive attacks."

We show that neural retrievers used in RAG systems have blind spots, which we define as the failure to retrieve entities that are relevant to the query, but have low similarity to the query embedding. We investigate the training-induced biases that cause such blind spot entities to be mapped to inaccessible parts of the embedding space, resulting in low retrievability. Using a large-scale dataset constructed from Wikidata relations and first paragraphs of Wikipedia, and our proposed Retrieval Probability Score (RPS), we show that blind spot risk in standard retrievers (e.g., CONTRIEVER, REASONIR) can be predicted pre-index from entity embedding geometry, avoiding expensive retrieval evaluations. To address these blind spots, we introduce ARGUS, a pipeline that enables the retrievability of high-risk (low-RPS) entities through targeted document augmentation from a knowledge base (KB), first paragraphs of Wikipedia, in our case. Extensive experiments on BRIGHT, IMPLIRET, and RAR-B show that ARGUS achieves consistent improvements across all evaluated retrievers (averaging +3.4 nDCG@5 and +4.5 nDCG@10 absolute points), with substantially larger gains in challenging subsets. These results establish that preemptively remedying blind spots is critical for building robust and trustworthy RAG systems (Code and Data)."

We study egocentric interaction generation from a single scene image under free-space hand gestures, aiming to synthesize photorealistic videos in which hands enter the scene, interact with objects, and induce plausible world dynamics under head motion. This setting introduces fundamental challenges, including distribution shift between free-space gestures and contact-heavy training data, ambiguity between hand motion and camera motion in monocular views, and the need for arbitrary-length video generation. We present Hand2World, a unified autoregressive framework that addresses these challenges through occlusion-invariant hand conditioning based on projected 3D hand meshes, allowing visibility and occlusion to be inferred from scene context rather than encoded in the control signal. To stabilize egocentric viewpoint changes, we inject explicit camera geometry via per-pixel Plücker-ray embeddings, disentangling camera motion from hand motion and preventing background drift. We further develop a fully automated monocular annotation pipeline and distill a bidirectional diffusion model into a causal generator, enabling arbitrary-length synthesis. Experiments on three egocentric interaction benchmarks show substantial improvements in perceptual quality and 3D consistency while supporting camera control and long-horizon interactive generation."

    "abstract": "The increasingly stringent observational bounds on primordial gravitational waves strongly constrain inflationary model building, favoring scenarios that predict highly suppressed tensor perturbations. While many viable constructions rely on non-canonical kinetic terms, non-minimal couplings, or modifications of gravity, it remains an open question whether comparably small tensor amplitudes can emerge within a minimal, single-field framework driven solely by potential dynamics. In this work we propose a novel inflationary scenario based on a modified Lennard-Jones potential. Inspired by a well-known interaction potential in molecular physics, the proposed form naturally combines a smooth minimum with an extended flat plateau at large field values. This intrinsic structure supports slow-roll inflation and ensures a graceful exit without introducing additional degrees of freedom. We perform a detailed analysis of the inflationary dynamics and confront the model with current observational constraints. We find that the scalar spectral index is fully consistent with CMB data, while the tensor-to-scalar ratio is predicted to be extremely small, reaching values as low as $r\\sim10^{-7}$. Finally, the running of the scalar spectral index is also found to be small, well withing the 1$σ$ recent observational bounds from Atacama Cosmology Telescope."

We first introduce a domain-agnostic formulation that enables consistent detection and evaluation of the counterintuitive phenomenon, addressing the absence of precise definition. Through extensive experiments on 47 tabular datasets and 10 CV/NLP embedding datasets in ADBench, benchmarked against 13 baseline models, we demonstrate that the phenomenon, as defined, is consistently rare in general tabular data. We further investigate this phenomenon from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, focusing on the roles of data dimensionality and difference in feature correlation. Our results suggest that likelihood-only detection with normalizing flows offers a practical and reliable approach for anomaly detection in tabular domains."

    "abstract": "Entangled granular systems exhibit mechanical rigidity and resistance to deformation, reminiscent of cohesive materials, due to their reduced degrees of freedom and contact friction. A quantitative understanding of how classical granular phenomena, such as shear localization and plastic flow, appear in such geometrically cohesive systems remains unknown. Here, we investigate this using granular chain ensembles subjected to direct shear tests. Our experiments reveal that chains longer than four beads exhibit pronounced shear hardening, which is nearly independent of the applied normal stress and is accompanied by the complete suppression of shear localization. The volume dilation of the long chain ensembles also does not vanish in the steady state. We complement this phenomenology, which is distinct from that of typical frictional granular ensembles, with DEM simulations. The simulations reveal that tensile forces are generated due to particles being locally jammed, characterized by a high non-covalent coordination number. Consequently, this leads to a deformation that shows a very diffuse region of localization and enhanced shear hardening. Overall, our study highlights that granular chains provide a systematic route to map how connectivity constraints impact flow properties and mechanical rigidity."

In this work, we study how to adapt pretrained visuomotor diffusion policies to reflect preferred behaviors using limited demonstrations. We introduce RKO, a novel preference-alignment method that combines the benefits of two recent frameworks: RPO and KTO. We evaluate RKO against common preference learning frameworks, including these two, as well as a baseline vanilla diffusion policy, on real-world cloth-folding tasks spanning multiple garments and preference settings. We show that preference-aligned policies (particularly RKO) achieve superior performance and sample efficiency compared to standard diffusion policy fine-tuning.

We utilize two techniques: the first achieves a provably optimal query complexity via a shifted Dyson series; the second breaks the conventional linear dependency, achieving fast-forwarding by exhibiting a square-root dependence on the norm of the dissipative part. Furthermore, one can derive existing methods such as the LCHS (Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulation) and the NDME (Non-Diagonal Density Matrix Encoding) methods from APS. The APS provides an effective and generic pathway for developing efficient quantum algorithms for general non-unitary dynamics to achieve either optimal query complexity or fast-forwarding property, outperforming the existing algorithms for the same problems."

    "abstract": "We study the reconfiguration of odd matchings of combinatorial graphs. Odd matchings are matchings that cover all but one vertex of a graph. A reconfiguration step, or flip, is an operation that matches the isolated vertex and, consequently, isolates another vertex. The flip graph of odd matchings is a graph that has all odd matchings of a graph as vertices and an edge between two vertices if their corresponding matchings can be transformed into one another via a single flip. We show that computing the diameter of the flip graph of odd matchings is $Π_2^p$-hard. This complements a recent result by Wulf [FOCS25] that it is~$Π_2^p$-hard to compute the diameter of the flip graph of perfect matchings where a flip swaps matching edges along a single cycle of unbounded size. Further, we show that computing the radius of the flip graph of odd matchings is $Σ_3^p$-hard. The respective decision problems for the diameter and the radius are also complete in the respective level of the polynomial hierarchy. This shows that computing the radius of the flip graph of odd matchings is provably harder than computing its diameter, unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. Finally, we reduce set cover to the problem of finding shortest flip sequences. As a consequence, we show $\\log$-\\APX-hardness and that the problem cannot be approximated by a sublogarithmic factor. By doing so, we answer a question asked by Aichholzer, Brenner, Dorfer, Hoang, Perz, Rieck, and Verciani [GD25]."

Trust in medical AI requires not just high accuracy but also transparency regarding the specific physiological features driving predictions. Existing explainability methods for ECGs typically rely on post-hoc approximations (e.g., Grad-CAM and SHAP), which can be unstable, computationally expensive, and unfaithful to the model's actual decision-making process. In this work, we propose the ECG-IMN, an Interpretable Mesomorphic Neural Network tailored for high-resolution 12-lead ECG classification. Unlike standard classifiers, the ECG-IMN functions as a hypernetwork: a deep convolutional backbone generates the parameters of a strictly linear model specific to each input sample. This architecture enforces intrinsic interpretability, as the decision logic is mathematically transparent and the generated weights (W) serve as exact, high-resolution feature attribution maps. We introduce a transition decoder that effectively maps latent features to sample-wise weights, enabling precise localization of pathological evidence (e.g., ST-elevation, T-wave inversion) in both time and lead dimensions. We evaluate our approach on the PTB-XL dataset for classification tasks, demonstrating that the ECG-IMN achieves competitive predictive performance (AUROC comparable to black-box baselines) while providing faithful, instance-specific explanations. By explicitly decoupling parameter generation from prediction execution, our framework bridges the gap between deep learning capability and clinical trustworthiness, offering a principled path toward \"white-box\" cardiac diagnostics."

This interest arises from its central role in developing vulnerability detection systems, copyright infringement analysis, and malware phylogeny tools. Nearly all binary function similarity systems embed assembly functions into real-valued vectors, where similar functions map to points that lie close to each other in the metric space. These embeddings enable function search: a query function is embedded and compared against a database of candidate embeddings to retrieve the most similar matches. Despite their effectiveness, such systems rely on bi-encoder architectures that embed functions independently, limiting their ability to capture cross-function relationships and similarities. To address this limitation, we introduce ReSIM, a novel and enhanced function search system that complements embedding-based search with a neural re-ranker. Unlike traditional embedding models, our reranking module jointly processes query-candidate pairs to compute ranking scores based on their mutual representation, allowing for more accurate similarity assessment. By re-ranking the top results from embedding-based retrieval, ReSIM leverages fine-grained relation information that bi-encoders cannot capture. We evaluate ReSIM across seven embedding models on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements in search effectiveness, with average gains of 21.7% in terms of nDCG and 27.8% in terms of Recall."

To address this, we propose \\textbf{Scalpel}, a method that reduces hallucination by refining attention activation distributions toward more credible regions. Scalpel predicts trusted attention directions for each head in Transformer layers during inference and adjusts activations accordingly. It employs a Gaussian mixture model to capture multi-peak distributions of attention in trust and hallucination manifolds, and uses entropic optimal transport (equivalent to Schrödinger bridge problem) to map Gaussian components precisely. During mitigation, Scalpel dynamically adjusts intervention strength and direction based on component membership and mapping relationships between hallucination and trust activations. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and benchmarks demonstrate that Scalpel effectively mitigates hallucinations, outperforming previous methods and achieving state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, Scalpel is model- and data-agnostic, requiring no additional computation, only a single decoding step."

Among existing methods, guiding the generation of frozen LLMs through autoregressive reward models (ARMs) to accomplish multi-objective test-time alignment is a low-cost solution. However, these methods typically rely on independent parameters for each preference objective, either by training ARMs independently across preference dimensions, which neglects interactions among preference features, or by training a single ARM with separate feature extraction modules for each preference, which can cause feature entanglement. Both strategies can result in misalignment between generated outputs and user preferences. To address this limitation, we propose Preference-Modulated \\& Shared Low-Rank Adaptation (MoSLoRA) for ARM training, which first extracts shared features via a preference-agnostic module and then applies affine transformations to shared features via a preference modulation module conditioned on mixed preference vectors.

However, the widespread reliance on the response-level Bradley-Terry (BT) model may limit its full potential, as the reference and learnable models are assumed to be autoregressive only after deriving the objective function. Motivated by this limitation, we revisit the theoretical foundations of DPO and propose a novel formulation that explicitly introduces the autoregressive assumption prior to applying the BT model. By reformulating and extending DPO, we derive a novel variant, termed Autoregressive DPO (ADPO), that explicitly integrates autoregressive modeling into the preference optimization framework. Without violating the theoretical foundations, the derived loss takes an elegant form: it shifts the summation operation in the DPO objective outside the log-sigmoid function. Furthermore, through theoretical analysis of ADPO, we show that there exist two length measures to be considered when designing DPO-based algorithms: the token length $μ$ and the feedback length $μ$'. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explicitly distinguish these two measures and analyze their implications for preference optimization in LLMs."

    "abstract": "Many modern iterative solvers for large-scale tomographic reconstruction incur two major computational costs per iteration: expensive forward/adjoint projections to update the data fidelity term and costly proximal computations for the regulariser, often done via inner iterations. This paper studies for the first time the application of methods that couple randomised skipping of the proximal with variance-reduced subset-based optimisation of data-fit term, to simultaneously reduce both costs in challenging tomographic reconstruction tasks. We provide a series of experiments using both synthetic and real data, demonstrating striking speed-ups of the order 5x--20x compared to the non-skipped counterparts which have been so far the standard approach for efficiently solving these problems. Our work lays the groundwork for broader adoption of these methods in inverse problems."

    "abstract": "Existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit insufficient visual attention, leading to hallucinations. To alleviate this problem, some previous studies adjust and amplify visual attention. These methods present a limitation that boosting attention for all visual tokens inevitably increases attention to task irrelevant tokens. To tackle this challenge, we propose a training free attentional intervention algorithm to enhance the attention of task-relevant tokens based on the argument that task-relevant tokens generally demonstrate high visual-textual similarities. Specifically, the vision-text cross-attention submatrices, which represent visual-textual correlations, are extracted to construct the reweighting matrices to reallocate attention. Besides, to enhance the contribution of visual tokens, we inject visual attention values into the beam search decoding to identify solutions with higher visual attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this method significantly reduces hallucinations across mainstream LVLMs, while preserving the accuracy and coherence of generated content."

    "abstract": "Precise and reliable trajectory planning of mobile robots remains a fundamental challenge due to distance-dependent gain sensitivity, dynamic constraints, and nonlinearities in real environments. Conventional kinematic controllers and fixed-reference distance ANN approaches often degrade in performance when initial conditions (initial position and posture) vary, resulting in excessive travel time or violations of velocity and angular velocity limits. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a Distance Normalization Factor–based Artificial Neural Network (DNF-ANN) trajectory-planning controller that generalizes quasi-optimal control gains across arbitrary initial positions and postures. In particular, the proposed controller aims to compute quasi-optimal gains immediately at the start of motion while satisfying physical velocity and angular-velocity constraints. The method introduces a distance normalization factor to transform gains optimized at a reference distance(ρ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ref</sub>), combined with a nonlinear compensation scheme to prevent angular velocity constraint violations. A genetic algorithm generates optimal gain datasets, which an ANN learns for real-time inference before the robot starts moving. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DNF-ANN strictly satisfies dynamic constraints and achieves benchmark-level performance comparable to GA re-optimization under identical initial conditions, with only a 0.26 s average difference in travel time. These findings confirm that the proposed controller ensures stable and quasi-optimal operation under diverse initial conditions. The DNF-ANN framework is suitable for mobile robot applications that require near-real-time gain computation during the pre-departure planning stage, such as logistics, service robotics, and industrial automation."

Pyrolysis gases emitted from the cable’s outer sheath serve as critical indicators of early-stage thermal anomalies, acting as diagnostic signals rather than direct ignition sources. To investigate the gas generation characteristics for fault diagnosis and to develop a robust early warning method, this study conducted pyrolysis experiments on polyethylene (PE) outer sheaths across a temperature range of 90–250 °C. An optimized Random Forest (RF) early-warning model was established, underpinned by multi-dimensional feature engineering and the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address data imbalance. Experimental results reveal that the pyrolysis products primarily consist of alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, CO, and CO2, exhibiting distinct non-linear trends with increasing temperature. Based on these characteristics, the cable condition was categorized into three warning levels: Attention, Alert, and Alarm. The proposed RF-based model achieved a mean stratified 5-fold cross-validation accuracy of 92.28%, with an independent test accuracy of 93.75%, demonstrating superior stability and generalization capability compared with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR) classifiers. This study provides a reliable, data-driven strategy for identifying incipient thermal faults and preventing fire accidents in high-voltage power cables."

The ETTIS algorithm effectively mitigates the Hamming distance shrinkage problem commonly observed in traditional probabilistic shaping algorithms and exhibits excellent compatibility, allowing seamless integration with standard forward error correction coding and interleaving algorithms. Moreover, the ETTIS framework utilizes predefined symbol components in the shaping templates to implicitly introduce pilot symbols, enabling real-time estimation of channel gain and noise variance without additional bandwidth overhead.. Experimental and simulation results show that, at the same bit rate, the proposed scheme achieves 0.4–0.6 dB performance gains under 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and 64-QAM modulation formats, respectively. Compared with other state-ofthe- art algorithms, ETTIS attains comparable performance while maintaining significantly lower complexity. During decoding, the absolute deviation of the estimated noise bit error rate remains below 0.75%. These features make ETTIS a promising solution for high-throughput and cost-sensitive optical interconnect systems."

We propose RA-SafeRL, a Risk-Aware SafeRL framework that improves learning without compromising safety. RA-SafeRL uses a digital twin environment to safely explore high-risk actions and learn from them, applies adaptive fallback penalties reflecting action severity to distinguish risk levels, and reuses fallback trajectories via off-policy learning, converting previously discarded data into useful signals. Experiments show RA-SafeRL outperforms baseline SafeRL by improving task performance by over 30%, reducing fallback frequency by more than 10%, and shortening recovery time by 38%, enhancing safety, efficiency, and robustness in safety-critical IoT applications."

Compared to conventional microwave resonant cavities, the electric field energy is primarily concentrated within the dielectric material at the resonant frequency, which significantly enhances the interaction between the electromagnetic field and the dielectric. Minor variations in dielectric properties caused by local defects will induce measurable shifts in the resonant frequency. Another distinctive feature of the designed resonant cavity is its semi-open architecture, where the dielectric material is not placed inside a rectangular waveguide but is positioned between two mirror-symmetric open-ended waveguides. This design enables the resonator to achieve scanning detection for larger-area MUTs. To mitigate electromagnetic leakage and enhance the quality factor of the resonator, a parallel plate waveguide (PPW) is incorporated at the open ends of the evanescent waveguides. To demonstrate the detecting ability, an extensive investigation of the sensitivity to local defects inside the material is presented. Two different dielectric materials, including F4B and ceramic samples, are tested using a prototype device. The experimental results demonstrated frequency shifts of 11 MHz at 4.32 GHz and 10 MHz at 3.65 GHz for subwavelength defects with diameters and thicknesses less than 2 mm. Compared to conventional microwave-based sensors, our proposed method offers advantages in detecting minute defects within relatively thick materials at lower operating frequencies."

Second, to compensate for the compromised states, a dual coordinate transformation structure consisting of a virtual coordinate transformation and an available coordinate transformation is proposed. This structure is applicable to both low- and high-power systems.

The model jointly optimizes economic cost, carbon emissions, and freshness retention while enforcing time windows, routing feasibility, and capacity constraints across multiple time periods. To tackle the problem’s combinatorial complexity, a customized Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) metaheuristic is proposed to ensure scalability and near-optimal performance across large-scale instances. Computational experiments based on well-known benchmark scenarios demonstrate that the proposed model achieves global optimality for small- and medium-scale problems, while the ALNS delivers near-optimal solutions within a gap of 1–2% from the optimal and significantly reduces computation time. Ablation studies confirm the essential role of cold-storage hubs in maintaining feasibility and highlight the operational value of time-dependent travel modeling for realistic urban traffic. The proposed model offers decision-makers valuable guidance for achieving sustainable and resilient e-grocery delivery operations in the presence of perishability and stochastic variability."

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional radiative transfer models (3D RTMs) are indispensable for understanding how radiation propagates within vegetation canopies and for interpreting remote sensing signals. Yet their practical deployment is hindered by the difficulty of acquiring the detailed 3D structural parameters they require. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) offers a powerful means of retrieving such information at landscape scales. Here, we quantitatively assess how ALS-derived 3-D forest reconstructions influence bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) simulations. Using three benchmark RAMI scenes that span contrasting canopy architectures, we generated synthetic ALS point clouds and reconstructed each scene via alphashape, voxel, and ellipsoid representations. The resulting 3D scenes were then input to the LargE-Scale remote Sensing data and image simulation (LESS) model to evaluate the structural contribution to simulated canopy reflectance and to quantify the associated uncertainties. Results demonstrate that at a 10-meter resolution, all three representation methods yielded favorable results, especially in the summer birch forest, where the alphashape approach achieves the highest coefficient of determination <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</i><sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> (0.94) and the lowest mean relative absolute error δ (3.5%) for NIR band.

These healthcare data with composite properties can be represented by high-order tensors, which enables the application of tensor multi-way analytics to uncover the latent features in data. However, existing tensor decomposition techniques often face challenges of limited interpretability and weak robustness, which constrain their application in the healthcare industry. To mitigate these challenges, this paper introduces a novel Bayesian Tensor Interpolative Decomposition (BTID) model, which is an extension of the concept of matrix interpolative decomposition and is designed to efficiently and interpretably analyze multi-way tensors. The proposed model performs low-rank approximation using a subset of the original data and employs the Bayesian learning approach to infer the weight matrices, thereby ensuring theoretical interpretability. Additionally, a hierarchical prior is incorporated within this model to address the complexities of the data and enhance model robustness. Finally, a clustering-driven strategy is developed to construct the skeleton matrix, ensuring its physical interpretability while facilitating the CP rank estimation. The BTID model has been comprehensively evaluated on synthetic and healthcare datasets, where the experimental outcomes confirm its superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability compared with traditional tensor decomposition methods."

Traditional augmentation methods, such as noise injection and signal transformations, often fail to preserve task-relevant structure in multichannel EEG, while deep generative models may suffer from mode collapse or produce physiologically inconsistent samples. To address these limitations, we propose a Riemannian Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (RC-GAN) that enforces geometric consistency during signal generation. RC-GAN leverages the manifold of symmetric positive definite (SPD) covariance matrices to regularize synthetic EEG trials according to covariance-based representations widely used in BCI decoding. Evaluated on the BNCI 2014-001 motor imagery dataset, the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art augmentation techniques, achieving a 12.0% improvement in classification accuracy. Qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate that RC-GAN generates diverse and realistic EEG samples while enhancing robustness across different augmentation levels. These results highlight the benefit of incorporating Riemannian structure into generative models for EEG augmentation and provide a principled framework for improving the reliability of BCI systems."

Domain element visibility varies depending on how analysts express the information they have elicited. When analysts are directly asked about the knowledge they acquired during elicitation, visibility increases substantially compared to when they describe the information in a written report. <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Conclusions</i>: Further research is required to replicate our results. However, the finding that analysts have difficulty reporting the information they have acquired is useful for identifying alternatives for improving the documentation of elicitation results. We found evidence that other issues, like domain complexity, the relative importance of different elements within the domain, and the interview script, also seem influential."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a DTC-based snapshot all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) that achieves robust fractional spur suppression and low phase noise with compact circuit complexity. The proposed architecture employs a constant-slope capacitor digital-to-analog converter (CDAC) based digital-to-time converter (DTC) to narrow the effective range of the time-to-digital converter (TDC), thereby enabling high-resolution phase detection without requiring a wide dynamic range. A feedforward spur cancellation filter suppresses residual fractional errors caused by DTC gain error and nonlinearity. In addition, an asynchronous duty-modulation unit (DMU) dithers the LSB of digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) to reduce DCO quantization noise, distribute it across finer time segments and lower the integrated RMS jitter. Fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process, the prototype ADPLL consumes 6.92 mW in steady-state operation, achieving 0.73 ps integrated RMS jitter and –71.6 dBc worst-case fractional spur. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining snapshot-based phase detection, feedforward spur cancellation, and asynchronous pulse-width dithering of DCO."

    "abstract": "Accurate and efficient traffic flow prediction is crucial for the increasingly prevalent autonomous driving, enabling more advanced intelligent transportation systems. For this purpose, we propose a novel model termed Meta Guided-Graph Lightweight TimesNet (MGGLTN) to accurately capture the spatio-temporal correlations within traffic flow data, thereby providing precise traffic flow predictions for Connected Vehicles (CVs). Our spatio-temporal information learning architecture features an encoder-decoder backbone, wherein both the encoder and decoder comprise graph convolutional networks coupled with lightweight Times modules. More importantly, we propose a meta guided-graph library, aimed at providing memory queries for time-varying traffic patterns based on real-world physical spatial information. It efficiently guides the initialization direction of meta guided-graph prototypes, thereby accelerating the convergence speed of model training. Moreover, we introduce depthwise separable convolutions to replace the computationally intensive multi-kernel convolutions in the Times modules, thus significantly reducing computational costs and model parameters while maintaining accuracy. We perform extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets (i.e., METR-LA, PEMS-BAY, and EXPY-TKY) and conduct comprehensive performance evaluations compared to both baseline models and state-of-the-art models. The findings demonstrate the superior performance of our model across all three datasets of varying spatial scales, highlighting the potential of this model to provide precise traffic guidance for CVs."

    "abstract": "Secure and efficient service authentication is vital for trustable interactions between users and service nodes in decentralized metaverse environments. However, conventional PKI-based authentication methods face limitations such as high query latency, privacy leakage risks, and centralized trust dependencies, making them unsuitable for large-scale, real-time metaverse services. To address these challenges, we propose ESAChain, a novel blockchain-based authentication framework that e nsures lightweight, decentralized, and privacy-preserving identity verification. Specifically, we propose a Mutually Exclusive Cuckoo Filter (MECF) integrated with a Filter Hash Chain (FHC), which provides lightweight data structures and efficient querying capabilities for certificate status. Furthermore, we design a trust-decay-based Delegated Proof-of-Stake (TD-DPoS) consensus mechanism to maintain the integrity and reliability of certificate status data by dynamically adjusting node trust values and decaying votes to prevent single-node dominance. We also incorporate a blind-signature-based authentication mechanism to enhance privacy-preserving identity authentication by preventing tracking of certificate verification requests. Extensive simulation experiments and security analyses demonstrate that ESAChain significantly reduces query latency and data transmission overhead, enhances consensus robustness, and provides an efficient, trustworthy, and privacy-preserving authentication solution for secure metaverse services."

    "abstract": "To allow a good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over a wide bandwidth for signals arriving from an unknown angle, many optical wireless communication (OWC) systems need a wide-aperture high-bandwidth detector. However, the physical properties of a photodiode (PD) challenge the design for high bandwidth and a large detection area, simultaneously. This problem is also known as the bandwidth versus area trade-off of an amplified PD receiver. In this paper, we study the limitations of a single-PD OWC receiver on throughput, particularly on bandwidth, photon capturing area, and electrical noise, to formulate a model that evaluates and optimizes the throughput of a communication link for different signal modulation schemes. We optimize the signal power spectral density (PSD) of pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) and of DC-biased optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) modulation for throughput, considering that large modulation bandwidths suffer disproportionally from noise enhancement in typical receiver amplifiers. This worsens if large PDs are used, but we show that to a large extent, the corresponding stronger signal can compensate for the increased noise. We study the optimum detector size, in combination with adaptations of the spectrum and, in particular, the maximum frequency of the modulation. While the limitations of photonic emitters have been extensively studied before, this is one of the first papers that models how the receiver limits the throughput of PAM and OFDM."

Under 416 nm excitation, all three clusters exhibited strong, single broad-spectrum emission. Owing to their small size and high surface area, the GSH‑AuNCs displayed high catalytic activity for the reduction of 4‑nitrophenol (4‑NP). A combined experimental and density functional theory (DFT) study revealed that the size‑dependent activity originates from differences in the adsorption energy of the reaction product, providing a mechanistic structure‑activity relationship. Furthermore, based on the specific Hg–Au metallophilic interaction, the GSH‑AuNCs served as a sensitive fluorescent sensor for selective mercury ion (Hg<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2+</sup>) detection.

    "abstract": "In this study, the prescribed-time fault-tolerant tracking control problem for quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle(QUAV) under external disturbances is investigated. Firstly, an error reconstruction mechanism based on adjustable convergence rate is proposed. This mechanism dynamically adjusts the convergence characteristics of the QUAV system, ensuring that the position and attitude tracking errors strictly converge to the prescribed accuracy range before the preset time threshold. Secondly, the disturbance observer is adopted to estimate unknown disturbances and additive faults, thereby reducing the impact of unknown variables on the stability of the system model. Afterwards, an adaptive fault-tolerant control (FTC) strategy is designed. It compensates for the multiplicative faults of the actuator online through the parameter adaptive law, and actively offsets additive faults by combining them with the output of the disturbance observer. This approach forms a composite FTC architecture. Finally, numerical simulation results show that the proposed control scheme can ensure the accurate convergence of the position and attitude system within prescribed-time under multiple actuator faults and unknown external disturbances. This verifies the effectiveness and robustness of the control strategy."

Given only a single view of an object and a goal pose for that object, ZeroBot uses image-to-3D generative models to obtain a complete object mesh, which is used in simulation for large-scale parallel reinforcement learning. To accelerate training, we introduce an action space which leverages the generated geometry and learned value function to sample states involving robot-object contact. When evaluated on real-world tasks including grasping, pushing, articulated object interaction, and multi-stage manipulation, ZeroBot achieves an 87% success rate with an average training time of 119 seconds. These results show the value of using image-to-3D models in a real2sim framework for rapid, autonomous robot learning.

Firstly, a distributed estimate layer is established to reconstruct the leader’s states, guaranteeing practical prescribed-time convergence of estimation errors independent of global information. The proposed communication-triggered event-triggered mechanism (ETM) eliminates continuous communication among neighboring followers, effectively reducing communication resource consumption. Then, utilizing the estimated information, a local control layer is designed to realize practical Pd-TC tracking for uncertain MASs, where the control-update ETM reduces unnecessary control updates to conserve limited control resources, and adaptive gains eliminate the dependence on the bounds of disturbances and uncertain inherent parameters. Furthermore, a rigorous analysis confirms the exclusion of Zeno behavior in both communication-triggered and control-update ETMs. Finally, the proposed control architecture is applied to multiple ground vehicles, validating the theoretical findings."

    "abstract": "A novel near-field wideband integrated sensing and communication framework is proposed to address the prohibitively high pilot overhead challenge in extremely large-scale MIMO systems. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on exhaustive two-dimensional codebook search, a unified architecture leveraging true-time-delay-based rainbow beamforming with controllable distance-dependent beam squint is proposed to extend spatial coverage. Furthermore, the inter-antenna phase ambiguity is harnessed to introduce beam split phenomena, enabling simultaneous multi-angle and multi-distance sensing within a single pilot transmission. Based on this architecture, a two-stage low-complexity sensing protocol is carried out, where distance-ring identification via beam-split-enhanced rainbow beams is performed in the first stage using sub-array structures, followed by angle refinement in the second stage. To mitigate frequency-dependent beamwidth variations, a frequency-compensated joint reconstruction algorithm based on virtual grid mapping and sparse optimization is proposed. Additionally, an echo-aided velocity estimation method exploiting intra-symbol Doppler diversity across subcarriers is developed, eliminating the need for multiple pulse transmissions. Simulation results demonstrate that: 1) complete spatial coverage is achieved with only two OFDM symbols, representing over 98% overhead reduction compared to exhaustive search methods; 2) the proposed scheme achieves superior localization accuracy with root-mean-square errors below 0.001 in normalized angle domain and 0.01 in distance-ring domain at moderate SNR; 3) communication rates are improved by 7% to 15% compared to conventional near-field beam training approaches under identical pilot budgets."

This article introduces LowCapChain (LCC), a lightweight PBC designed for manufacturing nodes, such as programmable logic controllers, robotic arms, and smart sensors. LCC integrates Merkle ledger compression, elliptic-curve cryptography-based proof-of-membership, and delegated fault-tolerant consensus to enable secure operations without full ledger replication. Implemented in a robotic metal stamping facility using Raspberry Pi edge nodes, LCC achieves 964 transactions per second with 108 ms consensus latency and memory usage below 55 MB. Compared with Hyperledger Fabric, LCC reduces mean consensus latency by 61% and cryptographic overhead by up to 81%. Compared with Quorum, the reductions are 54% and 76%, respectively. Scalability tests confirmed near-linear throughput growth across 10–200 nodes, and fault tolerance experiments verified block finalization under validator failure. These findings establish LCC as an efficient architecture for embedded industrial systems, offering a pathway toward scalable Industry 4.0 adoption with energy savings inferred from reduced CPU cycles rather than directly measured power."

However, this is a challenging task, especially in dynamic scenes characterized by concurrent movement of obstacles and UAVs. This paper proposes a vision-based framework that maps SLZs in dynamic scenes, characterized by both object and drone motions, by integrating several functionalities for visual analysis of the UAV surrounding scenes. Static scene analysis is achieved through context-aware segmentation which divides the UAV-acquired images into thematic classes enabling to identify suitable landing surfaces (e.g., roads, grass).For dynamic content analysis, we combine object detection, tracking, and trajectory prediction to determine object occupancy and identify regions free of obstacles. Trajectory prediction is performed through a novel encoder-decoder architecture taking past object positions to predict the most likely future locations. To ensure stable and robust trajectory prediction, we introduce an optimized homography computation using multi-scale image analysis and cumulative updates to compensate UAV motion. We tested our framework on different operational scenarios, including urban and natural scenes with moving objects like vehicles and pedestrians. Obtained results demonstrate its strong performance, and its significant potential for enabling autonomous and safe UAV navigation."

To address these challenges, this paper studies distributed transceiver design and access point (AP) duplex mode selection under edge distributed unit (EDU)-level information constraints and per- AP power limitations. We develop a partial distributed block coordinate descent (PDBCD) algorithm that decomposes the original sum-rate maximization into three tractable subproblems and iteratively approximates MMSE performance. The proposed design fully leverages EDU computing resources, reducing the computation load at the cloud computing unit (CCU), and significantly lowering fronthaul signaling overhead through an adaptive inter-EDU information sharing mechanism. Furthermore, by integrating a low-complexity greedy search for duplex mode assignment, the algorithm effectively mitigates cross-link interference (CLI) in NA-FD systems. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves spectral efficiency compared with conventional duplex mode, and centralized/distributed MMSE baselines, while maintaining strong scalability under practical deployment constraints."

    "abstract": "Underwater acoustic target classification (UATC) seeks to identify unknown acoustic sources through passive sonar in oceanic remote sensing applications. However, the highly dynamic marine environment and various background noise pose significant challenges to improving UATC performance. To address these challenges, we develop a hybrid temporal-spectral feature learning neural network that integrates three core components: a Fourier analysis network (FAN)-based temporal feature learner, a mixture of expert networks (MoEN)-based spectral feature learner, and an adaptive feature fusion (AFF) module. Specifically, the FAN-based learner encodes temporal feature by capturing multiple periodic patterns associated with underwater acoustic targets. In parallel, the MoEN-based learner models spectral dependencies and emphasizes spectral-selective patterns. The AFF dynamically then balance the contributions of the dual-branch learners through an adaptive weighting mechanism. The proposed algorithm achieves 98.58% accuracy on ShipsEar dataset, outperforming six state-of-the-art methods with moderate model parameters and computational cost."

While multimodal approaches show promising results, they present challenges related to hardware constraints and computational requirements that limits real time implementation in wearable devices. We propose a hybrid methodology combining feature extraction with ma chine learning (ML) for stress detection, using exclusively single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signals from which heart rate variability (HRV) and respiratory signals with their derived features are extracted. We evaluated our approach using the ES3 project database, testing various feature combinations with the XGBoost model. Results demonstrate that incorporating ECG-derived respiratory features significantly improves classification accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional HRV-based approaches and deep learning models. Feature importance analysis identified a reduced set of key features, resulting in a more efficient model with superior performance and substantially lower inference times than deep learning models. These findings support the feasibility of acute stress detection using a single-lead ECG-based multimodal approach that combines feature extraction with ML techniques, providing insights into stress-induced physiological responses and contributing to more accessible biomedical monitoring strategies."

Comparative analyses with established methods, including ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and singular value decomposition (SVD), indicate that the proposed approach mitigates mode mixing and truncation order uncertainty and yields higher detection quality and improved localization while providing superior adaptability and a low computational cost compatible with near real-time clinical application.

However, queries are often ambiguous while incorrect query paths could be reasoned due to misinterpretation of user intent. Existing methods leverage KG structure to disambiguate queries but user often cannot describe their query conditions clearly. To address these challenges, we propose user intent-aware query reasoning (UiQR) over KG, by incorporating user generated data (UGD) to identify user intent. Specifically, we first propose the weighting function to evaluate entity relatedness implied in UGD and prove its submodularity theoretically. Accordingly, we propose a greedy algorithm to efficiently filter optimal candidates and present a variational Bayesian method to reason query paths. Finally, we rank answer entities upon the reasoned paths that are most similar to the query embedding. Extensive experiments on three common datasets show that our UiQR significantly improves the accuracy of query reasoning over KG."

This paper proposes a novel GNSS localization framework that integrates three-dimensional (3D) light detection and ranging (LiDAR) perception with virtual grid-based differential correction to improve positioning performance for both multi-sensor receivers (core nodes) and surrounding low-cost GNSS devices (base nodes). First, an NLOS identification method is developed by combining LiDAR-based ray tracing with pseudorange innovation clustering, enabling reliable detection of mid- and high-elevation NLOS satellites. Then, a satellite selection strategy based on dilution of precision (DOP) optimization is proposed to balance NLOS error compensation and satellite geometry preservation. For cooperative localization, a dynamic virtual grid is constructed around the core node, and pseudorange observations are simulated to generate spatially correlated reference points, allowing base nodes to perform single-differenced positioning relative to the core node. Experimental results on the UrbanNav dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves GNSS positioning accuracy and stability for the core node in complex urban scenarios. Meanwhile, it enhances the localization performance of nearby low-cost terminals through real-time environmental information sharing."

    "abstract": "Navigating socially in human environments requires more than satisfying geometric constraints, as collision-free paths may still interfere with ongoing activities or conflict with social norms. Addressing this challenge calls for analyzing interactions between agents and incorporating common-sense reasoning into planning. This paper presents a social robot navigation framework that integrates geometric planning with contextual social reasoning. The system first extracts obstacles and human dynamics to generate geometrically feasible candidate paths, then leverages a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM) to evaluate these paths, informed by contextually grounded social expectations, selecting a socially optimized path for the controller. This task-specific VLM distills social reasoning from large foundation models into a smaller and efficient model, allowing the framework to perform real-time adaptation in diverse human-robot interaction contexts. Experiments in four social navigation contexts demonstrate that our method achieves the best overall performance with the lowest personal space violation duration, the minimal pedestrian-facing time, and no social zone intrusions.

To overcome these limitations, this study presents a high-precision capacitance-to-digital conversion circuit. The circuit adopts a continuous-time switched-capacitor architecture and incorporates a calibration module to suppress leakage current effects and improve conversion accuracy. Simulation results indicate that the effects of leakage currents and circuit mismatches are suppressed to approximately 24% of their original level by the proposed design. Experimental validation further confirms that the circuit extends the measurement range below 0.1 torr, maintaining a correlation coefficient of 0.999, improved repeatability, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.024 torr under constant pressure. These results improve both the accuracy and stability of MEMS CDG and lay a robust foundation for their deployment in high-precision vacuum measurement."

To address these issues, we propose a channel feedback and beamforming framework that decouples the cascaded channel into BS-IRS and IRS-UE components. The BS-IRS link, though fast-changing, follows predictable and periodic satellite trajectories, enabling statistical modeling from ephemeris data. In contrast, the IRS-UE link varies slowly and is typically dominated by a single angular path, which can be effectively represented using the DFT-based codebook. Leveraging this property, we apply sparse recovery to extract directional features, quantize them, and feed them back in a manner compliant with 3GPP standards. This design enables robust IRS beamforming aligned with the dominant UE-side channel direction. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively mitigates channel aging and codebook mismatch, leading to stable beam patterns and improved reliability over conventional methods."

    "abstract": "The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) has the largest area of permafrost terrain in the mid- and low-latitude regions of the world. Under the combined influence of global change and human activities, the permafrost on the QTP is undergoing widespread degradation, which will not only have significant impacts on the global environment and carbon cycle, but also result in permafrost-related geohazards. Surface deformation resulting from the freeze-thaw process is an important characteristic of permafrost, and predicting it is of great significance for understanding the development of permafrost. However, intrinsic complexity and multifactorial environmental controls limit the accuracy and generalizability of existing prediction models. In this paper, based on the deformation results from the InSAR technique, an integrated algorithm for permafrost deformation prediction is proposed. The algorithm combines wavelet multi-resolution analysis and a Multi-Resolution Cross-Attention (MRCA)-Transformer model, in which both periodic and non-periodic deformation features, together with environmental variables such as soil moisture and temperature, are incorporated through a multi-head cross-attention mechanism for spatiotemporal prediction. The proposed model is trained and evaluated using the InSAR time series deformation derived from 2017-2024 Sentinel-1A data over the QTP permafrost region. The model achieves an average root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 4.97 mm, an average mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.22 mm, with standard deviations of 3.21 mm and 2.89 mm, respectively. The square of the correlation coefficient and the coefficient of determination are both greater than 0.99 across all time steps. Moreover, the results show that the model demonstrates effective performance across a variety of terrains and observational conditions without additional training. This study provides significant scientific insights and practical value for the monitoring of permafrost evolution, environmental assessment, and early warning of geohazards."

To simulate realistic incremental learning scenarios, we construct two large-scale benchmark datasets, Split-AVQA and Split-MUSIC-AVQA, by reorganizing existing AVQA corpora into sequential tasks. Empirical results show that conventional models suffer from severe performance degradation and catastrophic forgetting when learning across audio, visual, and textual modalities in a continual setup. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that integrates four key modules: (1) Question-Guided Cross-modal Information Fusion (QCIF), which dynamically extracts task-relevant multimodal features via question-aware attention; (2) Task-specific Knowledge Distillation with Spatial-Temporal Feature Constraints (TKD-STFC), which preserves semantic output behavior and internal reasoning trajectories across tasks; (3) Question Semantic Consistency Constraint (QSCC), which regularizes evolving question representations to maintain linguistic stability. (4) Dual-Strategy Exemplar Selection (DSES), a memory-efficient replay strategy that jointly maximizes sample informativeness and diversity. All components are theoretically grounded, and formal analysis is provided to ensure modality alignment, spatial-temporal coherence, and exemplar selection reliability. Extensive experiments on both datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art AVQACL baselines in terms of accuracy, retention, and robustness."

These limitations hinder timely identification of critical insulation states. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a PD anomaly detection and severity assessment method based on self-supervised adversarial encoder network and Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Unlike standard autoencoders that over-generalize, the Transformer-based adversarial encoder with dual competing decoders creates sharper anomaly boundaries, enabling high-sensitivity detection of weak PD signals without labeled data. A GMM with composite clustering evaluation automatically determines optimal severity levels by capturing the natural multimodal distribution of PD anomaly scores, where different degradation stages form distinct Gaussian components. Transparent bushing experiments establish quantitative mapping between anomaly scores and observable physical phenomena (gas generation, thermal decomposition), providing interpretable diagnostic criteria. Experimental results demonstrate effective PD detection across developmental stages, automatic severity identification, and quantitative condition assessment. Particularly when approaching critical states, the method captures significant anomaly score changes, enabling timely risk warnings. Compared with existing methods, this approach achieves high-precision detection without labeled data while providing adaptive severity assessment, offering significant practical value."

A novel resilient distributed observer is developed to simultaneously reconstruct both the state and system matrix of the leader using only local neighbor information without requiring global knowledge of the leader’s dynamics or communication topology as in existing methods. Furthermore, a disturbance-rejection synchronization controller is designed based on the internal model principle and a saturation-compensating auxiliary system. In contrast to conventional strategies that rely on constant-bound disturbance assumptions and lack explicit saturation compensation, the proposed controller achieves online disturbance cancellation without prior knowledge of disturbance characteristics such as frequency, amplitude, and phase, while explicitly handling input saturation. The proposed control strategy could significantly improve tracking accuracy, robustness, and practicality in marine environments. Theoretical analysis and simulations validate the merits and performance of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "The tightly coupled GNSS/SINS integration technique has been widely adopted in navigation applications, offering reliable positioning and attitude determination in GNSS-challenged environments. However, further improving its performance, particularly in complex and low-dynamic scenarios where system observability is limited, remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose a novel rotating-antenna approach that actively enhances spatial observability by introducing autonomous antenna motion to modulate the observation geometry. Specifically, the GNSS antenna is driven to perform controlled motions during vehicle maneuvers, introducing relative motion with respect to the navigation frame. This dynamic motion enables the system to emulate the spatial diversity benefits of multi-antenna configurations while using only a single antenna. The resulting improvements in system observability under low-dynamic conditions are further analyzed within the Piece-Wise Constant System framework. The experimental results demonstrate that, compared to conventional fixed-antenna configurations, the proposed method yields improved yaw estimation accuracy, achieving a 38.2% reduction in RMS error. Furthermore, the rotating antenna demonstrates greater robustness, exhibiting slower error divergence and faster re-convergence under challenging conditions such as degraded GNSS signal quality, large initial alignment errors, and GNSS outages. Additionally, the study confirms that accuracy gains are attainable even at low rotation rates. This work provides a promising and cost-effective solution for achieving reliable high-precision attitude determination in challenging operational environments."

    "abstract": "Integrating Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite Internet into the 6G system to realize ubiquitous global coverage is a key objective of this imminent system. Due to the inherent randomness of satellite locations, stochastic geometry has emerged as a popular analytical methodology to provide an efficient alternative to network simulations for deriving statistical performance metrics. Although satellites or ground users are modeled as random processes, the majority of papers in literature have employed propagation channels based on general shadowing or independent blockage situations for urban or suburban areas. Consequently, the impacts of blockage spatial correlation, induced by the physical dimensions (e.g., height, width, and thickness) on satellite link performance remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose a novel three-dimensional (3D) cascade blockage structure and a functional framework to tackle this issue. Under the virtual satellite association strategy, two iterative functional equations in both azimuth and elevation domains are proposed to evaluate coverage performance in 3D correlated environments. For the real satellite association, a location index matrix is introduced to determine the serving node with minimum elevation angle in the orbital sphere. Then, a set of iterative functional equations are proposed to derive the association and coverage probabilities. Numerical simulations validate our analytical framework and quantify the impact of spatial correlation on coverage performance. This study provides guidelines for deploying future dense LEO constellations in correlated blockage environments for both satellite-only and hybrid networks."

    "abstract": "Through-the-earth (TTE) communication provides a practical solution for data transmission in environments with substantial electromagnetic shielding. However, the alignment of the receiving electrodes relative to the signal propagation direction has a significant impact on the strength of the received signal. Furthermore, the power-frequency interference signal, emanating from the power system, can significantly degrade the quality of reception, potentially obscuring the desired signal entirely. To address these issues, this paper proposes a ground electrode array receiving system designed to optimize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The system first utilizes an orthogonal “L”-shaped ground electrode array to perform preliminary detection of both the ground current signal and the power-frequency interference signal, while approximately determining their respective propagation directions. Subsequently, a semicircular array, consisting of multiple “L”-shaped electrode groups, is employed for precise identification of the signal propagation direction. An optimization problem is formulated based on the SINR to select the optimal receiving channel, thereby ensuring the best possible signal reception. The experimental results show that, compared to the conventional dual-electrode configuration with a single channel, the proposed system significantly improves the SINR of the received signal, demonstrating superior anti-interference performance."

    "abstract": "Inspired by the Fleming-Viot stochastic process, we propose a parallel implementation with restart of variational quantum algorithms, with the aim of reducing the time spent by the algorithm in barren plateaus where the optimization direction is unclear. In the Fleming-Viot tradition, parallel searches are called particles. In the proposed approach, the search by a Fleming-Viot particle is stopped when it encounters a region where the gradient is too small or noisy, suggesting a barren plateau area. The stopped particle continues the search after being restarted at another location in the parameter space, potentially taking the exploration away from barren plateaus. We first analyze the behavior of the Fleming-Viot particles from a theoretical standpoint. We show that, when simulated annealing optimization algorithms are used to drive the particles dynamics, the Fleming-Viot system is expected to find the global optimum faster than a single simulated annealing instance. Furthermore, the relative efficiency increases proportionally to the percentage of barren plateaus in the domain. This result is corroborated by numerical experiments carried out on non-convex 2-dimensional synthetic problems, as well as on quantum approximated Max-Cut instances, both in a lower 2-dimensional and a higher 16-dimensional problem. The experiments show that our method tends to perform better than vanilla and parallel simulated annealing when large barren plateaus are present in the domain, especially in the higher-dimensional problem where barrenness tends to be more important."

The system uses smart contracts to automatically incentivize and monitor nodes, rewarding or penalizing them to boost long-term availability. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that this system achieves an optimal Load Balance Factor (LBF) of nearly 1.00 and maintains high storage reliability. It is noteworthy that, even in environments with up to 90% malicious nodes performing tampering or denial-of-service attacks, the file availability of this system remains at least 30%, which is up to 5.7 times higher than that of other distributed storage algorithms."

In such settings, UAV trajectory and power control are naturally modeled as continuous variables, while communication resource allocation is typically discrete. However, existing methods for handling hybrid actions often ignore the interdependencies between discrete and continuous components, thereby limiting cooperative decision-making capabilities for ICAC among UAVs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm based on hybrid action representation (MAHyAR) to solve the dynamic optimization problem, which maintains an equilibrium between fair communication and UAVs’ energy consumption. Furthermore, we innovatively construct a hybrid action representation space to characterize the intrinsic dependencies between discrete and continuous actions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves an 11% increase in fair throughput and conserves energy consumption by up to 33%, compared to the baseline method."

Unlike existing studies that focus on isolated learning behaviors, the proposed circuit architecture simultaneously realizes associative learning, forgetting, latent inhibition, blocking effects, secondary conditioning, and emotion-modulated decision-making at the circuit level. A voltage-controlled threshold-type memristor model is employed to emulate synaptic plasticity, while modular perceptual and decision-making subcircuits are designed to ensure scalability and functional consistency. The complete circuit implementation is verified using PSPICE circuit simulations. Simulation results demonstrate the correct realization of diverse classical conditioning behaviors, controllable fear generalization, and adaptive decision responses under different perceptual stimuli.

The subwavelength U-shaped groove structures provide a significant slow wave effect, reducing the longitudinal size of the quarter-wavelength transformer while enhancing the operating bandwidth. To verify the results, back-to-back transitions are fabricated and measured. The measurement results show that the proposed structure operates at 7.8–22.0GHz with reflection coefficient more than −10 and −10-dB fractional bandwidth (FBW) of 95%.

Their value lies not only in ensuring secure data storage, but also in providing a practical foundation for data governance, especially in complex and cross-domain environments. In this paper, we propose LiveIndex, an index-driven hybrid-storage blockchain framework for cross-domain data governance.

Second, we employ asymmetric searchable encryption (ASE) to protect privacy by converting analysis policies into search trapdoors and embedding privacy attributes into ciphertexts, thereby supporting compliant and secure data analysis. Third, we integrate proxy re-encryption (PRE) to strengthen control over cross-domain data, using re-encryption keys to ensure secure data authorization.

Here, we propose a human–machine shared cascade control method for magnetically driven microrobots, which effectively integrates human cognitive intelligence with machine autonomy for collision-free navigation in dynamic environments. The outer-loop hybrid shared control unit smoothly modulates control authority in response to real-time collision risk, dynamically integrating the operator instructions and the autonomous navigation system output guided by the enhanced artificial potential field method to formulate the guidance law. For the inner-loop motion tracking, a data-driven adaptive orientation controller is designed, which integrates a nonlinear feedforward compensator leveraging a Gaussian process regression (GPR) model with a linear feedback controller whose parameters are optimized using the virtual reference feedback tuning (VRFT) method, ensuring fast and precise tracking of the desired motion. The effectiveness of the proposed method was validated through both simulation and physical experiments. In human-subject studies conducted on a physical magnetic actuation platform featuring both static and dynamic obstacle scenarios, quantitative results demonstrate that the shared control strategy significantly outperforms both purely manual and fully autonomous modes across all key metrics, including success rate, task completion time, stability, and safety (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$p \\lt 0.001$</tex-math> </inline-formula>).

Due to the intensive computational demands of running TGP, GPU acceleration is crucial for achieving scalable performance. However, efficient GPU-based execution of TGP remains challenging, primarily due to three core issues: (1) the structural heterogeneity of program individuals, (2) the complexity of integrating multiple levels of parallelism, and (3) the incompatibility between high-performance CUDA execution and flexible Python-based environments. To address these issues, we propose EvoGP, a high-performance framework tailored for GPU acceleration of TGP via population-level parallel execution. First, EvoGP introduces a tensorized representation that encodes variable-sized trees into fixed-shape, memory-aligned arrays, enabling uniform memory access and parallel computation across diverse individuals. Second, EvoGP adopts an adaptive parallelism strategy that dynamically combines intra- and inter-individual parallelism based on dataset size, ensuring high GPU utilization across a broad spectrum of tasks. Third, EvoGP embeds custom CUDA kernels into the PyTorch runtime, achieving seamless integration with Python-based environments such as Gym, MuJoCo, Brax, and Genesis.

However, due to the diversity of milk brands and environmental conditions in real-world application scenarios, the accuracy of existing detection models often drops significantly when applied to new domains. A significant amount of new data needs to be gathered in order to retrain the model for new domain, which greatly increases both time and labor costs. To tackle this problem, this paper introduces a transfer learning-based cross-domain milk freshness detection method. The method uses transfer learning to generate data for unknown categories within the target domain. Specifically, the transfer generation model trains on data from both the target and source domain categories. With the proposed model, data from other categories in the source domain can be utilized to generate corresponding target domain data. This method comprehensively considers data generation from multiple perspectives of time, frequency, and spatial, to enhance the authenticity of the generated data. It uses a transfer generation architecture, consisting of a transfer network and a decoder, to learn the mapping relationship between the source and target domain, helping to narrow the gap between domains. Additionally, a feature subspace decomposition method is introduced into the decoder, and a cross-domain consistency loss function is formulated to strengthen the model’s learning capability. The proposed method is shown to generate high-quality data for unknown target-domain categories in multiple cross-domain settings, leading to a performance improvement ranging from 17.64% to 32.44% in the detection of cross-domain milk freshness."

    "abstract": "Crop diseases pose a significant threat to agricultural productivity and global food security. Timely and accurate detection of such diseases is crucial for improving both crop yield and quality. While numerous deep learning approaches rely solely on image data for disease identification, they often overlook the complementary value of multi-scale feature extraction in enhancing visual analysis. To address this limitation and effectively capture hierarchical representations across different scales, we propose a Multi-Scale Feature Extraction Framework for Image-Text Fusion (MSF-ITF) that simultaneously processes both modalities through parallel convolutional branches with varying receptive fields. Our approach utilizes an image encoder to extract foundational visual representations, followed by four parallel convolutional branches (1×1, 3×3, 5×5, 7×7) to capture multi-scale visual information. For text processing, we employ established pipeline using GLM-4V-Plus to generate hierarchical textual descriptions and BLIP2 encoder for feature extraction, then apply multi-scale 1D convolutions to capture semantic patterns at different contextual ranges. Subsequently, a cross-attention module aligns and fuses the multi-scale features from both modalities. Extensive evaluations on Soybean Disease, AI Challenge 2018, and PlantVillage datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing single-scale and image-based models in terms of accuracy. Specifically, our model achieves recognition accuracies of 99.14%, 87.90%, and 99.24% on respective datasets, while maintaining computational efficiency through lightweight design. These results highlight the effectiveness of multi-scale learning in integrating hierarchical visual and textual cues for accurate and efficient disease recognition, offering a scalable solution for crop disease diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Objective: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a commonly used imaging modality for assessment of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), and lesion identification in PET images is a key step in the development of effective treatments. Deep neural networks have recently produced encouraging performance of automated lesion identification with PET imaging. However, most methods require a predefined region/volume of interest (ROI/VOI) or rely on a multi-stage, cascaded modeling pipeline, which often leads to low efficiency and/or high variability. In this paper, we propose a novel single-stage PET lesion detection method that does not need precomputed ROIs/VOIs, cascaded models or multimodal data. Methods: We introduce a novel three-dimensional dual-decoder neural network, which contains a cross-decoder attention module to take as input gating signals from an auxiliary organ segmentation decoder and suppress irrelevant feature responses in the primary decoder of lesion detection. Additionally, we design and insert a new patchwise contrastive learning module into the primary decoder to enhance the network's discriminative power for lesions with varying volumes and shapes. Results: We evaluate the proposed lesion identification method using multiple hepatic NET <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$^{68}$</tex-math></inline-formula>Ga-DOTATATE PET image datasets that are acquired from two different scanners.

    "abstract": "This paper maidenly formulates a distributed secure consensus tracking control framework for a leader-following cyber-physical multi-agent system (CP-MAS) subject to malicious cyber-intrusions. The proposed consensus tracking control framework synergistically combines model reference adaptive control (MRAC) and super-twisting terminal sliding mode control (ST-TSMC), applied to a partially unknown CP-MAS, to enable cyber-resiliency with minimal tracking error and improved chattering performance. Due to stealthy deception attacks on sensor measurements, the states of follower agents are compromised. Thus, to minimize the conservativeness in realizing the proposed cyber-resilient control framework, a radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN)-assisted state observer has been formulated to estimate the uncompromised states of CP-MAS. Using graph theory and the Lyapunov argument, online adaptation laws have been derived that guarantee the boundedness of all signals and finite-time global asymptotic stability of consensus errors. Numerical simulations have been conducted on a group of four single-link robot manipulator agents subjected to hybrid cyberattacks. The presented qualitative and quantitative assessment demonstrates the proficiency and cyber-resiliency of the proposed hybrid control framework over MRAC, ST-SMC, and other reported methodologies in the face of unknown malicious attacks."

    "abstract": "The latency-sensitive image recognition systems in edge data centers are facing the workloads of multiple deep neural networks (Multi-DNN) and multi-user dynamic requests. Most of the existing solutions are based on GPUs or ASICs, whose fixed hardware architecture has limited low-latency capabilities when dealing with varying request rates in random dynamic scenarios. The dynamic reconfigurability of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) can enable the hardware architecture to adapt in accordance with fluctuating request rates. Therefore, this study proposes a Request-Rate-Aware Multi-DNN accelerator framework (RRAM) based on FPGA, thereby improving latency performance. The RRAM includes a reconfigurable, computation-memory-interleaved multi-core accelerator architecture, a dynamic bandwidth adaptor for stable data transfers, and a performance analytic model for random request scenarios that enables an end-to-end latency evaluation. To efficiently explore the design space, a workload-aware resource boundary search strategy is also introduced, which eliminates a majority of invalid solutions. Implemented on the U250 platform, RRAM achieves better Service-Level Agreement (SLA) satisfaction rates compared to the fixed-architecture baseline accelerators under varying request rates, and improves the Average Normalized Turnaround Time (ANTT) by 1.3x to 6.1x. Furthermore, the average power consumption of RRAM is only 22.8% and 44.9% of the GPUs of RTX3090 and A100, while the latency is improved by up to 18.2x and 4.6x."

Current methods for foggy conditions rely on generic image enhancement without considering the physics-based correlation between fog distribution and terrain elevation. This paper presents PHENet, a physics-guided height-enhanced network that leverages the intrinsic correlation between atmospheric scattering and terrain elevation for robust change detection under foggy conditions. The proposed approach introduces three synergistic components: (1) Height-Aware Mixture Fusion module that leverages frequency-domain decomposition for elevation-conditioned spatial feature enhancement, selectively suppressing fog-related artifacts while preserving structural details; (2) Height-Enhanced Difference (HED)-Augmented Difference Fusion Module that incorporates height-derived change indicators invariant to atmospheric variations, significantly reducing false positives from weather-induced spectral changes; and (3) Physics-Guided Adversarial Refinement Module that enforces consistency with atmospheric scattering principles during training without requiring paired clear-foggy data. Comprehensive experiments on foggy variants of WHU-CD and LEVIR-CD datasets demonstrate that PHENet achieves superior performance across all fog densities. Furthermore, the proposed method maintains a compact architecture with 5.24M parameters, demonstrating that physics-informed design can deliver robust performance without excessive model complexity.

    "abstract": "In addition to securely handling objects, grippers endowed with a sense of touch are desirable for handling delicate objects. Force sensors can be mounted distally at the fingertips, but a simpler option is to estimate fingertip forces from motor current at the base. This approach, which is not new, reduces wire routing and recesses electronics away from the sensed surface for operation in wet environments. However, for such a strategy to work, the actuating motor must have no or low gearing, which increases its transparency to external torques, but greatly limits its own torque output. Therein lies a trade-off. In addition to gearing, the transmission ratio from motor to fingertip is also defined by the gripper linkage itself. In this work, the trade-off is overcome by introducing a linkage capable of reconfiguring without the need of an extra actuator. Reconfiguration is performed by moving across an output singularity to select between a mode which is biased for force sensing (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">sense mode</i>) and a mode which is biased for force production (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">grip mode</i>). These novel kinematics are embodied as a mostly monolithic compliant mechanism, leaving just one traditional pin joint in the entire gripper assembly. Experiments show that force mode exhibits 3.1× more force output, and sense mode can measure 2.6× smaller forces. Corollary to the latter, sense mode is ideal for estimating the stiffness of objects, including small fruits with stiffness lower than 150 N/m. As an illustration, we demonstrate the usage of sense mode to estimate the ripeness of small fruits, followed by a transition to force mode in order to pluck the fruit.

The prior self-referenced (SR) RXs suffer from a fundamental challenge in handling consecutive identical digits (CIDs), since their correction mechanism relies on detecting an unstable blind zone and requires complex digital overhead. The PPSR overcomes this by implementing two primary solutions. First, an analog CID-restoring feedback loop is integrated to actively secure a stable vertical margin even under long-term CID sequences. Second, the PPSR exploits the non-ideal low-pass filter (LPF) characteristic of the sample-and-hold (S&H) circuits. By intentionally adjusting the time constant (τSH), a robust horizontal margin is achieved. Fabricated in 28 nm CMOS, the RX achieves a data rate of 20 Gb/s/pin while compensating –15 dB channel loss. The RX consumes 8.42 mW (0.42 pJ/bit) and demonstrates strong immunity to 100 MHz supply noise up to 200 mVpp."

This removes the need to introduce penalty terms. The optimization problem formulated is quadratic, and its strong convexity ensures that convergence to the optimum point is guaranteed, even with gradient descent-based algorithms. In addition, we design an NN architecture with batch normalization (BN), residual net shortcuts, and multitask learning to improve training performance.

However, with the increasing demand for OWC scale in B5G and even 6G scenarios, the coverage range of a single ORIS (below 300 m) can no longer meet communication needs. Cascaded ORISs’ technology has become an inevitable trend in the development of ORIS, which has not been deeply studied in existing work. To address the above challenges, in this paper we set up cascaded ORISs in a typical long-distance free space optcis (FSO) scenario and conduct a detailed analysis of their channels and performance. This system employs cascaded ORISs to extend ORIS coverage and expand the overall scale of the FSO system, thereby enabling the FSO link to evolve from a traditional point-to-point configuration to a broader, spatially distributed communication layout. The physical model of multiple ORISs’ cascades and the effect on their communication performance are analyzed in detail. Meanwhile, the closed-form expressions of the bit error rate (BER) and outage probability of the multi-hop cascaded ORISs-assisted FSO system are derived and verified by simulations.

Concurrently, the retrieved Land Surface Temperature (LST) also decreases. Subsequently, two sites were selected in the Sahara Desert and the Taklamakan Desert. Using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) radiance product (MYD21KM) and the TES-derived temperature and emissivity product (MYD21), the impact of VZA on TES-derived surface temperature and emissivity products was analyzed. Additionally, longwave radiation data and broadband emissivity were employed to calculate surface temperature. Based on this analysis, a ratio correction method was proposed to convert satellite-observed thermal infrared radiance to nadir radiance, taking desert regions as a case study. The results demonstrated that for MODIS band 29 (8.55 μm), when VZA = 48.5°, the bias improved from −1.49 to 0.64, and from −2.05 to 0.84, while the corresponding RMSE decreased from 1.51 to 0.89, and from 2.08 to 1.17 (10⁻⁷ W·cm⁻²·sr⁻¹·cm⁻¹) for Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) and Bottom-Of-Atmosphere (BOA) radiance, respectively. When VZA = 35.2°, the bias improved from −0.32 to 0.12, and from −0.14 to 0.15, and the RMSE decreased from 0.72 to 0.69, and from 0.95 to 0.90 (10⁻⁷ W·cm⁻²·sr⁻¹·cm⁻¹) for TOA and BOA radiance, respectively. The method proves to be more suitable when VZA > 40°."

    "abstract": "The continuous real-time estimation of gait phase is a critical element for achieving natural synchronization between the user and the powered prosthesis. Traditional phase variable methods based on the unilateral thigh angle and its derivative or integral exhibit inherent limitations in nonlevel terrains (e.g., inclines and stairs), mainly attributed to the unequal positive and negative part area of single-leg angle curves and the phase shift between these curves and the standard cosine function. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a synchronized orthogonal gait phase estimation method based on inter-thigh angle. Based on the symmetry inherent in the synergistic locomotion of two legs, this study uses the inter-thigh angle as a phase variable candidate, whose intrinsic symmetry compensation mechanism directly eliminates the limitation of unequal positive and negative part area of the single-leg angle curve. By further implementing a zero-crossing-aligned gait cycle partitioning strategy, the proposed framework effectively overcomes the phase shift problem prevalent in conventional methods. Additionally, this study generates orthogonal cosine signals based on the inter-thigh angle, fundamentally circumventing the noise sensitivity inherent in thigh angle differential while suppressing drift errors associated with thigh angle integral, thereby improving the accuracy of gait phase estimation. Experimental results across various locomotion scenarios, including inclines, stairs, and speed variations, demonstrate that compared to time-based estimations and traditional phase variable methods, the proposed method reduces gait phase estimation errors by 33.88% and 65.09% respectively through symmetry compensation and phase correction."

    "abstract": "We study the rate-distortion function (RDF) for sampled cyclostationary Gaussian processes with memory, representing, e.g., the sampling of communications signals for the subsequent application of digital processing. Accounting for the inherent random jitter in local oscillators and keeping the sampling interval smaller than the memory length of the continuous-time (CT) source process to facilitate reliable modeling, induce a discrete-time (DT) wide-sense almost cyclostationary (WSACS) process with memory model upon the sampled signals. The main challenge follows from the information-instability of DT WSACS processes, which renders conventional information-theoretic approaches inapplicable. We use the information-spectrum framework to study the compression of incoming source sequences in two settings: when processing starts immediately upon reception and when a bounded delay exists between consecutive source sequences. Our analysis provides novel insights relating source memory, sampling frequency synchronization, and achievable compression rates.We show that, contrary to the sampled stationary case, the RDF for sampled cyclostationary processes is very sensitive to sampling rate synchronization. We also demonstrate that the RDF is not a monotonically decreasing function for the sampling rate and how introducing delay simplifies the compression scheme and lowers the rates."

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success in solving real-world problems using both static and dynamic graph data. While static graphs remain constant, dynamic graphs evolve over time, presenting unique challenges that necessitate integrating GNN computations with sequential models. Despite advancements, existing research has primarily focused on static graphs, with dynamic graphs receiving comparatively less attention. This study extends the investigation of over-squashing—a phenomenon where excessive information compression leads to the loss of distant node information—from static to dynamic graphs. Over-squashing is exacerbated in dynamic graphs due to the combined compression of spatial and temporal information into narrow time windows. To address this issue, we propose the spatial and temporal compensation model for dynamic graphs, which is theoretically validated and incorporates two key modules: the structural similarity-based spatial compensation (SSSC) module and the representation and trend similarity-based temporal compensation (RTSTC) module. The former module mitigates spatial information loss by leveraging structural similarities among nodes, while the latter module addresses temporal information loss by integrating historical data and trends. The extensive experiments on real-world dynamic graph datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.

    "abstract": "Owing to the huge success of generative artificial intelligence (AI), large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a core subclass, powering applications such as question answering, text generation, and code completion. While fine-tuning these models on domain-specific data can yield significant performance gains, it also poses daunting computational challenges, especially for researchers and organizations with limited hardware resources. Although SSD offloading (i.e., ZeRO-Infinity) has emerged as a viable strategy to overcome the GPU memory barrier via leveraging both system memory (i.e., CPU DRAM) and storage space (i.e., solid-state devices, SSDs), its design primarily targets model-centric performance issues. As a result, key system-level issues, including system memory fragmentation, inefficient pinned buffer allocation, peak system memory usage spikes, and file system overhead, remain unaddressed, limiting scalability and inflating costs. Such an observation motivates this paper to introduce MemAscend, a framework that systematically tackles the underexplored system memory bottlenecks in SSD-offloaded LLM training, with a focus on resource-constrained environments. By streamlining pinned-memory allocation, eradicating fragmentation, and mitigating peak system memory usage, MemAscend reclaims a substantial system memory budget, enabling larger models, longer context windows, and higher batch sizes without exceeding modest hardware limits. Across diverse LLM benchmarks, MemAscend reduces peak system-memory consumption by an average of 55.7% compared with state-of-the-art SSD offloading techniques, lowering the hardware barrier for fine-tuning and unlocking new possibilities for cost-effective large-scale training on limited-resource machines."

    "abstract": "Underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) is a key technology for supporting information transmission in the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT). Recently, semantic communication has been introduced into UWOC systems to enhance transmission efficiency and robustness. However, existing underwater wireless optical semantic communication (UWOSC) systems overlook the bandwidth limitation imposed by practical optoelectronic devices, which hinders high-speed semantic information transmission. In this paper, we introduce orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation into the UWOSC system for the first time, and design a novel OFDM-based UWOSC system with symbol and power loading (SPL). In the proposed system, shifted-window-based hierarchical vision transformer blocks are employed to extract semantic features and encode them into frequency-domain baseband symbols for OFDM transmission. Furthermore, an SPL scheme, comprising an entropy model-driven symbol reordering strategy and a lightweight power allocation network, is designed to adaptively allocate subcarriers and power based on semantic importance and channel conditions. Experiments conducted on an emulated UWOC platform demonstrate that the proposed OFDM-based UWOSC system achieves superior performance compared with baseline schemes under high transmission bandwidth scenarios. Moreover, the introduction of the SPL module further improves semantic spectrum efficiency, effectively mitigating the adverse impact of low-pass characteristic inherent in bandwidth-limited UWOSC systems. These results demonstrate that the proposed system has strong potential to enable high-speed semantic communication in the IoUT."

    "abstract": "Difference-aware Medical Visual Question Answering (MVQA) aims to answer questions regarding disease-related content and the visual differences between the paired medical images, which is crucial for assessing disease progression and guiding further treatment planning. Although current medical Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promising results in MVQA, they still exhibit poor generalization performance in difference-aware MVQA due to two key challenges. Firstly, existing difference-aware MVQA datasets are biased toward temporal variations of individual diseases, limiting their ability to model multi-disease coexistence and overlapping symptoms in real-world clinical scenarios. Secondly, disease-level semantic alignment becomes more challenging with multi-image inputs, as they introduce more redundant and interfering visual features. To address the first challenge, we introduce DAMON-QA, a large-scale difference-aware MVQA dataset designed to support visual difference analysis across multiple diseases.

As data-driven approaches to materials development are attracting increasing attention, two major challenges remain: the limited availability of polymer data and the complex hierarchical structures of polymers. In this study, we conduct high-throughput quantum chemistry calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using a single force field for approximately 5,500 homopolymers to construct a dataset of computed polymer properties. We develop machine learning models to predict MD-calculated polymer properties using quantum chemistry-derived physical quantities and MD force field parameters as descriptors. We also compare their performance with models using structural descriptors. While interpolation performance is comparable between molecular structure–based models, including a fingerprint model and a graph convolutional neural network, and models using quantum chemistry and MD force-field descriptors, the latter shows superior extrapolation performance in our evaluated setting for MD-computed density. In addition, we confirm that increasing the amount of data improves the accuracy of both interpolation and extrapolation predictions. The polymer dataset and predictive approach proposed in this study may help inform computational screening toward the development of high-performance polymer materials; experimental validation remains necessary."

To address the problem, we develop an efficient iterative algorithm based on block coordinate descent (BCD) scheme and a novel convex approximation method, which converges to a high-quality solution efficiently.

In this work, we introduce DaVinci, a unified framework that employs multi‑modal guidance prediction with neural networks to generate routing directives explicitly guided by performance objectives. By combining detailed layout cost maps with netlist connectivity using a heterogeneous message‑passing architecture and multi‑scale feature extraction, DaVinci incorporates performance gradients directly into the routing process. This integration enables the model to capture both local and global circuit interactions, aligning routing decisions with post-layout performance targets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms conventional approaches, delivering enhanced routing quality and design efficiency."

Often certain microscopic anomalies that are overlapped or hidden by high-frequency substrates go unnoticed. This work presents a detailed optimization pipeline customized specifically to integrate data-driven optimization and architectural refinement to attain better detection rates and accuracy. The uniqueness of this work is in the integrated pipeline that combines a multi-stage adaptive optimization process with an FGA-integrated YOLOv12 training script. So as to enhance representational focus and suppress background noise in complex PCB imagery. The framework begins with an adaptive hyperparameter optimization loop, where, 50 mini-training trials were conducted to empirically identify an optimal parameter set, specific to PCBs. This is followed by a model training phase, where the optimized configuration is utilized to train a high-capacity YOLOv12-Large model using 5-fold cross-validation, for up to 200 epochs. Further, aggressive data augmentation and early stopping mechanisms were implemented to ensure generalization of the model.

Selective phase compensation is applied only to the final resonant term, avoiding anti-resonant effects commonly associated with full compensation schemes. To address practical implementation challenges, an artificial intelligence-based evaluation framework is introduced to automate the selection of discretization methods for individual resonant components, ensuring high-fidelity digital realization. The stability and performance of the proposed controller are analyzed using frequency-domain and stability criteria. Experimental validation is carried out on two different inverter topologies, namely a three-level three-phase T-type converter and a single-phase H-bridge inverter, demonstrating accurate current tracking, effective harmonic suppression, and robust operation under practical conditions."
