    "abstract": "Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) play a crucial role in visiting task points to support sector surveillance and maintain environmental and operational stability in mountainous mission patrols. Completing UAV patrol missions requires determining an optimal sequence for visiting task points and planning feasible paths to ensure the UAV safety in the presence of diverse peaks, valleys, and infeasible regions in mountainous environments. To address these issues, we propose a dual-population evolution-based collaborative optimization algorithm (DECOA) for coordinated UAV mission patrol, encompassing both UAV task assignment and path planning, in mountainous environments. First, we design a comprehensive model to represent mountainous environments accurately. Then, DECOA is proposed to address the UAV mission patrol optimization problem using a population-evolution framework applied to the constructed model. In DECOA, two distinct particle encoding schemes are introduced to efficiently convert task assignment and path planning solutions in UAV mission patrol models into representations suitable for optimization processing. Additionally, a dynamic dual-population search strategy is devised to balance exploration and exploitation capabilities. To enhance the global search capability of DECOA in promising regions, an adaptive collaboration mechanism is proposed. Furthermore, to evaluate the performance of DECOA, various scenarios are designed to conduct extensive experiments, focusing on UAV task assignment, path planning, and coordinated mission patrol. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm and validate the effectiveness of the designed test scenarios."

Thus, a scientific analysis is shown based on values plotted and compared with mathematical and statistical results that helped to predict the behavior of the same. This analysis shows that the behavioral pattern of the STA max variable presents a positive trend, whose values constantly exceed 37° C starting in 1989 and continues with this trend until the end of the period (2021). A similar trend to that observed could show high values, which would exceed the limits recommended by the WHO for the safety of people and other living organisms. The regression analysis allowed us to find a forecast with similar characteristics and a positive trend of the slope. Therefore, it can be corroborated that the graphical analysis and the mathematical and statistical analysis of the STAmax variable are scientifically valid to verify the behavior of this variable according to its constant and continuous increase in the ZCVB."

Identifying the precise source location and controlloop origin of such oscillations is critical for timely mitigation. This paper presents a robust spectral energyflow algorithm for FO source localization and type classification at the equipment sub-controller level. The proposed method utilizes a cycle-based sliding window approach to compute cross-spectral energy terms between active/reactive power and frequency/voltage signals, including <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{P} \\boldsymbol{\\omega}}, \\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{P v}}, \\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{Q} \\boldsymbol{\\omega}}$</tex>, and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{Q v}}$</tex>. A composite index is formulated to identify the FO source location, while relative energy dominance among the spectral terms is used to classify the FO as either P-type (active power driven) or Qtype (reactive power driven). The algorithm is evaluated on a synthetic 2000-bus ERCOT test system under various local and inter-area resonance conditions. Results demonstrate accurate localization and reliable source type identification across all test scenarios, including challenging resonance cases. The proposed method offers a practical and computationally efficient solution for real-time oscillation monitoring and diagnosis in large-scale power systems."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an approach for super-resolution of images corrupted by impulse noise by integrating iterative image reconstruction with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). While CNNs are widely used for image super-resolution, they often fail to perform when the input is severely degraded by noise. To address this, pixels with extreme values are first identified as outliers and set to zero, applying an L-estimation based compressive sensing filter to treat them as missing. By doing so, the task is shifted from a traditional denoising problem to a signal recovery problem. A convex optimization-based gradient-descent algorithm is considered to recover the image, providing higher quality input for further processing within the CNN and enabling more effective network performance. The experimental results verify theoretical considerations, showing high performance of the proposed method with PSNR values ranging from 30.90 to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$34.88 \\mathbf{~ d B}$</tex> and SSIM values between 0.89 and 0.91 on images corrupted with 20 % salt-and-pepper noise."

    "abstract": "Cloud computing underpins modern information systems, offering scalable and flexible resource management. The massive volume of system logs renders manual monitoring impractical, and real-time error resolution often requires costly human intervention. Proactive anomaly detection offers a scalable solution by leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. This study investigates the use of BERT embeddings to represent cloud log data for automated error detection, with AdaBoost classifiers serving as the predictive model. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using metaheuristic optimization, with a modified self-adaptive algorithm (AB-ISASCHO) based on the sinh-cosh algorithm (SCHA) is introduced. Experimental evaluation on real-world cloud log datasets demonstrates that AB-ISASCHO outperforms standard SCHA and other metaheuristics, achieving near-perfect classification metrics and stable objective function scores. The results indicate that integrating BERT embeddings with adaptive metaheuristic tuning substantially enhances both accuracy and reliability, providing an effective methodology for large-scale, automated anomaly detection in cloud computing environments."

    "abstract": "Optimization methods are fundamental to machine learning, with Gradient Descent (GD) being one of the most widely used first-order algorithm. However, GD's convergence can be slow for ill-conditioned problems. Two common strategies to accelerate it are: (1) Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG), which uses a momentum term to achieve an optimal rate of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathcal{O}\\left(1 / k^{2}\\right)$</tex> for convex functions, and (2) backtracking line-search, which dynamically adapts the step size to enable faster periteration progress. The paper presents a comparative analysis of GD and NAG under both fixed and backtracking step-size strategies. Using a controlled linear regression model, we systematically investigate their performance across different condition numbers and degrees of strong convexity. Our key finding reveals a performance trade-off: in the strongly convex regime, GD with backtracking converges faster than both NAG variants. Conversely, for merely convex problems, NAG maintains its theoretical superiority. These results provide practical guidance for selecting an optimization algorithm based on problem convexity."

Accurate SOC and capacity estimations are essential for optimizing battery performance and longevity. Traditional methods often fall short in addressing the nonlinear dynamics and capacity degradation inherent in modern battery systems. This study investigates the implementation and comparative performance of the UKF alongside the traditional KF within an event-based framework for SOC and capacity estimation. Utilizing a sophisticated simulated battery model that reflects real-world conditions including thermal effects and charge-discharge cycles, the study demonstrates that the integration of UKF and KF significantly outperforms existing methods. The UKF, in tandem with KF, achieves an SOC estimation accuracy within 0.6% of actual values and enhances capacity estimation accuracy by approximately 10% compared to conventional approaches. The findings highlight the potential of employing both UKF and KF to substantially improve the accuracy, efficiency, and reliability of battery management systems. ensuring better energy utilization and extending the operational lifespan of battery-dependent applications."

By comprehensively considering both conventional scenarios and extreme temperature events, a collaborative expansion planning model for distributed renewable energy sources and pumped storage power stations is proposed. The optimal planning capacity is determined through an iterative solution of a bi-level model, and the effectiveness and economic feasibility of the proposed planning scheme are validated through case studies."

These issues may hinder the factory’s ability to scale up to larger production industries. This project addresses these issues by developing an automated quality control system using Reed switches controlled by a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). The system enhances inspection accuracy, reduces processing time, and improves overall product quality. This system operates by utilizing a reed switch to detect the characteristics of products. If a product conforms to the predefined template, the Reed switch is activated. Conversely, if the product exhibits any protrusions or deformities, the reed switch remains inactive. When a product fails to meet the specified quality standards, the PLC processes the inspection data and transmits a signal to the automated sorting mechanism to promptly remove the non-compliant item from the production line. A test conducted with a total of $\\mathbf{1 5 0}$ randomly selected products, consisting of both good items and defective items with defect sizes of $1 \\mathrm{~mm}, 2 \\mathrm{~mm}$, and 3 mm. The average inspection cycle is 10.53 seconds with a 33% failure rate merely on 1 mm due to mechanical problems of excessive pneumatic pressure.

    "abstract": "Industry 4.0 applications require deterministic, low-latency and low-jitter communication. Ethernet, when augmented with Time Sensitive Networking standards like Time Aware Shaper (TAS), meets these requirements. For TAS to function accurately, precise network-wide time synchronization is required. However, due to clock drift of network devices, there can still be timing misalignment between devices, disrupting the TAS mechanism and compromising determinism. In our previous work, we proposed adjustment-based scheduling mechanisms that adjust TAS time slots to ensure deterministic latency and zero jitter. Despite their advantages, the approaches can be bandwidth inefficient compared to other forms of scheduling mechanisms. However, their efficiency can be improved by varying the synchronization periodicity.In this paper, we present a novel method to compute the optimal synchronization periodicity in a given network by balancing the synchronization overhead and the time-sensitive bandwidth requirement. This trade-off enables improvement of the overall network bandwidth efficiency without compromising determinism. Further it reveals the existence of an optimal operating region, a range of synchronization periodicity intervals where the network overhead cost remains low and stable. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through simulation-based case studies in realistic network scenarios. Compared to using the default synchronization periodicity value defined by IEEE standards, the proposed method reduces the overall network capacity overhead by up to 72% and 55% for the two scheduling method variants examined in this study."

    "abstract": "Orthogonal Time-Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation is a promising technique for wireless communication in high-mobility environments, especially for future 6G wireless systems. Unlike Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), which sends data in the time-frequency domain, OTFS works in the delay-Doppler domain, where the channel appears more stable and easier to handle. For OTFS to work well, pulse shaping in the time domain is crucial as it affects the communication system’s capability to manage interference and effectively utilize the available bandwidth. Conventional pulse shapes like rectangular, raised cosine, and Gaussian are easy to implement but often lead to Inter-carrier Interference (ICI) and Out of Band (OoB) power leakage, which lowers the communication system’s performance. In this paper, we propose new time-limited Nyquist pulse shapes generated by convolving existing time-domain Nyquist pulses, such as the Double Jump (DJ1) pulse with Better Than Raised Cosine (BTRC) and Gaussian pulse. These new pulses aim to reduce ICI and improve the system performance. Through exhaustive numerical results, we show that for an OTFS communication systems, the proposed pulses outperform the traditional ones in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER) and Peak-to -Average Ratio (PAPR)."

    "abstract": "In this article, both the stator and rotor sides of the slip-ring induction motor (SRIM) are controlled using two distinct direct torque control (DTC) strategies, resulting in a dual DTC (DDTC) architecture. The SRIM is treated as a combination of two independent virtual induction machines (IMs), where each IM is operated individually through the stator and rotor terminals, respectively. In this work, a current model-based approach is employed to estimate the stator and rotor fluxes, which eliminates the need for conventional integration-based flux estimation and enabling more efficient digital implementation. Moreover, a flux sharing strategy based on the minimization of total copper losses is proposed to enhance the flux control performance. Further, field-weakening (FW)-based control is investigated under the DDTC scheme, wherein the motor is operated up to 2.2 per unit (pu) speed, with a base speed of 2 pu, in a doubly fed configuration. A flux-sharing mechanism based on airgap and leakage fluxes is considered to determine the appropriate magnitudes of the stator and rotor fluxes. The proposed DDTC approach is experimentally validated using a 2.2 kW SRIM test setup."

    "abstract": "Extreme device connectivity and high energy efficiency are top requirements for massive machine type communication (mMTC), which can be satisfied by cell free Massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) proposed in 6G. Grant-Free Random Access (GFRA) is an attractive access scheme for MTC traffic characterized by random short data transmissions. In CF-mMIMO systems configured with limited number of pilots chances of pilot collisions increase rapidly with increase in the number of MTC devices resulting in degradation of communication performance. In this paper we propose modified GFRA protocol with collision resolution for CF-mMIMO (GFRA-CR- CFM). The proposed protocol consists of two solution components; dominant AP-based pilot assignment and introduction of a new control signal for collision resolution to separate resources between colliding and non-colliding users of the same AP. The simulation results show that GFRA-CR-CFM achieves more than 20% improvement for mean per-user throughput performance compared to GFRA. The 95th percentile likelihood per user throughput performance of GFRA-CR-CFM is significantly improved by more than 4X times compared to GFRA."

Despite these benefits, aspiring 5G terrestrial networks pose critical interference and coexistence challenges for incumbent, in-band, and susceptible satellite (SAT) Digital Broadcasting Stations (DVB-S2). This paper leverages directional beam control and power adaptation through a spectrum sharing framework, minimizing interference on terrestrial SAT receivers. Opposing traditionally rigid spectrum sharing regulations, our framework implements an efficient and reproducible Joint Q-Learning algorithm through a Software-Defined Radio (SDR) emulation on the COSMOS testbed. Evaluating this model against realistic 5G transmission parameters and ETSI Rural Macro case study, a notable highlight of our method is demonstrated through the DVB-S2 Receiver Packet Error Rate (PER), restoring up to 98% of the DVB-S2 link’s ideal performance through coordinated Radio Resource Management (RRM). Furthermore, our model sustains a maximum of 48% standalone 5G network capacity in the presence of SAT downlink, showcasing acceptable coexistence despite simultaneous band usage."

Focusing on a hydrogen-based energy storage system, this study investigates potential optimizations by integrating batteries to improve system efficiency, stability, and cost effectiveness. Simulations are used to analyze the impact of different system configurations and operational strategies on design, performance, and economics, providing insights to guide the development of efficient and resilient storage solutions for smoother integration of renewable energy sources into future energy systems."

    "abstract": "Smart parking systems typically use red and green LEDs to show space occupancy, but this constant operation leads to continuous power consumption. A minimalist LED framework has been proposed, where only green LEDs signal available spaces, eliminating indications for occupied spots. Simulations with 5-watt LED modules show over 40% energy savings during high occupancy. For a 500 -space parking lot, this approach conserves about 8,800 kWh annually, surpassing 7,225 kWh. Scaling this to 100,000 spaces in a smart city can save over 1.7 million kWh each year, equivalent to more than $144,000. This strategy significantly reduces reliance on electricity from fossil fuels, improving sustainability. The minimalist LED control model is both cost-effective and environmentally friendly, with the potential to scale from local to global levels."

    "abstract": "Future communication technologies are anticipated to facilitate applications necessitating extremely high data speeds while maintaining energy efficiency. In this regard, hexagonal quadrature amplitude modulation (HQAM) is an attractive technique to achieve high-rate transmission without increasing the bandwidth, due to its dense arrangement of symbols on the two-dimensional plane. Nonetheless, due to its hexagonal lattice structure, accurately assessing the error probability is challenging, if not unfeasible. This paper presents a detailed analysis of the average symbol error probability (ASEP) for HQAM over generalized Nakagami-m fading channels. The study considers both integer and non-integer values of the fading parameter m, which models various multipath fading conditions. HQAM is evaluated for its error performance and spectral efficiency relative to conventional QAM formats. Analytical approximations and numerical methods are employed to derive ASEP expressions under diverse fading scenarios. The results indicate that HQAM maintains lower ASEP across a wide signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range, even in severe fading. This demonstrates its robustness and suitability for deployment in practical wireless systems. The analysis confirms HQAM as a viable alternative for efficient communication over Nakagami-m fading channels."

    "abstract": "The adoption of renewable energy sources (RES) is increasing rapidly due to their negligible carbon emissions and environmental sustainability. With rising population and continuous technological advancements, the global demand for electricity is also escalating significantly. The integration of RES into conventional power systems offers a promising approach to meet this demand. However, despite their environmental benefits, RES integration introduces several technical challenges, including power quality issues, fault ride-through (FRT) capability, power balance control, and protection concerns. This paper presents a simulation-based study on the impacts of photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy systems on power quality parameters in a radial distribution network. The analysis focuses on key issues such as voltage and power fluctuations, voltage profile deviations, and harmonic distortions. To address these challenges, a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) comprising a battery and a supercapacitor is employed to enhance power quality. The performance of the proposed HESS is further compared with that of a conventional distributed static synchronous compensator (D-STATCOM). All simulations are conducted in the MATLAB/Simulink environment."

This report details the clinical course, management, and recovery of a 23 -year-old male survivor of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with obesity, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and prediabetes, who developed severe AH after only two years of social drinking. The case is contextualized within the current epidemiology, pathophysiology, and guideline recommendations, highlighting the synergistic hepatotoxicity of metabolic dysfunction and alcohol, and underscoring the need for vigilance and preventive counseling in at-risk young adults. This case underscores the need for targeted surveillance and preventive counseling in cancer survivors, who represent a growing population at risk for alcohol-related liver disease due to improved long-term survival. By identifying these individuals early and integrating multidisciplinary care, there is potential to prevent severe outcomes and reduce healthcare burden. Current ACG and AASLD guidelines provide limited direction for atypical populations such as young cancer survivors. Our case suggests an urgent need to expand guideline frameworks to include this emerging high-risk subgroup. ()"

The wavelet-enhanced graph neural network utilizes graph wavelet-based filtering to produce spatially localized state estimates, capturing subtle variations in network conditions despite measurement imperfections. Sparse residual techniques then extract topology-related disturbances by treating line flow changes as sparse signals amidst noise. The proposed method demonstrates superior accuracy and resilience compared to traditional approaches when tested on realistic distribution system scenarios."

We investigate the use of feature extraction and regressor-based machine learning methods for predicting power consumption in virtualized open radio access networks (O-RANs), utilizing datasets from a hardware-instrumented testbed. We test three variants of deep neural networks (DNNs), namely, a standard DNN, a regularized DNN, and a hybrid model combining DNN-based feature extraction with an XGBoost regressor. We evaluate the performance of these models for various system parameters such as transmission gain, modulation/coding schemes, and airtime. We show that the hybrid model consistently outperformed others, achieving a mean relative error below 0.5%. Results suggest hybrid models like DNN-XGBoost offer superior accuracy and could be integrated into O-RAN management tools to enable more energy-efficient network orchestration in future networks."

    "abstract": "Wind turbines play a critical role in the shift toward sustainable energy generation. Their operation relies on multiple interconnected components, and a failure in any of these can compromise the entire system's functionality. Detecting faults accurately is challenging due to the intricate, non-linear, and non-stationary nature of vibration signals, influenced by dynamic loading, environmental variations, and mechanical interactions. As such, effective signal processing techniques are essential for extracting meaningful features to enhance diagnostic accuracy. This study presents a hybrid approach for fault detection in wind turbine gearboxes, combining Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) and a Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network (MSCNN). CEEMDAN is employed to decompose vibration signals into intrinsic mode functions, isolating critical features at different time-frequency scales. These are then input into the MSCNN, which performs deep hierarchical feature extraction and classification. The proposed method achieves an F1 Score of 98.95 %, evaluated on real-world datasets, and demonstrates superior performance in both detection accuracy and computational speed compared to existing approaches. This framework offers a balanced solution for reliable and efficient fault diagnosis in wind turbine systems."

This work presents YEGI, a customization of LLaMA 3.2 small language model (SLM) designed for the automatic summarization of scientific articles. The system integrates REST-like APIs and a web interface that allows for PDF document uploads, processes them, and returns tuned summaries with the help of tunable hyperparameters (temperature, top_p, repeat penalty, repeat_last_n, and num_predict). The methodology employs the CRISP-ML(Q) model, ranging from scope delimitation to testing with standard metrics such as ROUGE. Experimental results demonstrate that YEGI achieves competitive performance compared to both commercial and open-source LLMs (Gemini, ChatGPT, ChatPDF, and Deepseek). In particular, Gemini outperformed YEGI by more than 50%, ChatGPT by less than 30%, ChatPDF achieved comparable results, and YEGI surpassed Deepseek by over 5%. Even when operating in a local environment with limited resources and SLM, YEGI maintains robust performance, highlighting its efficiency and adaptability."

    "abstract": "Deep learning has been widely used in intelligent vehicle perception systems, but its vulnerability to adversarial attacks poses a serious threat to system security. Especially in the physical world, existing adversarial camouflage attacks often face problems such as poor cross-model transferability and visual unnaturalness, which limits their practical feasibility and concealment. To this end, this paper proposes a transferable adversarial camouflage generation method based on multi-layer topology adjustment. Based on the three-dimensional model of the vehicle, this method constructs a multi-layer attention graph and uses depth-first search (DFS) to generate a connectivity graph of the attention region. By adjusting the topological structure of the graph, the perturbation is guided to be reasonably distributed in different attention layers, thereby improving the interference effect on multiple detection models. At the same time, smoothness loss and unprintability loss are introduced to enhance the naturalness and feasibility of camouflage in physical scenes. Extensive experiments in digital and physical test environments show that this method significantly improves the cross-model transfer performance while maintaining the effectiveness of the attack. In the physical attack task, compared with the existing methods, the attack success rates on Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN and Deformable DETR reached 56.3%, 48.5% and 93.4% respectively, all achieving the best performance."

    "abstract": "Pseudorandom sequence (PRS) offers a rapid impedance measurement solution for lithium-ion batteries. However, PRS suffers from limited accuracy in the mid-to-low frequency range due to the low power content and sparse distribution of harmonics. Motivated by this, a parallel quadratic residue ternary signal with an almost theoretical minimum measurement time is proposed. By enhancing the power in mid-to-low frequency band, the first few low-frequency impedance points can be accurately obtained without any additional filters. Moreover, a two-stage filter with an iterative procedure is introduced, which eliminates outliers using a predefined threshold and obtains the filtered impedance through Fourier series fitting. Experimental validation proves that the proposed method achieves a max normalized root means square error of 0.59% and max absolute residual of 0.48% under various states of charge, states of health and temperatures, confirming its effectiveness for impedance measurement."

The control strategy is based on the theory of discrete-time sliding mode control to ensure robustness against parameter variations and external disturbances. The output voltage regulation is achieved using a digital controller that combines discrete-time first-order sliding mode control with a discrete-time realization of the super-twisting algorithm, commonly used in second-order sliding mode control. The design of the proposed controller is performed using a discrete-time model of the DC-DC buck converter. Extensive simulations were conducted in Matlab/Simulink to validate the performance of the control algorithm under varying load conditions and input voltage fluctuations. A comparative study between conventional PI controller and the proposed discrete-sliding mode based controller in tracking of various voltage references under action of disturbances is given."

    "abstract": "Deep hashing uses binary code to represent images with fast computation speed and efficient storage. Due to the increasing prevalence of long-tailed data in real life, traditional hashing methods are no longer applicable because their training is biased toward head-class samples and ignores tail-class samples. Recently, several long-tailed hashing methods have been proposed. However, current long-tailed hashing methods do not fully explore the extra-class and inter-class relationships within long-tailed data when learning class centers.However, current long-tailed hashing methods use an equal-weighted cross-entropy form in their loss functions and do not adjust the class weights to account for the long-tailed distribution. Due to the small number of samples in the tail classes, the head classes still dominate the gradient updates, and these methods do not fully explore the extra-class and interclass relationships within long-tailed data when learning class centers. To this end, we propose a novel Implicitly Enhanced Long-tailed Hashing with LVQ Dynamic Weighted network (LDWN) for long-tailed hashing. Specifically, we propose using the LVQ (Learning Vector Quantization) algorithm to learn class centers. The centers generated by LVQ utilize the information between each sample of lang-tailed data and the same of different classes, improving the representation ability of tail categories. At the same time, we propose a dynamic weighted network that dynamically learns the weights of each category and improves the weights of tail categories during model training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms numerous deep hashing models and recent long-tailed hashing methods."

The Eigensystem Realization Algorithm (ERA) identified the first six natural frequencies and mode shapes, which were validated using the Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC) matrix. A parametric ANSYS model compared to compare three parameter identification methods: (1) least squares optimization of an isotropic model; (2) RSM optimization of an isotropic model; and (3) RSM optimization of an orthotropic model incorporating parameter sensitivity analysis with Kriging modeling. Results demonstrate that the orthotropic model achieved a 2.19% average frequency error, significantly outperforming optimized isotropic models. It also exhibited superior correlation with the experimental mode shapes. This approach accurately captures PCB laminate dynamic characteristics, providing a basis for the dynamic design of pressure scanner valve PCBs."

According to traditional Chinese medicine theory, appropriate stimulation of specific acupoints on the hand can promote blood circulation, relieve inflammation, and reduce muscle fatigue. In this study, we designed and implemented an STM32 microcontroller -controlled massage glove for tendon sheath inflammation therapy. The glove employs a gear - rack transmission mechanism to drive massage heads for precise acupoint pressure, enabling multi level force adjustment and multiple automatic massage modes. The system consists of a hardware actuation module, sensor feedback unit, main control chip, driver circuit, and human - machine interface, and incorporates graded pressure control and a time-based safety protection mechanism to ensure safe and comfortable operation. Experimental results demonstrate that the device is compact, easy to wear, and offers adjustable massage effects, indicating its potential for home healthcare and rehabilitation assistance."

    "abstract": "Recently, environmental pollution caused inadequate plastic waste management have highlighted the need for sustainable solutions that can transform waste into high-value materials for structural applications. In this study, we present recycled low-density polyethylene (rLDPE) composites reinforced with natural Isoberlina fiber, which enhances mechanical performance and industrial viability. The rLDPE compounds reinforced with Isoberlina fiber were produced following standard compounding and molding procedures in accordance with ASTM/ISO standards. We characterized these compounds using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) to assess their temperature resistance. Additionally, we evaluated various properties of the materials, including density, water absorption, tensile strength, elasticity, flexural strength, Shore hardness, and creep behavior. inadequate plastic waste management has necessitated sustainable solutions that transform waste into materials with high added value for structural applications. Composites with 50 % fiber by weight exhibited the best performance, characterized by a tensile strength of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\approx$</tex> approximately 71 MPa, a stiffness modulus of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\approx$</tex> approximately 3.89 GPa, a flexural strength of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\approx$</tex> roughly 77.1 MPa, and a hardness of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\approx$</tex> approximately 68.6 Shore.

The loss modulus decreased with increasing temperature and frequency, suggesting lower viscous dissipation and better matrix-fiber load transfer. In creep tests, the reinforced composite exhibited a longer equilibrium time (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\approx$</tex> approximately 37.6 min) and a lower deformation rate than the unreinforced rLDPE. The use of Isoberlina natural fiber improves LDPE waste, resulting in high-performance composites with enhanced mechanical, dynamic, and service properties. This approach provides a technical and scalable method for transforming plastic waste into lightweight structural components, supporting circular economy strategies and replacing conventional materials in non-critical applications."

    "abstract": "Due to the shortage of peak demand, many residential consumers especially at rural locations, have poor grid connections (i.e. grid is available for a slot of few hours or multiple slots of a few hours in a day). The residential consumer has to live without electricity or must arrange their own power back up (i.e. battery or fuel generator) to supply building load during grid outage. This paper presents a demand side management scheme for a poorly grid connected residential building to switch ON/OFF the appliances in grid connected and isolated modes. The model is developed in the MATALB. The DSM response regulates the scheduling of appliances in a predictive and efficient way and kept the peak power within a predetermined limit. The results show that the DSM scheme reduces the building demand during peak hours of grid. Moreover, it also keeps the building demand curve more flatter during grid outage mode. The results show that DSM reduced the size of the battery and their capital cost as well as helping to grid during peak hours by reducing their load. Moreover, it increases the electricity reliability at low cost."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of affective computing, dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) has gradually become a key technology in applications such as human-computer interaction, intelligent surveillance, and virtual assistants. However, multimodal dynamic facial expression recognition in wild environments faces numerous challenges, including insufficient data diversity, modality inconsistency, and environmental complexity. To improve recognition accuracy and reduce reliance on large amounts of labeled data, transfer learning methods based on unimodal pretrained models have gained widespread attention in multimodal DFER. This approach leverages models pretrained on unimodal tasks, combining transfer learning techniques to apply them to multimodal tasks, effectively addressing the heterogeneity between different modalities and the lack of labeled data. Based on this idea, this paper systematically reviews the multimodal dynamic facial expression recognition methods based on unimodal pretrained model transfer, focusing on the key issues faced during transfer and analyzing and comparing different strategies for solving these problems. The discussion provides new directions and practical references for future research in the field of facial expression recognition, particularly in the application of transfer learning and modality alignment, aiming to promote the implementation of more accurate and robust expression recognition systems."

This phase compensated approach enhances the neural networks ability to learn PA memory effects and nonlinear characteristics from in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) inputs. The use of the h-Swish activation function further improves gradient stability and training efficiency while minimizing computational complexity. Experimental validation is conducted using a 100 MHz 5G NR test signal at 3.5 GHz transmitted through a wideband Doherty PA. The Results demonstrates a significant improvement, achieving an adjacent channel leakage ratio of - 52.81 dBc, an error vector magnitude of 2.49%, and a normalized mean square error of -38.13 dB.

    "abstract": "The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into smart grids presents unique opportunities to enhance both transportation systems and energy networks. However, ensuring safe and interpretable interactions between drivers, vehicles, and the surrounding environment remains a critical challenge. This paper presents a multi-modal large language model (LLM)-based framework to process multimodal sensor data-such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and vehicular telemetry-and generate natural-language alerts for drivers. The framework is validated using real-world data collected from instrumented vehicles driving on urban roads, ensuring its applicability to real-world scenarios. By combining visual perception (YOLOv8), geocoded positioning, and CAN bus telemetry, the framework bridges raw sensor data and driver comprehension, enabling safer and more informed decision-making in urban driving scenarios. Case studies using real data demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in generating context-aware alerts for critical situations, such as proximity to pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles. This paper highlights the potential of LLMs as assistive tools in e-mobility, benefiting both transportation systems and electric networks by enabling scalable fleet coordination, EV load forecasting, and traffic-aware energy planning."

While STAR-RIS technology, featuring simultaneous transmission and reflection capabilities, promises significant improvements in coverage and performance, its implementation suffers from CSI uncertainties. To overcome this, we propose a three-step channel estimation protocol specifically designed for STAR-RIS systems. Our approach optimally leverages UAV positioning and STAR-RIS capabilities to minimize normalized mean square error (NMSE). Simulation results highlight the proposed scheme’s superiority over benchmark methods under diverse configurations, including variations in path loss, UAV height, and trajectory adjustments. The findings highlight the scheme’s potential to enhance channel estimation accuracy and overall system reliability in next-generation wireless networks."

    "abstract": "Next-generation 6G communication systems are envisaged to support ultra-reliability and massive connectivity with sensing capabilities. Orthogonal chirp division multiplexing (OCDM) offers intrinsic benefits such as schemes that endorse pulse compression and spread spectrum in radar and communication systems. On the other hand, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a substantial scheme serving multiple users in the code-, time-, or frequency-domain. This paper proposes the integration of OCDM with downlink power-domain NOMA to leverage their complementary strengths—achieving enhanced reliability and connectivity. Using the Fresnel transform for OCDM, the average bit error rate (BER) results for the OCDMNOMA system are presented with imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) errors. The proposed systems’ BER performance is notably presented for downlink two-user NOMA systems with imperfect SIC errors. Monte-Carlo simulations of BER are shown for the aforesaid system over transmit SNR and power fraction coefficient variation."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the leakage rate performance of an untrusted reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted system under imperfect channel state information (CSI), resulting from channel estimation error (CEE) and feedback delay (FD). The study investigates a scenario in which a single mobile terminal communicating with a base station through an untrusted RIS operating in either passive or absorptive mode. To mitigate information leakage, a limited number of friendly jammers are deployed to interfere with the untrusted RIS. Outage probability is used as the performance metric to evaluate the system's leakage rate. Analytical and Monte Carlo simulation results reveal that CEE introduces coding gain losses in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, but its impact becomes negligible at high SNR. In contrast, F-D has no notable effect at low SNR but causes performance degradation in the high SNR regime. In both cases, friendly jammers contribute additional coding gain losses at high SNR. However, increasing the number of RIS reflecting elements significantly reduces these adverse effects. Finally, the results demonstrate that the untrusted RIS in passive mode outperforms the absorptive mode, primarily due to differences in the energy reflection coefficient."

    "abstract": "Unsupervised medical anomaly detection aims to identify abnormal images by training exclusively on normal samples, thereby enabling the detection of disease related irregularities without the need for large-scale labeled datasets. Current knowledge distillation-based methods typically detect anomalies by comparing feature discrepancies between teacher and student networks. However, because these methods employ an optimization strategy where the teacher and student architectures are highly similar, the student network's features tend to closely mirror those of the teacher, leading to an identity mapping issue. Moreover, the diversity of lesion types in retinal Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images further complicates anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid dual-heterogeneous knowledge distillation network to overcome these challenges. Our approach consists of a teacher network with an encoder-only architecture and a student network that integrates an encoder with dual decoders. This heterogeneous design effectively mitigates the identity mapping problem, enhancing sensitivity to both structural and logical anomalies. Specifically, our Multi Feature Model leverages convolutional and depthwise convolutional blocks to extract and integrate local features for structural anomaly detection, while the Mamba UpNet employs self-supervised learning to capture long-range dependencies and global anomaly patterns. Extensive experiments on two retinal OCT anomaly detection datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively handling diverse anomaly types.

    "abstract": "Due to the down-tilt of BS antennas to serve ground users in existing networks, aerial user equipments (AUEs) are only supported through the side lobes, which leads to insufficient aerial coverage. Fortunately, intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) possess the remarkable ability to offer extra signal power to enhance AUEs’ coverage. However, to fully realize the potential of the IRS, its deployment is contingent upon the radiation pattern of the BS which substantially modifies the network topology. This paper proposes a novel IRS-based network model to serve AUEs by constructing the virtual LoS air-to-ground links to provide targeted signal for AUEs, where IRSs are practically distributed in the BS main lobe to effectively utilize the BS radiation power. Specifically, the distribution of IRSs is modeled by a variant of the Matérn cluster process (MCP), based on which the correlated interference from BSs and IRSs introduced by their location correlation is theoretically characterized. Furthermore, based on a concise two-lobe model for BS antenna gain, the effective distribution area of IRSs is derived as a ring concentric with the cell, which exhibits tunability in accordance with the beamwidth and the tilt angle of the BS antenna. In addition, the framework is characterized for analyzing the correlated interference from BSs and IRSs through the accurate integration of the power correlation associated with both direct paths and IRS-reflected paths. Leveraging stochastic geometry, theoretical expressions of network metrics are derived on the IRS-assisted AUE networks. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, as manifested by the significant elevation in the coverage probability of AUEs by 67% when the number of elements per IRS hits <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i> = 2000."

    "abstract": "The capsizing of unmanned sailboats primarily results from strong winds, high waves, and improper maneuvering. However, most existing unmanned sailboat control approaches do not explicitly address roll dynamics or capsizing prevention. This paper investigates the capsizing prevention of an unmanned sailboat in the presence of the model uncertainties and unknown environmental disturbances. A safety-critical disturbance rejection control method is proposed to ensure the safe maneuvering of unmanned sailboat. Specifically, an extended state observer is presented to not only filter the velocity measurements, but also estimate the total disturbance composed by the model uncertainties and unknown environmental disturbances. By using the backstepping technology, the virtual guidance and control law is then derived. Both the control barrier function (CBF) and the input-to-state safe CBF are introduced to construct the safety condition. Based on the safety constraint, a quadratic programming problem is formulated to obtain an optimal safety-critical control law. Furthermore, the input-to-state stability of the closed-loop system is proven by Lyapunov theory, while its input-to-state safety is guaranteed. Comparative simulations under different disturbance scenarios using the developed high-fidelity unmanned sailboat model demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method in capsizing prevention."

    "abstract": "Brittle failure by crevasses and rifts formation is the most directly observable expression of stress state in glacier ice. Both satellite imagery and satellite altimetry are effective tools for characterizing them. However, the ice shelf surface exhibits non-fracture-related features that can appear similar to crevasses and rifts in images or elevation profiles, making it challenging to distinguish them using a single observational perspective. Here we combine satellite altimetry and satellite imagery to map these fracture features and provide their three-dimensional structure. During this process, we develop a novel algorithm for detecting and characterizing depressions on the ice surface using Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) L2A Global Geolocated Photon Data, Version 6 data set (ATL03). The strengths of the algorithm include estimation of surface elevation in 10 m along-track segments, broad applicability to different crevasse types, and robustness against surface irregularities. We apply this workflow to the Thwaites Eastern Ice Shelf (TEIS) as a case study and estimate the general depth and width of various crevasse types. Integrating altimetry with imagery, we find that V-shaped depressions, occurring at the early-stage of fracturing, could serve as an indicator of development of large-scale surface crevasses. Within the shear zone upstream of the pinning points, apart from shear failure, the ice surface also deforms due to strong compression, creating peaks a few meters high. This study highlights that including three-dimensional morphology in the detection and analysis of ice shelf crevasses and rifts improves the ability to distinguish between crevasse types and provides insights into ice shelf deformation."

Standard histological evaluation faces significant challenges that start from the intrinsic fragility of lymph node tissues, making them difficult to process and prepare for analysis, and from the subsequent manual review of slides, demanding extensive reading time from pathologists. There is a need of computer assisted diagnostic companion of the pathologist that provide objectivity and workflow efficacy. To address this, our study introduces an innovative approach that combines label-free imaging with machine learning (ML) for detection of metastatic invasions into lymph nodes. We utilized a Digital Holographic Microscope to obtain quantitative phase images (QPIs) of unstained samples. QPIs were cropped in superpixels that were classified with two supervised machine learning models (coarse and fine models) based on phase-shift parameters extracted from each superpixel. The ML-based procedure classified pixels with 97.91% Sensitivity and 98.62% Specificity into normal and invasion classes, and delineated invasion and areas with high suspicion grade from normal areas in segmented images. Our tool supports the clinicians in identifying malignant areas and focusing their expertise on the tumor boundaries, representing a step forward in computer-assisted cancer diagnosis."

These RICs collaborate for TS through a standardized A1 policy, known as the traffic steering preference (TSP), which enables the use of long- and short-term data that represent traffic, user equipment (UE), and cell characteristics. This collaboration facilitates adaptive TS that responds to dynamic network conditions when beneficial, while avoiding unnecessary adaptations that may degrade long-term performance. We develop a deep neural network (DNN)-based data-driven algorithm capable of capturing intricate relationships among heterogeneous features representing traffic, UE, and cell characteristics. In our algorithm, Non-RT RIC utilizes a DNN model with long-term data to generate the TSP, which is then delivered to Near-RT RIC. Near-RT RIC, in turn, jointly utilizes the received TSP with short-term data to adjust handover (HO) parameters. Through simulations, we show that our algorithm effectively performs adaptive TS by leveraging both long- and short-term data."

Probabilistic forecasts, which capture uncertainty, are increasingly vital for GW-scale plants due to their large spatial footprints and weather-driven variability. This article evaluates error metrics for assessing solar PV power forecasting accuracy, with a focus on the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) and its integration with ensemble forecasting methods. We analyze the suitability of CRPS, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and normalized variants for GW-scale applications, emphasizing their operational and economic implications. Through a case study of a 1 GW PV plant, we demonstrate CRPS's effectiveness in evaluating probabilistic forecasts derived from ensemble methods, such as Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) ensembles. The study provides actionable insights for grid operators and researchers, advocating for CRPS as a cornerstone metric for large-scale solar forecasting.

Experiments on the TIMIT speech corpus demonstrate that Graph-RelNet consistently outperforms a regression-based adaptation of GNN-SSL, while also surpassing conventional steered response power (SRP) with delay-and-sum (D&S) beamforming at medium and high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), especially in scenarios with few microphones.

Diagnosis through microscopic examination of blood samples by microbiologists is time-consuming and faces significant challenges in some regions due to economic constraints, lack of equipment, and the need for specialized laboratories and trained personnel. Artificial intelligence (AI) models play a critical role in early and accurate detection of malaria parasites, which is essential for effective treatment. In this study, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT)-based models are proposed for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum, one of the five species causing malaria in humans. Additionally, a VGG-16 model with weight fine-tuning (Wft) was implemented using transfer learning, and its performance was compared with the proposed models. The accuracy performances of the developed models were tested on three different datasets. In the first dataset consisting of Giemsa stained microscopic images, the VGG-16 Wft model achieved the highest accuracy of 97.06%, while in the second dataset, CNN, CNN-ViT and VGG-16 models achieved the best accuracy of 98.18%. Finally, in the third dataset extended with gametocyte and trophozoite cell images, the VGG-16 Wft model showed the highest accuracy of 96.85%. These models aim to reduce the workload of healthcare professionals and offer a more accurate and cost-effective alternative to traditional diagnostic methods."

    "abstract": "Solar resources are inherently intermittent and can affect power system stability if the photovoltaic (PV) production reduces during critical (peak) hours. Shading on PV modules increases power losses, underscoring the need for effective PV system design to mitigate shading effects and enhance performance ratio and capacity factor. This paper evaluates the advanced bifacial module technologies and inverters with multiple Maximum Power Point Trackers (MPPTs) on shading performance, focusing on improving capacity factor and, in turn, resource resilience. Shading losses are categorized into module-specific and mismatch losses and a 12.29 kWp on-grid PV system is simulated for practical settings to evaluate system performance. The analysis compares state-of-the-art half-cut bifacial crystalline silicon (c-Si) and full-cell modules using single and dual MPPT inverter systems. The results show that half-cut cell technology with dual MPPT inverter has an overall shading loss of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 5. 8 9 \\%}$</tex> compared to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{2 0. 6 9 \\%}$</tex> for conventional single-MPPT full-cell modules.

Traditional localization methods require synchronization or assume simple linear topologies, limiting their effectiveness in complex networks. This paper proposes a graph-based TDOA localization framework that works with asynchronous sensors and arbitrary topologies. The cable system is modeled as a weighted graph, and PD source location is inferred from TDOA measurements. Two algorithms are presented—one for node-based and one for edge-based PD occurrences. Simulations on synthetic branched networks show high accuracy and robustness under noise. The method is scalable, cost-effective, and suitable for smart grid and industrial applications."

These curves are developed from historical utility outage data and aligned with severe weather events to provide insights into the system impacts and restoration process. This analytical method facilitates the comparison of essential resilience metrics, including outage rate, restoration rate, degradation rate, recovery rate, and peak customer interruptions, and provides an interpretable means to quantify the effects of severe weather events on network performance. The approach is demonstrated using historical outage data from multiple distribution network operators in the United Kingdom for named storms including Desmond (2015), Arwen (2021), and Isha (2024). The results highlight the value of customer resilience curves as a benchmarking tool to inform storm response strategy, direct resilience investment choices, and improve resilience for future high-impact, severe weather events. While the analysis is conducted for distribution network operators in the UK, similar analyses would be valuable for network operators worldwide."

This research suggests a more innovative design to an already existing solar power technology, making it a better solution for future technological advancement. The created design, a cubed arranged solar panels design as a system (CSS), aims to maximize the wattage production using the same space area for a single generic solar panel, which gives a high solar capture concentration in a minimal footprint. To counter and ensure that all the panels are well exposed to solar rays, a system of auto-adjusting mirrors, controlled by microcontrollers that will track sunlight and reflect them on the adjacent panel to give maximum exposure is implemented. In addition, to counteract the higher temperatures of the panels, a cooling mechanism is proposed to make sure that the panels operate at efficient temperatures and not be damaged over long periods of time. This research shed light on the uses of such technology using a logical theoretical approach and calculations while taking into account the solar irradiance, efficiency of the panels, and the change in outputs under different conditions. Researching such challenges as light dispersal and cooling systems, the Cubed Solar System (CSS) aims to improve solar technology to accommodate regions with high temperatures and irradiance such as Kuwait."

Full-wave simulations were conducted in Ansys HFSS over the 0.5-20 GHz frequency range, with methanol serving as the test medium. The probe length (13, 23, and 26 mm), diameter values halved and doubled, and immersion depth (0,3, and 6 mm) were varied across different configurations (a total of nine simulations across four different scenarios). The results showed that immersion depth variations led to changes of approximately 16-18% in the reflection coefficient, probe length extensions caused deviations exceeding 260%, and larger probe diameters introduced differences of up to 135%. These findings highlight the strong dependence of OECP performance on geometric parameters and optimization in probebased measurement systems."

However, tribological instruments such as tribometers or profilometers are expensive and require specialized maintenance. In order to address this challenge, we propose a twodimensional simulation model to predict the wear behavior of 316L stainless steel using the finite element method. This model can simulate the ball-on-flat contact on stainless steel without requiring the UMESHMOTION subroutine of Abaqus Software. In addition, Archard's wear law is implemented via interaction properties-contact type, friction, and wear coefficientsreported experimentally in the literature. The proposed model contains shell elements to reduce node count, determining wear scars depth within 2.68 % average deviation from experimental results at <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$5 ~\\mathrm{N}, 10 ~\\mathrm{N}$</tex>, and 20 N.

In this paper, we utilize functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals as real-time human risk-perception feedback to establish a brain-in-the-loop (BiTL) trained artificial intelligence algorithm for decision-making. The proposed algorithm uses the result of driving risk reasoning as one input of reinforcement learning combining fNIRS-based risk and driving safety field model-based risk, realizing integrating human brain activity into the reinforcement learning scheme, then overcoming the disadvantage of machine-oriented intelligence that could violate human intentions. To achieve policy learning within limited BiTL training periods, we add two modification features to the proposed algorithm based on TD3. The experiment involving twenty participants has been conducted, and the results show that in continuously high-risk driving scenarios, compared to traditional reinforcement learning algorithms without human participation, the proposed algorithm can maintain a cautious driving policy and avoid potential collisions, validated with both proximal surrogate indicators and success rates."

    "abstract": "With the development of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) for Sixth-Generation (6G) wireless systems, contactless human recognition has emerged as one of the key application scenarios. Since human gesture motion induces subtle and random variations in wireless multipath propagation, how to accurately model human gesture channels has become a crucial issue for the design and validation of ISAC systems. To this end, this paper proposes a deep learning-based human gesture channel modeling framework for ISAC scenarios, in which the human body is decomposed into multiple body parts, and the mapping between human gestures and their corresponding multipath characteristics is learned from real-world measurements. Specifically, a Poisson neural network is employed to predict the number of Multi-Path Components (MPCs) for each human body part, while Conditional Variational Auto-Encoders (C-VAEs) are reused to generate the scattering points, which are further used to reconstruct continuous channel impulse responses and micro-Doppler signatures. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy and generalization across different gestures and subjects, providing an interpretable approach for data augmentation and the evaluation of gesture-based ISAC systems."

    "abstract": "Cooperative positioning enhances localization accuracy in intelligent artifact swarms through shared measurements, especially in environments such as urban canyons or disaster zones. Dynamic topologies, heterogeneous measurements, and scalability demands create complex challenges for state estimation. This paper introduces MRCA, the first comprehensive framework unifying heterogeneous measurements, reasoning processes, environment cognition, and scenario-based applications for cooperative positioning. The four-layer architecture comprises: i) the Measurement block converts signals into measurement parameters in a standard format independent of sensor types and measurement methods; ii) the Reasoning block uncovers the underlying principles of state transition using a four reasoning elements; iii) the Cognition block underscores the importance of node-environment interactions by identifying new valid radiation sources and verifying the ongoing validity of existing ones; iv) the Application block offers users task-driven cooperative positioning services, like execute potential navigation actions. Our proposed framework demonstrates performance improvements in various key metrics compared to legacy swarm positioning algorithms. Focusing on the framework itself, we employ the most basic algorithms within each block, and the experimental results are as follows: In scenarios featuring static unknown anchors, sparse perception, and collision interference, MRCA reduces cumulative positioning error by over 51% for dead-reckoning and 39% for traditional distributed cooperative positioning, while reducing average orientation error by over 31% and 27%, respectively.

    "abstract": "The CASM-UFLD algorithm proposes an improved approach based on curvature aware sequence modeling to address the issues of poor detection continuity and insufficient accuracy caused by the independent prediction mechanism of row anchor points in Ultra Fast Lane Detection (UFLD) in complex curved scenes. This algorithm retains the real-time advantage of UFLD at 300+ FPS, and achieves accurate modeling of curved lanes by inserting a curvature aware sequence modeling module (CASM) and optimizing the loss function. The CASM module is embedded between the UFLD feature extraction layer and the classification head, using bidirectional GRU to capture the vertical dependency relationship of row anchor sequences, and combining curvature gating mechanism to adaptively fuse the original features and sequence features, enhancing the continuity representation of the curve region; At the same time, a feature curvature regularization loss is added to achieve “feature position” dual supervision by constraining the second-order differential smoothness of the feature sequence, thereby improving the efficiency of curve feature learning. The experimental verification shows that the accuracy of CASM-UFLD in Tusimple dataset is 96.7% (0.83% higher than the original UFLD), and the accuracy in the complex curve scene of CULane is 3.3% higher. It provides a lightweight solution for lane detection that gives consideration to both real-time and accuracy, and significantly improves the safety of the auto drive system in complex road environments."

The system automates the process of filling cylindrical boxes with exactly three golf balls per box, ensuring consistent output, reducing manual labor, and enhancing packaging efficiency. The automation process employs three pneumatic actuators to manage tasks such as catching cylindrical boxes, ejecting golf balls, and separating boxes. Additionally, a dual infrared photoelectric detection system is integrated to confirm the presence of cylindrical boxes and accurately count the golf balls. Once filled, the system organizes the boxes containing three golf balls each into a $2 \\times 2$ arrangement, optimizing sorting and handling for downstream packaging. A Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is employed to oversee the automation processes, receiving detection data from computers and controlling operations like rejections and other machine functions. The integration of a Human-Machine Interface (HMI) with the PLC enables users to easily monitor and manage key information. Testing has demonstrated that the machine operates efficiently, achieving a $100 \\%$ success rate at a commendable speed. However, certain weaknesses were identified in areas such as system stability, pneumatic catcher performance, and overall durability due to constraints in skills, time, and budget. These limitations may result in operational errors, making the system less suitable for long-term investment."

    "abstract": "The rise of intelligent systems and mobile computing has driven spatial crowdsourcing to become an important tool for resource coordination. Among them, intelligent vehicles, as the main entities in intelligent transportation systems and Internet of Vehicles scenarios, have also become an important component of spatial crowdsourcing with the development of communication protocols such as C-V2X and the wide popularization of communication media such as MES, OBU, and RSU. Mobile space crowdsourcing tasks often have high complexity. Some tasks require workers with specific professional skills, and at the same time, they may have different focuses on requirements such as time and quality. Most existing space crowdsourcing frameworks rely on centralized servers. However, these solutions may be affected by single points of failure, privacy leaks and misbehaving platforms. In addition, in space crowdsourcing, the rationality of task allocation, high platform service fees, and privacy protection strategies also need to be taken into account simultaneously. To overcome these limitations and address the dual challenges of fine-grained privacy protection and reasonable and stable task allocation in the complex multi-skill task environment of the Internet of Vehicles, this paper proposes a decentralized personalized privacy-protecting space crowdsourcing framework. By constructing the acceptable list and preference list of tasks and workers, and using the gale-shapely algorithm for matching, the reasonable and stable task allocation is ensured. Meanwhile, finegrained authorization is achieved through attribute encryption based on ciphertext policy. Workers submit travel expenses instead of location information, which strengthens the privacy protection of tasks and workers. In addition, the trust value management method based on Bayesian reasoning conducts dynamic reputation assessment of workers to prevent malicious workers from committing evil deeds. These functions are implemented through smart contracts, while ensuring the transparency of the system and overcoming the main limitations of centralized solutions. Performance evaluation indicates that the scheme achieves two-way location privacy protection while taking into account both computational efficiency and system scalability."

    "abstract": "Recently, kilohertz-frequency pulse-train stimulation has attracted attention as a novel neuromodulation method, as an alternative to conventional electrical pulses delivered at repetition rates below 200 Hz. In this study, we propose a new stimulation paradigm in which kilohertz-frequency stimulation is applied not as the main stimulus that directly induces neuronal excitation, but as a priming stimulus applied prior to the main stimulus. Using physiological experiments and numerical simulations, we demonstrated that the cortical response to the main stimulus was partially suppressed by the priming stimulus. These findings suggest the potential of kilohertz-frequency stimulation as a new strategy for precise activation of neural circuits in cortical prostheses."

    "abstract": "This study explores a novel dimension in underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) by investigating the impact of optical intelligent reflecting surfaces (OIRS) element shape on system performance. While prior research has focused on the deployment and control of OIRS, this work uniquely examines how the geometry of OIRS elements, specifically circular OIRS (C-OIRS) versus square OIRS (S-OIRS), influences non-line-of-sight (NLOS) UWOC transmission. A submerged OIRS is employed to optimize signal reflection and enhance overall transmission efficiency. Through comparative analysis, we demonstrate that C-OIRS offers superior signal enhancement and system efficiency, especially as the number of elements increases. The results underscore the critical role of OIRS shape in improving UWOC performance and present C-OIRS as a promising design for reliable and efficient underwater data transmission."

In 5G, Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) encoding serves as the channel coding scheme for data transmission via shared channels. This work focuses on the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based implementation of an LDPC encoder compliant with the 5G-NR Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards. This paper details the design, development, and evaluation of a generalized LDPC encoder capable of generating codewords for all code rates and payload sizes. The generated Intellectual Property (IP) selects the base graph, calculates the parity matrix, and encodes the data in accordance with T S 38.212. Implementation was carried out using the Xilinx MPSoC ZCU-102 board. The developed IP is tested and verified using the reference output generated by the MATLAB 5G-NR built-in library. Our results demonstrate the efficiency of the LDPC encoder implementation in terms of latency and resource utilization on the evaluation board making it suitable for practical applications."

The experimental relationship between the differential capacitance signal of the sensor and the volumetric change of the droplet, observed in previous work, it is substantiated. First, we describe a practical sensor, simplifying its analysis by assuming that it is well represented as a capacitor of parallel plates with a uniform substrate and liquid layer between the electrodes. This first consideration enabled us to estimate the conditions and the approximate maximum volume of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mu \\mathrm{L}$</tex> to be used in practice, ensuring that the sensor response is proportional to the volumetric change of the droplet during evaporation. Next, we present a calculation of the equivalent differential capacitance and resistance of the device, both with and without droplet, as a function of the operating frequency. In this analysis, we assume an equivalent circuit composed of a series capacitor with a resistor. Our calculations indicate a precise optimal frequency for operating the device, which primarily depends on the conductivity of the liquid sample. For water samples, from drinking water to seawater, the optimal frequency is between approximately 300 kHz and the GHz range."

The review revealed nine CA algorithms applied in this context, with K-means being the most frequently adopted for its simplicity and efficiency, followed by Hierarchical Clustering, Fuzzy C-means, and DBSCAN. The findings show that CA has been used to group code fragments, support refactoring, classify developer profiles, automate code generation, organize APIs, and detect dependencies among modules. These applications contribute to improving software quality, scalability, and maintainability. However, challenges remain in selecting the optimal number of clusters, interpreting results reliably, and generalizing across heterogeneous software systems. Overall, CA demonstrates significant potential as a complementary approach to enhance efficiency and quality in software construction, providing practical benefits for software engineers while highlighting the need for methodological guidance and further research."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a two-stage optimization approach for the optimal sizing and placement of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) in 11 kV distribution feeders. In the first stage, an analytical approach determines the optimal BESS capacity by incorporating feeder-specific operating constraints, including reverse power flow limits, node strength, and loss thresholds. In the second stage, a heuristicbased method identifies the most effective feeder locations for deployment. The proposed methodology is validated using two real distribution networks in Dubai. For a single-feeder system (Net-1), the approach achieves a reduction in feeder losses from 32 kW in the base case to 4 kW with three BESS units, while also improving the voltage profile. For a multi-feeder system (Net-2), coordinated deployment reduces total network losses by 81.8% and improves reliability, with taking up to 30% of feeder demand supported through BESS integration. The results confirm that strategic and modular BESS allocation provides significant improvements in voltage stability, loss minimization, and operational flexibility, whereas nonoptimal siting yields only marginal benefits. In general, the proposed two-stage approach offers a practical and scalable solution that identifies heuristic-optimal BESS siting and sizing within real distribution networks under technical and spatial constraints."

We model a single BSS as either an Erlang-B loss system (no wait) or Erlang-C queue (wait), derive closed-form blocking, waiting and utilisation formulas, and embed them in a cost function that sums battery CAPEX, degradation and customer delay/loss penalties. Discrete-event simulation confirms analytic accuracy. Results show that higher charging rates cut required inventory yet raise degradation cost, while allowing short queues can minimise total cost when waiting penalties are modest. The framework yields explicit, closed-form sizing rules for reliable and cost-efficient BSS operation under stochastic EV demand."

Blockchain offers transparency integrity and trust for such markets. However executing blockchain logic on embedded platforms such as Raspberry Pi (RPi) raises concerns about gas cost communication overhead and long-term storage. Despite growing interest in blockchain-based energy trading there is limited performance evaluation on resource-constrained devices. We present a comprehensive analysis of two double auction (DA) implementations using full Quorum nodes running on RPi devices. One performs sorting and order matching fully on-chain while the other shifts these operations off-chain with verifiable results. We analyze gas cost, communication overhead and blockchain growth across different community sizes. Our results show that off-chain implementation offers improved gas efficiency as the number of participants increases. On-chain execution also remains a viable alternative especially for smaller and moderate communities. Both implementations maintain manageable communication and storage requirements under realistic trading activity. These findings demonstrate that full blockchain nodes can operate effectively on RPi devices, enabling the practical and scalable deployment of P2P energy trading systems."

In this research, we develop and evaluate a distributed deep learning model for credit card fraud detection deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Apache Spark and PyTorch Distributed Data Parallel (DDP). The model addresses data imbalance with SMOTE and distributes key tasks, including data preprocessing and model training, across multiple worker nodes. Experiments with two and three worker nodes demonstrate that distributing resources significantly reduces training time while maintaining high recall in fraud detection.

    "abstract": "As digital twins (DTs) become increasingly adopted in hydrogen power plants, a key challenge is enabling them to communicate with and learn from one another smoothly. Without interoperability, DTs remain isolated and cannot share validated knowledge or build upon each other's operational experience. Semantic interoperability is therefore essential for supporting communication, parameter adaptation, and collaborative improvement across multiple DTs. This paper presents a layered framework that achieves semantic interoperability by leveraging W3C-aligned standards, together with shapes constraint language validation and rule-based reasoning. It integrates a semantic gateway, a knowledge graph, and a rule engine to support consistent data integration, semantic representation, and decision support. It also incorporates a DT interface that exposes validated observations and action logs to external DTs under a shared data contract, thereby enabling cross-twin communications. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated using simulated electrolyzer stack temperature and pressure observations, which confirm correct ingestion, validation, and semantic representation of plant data. A twin-to-twin communication scenario further illustrates how hydrogen DTs can exchange validated knowledge, adapt operational parameters, and support collective learning. Results show that the framework reduces integration complexity and provides diagnostics for non-conforming data, thereby supporting reliable and semantically interoperable DT operations."

    "abstract": "To address localization deviations, missed detections, and the large parameter size of models in robotic arm-based biological sample sorting, this paper proposes an improved YOLOv11n-based detection method. First, we introduce the C3k2-StarNet module [1], enhancing the C3k2 module using the lightweight StarNet to improve basic feature extraction [2]. While YOLOv11 employs an FPN+PAN structure for multi-scale feature fusion, it struggles with insufficient spatial noise suppression in complex backgrounds and small-target localization errors. Traditional channel attention fails to model positional information explicitly, while spatial attention (e.g., CBAM) overlooks channel correlations. Thus, we integrate a Coordinate Attention-Enhanced CAA module into the neck network to reduce missed and false detections [3]. The improved model achieves 99.7% precision, 100% recall, 99.5% mAP@50, and 84.6% mAP@50:95. Compared to the original model, it reduces parameters by 0. 5 0 2 M, increases mAP@50 by 10.5%, improves mAP@50:95 by 5.1%, lowers GFLOPs by 1.3 G, and boosts precision by 0.115% and recall by 13.8%. Additionally, parameter count and model size decrease by 13.5% and 12.4%, respectively. The enhanced model significantly improves biological sample detection, mitigating low accuracy, missed detections, and localization errors."

    "abstract": "In recent years, the aerial-ground federated learning architecture, which combines unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with federated learning, has shown great potential for crop health monitoring in smart agriculture. However, optimizing federated learning for these UAV-based systems in precision agriculture scenarios faces multiple challenges, such as reducing latency, improving accuracy, and ensuring coverage, necessitating a balance between comprehensiveness and efficiency during model training. Existing strategies mainly focus on reducing training time but often overlook the fairness of model training, which can lead to insufficient classification accuracy or incomplete coverage for certain crop diseases, thereby affecting the accuracy of pest control decisions. To address this issue, this study proposes a federated learning optimization scheme for precision agriculture, introducing a novel fairness metric and multi-criteria client selection mechanism based on the upper confidence bound. Simulation results show that the proposed MCCS method achieves superior performance compared to existing DCS and GCS baselines. Specifically, MCCS reduces the total training latency by 20% and 27% respectively while improving the model accuracy by 6.9% and 12%."

    "abstract": "6G networks promise advanced applications such as immersive extended reality, autonomous systems, and massive machine-type communications, all of which demand highly secure communication. Yet, the rise of quantum computing technologies poses significant challenges to classical cryptographic methods, creating an urgent need for security designs resistant to quantum attacks. Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a promising solution; however, its deployment is currently constrained by expensive point-to-point connections that require dedicated devices at both endpoints. These constraints, combined with a restricted operational range, have limited the use of QKD to niche applications. To address this, our study introduces a scalable microservice framework for SDN-enabled QKD networks, leveraging the SDN Controller and its support for diverse communication protocols, including REST APIs. Our findings demonstrate that integrating QKD within an SDN-enabled microservice architecture can enhance network performance and flexibility by improving scalability, reducing latency, and extending achievable secret key rates over longer distances."

There exists in literature several schemes to optimize performance of mobility procedures by tuning configuration parameters.

A novel supervised feed-forward neural network model is developed for deploying at the network edge nodes so as to maintain optimal operating configurations to achieve superior mobility performance. As compared to existing schemes which mostly focuses on one specific handover performance indicator, the developed neural network model is designed to cater to a multi-objective optimization scheme, thereby providing a holistic performance improvement. The developed model is trained and tested with data obtained from an operational network deployment, thus providing a realistic estimate of the solution."

In logistics, routing truck platoons from one city to another and multi-destination within the city remains central to reducing the transit time, fuel consumption and, the operational costs involved. In this work, method is developed which combines adaptive truck platooning controls with a traveling salesman problem (TSP) algorithm, set on the path of deriving an optimal route from city to city. Using a distance matrix and iterating over possible routes, it sets out to pick on the optimum path that would minimize total travel distance. The most optimal route demonstrated a 38.9% fuel efficiency improvement over the second-best route. This study will assist logistics companies, autonomous vehicle developers, and transportation managers in providing safe, fuel-efficient solutions for platooning of complex multi-city transportation routes."

Although the detection frequency band is from 0.1 mHz to 1 Hz, magnetic fields with frequencies higher than 1 Hz can still contribute to the noise through down conversion effect. Therefore, it is necessary to measure the AC magnetic susceptibility or magnetic response of the test mass at higher frequency for the evaluation of the magnetic noise. In this work, we propose a magnetic field response measurement method by directly probing the induced magnetic field of the test mass placed in a spatially uniform magnetic field. The frequency can be measured up to 1500 Hz, satisfying the requirement of space-borne gravitational wave detection."

These are significant hurdles for traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) that rely on static, pre-trained knowledge. This paper introduces UQA-RAG, a new framework to enhance Urdu QA by using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) over the multi-domain UNQA dataset. Our core methodological contribution is a Hybrid Retrieval Strategy. This approach overcomes the individual weaknesses of pure semantic or lexical search by combining their strengths. It fuses results from OpenAI’s text-embedding-3-small vectors (Semantic) with BM25 (Lexical) using the Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) algorithm. This method maximizes both context relevance and diversity. We conducted an extensive ablation study to evaluate UQA-RAG’s performance with different LLM backbones, including GPT-4o, Llama-3.2, and Deepseek-r1. The optimal setup, pairing Hybrid Retrieval with GPT-4o, achieved a BERTScore F1 of 93.15%. This was a 16.55 percentage point improvement over our fine-tuned mBERT baseline. The system also reached a high RAGAS Context Precision of 95.20%. These results confirm that our hybrid approach is essential for generating accurate, contextually grounded responses, making UQA-RAG an effective solution for advancing high-quality QA in Urdu."

    "abstract": "Fixed, Mobile, and Satellite Convergence (FMSC) networks aim to enable seamless communication across diverse infrastructure domains. Traditional access and roaming control mechanisms are centralized, inflexible, and unsuitable for heterogeneous environments. This research proposes a decentralized framework based on blockchain smart contracts to manage roaming agreements and dynamic access authorization across FMSC domains. The architecture introduces two core innovations: (1) a Roaming Agreement Smart Contract (RASC) for autonomous SLA negotiation between operators, and (2) an Access Authorization Contract (AAC) that issues time-bound tokens using decentralized identities (DIDs). By leveraging permissioned blockchains, the system achieves rapid token issuance while eliminating single points of failure inherent in conventional HSS/UDM architectures. The solution ensures secure, auditable interoperability through cryptographic identity binding and immutable policy enforcement, addressing critical gaps in multi-domain trust management. Key advancements include programmable QoS-aware access tokens, integration of intent-based FMSC orchestration systems, and a revocation mechanism for dynamic policy updates. The framework’s modular design aligns with 3GPP and ITU-T standards while enabling new business models for cross-domain service delivery in 5G/6G and satellite networks."

    "abstract": "Optical fiber communications and networks constituting the backbone of Internet infrastructure have been continuing evolving technologically and architecturally to meet the explosive traffic growth. On the technological front, recent key advancements including spectrally and spatially flexible transmission, and wide-band optical transmission hold the promise of order-of-magnitude capacity gain. Concurrently, architectural innovations seek to capitalize on this expanded capacity to enable more scalable, cost-effective, and energy-efficient data transport. A prominent example is the optical-bypass architecture, which has now become widely deployed since the 2000s due to its substantial operational and capital cost savings over the predecessor optical-electrical-optical (O-E-O) mode. Driven by massive investments and consequently significant progresses in optical computing and all-optical signal processing technologies lately, this paper presents a new architectural paradigm for next-generation optical transport network, entitled optical computing-communication integrated network, which is capable of providing dual services at the optical layer, namely, computing and communication. This approach seeks to exploit the potential for performing optical computing operations among lightpaths that traverse the same intermediate node. Optical-Layer intelligence concept is thus introduced as the capability to perform computing / processing at the lightpath scale to achieve greater spectral and/or computing efficiency. A case study focusing on optical aggregation operation is introduced, highlighting the key differences between optical computing-communication integrated network and its current counterpart, optical-bypass ones. A mathematical formulation for optimal designs of optical-aggregation-enabled network is then provided and performance comparison with traditional optical-bypass model is drawn on the realistic NSFNET topology."

    "abstract": "Large-scale disasters often trigger cascading failures in Elastic Optical Networks (EONs), severely compromising communication networks. This paper introduces a restoration model based on Time-Varying Graphs (TVGs), which captures the temporal evolution of network degradation. The core insight of our approach lies in the observation that all snapshots in the TVG originate from a single initial graph G0 through monotonic topology changes, in which only node and link removals occur over time. the cost-based order of shortest paths computed in G0 is preserved in any degraded snapshot Gi, allowing restoration to be performed by scanning a precomputed candidate path set without global recomputation. Leveraging this property, we design the TVG-DR algorithm, which restores disrupted services efficiently by dynamically selecting the most failure-resilient path from a reusable pool. Simulation results confirm that TVG-DR improves restorability, reduces the number of connections experiencing recurrent disruptions during cascading, and increases availability when compared to conventional strategies."

Three-dimensional representations are essential for comprehending molecular geometry, bonding, and polarity. This study introduces the Multimolecular Structural Sphere (MMSS), a 3D-printed, didactic tool designed to enhance conceptual understanding of molecular geometry through tangible, student-centered learning. The project was implemented in the course Foundation of the Structure and Transformation of Matter at Tecnológico de Monterrey, campus Puebla, México (August-November 2024). Two groups were compared: a traditional instruction group (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{n}$</tex> = 52) and a treatment group using MMSS <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(n=64)$</tex>. Although no statistically significant difference in average grades was found (6.9 vs. 7.0), the MMSS group demonstrated greater dispersion of scores, with a subset of students scoring below the mean, influencing the overall result. Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analyses (EFA and CFA) of the knowledge survey provided evidence of construct validity, supporting a refined 15-item instrument structured around three thematic dimensions of molecular geometry. Student perception results were notably positive, 83% found MMSS highly beneficial for learning and 86% reported increased motivation to study chemistry <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(n=62)$</tex>. The MMSS proved to be cost-effective, durable, and easily reproducible through 3D printing, offering broad potential for adoption in educational contexts. Entering the second phase of this project-focused on refining the model, enhancing the survey, and strengthening its pedagogical integration, the findings suggest that the MMSS can transform the teaching of complex chemistry concepts, making them more intuitive, engaging, and accessible for students."

In addition, OFETs can operate as switches, amplifiers, transducers, controllers, smart cards, sensors, and artificial skin. The design of OFETs with low operating voltages is key to enabling their applications in the portable electronics industry. Recent advances in OFET designs have utilized SiO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> and polymers. However, these materials have low dielectric constants and operate at high voltages, which is not suitable for portable low-power transistors. To address these challenges, we propose a compact simulation model of an OFET based on Al<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>O<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</inf> with a high dielectric constant. This model is developed through Silvaco Atlas Software, considering variations in the thickness of pentacene and dielectric layers and selecting gold electrodes. For the lower gate/lower contact transistor configuration and a 60 nm pentacene layer, the simulation model predicts the higher drain currents. With the proposed simulation model, current-voltage electrical characteristics of OFETs can be compared with those of others manufactured in the laboratory. Our simulation model of OFETs can be used to estimate their charge transport properties for applications in portable electronics."

    "abstract": "Monitoring landslide activity demands positioning systems that can operate continuously in difficult terrain while maintaining high accuracy. Traditional geodetic GNSS receivers provide excellent precision but are often too costly and delicate for large-scale deployments. Recent developments in affordable GNSS hardware have opened new opportunities for building dense monitoring networks at a fraction of the expense. This paper reviews the hardware components most critical to such systems, including receiver types, antennas, power solutions, and communication links. Low-cost single-frequency devices, such as u-blox modules, demonstrate promising results under favorable conditions, though they require longer convergence times. Dual-frequency receivers, such as the ZED-F9P, deliver faster initialization and more reliable precision, albeit with higher cost. Antenna configuration further influences performance, with geodetic-grade options ensuring stability and calibrated patch antennas offering practical compromises. Field deployments typically integrate solar panels with battery storage and rely on cellular or radio communication for real-time data transfer. With overall system costs ranging from €500 to €1500 per station, properly configured low-cost units have proven capable of tracking ground displacements with sufficient accuracy for landslide monitoring. The evidence suggests that careful hardware integration, balancing receiver choice, antenna performance, autonomous power supply, and connectivity is key to designing effective and resilient GNSS monitoring networks."

Various machine learning algorithms were implemented and different feature subsets were evaluated. Our models achieved results comparable to previous research while also exploring different preprocessing strategies, including dimensionality reduction with Principal Component Analysis, and compare model performances across different anatomical brain atlases. We demonstrate that combining carefully selected features from multiple atlases leads to improved model performance, surpassing models trained on one atlas sets and PCA-transformed data. Additionally, we assess the impact of manual verification on prediction accuracy and investigate brain structures that have the greatest impact on age prediction. Unlike many studies that focus on markers of dementia, this work highlights brain structures that change in a stable and most consistent manner throughout life, rather than those that atrophy most rapidly in old age. We present an analysis using two model explainability methods: Permutation Importance and SHAP."

Efficient utilization of these phase shifts is critical for optimizing system performance across diverse applications. This paper proposes a unique eigenvalue-based phase optimization framework for RIS-assisted multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) systems, aimed at reducing the condition number of the Gram matrix and enhancing the performance of the minimum mean square error (MMSE) detector. A maximizing minimum eigenvalue approach is used to dynamically modify the phase of the RIS, followed by MMSE detection at the base station (BS). Simulation results demonstrate a 50% reduction in condition number, which translates into a BER improvement of more than 5 dB at 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−3</sup>error rate compared to conventional RIS-MIMO schemes with random phase assignments. Also, since the proposed approach is dedicated to improving channel conditioning, it also indicates the convergence of iterative methods for the MMSE detection schemes in a highly correlated environment, thus leading to a further reduction in complexity at the BS."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of distributed transmission control and video streaming optimization for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in unlicensed spectrum bands. We develop a rigorous cross-layer analysis framework that <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">jointly</i> considers three inter-dependent factors: (i) in-band interference introduced by ground-aerial nodes at the physical (PHY) layer, (ii) limited-size queues with delay-constrained packet arrival at the medium access control (MAC) layer, and (iii) video encoding rate at the application layer. First, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the average throughput by optimizing the fading threshold (transmission policy). To this end, we jointly analyze the queue-related packet loss probabilities (i.e., buffer overflow and time threshold event) as well as the outage probability due to the low signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). We introduce the Distributed Transmission Control (DTC) algorithm that maximizes the average throughput by adjusting transmission policies to balance the trade-offs between packet drop from queues vs. transmission errors due to low SINRs. Second, we incorporate the video distortion model to develop distributed peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) optimization for video streaming. The formulated optimization incorporates two cross-layer parameters, specifically the fading threshold and video encoding rate. To tackle this problem, we develop the Joint Distributed Video Transmission and Encoder Control (JDVT-EC) algorithm that enhances the average PSNR for all nodes by fine-tuning transmission policies and video encoding rates to balance the trade-offs between packet loss and lossy video compression distortions. Through extensive numerical analysis, we thoroughly examine the proposed algorithms and demonstrate that they are able to find the optimal transmission policies and video encoding rates under various scenarios. Notably, our approach improves the average throughput by 1.7% to 51.65% compared to various baselines, including the selfish and random policies. Additionally, we demonstrate an average PSNR increase of 0.24 dB and 1.7 dB compared to separately optimizing the fading threshold and video encoding rate, respectively."

As a result of random frequency offsets, direct estimation of range and angle extension is not feasible. In this communication, the half power beamlength (HPBL) of the fundamental harmonic of the radiation pattern is utilized to design appropriate random frequency offsets to ensure that the RFDA exhibits a specified range resolution. For symmetric probability density functions (PDFs) of the frequency offsets, the problem is cast into a convex quadratic optimization program with linear constraints. In contrast, for general PDFs, the problem is primarily non-convex which is transformed into an iterative quadratic problem with linear constraints exploiting a Lagrange multiplier. Finally, a PDF-weighted random number generator is used to generate several RFDAs with the desired HPBLs. The proposed PDFs generate radiation patterns with desired range resolutions for arbitrary frequency offset coefficients, while enjoying acceptable side lobe levels."

    "abstract": "Edge computing has received more and more attention in recent years. Since its terminal devices only have information collection and information generation functions, their own computing power is limited and they need the assistance of edge computing nodes to complete computing tasks. In this process, edge computing nodes are considered unreliable. They not only intend to obtain private information, but also have a certain probability of forging computing results. In response to the above problems, this paper designs a solution based on the three-layer architecture of edge network. First, this paper adopts the improved entanglement polynomial coding technology, which can effectively prevent the leakage of terminal device privacy information and reduce the number of edge nodes required to participate in the calculation; secondly, with the help of the preset auxiliary server, the calculation results finally aggregated by the edge nodes on the central server are verified to prevent some edge nodes from maliciously calculating wrong calculation results and eventually causing the failure of the computing task; finally, the whole scheme realizes the malicious security of edge nodes and ensures high efficiency while achieving high-level malicious security. In the final verification process, the central server will publicly publish the proof evidence, and each participant can verify the correctness of the entire calculation result. Finally, we conduct security and performance analysis on the scheme in this paper. The experimental results show that this scheme is superior to previous schemes in terms of preprocessing overhead and communication overhead."

Multimodal sensor data collected during controlled experiments that combined cognitive tasks with physical exercise were analyzed, with a focus on machine learning models for estimating mental fatigue levels. The results show that although EEG is the most accurate single sensor for estimating mental fatigue levels under physical fatigue, a combination of ECG and eye-tracking shows better accuracy (79.16%) with minimal error (MAE $=0.52$). This combination offers a balance between performance and wearability for practical applications."

    "abstract": "Providing equitable gaming experiences for diverse players, including elderly and those with physical disabilities who cannot manipulate conventional gamepads, mice, keyboards or physical sensor controllers, is an important challenge in human-computer interaction. We have also been developing a middleware-based plush toy controller system for video games. This system utilizes AI technology to estimate plush toy poses, enabling game players to control gameplay through natural and intuitive manipulation of the plush toy’s position and joint positions. However, the system’s lack of flexible input customization limited its versatility across different games and plush toys. In this work, we report on the development of a middleware that bridges plush toy controller inputs to in-game actions through flexible input customization via a graphical user interface (GUI), making this controller system compatible with various games and significantly expanding the controller’s adaptability. The main contribution of the middleware is enabling intuitive binding of various plush toy movements, such as moving the body, tilting, or raising arms, to in-game actions. Questionnaire surveys indicated that the controller system was perceived as highly usable and responsive, achieving high scores on enjoyment metrics. This work demonstrates that our proposed alternative input method can achieve near-comparable performance to conventional devices while significantly improving game accessibility for individuals unable to use conventional input devices."

User mobility can degrade throughput as movement beyond a single access point (AP) reduces signal quality, while deploying multiple APs introduces interference and signal fluctuations. This paper uses the random waypoint mobility model to analyze how device orientation impacts signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and throughput in dynamic indoor environments. Results show that orienting user devices toward a Li-Fi AP enhances SINR in high-interference areas, while a non-oriented state improves throughput in low-interference regions by preserving LoS. The proposed strategy dynamically adjusts device orientation based on real-time SINR and channel conditions, balancing interference reduction and LoS preservation. This adaptive approach optimizes network performance under varying mobility and interference scenarios, improving throughput and reliability in Li-Fi networks."

On the UE side, battery life significantly impacts user experience. Improving UE performance without affecting battery life is challenging due to varying traffic patterns within an active data session. To support power-saving mechanisms, 3GPP proposed PDCCH skipping. PDCCH is used for transmitting control information, and its usage directly affects UE power consumption. By implementing PDCCH skipping, UEs can save power by not monitoring PDCCH during certain periods. Furthermore, when PDCCH skipping is combined with other power-saving features such as CDRX, Scell dormancy, and BWP inactivity timer, even more significant power savings can be achieved. This multi-faceted approach to power saving enables 5G NR networks to enhance UE battery life and overall energy efficiency, providing a better user experience."

    "abstract": "Video streaming represents the dominant type of traffic on the Internet today, with MPEG Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) being the leading standard for adaptive video delivery. The main goal of streaming services is to provide the best possible Quality of Experience (QoE) to the user, and one of the most critical components in achieving this is the adaptation algorithm, which selects the most appropriate video representation under the variable network conditions. Numerous adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms aiming to improve the QoE have been proposed, mainly following two approaches: based on measured throughput values (traditional approach), and those relying on the prediction of throughput for the next segment download. This paper presents a novel hybrid DASH adaptation algorithm approach that combines the traditional measurement-based approach with throughput prediction to improve users QoE. An ablation study was conducted to identify the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) model that provides the most accurate prediction of network throughput. Four key QoE metrics were considered in the experimental evaluation: average bitrate, the number of bitrate transitions, the magnitude of bitrate changes, and the duration of buffer underruns (the time during which multimedia playback is stalled). The proposed algorithm outperformed all evaluated algorithms across all QoE metrics."

    "abstract": "Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for data extraction from documents is essential to intelligent informatics, such as digitizing medical records and recognizing road signs. Multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve this task and have shown remarkable performance. Recently, it has been noticed that the accuracy of data extraction by multi-modal LLMs can be affected when in-plane rotations are present in the documents. However, real-world document images are usually not only in-plane rotated but also perspectively distorted. This study investigates the impacts of such perturbations on the data extraction accuracy for the state-of-the-art model, Gemini-1.5-pro. Because perspective distortions have a high degree of freedom, designing experiments in the same manner as single-parametric rotations is difficult. We observed typical distortions of document images and showed that most of them approximately follow an isosceles-trapezoidal transformation, which allows us to evaluate distortions with a small number of parameters. We were able to reduce the number of independent parameters from eight to two, i.e. rotation angle and distortion ratio. Then, specific entities were extracted from synthetically generated sample documents with varying these parameters. As the performance of LLMs, we evaluated not only a character-recognition accuracy but also a structure-recognition accuracy. Whereas the former represents the classical indicators for optical character recognition, the latter is related to the correctness of reading order. In particular, the structure-recognition accuracy was found to be significantly degraded by document distortion. In addition, we found that this accuracy can be improved by a simple rotational correction. This insight will contribute to the practical use of multi-modal LLMs for OCR tasks."

    "abstract": "Resource access is a fundamental challenge in distributed systems where multiple uncoordinated nodes contend for a limited medium. Classical random-access protocols, such as Slotted-ALOHA, achieve modest efficiency because of frequent collisions and retransmissions. An entanglement-based procedure for collision-free slot allocation is investigated in this paper. The performance is evaluated through simulation under ideal classical and quantum channels. A system of N competing nodes is modeled, and three operations are implemented: JOIN, LEAVE, and TRANSFER. These operations rebalance amplitude probabilities and reflect node priorities while preserving normalization. The entanglementbased approach compares the obtained throughput and collision metrics with those of Slotted-ALOHA. It is shown through simulation results that higher throughput is achieved and collisions are completely eliminated across all tested <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$N$</tex> and iteration settings. According to the theoretical model presented in [9], this study is focused on developing a practical simulation framework and exploring priority-aware scenarios. The results demonstrate the feasibility of distributed entanglement establishment and provide a practical interpretation of JOIN, LEAVE, and TRANSFER operations under normalized probability constraints."

Solar tracking technologies, particularly single-axis and dual-axis systems, play a key role in enhancing energy yield. This study presents a comparative analysis of these two systems in terms of energy efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and real-world applicability. Dual-axis trackers offer higher energy gains by following the sun's movement in both azimuth and elevation, but come with increased costs and complexity. Single-axis trackers, while less efficient, provide a simpler and more economical solution suitable for larger-scale or budget-conscious installations. The analysis considers factors such as installation and maintenance costs, return on investment, and suitability across different environments. The findings suggest that although dual-axis systems outperform in terms of energy capture, single-axis systems may offer a better trade-off between performance and affordability for many practical scenarios."

Traditional NIDS often struggle to maintain high detection accuracy while providing transparency and adaptability, particularly when faced with sophisticated or zero-day attacks. To address these challenges, the proposed work presents a hybrid deep learning and explainability-driven architecture for intrusion detection. The approach integrates a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for capturing sequential attack patterns with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for local feature extraction, enabling both temporal and spatial learning. To enhance interpretability, the proposed work employs Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and SMOTE sampling to quantify feature contributions, providing actionable insights to security analysts. Additionally, Isolation Forest-based anomaly detection identifies unusual and zero-day attacks that lie outside the labeled training distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CNN, LSTM, Autoencoder and Isolation Forest pipeline achieves superior detection accuracy while maintaining transparency. By combining deep learning with explainable AI, this framework offers a robust, trustworthy, and adaptable NIDS capable of responding effectively to evolving cyberthreat landscapes."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel, low-complex algorithm for log-likelihood ratio (LLR) computation tailored for higher-order quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) modulation schemes in fifth-generation new radio (5G-NR) systems. Unlike conventional approaches that require distinct, complex calculations for each modulation order, the proposed method uses a recursive framework that models LLR calculation as a scaled and shifted quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) problem, enabling scalability and uniformity across modulation schemes. The proposed algorithm significantly reduces computational complexity and execution time by utilizing only linear operations and avoiding computationally intensive operations, making it highly suitable for hardware implementation. These reductions are achieved by the proposed scheme with almost no compromise in block error rate (BLER) performance, as demonstrated by simulation results. Its recursive and scalable design makes it a promising solution for efficient LLR computation in higher-order modulation schemes used in 5G-NR systems."

Gamification of simulators enables realistic testing of proposed solutions, allowing errors to be identified and resolved before equipment is installed in real factories. In this way, the 1-10-100 rule can be applied, where quality issues and costs grow rapidly depending on the stage at which they are detected. The most effective approach is to use simulators to verify design of factories before purchasing and installing components. For this reason, the new generation of gamified simulators can significantly reduce both costs and development time for new factories. When including components from different manufacturers and various types of equipment such as PLCs, robots, and CNC machines, gamified simulators can support rapid prototyping of industrial environments. The Simulator Factory I/O, in combination with TIA Portal, is recognized as an adequate environment for verifying the proposed design of an entire factory or a specific part of a production line"

Although active and reactive power is controlled at the far end of the feeder, the control is achieved by using only the local measurements at the inverter terminals, thereby reducing the implementation costs on account of less communication needs. The corresponding active and reactive power injections at the PCC are estimated from local measurements at the inverter terminals consisting of voltage magnitude, current magnitude, active and reactive power, and parameters of the feeder. The proposed controller uses Parks transformation and PI control logic to implement the decoupled control. Results on a test network under different scenarios prove the proposed controller can accurately inject the contracted amount of active and reactive power at the PCC."

Traditional cybersecurity approaches often fall short in modeling the uncertainty and partial knowledge inherent in Smart Grid environments. In this paper, we propose a novel formal trust-based framework for evaluating the security of Smart Grids under uncertainty. Our approach extends the Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic of Trust (PCTLT) with a group operator, resulting in the Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic of Group Trust (PCTLT+). We use this logic to formally specify trust-related security properties and verify them using a model checking technique. A scenario of a Smart Grid Energy Management System is introduced to illustrate key security concerns, such as device authenticity, data integrity, privacy protection, and command legitimacy. The proposed framework enables rigorous and interpretable reasoning about security through quantifiable trust relationships, providing a foundation for developing resilient and scalable Smart Grid infrastructures. Our work addresses a critical gap in current Smart Grid research by formally incorporating trust and uncertainty into the security evaluation process."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the design and implementation of a modular vital signs monitoring system intended for accessible healthcare applications. The system integrates a Raspberry Pi 4B as the central processing unit and an ESP32 microcontroller for communication through the UART protocol. Commercial biomedical sensors, including an ECG module, pulse oximeter, and a Bluetooth-based blood pressure monitor, are used for realtime measurement of physiological parameters. A custom user interface, developed entirely in Python using PyQt5 and PyQtGraph, provides real-time visualization, configurable signal selection, and alarm management. Preliminary testing demonstrates the system's capability to display simultaneous ECG leads (DI, DII, DIII), <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{SpO}_{2}$</tex> waveforms, blood pressure readings, and body temperature in a unified interface. Experimental results showed the stable acquisition of ECG and plethysmographic (SpO2) signals, with an average end-to-end latency of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{8 0 ~ m s} \\pm \\mathbf{1 5}$</tex> ms. Body temperature and blood pressure readings closely matched commercial monitors, while ECG traces displayed clear P-QRS-T complexes. Although <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{SpO}_{2}$</tex> values exhibited fluctuations and BLE communication was occasionally susceptible to disconnections, the system proved reliable for educational use and holds potential as a cost-effective alternative for pre-hospital monitoring in low-resource environments."

Additionally, a switching interpolation technique is proposed and integrated with the ImEx-G2O and ImEx-G3O solvers to account for intra-time-step switching events. The proposed SST SFB-DEMs greatly accelerate the EMT simulation, compared to the conventional detailed model (DM) and variable conductance(G)-matrix DEM (VG-DEM). For the SST with 60 SMs, the proposed SFB-DEM with ImEx-G3O method achieves the EMT simulation speedup by 171 and 7.5 folds, compared to the DM and VG-DEM, respectively."

    "abstract": "Cooperative positioning enhances localization accuracy in intelligent artifact swarms through shared measurements, especially in environments such as urban canyons or disaster zones. Dynamic topologies, heterogeneous measurements, and scalability demands create complex challenges for state estimation. This paper introduces MRCA, the first comprehensive framework unifying heterogeneous measurements, reasoning processes, environment cognition, and scenario-based applications for cooperative positioning. The four-layer architecture comprises: i) the Measurement block converts signals into measurement parameters in a standard format independent of sensor types and measurement methods; ii) the Reasoning block uncovers the underlying principles of state transition using a four reasoning elements; iii) the Cognition block underscores the importance of node-environment interactions by identifying new valid radiation sources and verifying the ongoing validity of existing ones; iv) the Application block offers users task-driven cooperative positioning services, like execute potential navigation actions. Our proposed framework demonstrates performance improvements in various key metrics compared to legacy swarm positioning algorithms. Focusing on the framework itself, we employ the most basic algorithms within each block, and the experimental results are as follows: In scenarios featuring static unknown anchors, sparse perception, and collision interference, MRCA reduces cumulative positioning error by over 51% for dead-reckoning and 39% for traditional distributed cooperative positioning, while reducing average orientation error by over 31% and 27%, respectively.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a high-fidelity Digital Twin of the wireless physical layer for a representative manufacturing environment using Sionna’s ray-tracing engine. A detailed 3D model of the factory floor is integrated with Sionna to generate path loss, channel impulse response (CIR), and link-level calculations for an OFDM system. Using software-defined radio via the COSMOS testbed, we conducted measurements under both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-LOS (NLoS) conditions, employing CIR sounding and link-level analysis. The Digital Twin achieves a path loss exponent of 1.611 and shadow fading of 0.728 dB, closely matching the measured results and 3GPP Indoor Factory predictions, though underestimating shadow fading. CIR comparisons show an accurate capture of multipath components in most scenarios, with delay spread values that closely follow the measurements and remain within the bounds of the 3GPP factory model. The SNR vs. BER(Bit Error Rate) results revealed a systematic offset, which we addressed by applying a gain calibration to the Digital Twin so that simulated and measured SNR values aligned, enabling consistent link-level predictions. Then, we extended the Digital Twin to generate predictions in a 100 MHz wideband channel, producing BLER(Block Error Rate) maps that pinpoint optimal IIoT placement and demonstrate robustness in multipath-rich factories."

    "abstract": "With the widespread application of drones in scenarios such as inspection, logistics, and emergency communications, the contradiction between their limited computational resources and the high real-time requirements of tasks has become increasingly prominent. To address computational offloading challenges in cooperative drone missions, this paper proposes a load-aware lightweight task scheduling algorithm (UCO, UAV Cooperative Offloading). Centering on minimizing average task response time, the method integrates real-time computational load and location data to construct a distributed task offloading decision model. By designing an iterative task forwarding mechanism based on load information, the algorithm enables dynamic task allocation within the UAV swarm, preventing individual node overload. Simulation results demonstrate that compared to random offloading and nearest-node offloading strategies, the UCO algorithm effectively reduces average task response time while significantly improving swarm load balancing. This validates the algorithm’s effectiveness and superiority in dynamic UAV swarm environments."

The manufacturing industry that has had facilities for more than 3 decades requires modernizing its electrical systems and energy distribution with efficient medium voltage panels. Today, there are gas-insulated technologies that allow agile protection and selectivity in the coordination of protections. The use of gas insulation is widely used for industrial installations that require optimizing electrical safety and human safety. Based on the above, the comparison of two insulation media is presented, considering the durability of materials, cost, size and long-term maintenance. The purpose is to contribute to the design of safe facilities, considering that the manufacture of this equipment is already a reality in the electricity market. It also tries to contribute to the technical knowledge of engineers who make decisions in projects of this nature, such as the engineers in charge of the Auxiliary Services of electrical maintenance and the Supervision of internal Operation of the Industry in selecting one of the two technologies for a better use in the long term or during its electrical operation and that can be visible in the electrical model for electrical studies that can allow an agile decision-making of the technical personnel in a possible integration of primary electrical equipment."

Through a detailed literature review, the study explores the contribution of ESS in peak shaving, load shifting, voltage and frequency regulation, grid flexibility, and renewable energy integration. Mathematical models and real-world case studies are employed to evaluate the cost savings and performance enhancement offered by ESS deployment. The discussion further identifies key challenges such as battery degradation, high capital costs, regulatory barriers, and material sustainability. Finally, future research directions are proposed to address these gaps through technological innovation and policy development. This work underscores the critical role of ESS in enabling resilient, efficient, and sustainable energy infrastructure."

The final simulation results indicate that the proposed antenna operates effectively over the frequency range of 12.5–16 GHz. In particular, it achieves circular polarization over 13.6-14.5 GHz, indicating its ability to transmit and receive signals without polarization loss. Furthermore, the antenna demonstrates an impressive average realized gain of 8 dBi, highlighting its efficiency in radiating power and enhancing signal strength within the designated Ku-band."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the use of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) for metamodeling the techno-economic stability of an islanded smart microgrid, which can also be applied to larger and more extensive grid systems. Using a physics-accurate simulator, we generated a small, many-shot dataset for the proposed microgrid architecture that is powered by a wave energy generator. To address the scalability challenges of both classical simulation and quantum computation, we propose a Quantum Many-shot Out-of-Context Learning (QM-OCL) pipeline. This pipeline uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for data dimensionality reduction, which was also shown to mitigate the barren plateau phenomenon in the optimization landscape of the Quantum Neural Network (QNN). The QNN was trained in a context-free manner, and its performance was benchmarked against classical models, including Shallow Neural Networks (NNs), Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), and Support Vector Classifiers (SVCs). QNN achieves an accuracy of 0.75 on this limited data, slightly outperforming most state-of-the-art classical models that achieve accuracies in the range of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$0.70-0.77$</tex>. While the approach currently shows some limitations in generalization, this is expected given that the QNN algorithm is still in its early stages of development. This work highlights the potential of QML for metamodeling complex, data-scarce systems like smart grids/microgrids and shows that dimensionality reduction can significantly improve the trainability of QNNs. Future work will focus on larger datasets and a quantitative analysis of barren plateau mitigation."

    "abstract": "The suppression of current zero-crossing distortion and dc-link voltage oscillations has been a key research focus for three-phase Vienna rectifiers in recent years. In addition, under variable power factor (PF) operation, the phase difference between the input current and grid voltage increases the likelihood of the Vienna rectifier entering a nonsynthetic interval at a high modulation index. This prevents the effective synthesis of the reference voltage vector, leading to severe current distortion and voltage oscillations. In order to reduce the impact of the nonsynthetic interval on the three-phase Vienna rectifier, this article proposes a nonunity power factor current optimization (NUPF-CO) strategy to effectively reduce the negative impact of the nonsynthetic interval on system performance. This strategy allows the three-phase Vienna rectifier to avoid current zero-crossing distortion, even under variable power factor operation and actively unbalanced output voltage, while ensuring good neutral point current disturbance suppression and improving voltage utilization. Finally, a 2.5 kW three-phase Vienna rectifier is constructed for verification. The performance of the proposed NUPF-CO strategy under variable power factor conditions is compared with that of conventional strategies."

By incorporating clamping capacitors and additional inductors into the buck converter topology, the proposed design achieves a significantly higher step-down conversion ratio while reducing voltage stress and improving efficiency. In the proposed converter, the clamping capacitors store energy to act as a voltage source, thereby reducing voltage stress on the switching devices. While the main inductor serves as the primary component for energy transfer to the output, additional inductors are connected in parallel to reduce the burden on the clamping capacitors, reduce current stress, and ensure natural balance. Furthermore, the switch network is scalable to achieve the desired voltage conversion ratio, depending on the application. Finally, a 48V-to-1.5V/25W prototype operating at 300kHz was developed and tested, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed converter."

    "abstract": "Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) has emerged as a critical enabler of broadband connectivity, particularly in underserved and remote regions. However, delivering a deterministic, fiber-like experience over FWA networks remains challenging due to fluctuating radio conditions, suboptimal customer premises equipment (CPE) placement, and limited end-to-end visibility across the service chain. This paper presents a holistic FWA Assurance Framework designed to proactively detect, localize, and resolve performance degradations across the customer lifecycle. The solution integrates multiple innovations: (i) a geospatially enhanced WTTx Suite for precise pre-sales qualification using 3D RF propagation modeling and predictive analytics; (ii) an AI-driven CPE placement optimizer via mobile apps to reduce installation errors; (iii) a real-time FWA Insight Dashboard for end-user performance monitoring leveraging OSS data and intelligent KPIs; and (iv) an integrated Customer Care Assistant (CCA) platform powered by decision-tree-based RCA for contextual complaint resolution. Deployed at scale, the framework resulted in a 40 percent reduction in complaint volumes and a 30 percent improvement in the mean time to resolution (MTTR) while enabling proactive retention and upselling strategies. The solution demonstrates a scalable blueprint for FWA quality assurance and has been recognized as a replicable best practice across OpCos."

The proposed model employs a novel neural network architecture utilized at every stage of Curriculum Learning to efficiently capture and focus on both short- and long-term temporal dependencies, improve learning stability, and enhance accuracy while remaining lightweight and robust against noise in sequential IoT data. Robustness is achieved through staged learning, where the model iteratively refines itself by removing low-relevance features and optimizing performance. The workflow includes edge-optimized quantization and pruning to ensure portability that could easily be deployed in edge IoT devices. An ensemble model incorporating Random Forest, XGBoost, and the staged learning base further enhances generalization. The results demonstrate 98% accuracy on CIC-IoV-2024 and CIC-APT-IIoT-2024 datasets and 97% on EDGE-IIoT, establishing this framework as a robust, transparent, and high-performance solution for IoT network security."

To address this issue, we developed and evaluated an automatic grading tool for SQL query design using generative AI in this paper. The system targets SPJ (Selection, Projection, Join) query tasks from the Information Systems Experiment course. By incorporating model answers, lecture materials, and common student errors into carefully designed prompts, the tool aimed to improve grading accuracy and feedback quality. Comparative experiments were conducted with different prompt configurations as well as with an existing rubric-based tool developed by Ando et al. The results demonstrated that the optimized GPT-based prompt design achieved 96.8% accuracy (387 out of 400 items correctly graded), while also providing detailed feedback that specified “what was wrong,” “why,” and “how to fix it.” This feedback was found to support student learning and reduce grading inconsistencies for instructors. The findings confirm the potential of GPT-based systems as effective complements to existing rubric-based methods. This research highlights the promise of generative AI in delivering scalable, fair, and pedagogically meaningful assessments in database education."

Under 5 G communication, the end-to-end latency from speech to action averages 165 ms, supporting real-time flight control. Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) yields a mean absolute error of 3.733 bpm compared to electrocardiogram (ECG) for vital-sign monitoring.

Firstly, in response to the process characteristics and technical requirements of insert assembly, the overall structural design and process planning of the workstation are completed. Through two chapters, the mechanical structure layout, transmission system selection, control system architecture and assembly operation process of the workstation are elaborated in detail, laying a hardware and process foundation for automated assembly.To achieve high-precision recognition and positioning of inserts, the KNN algorithm is introduced for improvement based on the traditional SURF algorithm. Feature points of inserts and assembly stations are extracted via the SURF algorithm, and the KNN algorithm is utilized to optimize the matching and classification of these feature points. This effectively enhances the accuracy and anti-interference capability of feature matching, addressing the issue that traditional algorithms tend to suffer from insufficient matching precision due to the influence of illumination and noise in complex industrial environments.Experimental results indicate that the improved SURF-KNN algorithm achieves higher matching accuracy than the traditional SURF algorithm in recognizing inserts in injection molds, which meets the precision requirements of automated assembly. The workstation based on this vision algorithm can stably perform the grabbing, positioning and assembly of inserts, significantly improving production efficiency and providing a feasible technical solution for the automated assembly of inserts in injection molds."

The framework leverages a distributed ledger to immutably bind the hash-locked commitment of data and model parameters through deployed smart contracts defining automated verification protocols. Secure multiparty computation [PADDP13] and zero-knowledge proofs are some of the privacy mechanisms used during collaborative training in federated learning environments to keep sensitive data safe. In expanding on our work in blockchain-based AI integrity frameworks, the new architecture shown integrates anomaly detection and provenance tracking to prevent malicious contributions. Extensive experimental evaluations over standard datasets confirm the ability of our solution to efficiently provide reliable verification without additional computational background for domain independence. This work has the potential to form the bedrock of future AI deployments that are transparent, safe, and ethically responsible."

    "abstract": "The CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) model has demonstrated remarkable performance in zero-shot image classification and object detection tasks, owing to its powerful cross-modal alignment capability. However, accurately applying CLIP to counting tasks (regression tasks) remains a significant challenge due to the fundamental differences between counting and recognition tasks. Meanwhile, large-kernel convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have recently gained considerable attention in computer vision, but their architectural design still faces two critical issues: on one hand, existing large-kernel ConvNets predominantly follow the design principles of traditional small-kernel convolutions or Transformers, lacking specialized optimization for large-kernel characteristics; on the other hand, although Transformers dominate in multimodal domains, whether ConvNets possess similar cross-modal perception capabilities remains insufficiently explored. To address these challenges, this study focuses on investigating the potential of CLIP in crowd counting tasks and innovatively proposes integrating a reparameterized large-kernel convolution module into the CLIP framework. This approach not only effectively mitigates the discretization errors inherent in traditional classification-based crowd counting methods but also enhances counting accuracy through multi-scale feature fusion and spatial attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, including SHA, SHB, QNRF and NWPU, demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in key metrics such as MAE and RMSE, outperforming previous approaches and recent strong baselines. This research not only expands the application scope of CLIP to regression tasks but also provides new insights and empirical evidence for the architectural design of large-kernel ConvNets and their cross-modal capabilities."

    "abstract": "Radio Link Failure (RLF) is a challenging problem in 5G networks as it may decrease communication reliability and increases latency. This is against the objectives of 5G, particularly for the ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (uRLLC) traffic class. RLF can be predicted using radio measurements. Radio Link Failure (RLF) prediction in 5G networks is an emerging research area that aims to improve network reliability and performance. RLF prediction in 5G networks enables network operators to proactively manage network resources, optimize performance, and implement preventive measures to minimize service disruptions. By identifying potential link failures in advance, operators can take corrective actions, such as adjusting transmission parameters, optimizing resource allocation, or re-routing traffic to maintain reliable and un-interrupted connectivity for 5G users. The existing works performed the RLF prediction for one day ahead of the present date. The proposed work planned to extend the span of prediction to the next five days instead of one. By using N-day (previous day data) and weather forecasted data, the RLF of N+4 day is predicted. According to this, Modulated Convolutional Neural Network (MCNN) is proposed for link failure prediction. The input data is collected from Radio Link Failure prediction dataset. Then, the distance correlation and noise elimination are used to enhance the quality and relevance of the data. The proposed work obtains the 79.03%, 65.93%, 67.51% of precision, recall and F1-score, which are higher than existing techniques. The analysis shows that the proposed scheme is appropriate for RLF prediction."

While graph-based machine learning with a similarity graph has recently been shown as a promising technique for detecting noisy labels hidden in large image datasets, a stable metric for assessing labeling quality remains an open challenge. This is because graph structure can vary depending on several factors, even when built from a single dataset, making the labeling quality metric value susceptible to changes in graph structure. In this study, we first detail the limitations of an existing, recently proposed metric, and then introduce our novel approach. Our metric addresses these limitations by considering the label distributions between datasets and graph cliques. We demonstrate the stability of our proposed metric through an experimental evaluation on three real-world benchmark datasets."

The confusion matrices visually corroborated these trends, illustrating the impact of noise on the predictive capabilities of each model. The stable overall performance of the Decision Tree (DT) also provided a valuable point of comparison. These results underscore the superior robustness of ensemble methods for EV charging classification in potentially noisy real-world scenarios."

    "abstract": "The increasing complexity of latest-generation audio technologies such as Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, and MPEG-H poses significant challenges in the development, testing, and certification of embedded audio systems. Current testing practices are resource-intensive, and often rely on technologyspecific tools, resulting in limited reusability and long-lasting certification processes. This paper presents a uniform framework for testing embedded audio systems, developed to unify and standardize testing procedures across diverse technologies and platforms. The proposed solution CUTE (Completely Unifying Test Executor), introduces modular architecture with unified APIs, multi-agent distributed execution, and IoT-enabled recovery mechanisms. Together with the GRANT (Generator of Random Tests) tool, this framework enables automated generation of test cases, extended coverage, and reduced manual effort. The framework was validated on multiple state-of-the-art audio technologies. Experimental results demonstrated significant improvements: faster error detection, reduced test execution time, lower code complexity and improved team productivity. The contributions of this work include a novel methodology for framework development, implementation of uniform testing framework, and comprehensive experimental validation. The results confirm effectiveness of a uniform framework that provides standardized and scalable testing of latest-generation embedded audio systems."

    "abstract": "This work presents the development and implementation of a computer vision system that simultaneously addresses two related problems: (i) real-time color identification and (ii) distance estimation using a standard camera. For the color detection task, the proposed method integrates OpenCVbased preprocessing, HSV color segmentation, and morphological filtering for robust object recognition. A graphical user interface was developed to facilitate camera selection, enable or disable detection, and provide real-time visualization. Experimental evaluation of the classification module yielded an overall accuracy of 93.3 %, with perfect recognition of red objects (100 %) and 90 % accuracy for both green and blue objects. In parallel, the system performs distance estimation based on the detected object's size and position in the image frame. Under controlled conditions, the method demonstrated high precision: for a reference distance of 11 cm, the system reported 10.9 cm with an error of only 0.1 cm; for a real distance of 15 cm, the error was 0.2 cm; and for a short separation of 5.2 cm, the estimated value was 5.3 cm, corresponding to an error of 0.1 cm. These results confirm that the proposed solution offers reliable real-time performance for both color classification and distance estimation. The combination of traditional image-processing techniques with a simple but effective computational pipeline enhances the stability and usability of the system, making it suitable for applications in robotics, automated monitoring, and educational environments."

The proposed Tx pad consists of four identical rectangular coils strategically positioned in the XZ and YZ planes. Key design parameters, including central coordinates, side lengths, number of turns, and current circulation, are jointly optimized through computational modeling based on analytical equations governing the magnetic field intensities of rectangular coils. The performance of the proposed Tx pad is evaluated against a conventional planar coil positioned in the XY-plane. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed configuration enhances field uniformity, improves misalignment tolerance, and ensures reliable power transfer at greater distances. These findings highlight the potential of the optimized vertical coil design as an effective solution for WPT systems requiring extended range and robust performance."

We introduce a multiscale preprocessing pipeline for reconstructed ON-potential time series to feed the model, optimized via adaptive dynamic weighting. In tandem, the research contributes two advances: (i) the definition of a fuzzy recursive operator, and (ii) the formulation of a recursive equation modeling the dynamic behavior of the ON potential. The procedure achieved an experimentally validated forecasting accuracy of 83 %. This multidisciplinary approach not only improves prediction and operational resilience but also reframes the role of artificial intelligence in high-criticality industrial environments. The proposed system lays a robust foundation for future developments in prescriptive maintenance, extreme-scenario simulation, and technology transfer to other critical infrastructures."

Specimens were exposed to controlled water-vapor environments for up to 12 h, and space-charge density profiles were recorded every 50 s under applied fields reaching <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$80 \\text{kV} / \\text{mm}$</tex>. Moisture increases the density of deep traps, stabilizing negative charge at the electrode-polymer interface and enabling bulk space-charge through field-assisted ionization. Humidified films exhibit shorter charge-packet transit times, indicating higher effective carrier mobility. At elevated fields, the emergence of multiple packets evidences a nonlinear transport regime governed by trap saturation and dynamic retrapping. These effects erode LDPE dielectric stability, with implications for medium-voltage cable insulation. We interpret the observations using coupled models that combine Schottky-type injection, drift-dominated transport, and Poisson electrostatics, and emphasize the need for predictive multiphysics frameworks that integrate rigorous moisture quantification, polymer morphological evolution, and the nonlinear dynamics of charge migration."

    "abstract": "Future 6G networks are expected to enable a wide range of industrial applications that demand ultra-high data rates. To meet these requirements, communication systems will increasingly rely on millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies, which offer large available bandwidths but exhibit complex and sensitive propagation behavior. Accurate network planning for such environments requires reliable Radio Environmental Maps (REMs), which in turn depend on precise channel modeling. Machine learning (ML) has shown promise in bridging the gap between computation time and prediction accuracy left by traditional modeling methods, but it has not yet been transferred to large-scale, complex Indoor Factory (InF) environments. In this paper, we present an ML-based propagation model for taming mmWave connectivity prediction in a densely cluttered real-world industrial scenario. The model utilizes features derived from privacy-preserving level-of-detail environmental representations, such as top and side-view image projections. We evaluate two ML model types – LGBM and ANN – on a dataset collected in a complex industrial environment. Both models accurately capture the underlying propagation characteristics and outperform traditional empirical models by 8.18 dB in prediction RMSE and by being approximately 30-times faster than ray tracing. We demonstrate the potential of ML-based models to support fast and reliable connectivity map generation, making them suitable for efficient mmWave network planning for industrial scenarios."

    "abstract": "Brain–computer interface (BCI) systems frequently necessitate time-intensive subject-specific calibration, thereby motivating the development of subject-independent P300 detection approaches. Existing methodologies that employ transfer learning and knowledge distillation encounter challenges with limited generalizability due to substantial intersubject variability and constrained data availability. Furthermore, their applicability is often questioned, as most lack comprehensive external validation and cross-script evaluation. To address these limitations, we introduce P3-FSLNet, a few-shot metalearning framework that integrates prototypical networks and contrastive learning within a spatial-temporal convolutional neural network augmented by dual-channel attention for the selection of relevant electroencephalogram channels. Episodic metatraining facilitates the transfer of robust knowledge across different subjects. Evaluated on a self-recorded Devanagari script dataset, P3-FSLNet attains a classification accuracy of 93.17%, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 1%–14%, while simultaneously reducing trainable parameters by up to 400 times. External validation using English-script datasets from BCI Competition II and III confirms its robustness in cross-subject and cross-script generalization. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of P3-FSLNet and represent a substantial advancement toward the development of script-agnostic P300 spellers that are lightweight, scalable, and conducive to multilingual applications."

    "abstract": "Regarding intelligent transportation systems, low-bitrate transmission via lossy point cloud compression is vital for facilitating real-time collaborative perception among connected agents, such as vehicles and infrastructures, under restricted bandwidth. In existing compression transmission systems, the sender lossily compresses point coordinates and reflectance to generate a transmission code stream, which faces transmission burdens from reflectance encoding and limited detection robustness due to information loss. To address these issues, this paper proposes a 3D object detection framework with reflectance prediction-based knowledge distillation (RPKD). We compress point coordinates while discarding reflectance during low-bitrate transmission, and feed the decoded non-reflectance compressed point clouds into a student detector. The discarded reflectance is then reconstructed by a geometry-based reflectance prediction (RP) module within the student detector for precise detection. A teacher detector with the same structure as the student detector is designed for performing reflectance knowledge distillation (RKD) and detection knowledge distillation (DKD) from raw to compressed point clouds. Our cross-source distillation training strategy (CDTS) equips the student detector with robustness to low-quality compressed data while preserving the accuracy benefits of raw data through transferred distillation knowledge. Experimental results on the KITTI and DAIR-V2X-V datasets demonstrate that our method can boost detection accuracy for compressed point clouds across multiple code rates. We will release the code publicly at https://github.com/HaoJing-SX/RPKD."

Four obliquely isosceles triangular patches are optimally positioned on alternating facets of the pyramid to maximize bandwidth, excited via a cross-slot coupled feed in the ground. Compared to conventional slot-coupled patch antennas, the proposed design significantly broadens bandwidth and improves port isolation without incorporating extra resonant structures. A 4×4 antenna prototype was fabricated and measured for validation. Measurements demonstrate an overlapped impedance bandwidth (IMBW) better than 60% across both ports covering the entire <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Ku</i>-band, with isolation exceeding 27 dB and a peak gain of 15.8 dBi. This approach leverages radiator geometry optimization instead of additional resonant structures for bandwidth enhancement and enables customized design via multi-material additive manufacturing, greatly simplifies the antenna configuration while establishing a promising pathway for future wideband antenna development."

We scope only shallow variational loops and Grover-class search under realistic trainability/noise limits, and outline three integration patterns (tightly coupled, LAN-attached, and in-network) with PQC-first security and selective QKD. NV and Si spins emerge as the most credible edge options; photonics fits networking; others suit central-edge/cloud.

An important technology considered to enable the achievement of this goal is the Cybernetic Avatar (CA) teleoperation system. A CA teleoperation system is a robotic system designed to act as human surrogates in remote environments. While being an important enabler to achieve freedom from human limitations, the amount of data generated by the CA operation increases rapidly especially in a multiple operators and avatars scenarios. This leads to a communication bottleneck problem, especially in resource limited situations, where the bandwidth is not sufficient to efficiently transmit the large amount of data. Many approaches have been proposed to address this challenge, but one promising approach is semantic communication, which consist of transmitting the meaning of data rather than the raw data. In this paper, we propose a semantic communication model using a goal-oriented approach. We applied this model to improve the communication performance in a CA teleoperation. Simulation results show an improvement on the reliability of the CA teleoperation."

    "abstract": "The high mobility of vehicles in Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) introduces significant challenges, primarily frequent task interruptions due to unstable vehicle-to-edge (V2E) connectivity. Most existing task offloading strategies are fundamentally reactive, making decisions only after a task is generated, which often fails to mitigate the risks posed by rapid network topology changes. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel proactive scheduling paradigm named PREDICT (Predictive Resource Reservation and Edge Selection). The core of PREDICT lies in its lightweight trajectory prediction module, which forecasts short-term vehicle positions. Leveraging these predictions, the framework proactively reserves virtual computing resources at candidate edge servers and incorporates a stability-aware edge selection strategy. This shift from reactive to proactive decision-making allows the system to anticipate and avoid potential offloading failures. Simulation results in a typical urban scenario (vehicle density: $\\mathbf{3 0}$ vehicles/km; task arrival rate: 0.5-1 task/s) show that the proposed approach reduces task-interruption rates by 42.7% (from 18.2% to 10.4%), decreases average task delay by 31.5% (from 3.2 s to 2.2 s), and limits the energy overhead to within 7.9%. Under high-mobility conditions (vehicle speed: $25 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$), it maintains a task completion rate of 82.3%, outperforming Q-learning by over 40%, demonstrating superior robustness and generalization in highly dynamic environments."

This paper introduces a statistical framework for real-time anomaly detection and threat forecasting using data from a distributed honeypot infrastructure. The system combines geographically dispersed honeypot clusters with a multivariate analysis pipeline to identify coordinated attack campaigns and emerging threats. Key contributions include a surge detection algorithm based on statistical hypothesis testing, time series differencing, and multivariate deviation scoring, as well as an evaluation of ARIMA-based forecasting accuracy across varying data windows. A two-year deployment across four clusters revealed early indicators of several high-impact exploits, demonstrating the framework’s effectiveness and scalability for proactive threat detection."

A rollingwindow framework trained models on seven-day windows for 24-hour forecasts. Results show performance is highly locationdependent, driven by local weather variability. Univariate models performed well in stable climates (e.g., SARIMA achieved MAE of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$9.14 ~\\mathrm{W} / \\mathrm{m}^{2}$</tex> in Tucson), but poorly in variable ones (e.g., Holt's RMSE of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1,797.69 ~\\mathrm{W} / \\mathrm{m}^{2}$</tex> in Seattle).

Deep learning models yielded the best accuracy, with CNN-LSTM achieving MASE between 1.13 and 1.49, and TFT capturing complex temporal patterns. These findings suggest that complex models are best for volatile climates, while simple ones suffice in stable regions. This work provides practical guidance for model selection based on climate and a structured evaluation framework for solar forecasting."

Unlike conventional methods, which extract load current components by converting the fundamental component to a DC quantity using a sample, control, and hold block with a proportional-integral (PI) controller, the proposed method computes the average load current directly, providing the DC quantity for the fundamental component. This DC quantity, combined with the current gain of the outer voltage control loop, generates the reference currents and effectively manages active and reactive power flow. Power quality concerns, such as unity power factor, harmonic mitigation, and reactive power compensation, were addressed during power management are avoided by suppressing the total harmonic distortion. Additionally, when PV array power is unavailable, the voltage source inverter (VSI) functions as a DSTATCOM, which enhances the utilization of PV systems. The proposed control method is validated through a MATLAB®/Simulink model and evaluates its performance using dSPACE-1104-based laboratory prototype."

Characterized by high, continuous, and often rapidly scaling power demand, DaCs can strain local grid infrastructure, increase power loss, reduce hosting capacity for distributed energy resources, and complicate voltage and thermal management at the feeder level. At the same time, DaCs provide demand response (DR) potential through flexible IT workloads, workload shifting, adaptive cooling, and on-site backup and storage systems. This paper reviews recent strategies for using these capabilities in DR, covering optimization models, market mechanisms, and operational planning.

The inference process is based on a rule base derived from historical data analysis and expert knowledge from materials planning personnel. Defuzzification is performed using the weighted average method, yielding crisp percentage values for purchase orders ranging from 0% to 100%. The system's performance was evaluated through surface plot analysis, which revealed nonlinear and interdependent relationships between the input variables and the purchase output. Results demonstrate that the approach provides accurate and adaptive recommendations for inventory control, offering a valuable decision-support tool for optimizing resource allocation and maintaining stock levels in dynamic operational environments."

Compared to conventional gel-based TMMs, conductive polymer composites, such as PDMS with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), offer improved shelf-life and stable conductivity. However, integration of embedded sensors for real-time field mapping remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a fabrication method for sensor-integrated TMMs made from doped PDMS, achieving a conductivity of 3.3 S/m at 1.5 wt% doping with MWCNTs, with electrical sensor structures manufactured by photolithography. DC stimulation revealed irreversible resistance increases, highlighting the suitability of AC or pulsed excitation for long-term studies. Voltage distribution mapping within the TMM was achieved through embedded copper sensors, and results were consistent in trend with computational simulations, validating the experimental approach. This work demonstrates the feasibility of sensorintegrated polymer TMMs for TES, ensuring reproducible sensor placement and providing a foundation for advanced brain phantom studies."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel denoising method for partial discharge (PD) signals in smart grid condition monitoring, termed SEMMA (Segment-wise Adaptive Multiwavelet Denoising with Morphological Alignment). Aimed at improving the reliability of diagnostic systems in high-voltage equipment, SEMMA adaptively selects the most suitable wavelet basis for each signal segment to accommodate local non-stationary and transient features. Noise suppression is achieved through wavelet thresholding, followed by a morphology-preserving alignment strategy that ensures structural coherence and continuity across segments. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic PD signals under severe noise conditions demonstrate that SEMMA significantly outperforms traditional methods such as Energy-Based Wavelet Selection (EBWS) and SNR-Based Wavelet Selection (SNRBWS). It achieves consistently lower mean squared error (MSE), higher correlation coefficients (CC), and improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), confirming its effectiveness in enhancing signal fidelity. These results underscore SEMMA's potential for robust, real-time deployment in predictive maintenance frameworks for smart grid infrastructures."

    "abstract": "A straightforward way to study the electronic structure and certain physical properties of atoms and molecules under high pressures is through the confinement (caging) model, in which the atom is placed at the center of a spherical box with impenetrable walls. The hydrogen atom confined inside penetrable and impenetrable spherical cavities is perhaps the most studied compressed system, and exact solutions exist for both types of confinement. The physical properties of the hydrogen atom confined within impenetrable-wall cavities (AHCI) have been widely analyzed; however, the same system embedded in penetrable spherical cavities (AHCP) has received less attention. A more physical model suggests using a spherical box with penetrable walls. Therefore, in this work, we compute via the variational method, the Shannon and Fisher information entropy in position space, <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$S_{r}$</tex> and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$I_{r}$</tex>, for the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$2 \\mathbf{p}$</tex> and 3d states of a hydrogen atom subjected to spatial confinement by penetrable and impenetrable spherical cavities. Additionally, we calculate the tunneling probability for the penetrable confinement and seek to relate it to the overlaps of the radial probability densities as a function of the cavity radius and the height of the confining barrier. To model the penetrable confinement, we employ a logistic potential which, unlike earlier reports that used a discontinuous step potential, is a continuous function. The wavefunction is expanded in terms of Slater functions that satisfy appropriate boundary conditions; in some cases, we find notable differences with respect to the impenetrable potential."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the outage performance of amplify-and-forward (AF) two-way relaying under half-duplex (HD) and full-duplex (FD) operation across sixth-generation (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$6 \\mathrm{G}$</tex>) candidate bands (e.g., <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$4.6,7.8,15$</tex>, and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$40 \\text{G H z}$</tex>), with emphasis on an outdoor roadside vehicle-to-everything (V2X) setting. Because the end-to-end signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is intractable in closed form, an upper bound is employed to derive compact lower-bound outage CDFs for both HD and FD. The bounds are validated by exact end-to-end Monte Carlo simulations. Results show that FD attains a modest outage advantage over HD when residual loop-interference is sufficiently suppressed, and that increasing the carrier frequency from 4.6 to 40 GHz degrades outage performance due to stronger frequency-dependent path loss when antenna gains are fixed."

    "abstract": "Hybrid AC/DC microgrids (HMGs) face significant challenges in the detection and classification of faults due to variable short circuit levels, bidirectional power flows across interlinking converters, and the absence of a unified protection strategy. This paper presents a novel framework that integrates Shannon entropy and Pearson correlation analysis to address these issues for rapid fault detection and classification across AC/DC subgrids of the HMG. The proposed method leverages Shannon entropy, a measure that quantifies current signal uncertainty and irregularity, to enable real-time fault detection. Further, fault classification is achieved by computing Pearson correlation coefficients between fault-induced entropy distributions of current signals and predefined entropy patterns corresponding to various fault scenarios. The framework is validated using a modified IEEE 33-bus HMG testbed simulated in MATLAB/Simulink. Simulation results confirm the method's efficacy for high-speed and accurate fault detection and classification, under diverse operating conditions."

Coordination and collaboration involves effective communication among robots and efficient task allocation and performance. In this paper, we have proposed architecture and developed algorithm for effective communication and task management. Through performance analysis, we showed the error and task completion time as a function of number of robots. We have also presented coordination overhead when number of robots is more. It is found that there is decrease in task completion time as number of robots increases, which is obvious however, the rate of decrease is lesser as the number of robots increases. It is also found that the coordination overhead increases so as the error; almost linearly with the number of robots. Thus, a trade-off between scaling up robots and managing the higher error rate must be maintained. The investigation is expected to be very useful in automation of production, logistic, agriculture and other industry."

While these open interfaces promote innovation, they also demand advanced security measures to ensure resilient network performance. This paper presents a novel, layered, closed-loop, distributed security architecture tailored for 5G O-RAN. Leveraging the architecture’s modular design, the proposed system comprises a Lightweight Filtering Entity (LFE) and a High-Level Deciding Entity (HLDE) to ensure performance-optimized security that continuously adapts to combat new threats to the network. The LFE operates at lower network levels in real-time, filtering packets with minimal overhead, while the HLDE conducts near-real-time analysis of traffic flows, dynamically updating LFE rule sets to identify and mitigate anomalous activity. This dynamic, disaggregated approach safeguards the O-RAN environment while preserving network responsiveness and throughput efficiency. Initial testing demonstrates the efficacy of this distributed security solution in maintaining secure and efficient O-RAN operations."

This paper proposes a deterministic, UAV-assisted architecture for fault-tolerant V2I communication using LoRa and IEEE 802.11 backhaul links. In the proposed system, UAVs are triggered when RSUs detect degraded RSSI or ACK loss, thereby providing a redundant relay path to maintain session continuity. All logic is implemented on off-the-shelf embedded hardware without reliance on cloud or simulation platforms. Experimental results from real hardware deployments demonstrate a 14% improvement in message delivery ratio, steady latency of approximately 34 ms, and enhanced SNR performance in low-coverage areas. The architecture is lightweight, interpretable, and immediately deployable for real-world ITS applications."

Uplink Sounding Reference Signals (SRS) are processed at the base station (BS) using the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimation technique to obtain accurate channel estimates. These estimates are used to compute regularized zero-forcing (RZF) beamforming weights for simultaneous multi-user transmission. The system performance is evaluated in terms of cell throughput and error vector magnitude (EVM) for 64-QAM and 256-QAM modulation schemes by varying the number of users. Furthermore, spatial beam patterns are visualized to demonstrate effective user separation and interference suppression. The results confirm that the implemented framework enables high cell throughput and robust multi-user support in next-generation wireless networks."

Additionally, an energy selective protective structure is created by etching cavities around the coaxial feed probe, allowing for joint energy and spatial domain manipulation. Furthermore, a reciprocal high-power injection testing method is introduced, significantly reducing the cost of conventional irradiation measurements. The measured results for different spatial modes show excellent agreement with full-wave simulations. Within the operational frequency band, the shielding effectiveness (SE) peaks at over 12 dB, the interference suppression capability (ISC) exceeds 10 dB, and the comprehensive protective capability (CPC) achieves over 22 dB."

We evaluated SMA and RSMA in terms of capacity, power consumption, energy efficiency, and processing time (used as a metric for complexity). RSMA demonstrated better capacity performance, offering up to 28% increase over SMA. However, it also consumes up to 24% more power compared to SMA.

Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks (SAGIN) are envisioned as a key enabler of this vision by extending network reach beyond terrestrial limits. SAGIN harnesses the capabilities of Network Function Virtualization (NFV), which enables the virtualization of network functions, thereby reducing maintenance overhead and improving scalability. Service Function Chaining (SFC) adds additional flexibility by directing traffic through an ordered sequence of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). However, deploying VNFs in SAGIN is particularly challenging due to the dynamic topology of the network, frequent handovers, and limited computational resources –especially in low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites and aerial nodes. To address these challenges, we propose a delay- and reliability-aware SFC deployment approach tailored for dynamic SAGIN environments. Our approach models the evolving network using a Reconfigurable Time Expansion Graph (RTEG) and applies a multi-constrained shortest path algorithm to determine optimal VNF placement. The simulation results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of SFC acceptance ratio by 40% and reliability by 10%, offering an effective solution for future integrated network deployments."

According to experimental results, all techniques restore faces; nevertheless, Bicubic Interpolation offers the best reconstruction quality and lays a solid basis for future multi-FIAT by reaching the maximum visual quality."

    "abstract": "Differential relays are essential for protecting transmission lines, but their reliance on communication networks makes them vulnerable to cyberattacks, especially false data injection attacks (FDIAs). This paper explores how such attacks can be exploited and proposes a detection method to distinguish attacks from internal faults. The proposed approach compares positive-sequence voltage measurements at the relay terminal with estimates from two observers, each based on state-space models (for healthy and faulty conditions) using both local and remote inputs. Under normal or fault scenarios, one observer's estimate matches the measured voltage, reflecting the true system state. In contrast, during an FDIA, both observers deviate, leading to noticeable mismatches. Simulation results on the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in identifying FDIAs."

    "abstract": "Auditory displays use sounds to communicate or monitor states and processes without the need for visual indicators. These auditory cues need people's attentional shift towards them. Auditory attentional processes can be measured through perceptual tests, and electrophysiological tests, such as auditory evoked potentials, that function as an indicator when different stimuli are presented. Assessment through auditory evoked potentials often use the oddball paradigm composed by frequent and deviant stimuli, where deviant stimuli can vary different auditory features (pitch, intensity, time, localization, speech). This study tests the attentional acoustic feature differences perceived through auditory evoked potentials. The discrimination paradigm was applied to 12 normal hearing students 18 – 25 years old, to measure their electrophysiological response changes using electroencephalogram readings in pitch, intensity, and localization of deviant sounds. Participants were also asked to fill in a questionnaire about their perception of attention during the test and the ease of discrimination. N2-P3a complex analysis indicated better attentional discrimination for pitch changes, followed by intensity and localization, supported by participant's questionnaire answers and number of deviants count-ed. These findings suggest that from these features, pitch changes can be widely considered when designing auditory displays that aim to easily shift people's attention towards the sound."

    "abstract": "Future energy systems require utilities to intelligently manage diverse energy sources including renewables to meet rising electricity demand. Microgrids, as localized smart grids, play a critical role in this transition. However, day-ahead energy scheduling remains challenging due to the stochastic nature of solar and wind generation and the non-linear dynamics of diesel generators. Traditional heuristic methods like Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) often yield suboptimal results. This paper proposes an enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, combining DRL with classical Quadratic Programming (QP). In this two-phase approach, DRL identifies feasible decision regions, while QP refines solutions to optimal continuous values. Two state of the art DRL algorithms: Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) and Dueling DDQN (D3QN) were tested on an energy management problem for a microgrid in NSW, Australia. Training results showed that DDQN achieved the highest reward and lowest cumulative cost (AUD 1,243,227) with less than 0.2% constraint violations. In testing, DDQN further outperformed D3QN, achieving a lower operating cost (AUD 8,127) with zero constraint violations and less than 0.1 second execution time. Compared to GA, both DRL approaches achieved significantly lower costs by 25.4% (D3QN) and 26.5% (DDQN) and had much faster computation."

These systems are essential for preventing malicious activities such as spamming and creating fake accounts. CAPTCHAs can be broadly categorized into OCR-based and non-OCR-based methods, with image and distorted character challenges being the most prevalent. Although designed to be easily solvable by humans, CAPTCHAs pose significant challenges for automated systems due to their reliance on cognitive skills such as visual recognition and pattern identification. This paper presents the design, development, and implementation of an OCR model to solve alphanumerical textbased CAPTCHAs of variable lengths. The proposed model is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture trained on the EMNIST ByClass dataset. The model achieved an accuracy of 87.5 % in the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting text-based CAPTCHAs from the IMSS (Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social) web portal, which belongs to the Mexican Government."

This prototype can generate the motions of the pronosupination of the human forearm with good performance. Furthermore, the proposed prototype includes a simple mechanism, which decreases its manufacturing cost. The prototype's performance is tested with suitable results, reproducing the biomechanics of the human forearm using an easy-to-operate mechanism.

    "abstract": "Cooperative positioning enhances localization accuracy in intelligent artifact swarms through shared measurements, especially in environments such as urban canyons or disaster zones. Dynamic topologies, heterogeneous measurements, and scalability demands create complex challenges for state estimation. This paper introduces MRCA, the first comprehensive framework unifying heterogeneous measurements, reasoning processes, environment cognition, and scenario-based applications for cooperative positioning. The four-layer architecture comprises: i) the Measurement block converts signals into measurement parameters in a standard format independent of sensor types and measurement methods; ii) the Reasoning block uncovers the underlying principles of state transition using a four reasoning elements; iii) the Cognition block underscores the importance of node-environment interactions by identifying new valid radiation sources and verifying the ongoing validity of existing ones; iv) the Application block offers users task-driven cooperative positioning services, like execute potential navigation actions. Our proposed framework demonstrates performance improvements in various key metrics compared to legacy swarm positioning algorithms. Focusing on the framework itself, we employ the most basic algorithms within each block, and the experimental results are as follows: In scenarios featuring static unknown anchors, sparse perception, and collision interference, MRCA reduces cumulative positioning error by over 51% for dead-reckoning and 39% for traditional distributed cooperative positioning, while reducing average orientation error by over 31% and 27%, respectively.

A Lyapunov-based strategy is used to make the system work appropriately with model uncertainties as well as measurement problems. The proposed observer jointly estimates SOC, terminal voltage, and sensor-induced measurement errors using a second-order battery model. This method is particularly useful for stationary energy storage systems using low-cost sensors. Low-cost sensors typically have a large bias with inaccurate measurements. We conducted the experiment using a 25 A lowcost current sensor. In the experiment, we added bias as an error to the current measurement. The experimental results show that, compared to the conventional Sliding Mode Observer (SMO), the proposed Luenberger observer significantly decreases the measurement error, effectively improving the accuracy of the SOC estimation. In addition, the observer decreases chattering effects and offers robust performance. The proposed observer can be used to reduce the battery management systems using low-cost sensors, without compromising the SOC estimation accuracy."

    "abstract": "In the offshore oil and gas industry, FPSO (Floating, Production, Storage, and Offloading) vessels are widely used for the transportation of oil and gas. These FPSO vessels are designed to consider the extreme environmental conditions encountered during their navigation routes. These designs of FPSO vessels can include the analysis of their aerodynamic and hydrodynamic stability. Thus, a FPSO vessel must maintain its stability under normal working conditions and in critical weather states, such as hurricanes and cyclones. Herein, we report the analysis of the effect of ocean waves and wind on the stability of an FPSO operating in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico (at water depths exceeding 500 m). This analysis considers the FPSO dynamic response under various heeling angles. Thus, we propose a design methodology for FPSO vessels to ensure their aerodynamic and hydrodynamic safety under severe environmental conditions. The proposed methodology utilizes a computational tool based on the Airy theory to determine hydrodynamic forces, and another based on the finite control volume method to determine aerodynamic forces. This methodology is applied to an FPSO operating under high wind velocities of 136 knots (70 m /s) and wave heights ranging from 1.12 m to 14.14 m, with wave periods of 6 to 22 s. The FPSO stability is modeled using MAXSURF and ANSYS Fluent software. Our methodology can be used to evaluate the technical feasibility of operating floating units in highly complex environments, such as the deep-water field of the Gulf of Mexico. The proposed methodology can be useful for naval designers of FPSO vessels, regarding the influence of high aerodynamic and hydrodynamic forces."

Renewable energy converters offer benefits in weak grid conditions due to their inherent voltage support. However, existing research on these converters' stability characteristics is limited, necessitating further analysis. This paper investigates how passive system parameters affect the small signal stability (SSS) of a smart gridconnected <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$100-\\text{MW} \\text{PV}$</tex> plant. The study employs eigenvalue analysis and participation factor, comparing the performance of twin-delayed deep deterministic (TD3) controllers to proportionalintegral (PI) controllers, with stability assessments supported by Bode plots. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to evaluate the impact of varying passive parameters on eigenvalues and overall system performance. Results from mathematical analysis were validated through MATLAB Simulink simulations, revealing that passive parameters significantly affect the SSS of large-scale gridconnected PV systems."

The design integrates three core mechanisms: (i) a hierarchical structure that minimizes redundant transmissions by aggregating detection data under a designated coordinator, (ii) a duty-cycled MAC that conserves energy while remaining responsive to detections, and (iii) an anycast forwarding scheme that exploits multiple candidate relays to minimize reporting latency. Evaluation with the DESERT Underwater simulator demonstrates that the proposed solution sustains low reporting latency even under stringent duty-cycling conditions and scales efficiently with network size."

One variational autoencoder is trained on a dataset that contains images of hand written digits, while the other is trained on a dataset that contains audio recordings of people pronouncing digits in English. The first variational autoencoder is trained to reproduce images of hand written digits using standard techniques, after which the latent data distribution is saved. The second variational autoencoder is trained in such a way as to make the latent data distribution match the saved one, effectively making the two models use a shared latent space. It is shown that establishing this shared latent space makes it possible to convert the same information from one medium to another."

Recently, collaborative combining of DSA with deep learning (DL) has been widely accepted with appreciable performance. We present a suitable frequency channel occupancy (FCO) and frequency band occupancy (FBO) algorithm that exploits time and frequency correlations to improve quality of service (QoS) and reduce computational complexities. A heterogeneous DSA model has been adopted and tested according to the third generation partnership project (3GPP) standard for evaluating spectrum activities. We adopt the applicability of FCO and FBO techniques in the design of DSA networks that enlightens the efficient spectrum utilization for a typical indoor UMa scenario."

    "abstract": "For Precision Time Protocol based Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) time synchronization it is assumed that the latency in uplink and downlink direction is the same, which is true for fixed TSN-Ethernet networks. However, with TSN-5G integration (where the 5G system acts as a TSN bridge), an equal uplink/downlink delay cannot be assumed for the 5G wireless links, thus drastically decreasing the synchronization accuracy. In the 3GPP standardization, Device Side and Network Side Time Translators (TT) were introduced to resolve this issue. In this paper, a novel method is presented to increase the synchronization accuracy for 5G User Equipment (UE) without requiring the TT. Our method works by time-stamping the radio resource request and grant messages within the UE and utilizes the measured delay in the PTP synchronization process. Through simulations with OMNeT++ we investigated our approach for various traffic scenarios and showed that TSN time synchronization over a 5G network with high accuracy is possible even without TT."

    "abstract": "Private millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks offer immense potential for indoor factory (InF) environments by enabling ultra-high data rates and network capacity to support advanced industrial applications. However, their performance is significantly challenged in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) situations, where severe attenuation may lead to insufficient connectivity. Traditionally, this limitation requires the deployment of additional base stations (BSs), which increases both the costs and energy consumption. To address these challenges efficiently, future 6G networks will leverage intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) to illuminate under-connected regions. The passive-static HELIOS IRS concept has reached a high maturity level compared to other solutions, with field experiments successfully demonstrating its ability to enhance various link metrics in predetermined regions. This work now investigates how to systematically determine the required number of IRSs, their placement, and preconfigured reflection characteristics. Our proposed brownfield network planning scheme for IRSs thereby takes an important step toward solving the open research problem of 6G hybrid network planning. Using a real-world production scenario from previous measurement campaigns, we demonstrate that one BS with three custom-tailored passive IRSs eliminates the need for a second active BSs while maintaining the required service quality level.

This becomes more difficult in highly mobile and high traffic environment. This study investigates the radio coverage characteristics of mmWave frequencies in a specific urban 100-foot (30.48-meter) MG road scenario in Bengaluru city of India. Using simulation, we analyzed signal propagation, path loss at 28GHz bands under line-of-sight (LoS) situations. We optimized the antenna placement to provide and maintain high data rate user experience throughout the street. It is ensured that a minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 19dB for 100MHz and 13dB for 400MHz is maintained throughout the street. Received signal strength indicator (RSSI) remained stable across both bandwidths ranging from -66dBm to -74dBm, confirming its independence from system bandwidth. This would allow sufficient data rate services to mobile users. The results highlight strong directional beamforming to enhance coverage in such unique environment. Our findings provide insights into optimal antenna placement and the feasibility of mmWave deployment for dense urban corridors. This work supports the planning and design of efficient 5G and beyond networks in short-range, high-capacity road environments."

These attacks exploit gaps in lower-layer authentication procedure by impersonating legitimate base stations, resulting in wastage of radio resources. Traditionally, these attacks and their detection techniques often operate at the Non-Access Stratum (NAS) or Radio Resource Control (RRC) layers, missing the signs of such attacks originating at Layer 2. In this work, we introduce two DoS attacks on Random Access Channel (RACH) and RRC procedures over 5G RAN and study their impact on users. We further introduce a user-side threshold-based FBS detection technique to mitigate the impact of FBS. We demonstrate these DoS attacks and assess the effectiveness of the proposed detection technique on both physical testbed and simulation environments. Attack scenarios, including RACH drop and RRCSetupRequest drop, are emulated to demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks. The results indicate that the proposed DoS attacks using FBS can significantly drain radio and compute resources, even without going through the registration process. With a threshold-based detection technique, we can minimize the impact of these attacks before they escalate."

In this paper, to improve the prediction accuracy of gold-related stock prices, the particle swarm optimization algorithm is introduced. This can overcome some shortcomings of the traditional backpropagation neural network. The traditional BP neural network is relatively sensitive to the initial weights and is prone to fall into the situation of local optimum. This paper selects Shandong Gold as the research object, uses its daily trading data from 2014 to 2024, adopts the sliding window method to construct the sample, then establishes the standard BP model and the mixed PSO-BP prediction model, and compares these two models. The empirical results show that The predicted values and measured values of the PSO-BP model fit more closely, and the prediction error has been significantly reduced. Among them, MAE decreased by 52.74%, RMSE decreased by 50.88%, MAPE decreased by 56.35%, while the coefficient of determination increased to 0.9781. These findings prove that the PSO-BP model is more precise and practical in predicting the stock price of gold, and can provide investors with a more reliable quantitative analysis tool."

A promising future direction of multi-operator cellular deployments allows users to associate with neighboring Base Stations from other operators, if that link offers a stronger Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio. While \"Proximal Spectrum Sharing\" improves spectrum usage and users’ experience, it leads to unpredictable traffic shifts, inefficient energy usage, and revenue imbalance among the operators.To overcome these limitations, we propose a game-theoretic model that jointly couples user association, pricing, and power into a single convergent algorithm. The interaction between the users and operators is formulated as a two-level game: an ordinal potential game governing user association, and a concave profit-maximization game handling pricing decisions. We establish convergence to a Nash Equilibrium where no player benefits from unilateral deviation. Extensive simulations validate our framework, resulting in lower power consumption and higher operator revenue"

Existing methods, such as Siamese trackers and single-frame detectors, often struggle to balance spatial discriminability and temporal continuity, leading to degraded robustness in complex environments. To address these issues, we propose IRST-DETR, an end-to-end video detection framework that integrates spatiotemporal features for robust UAV detection. IRST-DETR combines a spatial branch with a detail-enriched pyramid module (DEPM) for fine-grained feature extraction and a temporal branch using Video Swin Transformer to model motion dynamics. Hierarchical fusion modules, including the Temporal Gate Fusion Module (TGFM) and the Spatial-Temporal Attention Fusion Module (STAFM), adaptively merge spatiotemporal information, enhancing robustness against thermal noise. To rigorously evaluate performance in challenging conditions, we construct a specialized evaluation subset from Anti-UAV410, focusing on cluttered infrared scenes with dynamic thermal interference. Extensive experiments on Anti-UAV300, Anti-UAV410, and the challenging subset demonstrate that IRST-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance. It outperforms Siamese trackers by 2.8% in state accuracy and surpasses single-frame detectors by over 9% in complex scenarios, with ablation studies confirming its efficiency.

In this paper, we propose MsgFliter, a sender-anonymous messaging system with proactive anti-harassment mechanism. Our core idea is to prevent unanswered senders from sending messages continually while keeping their identities, messages, and sender types secret. To meet the functionality and security requirements of MsgFliter, we propose the Anti-Harassment Anonymous Authentication (AHAA) protocol. We associate messages from the same sender through linkable tags and invalidate linkability when a message is replied to. To achieve session indistinguishability, we further combine the proposed anonymous authentication with zero-knowledge proofs of disjunctive relations. We implement MsgFliter and compare its performance with related solutions. Experimental results show that our solution is practicable."

    "abstract": "Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) is a promising quantitative phase imaging technique that enables high-resolution, label-free imaging over a large field-of-view. Here, we present the first application of FPM for the quantitative analysis of human brain organoid slices, providing a powerful, cost-effective, and label-free enhancement to the current gold-standard fluorescence microscopy. Brain organoids, prepared as thin (5 μm) slices, were imaged with a custom-built FPM system consisting of a standard light microscope (4x, 0.2 NA objective) and a 7×7 LED array. This configuration achieved a synthetic numerical aperture of 0.54 and a spatial resolution of approximately 488 nm across an area of 2.077 × 3.65 mm. Fluorescence microscopy was used in parallel for neurons, astrocytes, and nuclei labeling, providing rich fluorescence imaging. Moreover, we designed an automated method to merge classical resolution fluorescence images to visualize the whole brain organoid and align it with the numerically increased space-bandwidth product FPM image. The provided alignment method enables rich phase-fluorescence correlative imaging. Based on the segmentation performed on the stitched fluorescence images, we devised a quantitative phase analysis revealing a higher mean optical thickness of the nuclei versus astrocytes and neurons. Notably, nuclei located in neurogenic regions consistently exhibited significantly higher phase values (optical path difference) compared to nuclei elsewhere, suggesting cell-type-specific biophysical signatures. The label-free, quantitative, and high-throughput capabilities of the FPM approach demonstrated here make it a powerful and accessible tool for future structural and functional studies of whole-section brain organoid development and disease modeling studies."

    "abstract": "To meet the capacity and flexibility demands of future 6G networks, this paper proposes a novel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted communication framework that leverages integrated aerial access and terahertz (THz) backhaul. The system employs a UAV as an aerial access node, integrating THz backhaul for high-capacity core connection while providing multi-user connectivity via sub-6GHz access links enhanced with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). THz links enable ultra-high data rates through directional beamforming to mitigate molecular absorption and path loss, while NOMA enhances connectivity by serving multiple users simultaneously using power domain multiplexing with successive interference cancellation. A joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum rate of multiple ground users, considering UAV positioning, power allocation, and beamforming under Rician fading. The resulting non-convex problem is solved using a sequential least squares programming algorithm with a multi-start strategy. This integrated design is particularly well-suited for cellular and IoT deployments in remote or emergency scenarios where conventional terrestrial infrastructure is unavailable."

In the industrial cities where multiple polluting sources are located, it is critical to determine quickly who is responsible for the overflow and take rapid measures to correct it. While the continuous measurements have to be performed at the spots of interest for pollution monitoring, it is also highly important to improve the data processing speeds and prompt alerting protocols. Thereby, the real time response to the environmental threats would be enabled. A solution to achieve this prompt operational reaction is proposed in this paper."

    "abstract": "The increasing integration of distributed renewable energy resources among households has sparked growing interest in peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading as a means to enhance local energy sharing and prosumer participation. Blockchain technology is often proposed to support these systems due to its ability to ensure transparency security and decentralized control. However blockchain is resource-intensive complex and not universally suitable. Therefore there is a critical need to evaluate whether a given community has sufficient trading activity to justify such infrastructure. This paper proposes a novel methodology to quantify the energy trading potential (ETP) of a P2P community. The P2P energy trading market is modeled as a bipartite graph with consumers and prosumers as nodes and edge weights capturing the potential of each trading pair based on willingness to trade (reflected through buy/sell prices) demand-supply compatibility and communication strength. The total edge weight is normalized to define the Energy Trading Potential Index (ETPI) ranging from 0 to 1 where higher values indicate stronger trading opportunities. Simulations show that the method generally favors balanced communities (with roughly equal numbers of consumers and prosumers) though deviations may occur due to other factors. ETPI serves as a decision support tool throughout the life cycle of a P2P system helping to justify or optimize energy trading infrastructure."

By formulating the charging and discharging scheduling problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), the proposed model enables real-time adaptation to fluctuating electricity prices, varying grid load conditions, and renewable energy supply dynamics. A standard Deep Q-Network (DQN) architecture is employed to learn the optimal policy without relying on model-based assumptions or complex handcrafted heuristics. The state representation integrates key operational factors, including battery energy levels, time-of-day indicators, electricity prices, grid load, and renewable energy availability. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the DQN-based strategy can reduce operational costs by up to 43% and significantly mitigate peak grid loads compared to conventional uncontrolled charging baselines. Sensitivity analyses further reveal the influence of reward structure design on system performance. The results validate that Deep Q-Learning offers a scalable, adaptable, and efficient solution for intelligent EV fleet energy management in dynamic and uncertain smart grid environments."

Results demonstrate that the proposed modified optimizer helps tune extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) classifier performance consistently so that it outperforms other evaluated approaches, achieving the highest objective function values, lowest error rates, and balanced detection of normal and anomalous traffic. Convergence analysis and error distributions further confirm the stability and reliability of this approach.

Quantitatively distinguishing between active and passive movements within the same task is essential for understanding human motor control and may inform clinical and rehabilitation applications. However, few studies have compared agonist muscles during active and passive movements of the same joint in the same direction. In this study, data from agonist muscles (biceps brachii and triceps brachii) were obtained using surface electromyography (sEMG) and optical myography (OMG), two sensing modalities commonly used for proprioceptive assessment. Differences between active and passive movements were evaluated. The results show that sEMG amplitudes are significantly larger during active than passive movements in both muscles (after Holm correction). In contrast, OMG identifies phase-specific biceps segments with greater deformation during active movement; however, the scalar metrics-root-mean-square (RMS) and standard deviation (SD)-do not differ significantly. These findings suggest that differences between active and passive movements are expressed clearly in electrophysiological signals, whereas they appear only locally in muscle deformation. Future work should examine agonist-antagonist muscle groups and investigate active-passive differences under multiple velocity conditions."

Previous studies often employed Tetris to manipulate difficulty and evaluate flow through self-reports and physiological measures such as heart rate variability (HRV). While informative, these paradigms suffer from strong skill dependency, limiting the generalizability of physiological indicators. This study introduces a skill-independent shooting game designed to reduce prior experience effects. Using intuitive gyroscope-based controls, the game implements three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) to elicit varying levels of concentration. Ten university students played randomized sequences while self-reported flow scores and electrocardiogram data were collected. HRV features (low- and high-frequency components) were extracted from $\\mathbf{R}-\\mathbf{R}$ intervals for analysis. Results showed a consistent increase in self-reported flow with task difficulty (Easy: 4.0, Medium: 5.4, Hard: 6.5). HRV analysis revealed group-level tendencies toward reduced autonomic variability under higher challenge, though individual variability remained. In sum, the findings replicate the general direction of Tetris-based research while demonstrating that a skillindependent design can yield more consistent group-level outcomes. The proposed paradigm thus provides a practical and generalizable tool for advancing flow research through both subjective and physiological indices."

We further examine the mediating role of dynamic capabilities and the moderating role of environmental dynamism using survey data and hierarchical regression. Results show that both search types significantly promote green innovation. Reactive search enhances exploitative dynamic capabilities, while proactive search strengthens exploratory capabilities. These capabilities partially mediate the effects of the two search types. Environmental dynamism amplifies the link between proactive search and exploratory capability, as well as its indirect effect on green innovation, offering insights into firms’ green innovation strategies."

Among its various approaches, finger-writing verification of a simple symbol is the most convenient, in which a user is verified by writing a simple symbol with a finger on a smartphone screen. In a previous study, an error rate of 11.9% was achieved. Furthermore, by selecting and fusing individually high-performing features, an equivalent error rate was obtained, even though the number of used features was reduced. In this study, we propose a new feature selection method focusing on individuality, and a fusion method that combines this with three other selection methods. By using the proposed method, we finally achieved the error rate of 5.8%."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we design both the transmitter and receiver optical systems using Zemax optical design software. Additionally, we present the corresponding mathematical formulations that characterize the optical components. The developed optical system is then employed to evaluate key performance metrics namely, the received power, geometric loss, and outage probability, using Monte Carlo simulations within the context of a free-space optical (FSO) communication system. The transmitter optics system utilizes a collimator and proposed beam expander (BE) to reduce the divergence angle thereby geometric loss of the optical beam. In the receiver optics systems, we propose three different designs: the first design consists of a beam reducer followed by a collimating lens, whereas the second and third designs consist of a collimating plano-convex (PCX) lens and plano-concave (PCV) lens. The first receiver optics design emphasizes minimizing the beam diameter rather than maximizing power. The subsequent designs focus on enhancing power at the cost of increased beam diameter. These designs show a trade-off between received power and beam diameter in the receiver’s configuration to achieve an efficient FSO communication system. Further, we compare the outage probability performance for conventional and proposed FSO optics system. Our proposed optics with FSO system show a transmit power gain of around 22 dB compared to the conventional."

While the original PMRDN model estimates the channel for each subcarrier independently, the proposed hybrid block sparsity-integrated PMRDN (HBS-IPMRDN) performs joint estimation across all subcarriers in a single forward pass, capturing inter-subcarrier correlations and reducing computational complexity. A hybrid block sparsity module is integrated to enforce structured sparsity along the subcarrier frequency, suppressing weak and noisy components and thereby improving estimation accuracy. Simulation results show that HBS-IPMRDN achieves up to 15 dB and 20 dB improvements in normalized mean square error (NMSE) over PMRDN and simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (SOMP), respectively, under low SNR conditions of-5 dB."

This study presents the performance and degradation assessment of monocrystalline silicon PV modules that have been field-exposed for 21 years in the composite climatic zones of India. The observed annual power degradation rate ranges from 0.8 % to 4.0 %, surpassing typical warranty limits. Despite this degradation, the analysis indicates considerable potential for reusing PV modules that have experienced up to 25 % performance loss, particularly in secondary use for low voltage applications. Additionally, area requirement analysis at a latitude of 30° shows that accommodating modules with 25 % degradation would require approximately 36 % more land compared to non-degraded modules, an important consideration for project economics and land use planning."

This specific demand duration creates the demand peaks, for which there is need to pay extra charges to the grid.

Peak loads and overall energy expenditures are significantly reduced when DPPSEV-PV is compared to alternative methods. By attaining the lowest peak load and total cost, DPPSEV-PV demonstrates its superiority in managing the complex dynamics of EV and PV integration. In contemporary power networks, the DPPSEV-PV algorithm offers a reliable and effective EV and PV penetration rate, leading to cost reductions and ideal energy management. The installation of an AC charging station on the university campus has been the subject of analysis."

Using an array of five optodes placed over the midline of the prefrontal lobe, participants were asked to recall an alphabetical symbol from a sequence of symbols presented on the screen as part of the task. During task performance, signal changes from photodiodes at different locations on the prefrontal cortex were recorded. Time-resolved measurements revealed signal variations indicating a significant increase in the absorbance of 850 nm infrared light during task execution compared to baseline periods."

    "abstract": "Landslides pose a serious hazard worldwide, and monitoring their slow displacements is crucial for early warning and risk mitigation [1]. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) sensors provide continuous 3D positioning in all weather, but conventional geodetic-grade GNSS are expensive and fragile in harsh terrain. Recent years have seen the rise of low-cost GNSS units that offer centimeter-level accuracy at a fraction of the cost [2]. This paper reviews technical innovations that enable such performance, focusing on real field deployments. Key advances include high-precision positioning techniques (RTK and Precise Point Positioning, PPP) and hybrid PPP-RTK corrections that speed up convergence, data-driven approaches like “Virtual RINEX” (VRINEX) to emulate reference observations [3] [4], and integration of inexpensive MEMS inertial sensors to suppress GNSS noise [5]. Open-source processing (e.g. RTKLIB-based workflows) and community tools now make low-cost GNSS monitoring more accessible. Field tests confirm that properly deployed dual-frequency low-cost GNSS stations can track subcentimeter displacements. We summarize 14 representative studies, compare their setups and results (Tables 1&2), and conclude that multi-constellation dual-frequency receivers, short baselines or VRINEX references, and hybrid processing are recommended for cost-effective landslide monitoring. Future work should emphasize long-term autonomous networks and real-time PPP-RTK services to further democratize GNSS hazard monitoring."

Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) offer a promising solution by providing the flexibility necessary to support the generation or demand ramping needs. However, existing market structures often hinder the participation of BESS, primarily due to the lack of adequate compensation for their diverse capabilities. To address this issue, a flexible contract for BESS has been introduced in the literature. However, the effectiveness of a flexible contract depends on systematically determining its parameters. This paper presents a comprehensive methodology to determine parameters of a flexible contract for BESS offering grid services."

    "abstract": "The Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) system based on phase-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometry (Φ-OTDR) uses optical fiber as a medium to detect external vibration information. To improve the noise immunity of phase demodulation in DAS systems, this paper introduces an enhanced phase-locked loop demodulation method. The approach incorporates a Kalman filter (KF) to optimize the Costas loop (CL) and employs a moving average filter (MAF) to further suppress noise in the phase demodulation process. In addition to significantly improving phase demodulation performance, the method effectively reduces the influence of random noise on the demodulation accuracy. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed KF-CL-MAF algorithm reduces both phase demodulation distortion and mean square error by an order of magnitude, while increasing the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by approximately 11 dB compared to existing demodulation methods. This improvement provides a more reliable technical solution for high-precision vibration monitoring with DAS systems in complex environments."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a pulse with modulation (PWM) strategy for a transformerless grid-connected inverter for photovoltaic (PV) systems based on two cascaded inverters. The cascaded inverter consists of two inverters, where the upper inverter is the T-type inverter (TT) and the lower inverter is the full bridge (FB). This inverter is called 7L-TT-FB. Disconnection of the transformer at the grid connection results cause leakage current to flow through the ground, which is hazardous. In order to minimize the effect of leakage current, the common mode voltage (CMV) is usually maintained to be constant at all modes of operation. In this paper, a different PWM strategy in the multilevel inverter is proposed to deal with the leakage current issue; no topology modifications were made and a traditional current controller. The proposal is based on the capacitor leakage voltage evolution. Numerical results that constitute the theoretical are presented."

Due to the limited lifespan of the traction batteries in these vehicles, there will be a high volume of battery modules in the coming years that are at the end of their first life cycle and can either be recycled or repurposed for a second application. The aim of this work is to develop a tool that evaluates the usability of a retired battery module based on a limited amount of key data and taking into account technical, economic, social and ecological aspects. The data basis for the tool was developed using literature research and by conducting an online survey on brand awareness and popularity of the car manufacturers with the largest sales on the German market. The result of this work is a MATLAB tool that enables the user to evaluate a battery module in terms of technical, economic, ecological and social aspects based on a limited amount of technical data, the price, the car brand and the country in which the reprocessing into a second-life battery takes place. The user can individually prioritize the aspects to obtain an overall assessment of the battery module."

    "abstract": "The Personal Software Process (PSP), developed by Watts Humphrey, is a methodology designed to improve individual performance in software development through disciplined planning, tracking, and analysis practices. This study implemented PSP in an academic setting to evaluate its impact on the productivity and quality of software developed by university students. The study was conducted in the Software Processes course, where 18 students applied PSP while individually developing an address book application. Standardized templates were used to record time per phase, defects introduced, defects removed, and other relevant metrics. This case study used a quantitative approach with a non-experimental, cross-sectional design. Analysis of the collected data revealed patterns in the effort invested, code quality, and individual productivity. The results indicate that applying PSP enabled students to gain greater control over their time, improve early defect detection, and reflect upon their work habits. The study concludes that integrating PSP into the classroom fosters the development of practical skills related to quality, self-regulation, and continuous improvement in software engineering performance."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Accurate estimation of indoor illumination is critical for sustaining the operation of battery-free Photovoltaic (PV) Energy-Harvesting (EH) based Zero-Energy Internet of Things (ZE-IoT) nodes. Most of these nodes rely on supercapacitors for energy storage, which offer high cycle life but exhibit low energy density compared to batteries. Consequently, the available runtime depends heavily on the limited optical power density typically found in indoor environments. Using dedicated optical sensors to monitor illumination increases node complexity, raises energy overhead, and is susceptible to noise. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel Machine Learning (ML) approach that estimates indoor incident illumination on ZE-IoT nodes from supercapacitor voltage variations, thereby eliminating the need for dedicated illumination sensors. For concept evaluation, a Random Forest regressor with Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOO-CV) is employed to infer optical power availability from the supercapacitor’s discharge behavior. Experimental validation using a ZE-IoT prototype based on the LIoT platform demonstrates an average estimation error of ±29.8 lux. By transferring illumination estimation to the network side, the proposed method reduces node complexity, supports energy-constrained operation, and enables proactive outage mitigation in sustainable ZE-IoT deployments."

    "abstract": "This paper presents an advanced machine learning model to enhance weather and energy forecasting while optimizing solar photovoltaic (PV) system performance. The proposed framework focuses on three objectives: improving weather prediction accuracy, enhancing energy forecasting reliability, and maximizing solar PV efficiency through tilt angle optimization. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based model was developed to predict key weather parameters, such as temperature, irradiance, and diffuse radiation, with systematic refinements using a Dynamic Error Correction Model (DECM) to minimize prediction errors. Energy forecasts were validated using the PVsyst simulation tool [4]. Additionally, a machine-learning-driven tilt angle optimization method was implemented to determine weekly angles that enhance energy efficiency. The results highlight significant improvements in prediction accuracy and system adaptability, with practical validations through extensive experiments. The model demonstrates strong performance in predicting key weather parameters for PV system optimization, with accurate forecasts of Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) and diffuse irradiance, achieving RMSSE values of 0.3365 and 0.4047, respectively. Temperature predictions showed moderate accuracy (RMSSE 0.6135), and the DECM further refined forecasts, significantly reducing GHI errors to 0.2065. This approach avoids the cost of fully automated tracking systems while significantly improving performance over a static annual tilt. Notably, it has been practically implemented in real life at the German University in Cairo (GUC) on a groundmounted PV model, demonstrating its effectiveness beyond simulations."

To address this challenge, we propose a Hierarchical Channel Attention (HCA) module that models channel dependencies hierarchically by combining coarse-grained global channel selection with fine-grained local channel optimization. The module is lightweight, easily integrable, and enhances keypoint feature representation with minimal additional parameters and computational cost. Experimental results on the MPII dataset demonstrate that HCA improves PCK@0.5 by 1.46% on MobileNetV2 and 1.50% on ShuffleNetV2, outperforming existing lightweight attention mechanisms such as SE, CBAM, and ECA."

Using leave-one-vehicle-out cross-validation across 10 km/h speed intervals (speed classes), both methods achieve nearly identical accuracy when a misclassification of one interval is tolerated: 94.68% (MA) and 94.63% (Whisper). These results indicate that AFMs can match physics-based baselines while requiring less feature engineering, positioning them as promising candidates for future acoustic traffic monitoring systems."

This adversarial setup forces the Generator to produce visually realistic images while maintaining high message fidelity under various distortions such as JPEG compression or noise.

This paper presents novel test methodologies to evaluate RA and RIS performance, focusing on the sub-6 GHz frequency range. We introduce a systematic approach involving link budget calculations, far-field measurements, and noise floor assessments, applied in three testing environments: an anechoic chamber, open-air testing with narrowband FM, and a 5G network-in-a-box (NIB) setup. To ensure realistic benchmarking, our methodology compares RA/RIS systems against both a vacuum reference and a copper plate of the same size. While copper plates reflect signals without directional control, RA/RIS structures provide enhanced gain and beam-shaping capabilities. This comparative framework highlights the practical benefits of RA/RIS over passive reflectors, offering clearer insights into their true performance in real-world conditions."

    "abstract": "Japan’s food security has become a national emergency issue, and the fisheries sector is no exception, facing serious challenges including labor shortages and declining catches due to factors such as global warming. As a solution, aquaculture technology for marine products is expected to play a crucial role. However, proper management and operation according to fish conditions and water quality are important, and particularly delicate handling is essential for feeding operations. This is because feeding has strong dependencies on critical factors for successful aquaculture, such as fish growth periods and water quality deterioration due to leftover feed. Many fish species are difficult to manage with simple timer-based feeding approaches, necessitating continuous human monitoring in many situations. Therefore, technological innovations are desired to enhance laborsaving and scalability. To address these issues, we developed an automatic feeding system for Sillago japonica aquaculture utilizing AI and IoT, comprising the following four processes: (A) image input via camera, (B) image recognition via supervised learning, (C) feeder control via reinforcement learning, and (D) feeding action via microcontroller. In particular, the control policy in (C) has been implemented through training in a dedicated aquaculture simulator. In this work, we redefined the reward design to suppress the occurrence of leftover feed in addition to conventional parameters, aiming not only to shorten the shipping period but also achieve labor-saving in water quality management. Simulation results demonstrate that our system effectively maintains fish growth while reducing size variability and suppressing leftover feed, indicating a viable path toward automated, labor-efficient aquaculture operations with improved water quality management. This study assumes an indoor, landbased aquaculture environment."

The proposed detection method utilizes the Hankel matrix to identify a wide range of cyber-attacks, including step, ramp, and simultaneous multi-link intrusions, while effectively distinguishing them from natural disturbances like faults or load variations-significantly reducing false alarms. The effectiveness of the proposed detection scheme is validated through detailed simulations on a 4-DG AC microgrid system under various attack scenarios, demonstrating its superior accuracy in detecting and locating stealthy and complex attacks and provides a cost-effective, scalable solution that does not depend on network reconfiguration."

    "abstract": "Food loss and waste (FLW) exert considerable economic and environmental repercussions. The World Food Program (WFP) reports that 20 percent of edible food is wasted annually, equating to approximately 1 billion meals on average. The significant economic repercussions of FLW amount to nearly 1 trillion dollars each year. Moreover, 10 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions result from food loss, which is nearly five times greater than the emissions produced by the aviation industry. The European Union (EU) established stringent objectives to substantially decrease food loss and waste (FLW) by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. To achieve these objectives, one specific area where food loss and waste (FLW) totals 620 million metric tons is within the food cold chain sector alone. A considerable portion of food loss in this sector is attributed to outdated infrastructure and a lack of technological resources, resulting in inadequate defrosting and subsequent food waste. This article introduces the machine-learning based approaches to characterize the industrial defrost cycle that will help in mitigation of food wastage by enabling timely intervention and necessary actions. Two defrost classification frameworks, Window-based and Cycle-based, are proposed in this paper. The machine-learning models, such as SVM, KNN, RF, and NB, are trained either on real-time sensors data or on features extracted from the real data. The results show that classification accuracies of 0.97 and 1 are achieved for the Window-based framework and the Cycle-based framework, respectively."

    "abstract": "Accurate short-term and medium-term wind power forecasting (WPF) is essential for the stable and reliable integration of wind energy into modern power systems. While artificial intelligence (AI) has improved forecasting accuracy, the potential of Bayesian-optimized hybrid deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) models for WPF remains underexplored. This study introduces a novel approach that combines hybrid DL architectures with ML models, optimized using Bayesian Optimization (BO), to enhance prediction performance. The proposed framework integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Residual Networks (ResNet) into a BO-CNN-ResNet-LSTM framework, capturing both spatial and temporal patterns. Alongside, traditional ML models are also optimized for comparison. The methodology is tested using historical wind power data from Pakistan for day-ahead and week-ahead forecasts. Results show that under limited data availability, the Bayesian-optimized Random Forest (BORF) model outperforms the hybrid DL model. For example, in Gul Ahmad WPP, BO-RF achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.0036 % for day-ahead forecasting, compared to 0.0874 % for the hybrid DL model. This suggests that ML models work better with smaller datasets due to their efficiency, while hybrid DL models excel with larger datasets by leveraging deep feature extraction. This study establishes a data-adaptive framework where ML is preferred for small datasets, and hybrid DL is more effective in data-rich environments, improving WPF reliability and supporting the smooth integration of wind energy into power grids."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel resilient algorithm designed for distributed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in dynamic and unreliable network environments. Initially, the UAVs should be trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for autonomous mission-critical operations and are fundamentally grounded by centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) using a centralized MARL server. In this situation, it is crucial to consider the case where several UAVs cannot receive CTDE-based MARL learning parameters for resilient operations in unreliable network conditions. To tackle this issue, a communication graph is used where its edges are established when two UAVs/nodes are communicable. Then, the edge-connected UAVs can share their training data if one of the UAVs cannot be connected to the CTDE-based MARL server under unreliable network conditions. Additionally, the edge cost considers power efficiency. Based on this given communication graph, message-passing is used for electing the UAVs that can provide their MARL learning parameters to their edge-connected peers. Lastly, performance evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm in terms of power efficiency and resilient UAV task management, outperforming existing benchmark algorithms."

    "abstract": "Log-based anomaly detection (LAD) is imperative to ensure both the reliability and security of software systems. Although many deep learning approaches have been designed to capture complex and diverse anomaly patterns from log files, they heavily rely on large-scale annotated data. However, collecting sufficient labeled data is impractical when a software system has just been deployed. In this paper, we propose a cross-system few-shot learning log-based anomaly detection approach, namely FSLog, to solve the abnormal label scarcity problem, which is the main challenge of recent LAD research. Specifically, we leverage a pre-trained model from source system to enrich feature representations so that data instances from target system can also be effectively represented. To this end, we introduce a novel adversarial margin loss to enhance our feature distinguishability while preserving their generalizability. Further, we also develop a masked interactive temporal network for robust feature extraction of temporal relationships for log samples. We evaluate the proposed FSLog on three publicly available datasets based on a standard few-shot learning setup protocol. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the best performance in detecting abnormal logs when compared to state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Electric-hydrogen coupled virtual power plants (EH-VPPs) have emerged as a promising solution to enhance energy flexibility and economy in harbors by aggregating distributed energy and hydrogen systems. However, scheduling becomes challenging due to the uncertainty of ship hydrogen demand under varying navigation environments. This paper proposes a robust scheduling method for EH-VPPs that jointly considers PV output errors and navigation-induced hydrogen demand uncertainty. A hydrogen demand estimation model is developed based on environmental factors, including wave height and wind speed. To address the difficulty in obtaining accurate data distributions, a robust uncertainty model is formulated, and a statistically feasible chance-constrained framework is introduced to describe the impact of State Of Hydrogen and State Of Charge constraints. A robust optimization model integrating statistical feasibility is then established. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed method increases profits by ​​13.8%​​ compared to conventional robust optimisation method, and the violation probability of hydrogen and charge constraints is maintained below ​​5%​​, while violation rate is 0, under the conventional robust optimisation method, which is overly conservative."

We present qualitative indications of conceptual understanding of invertibility, based on textual evidence of diagnosis and justification in student artifacts; however, no objective pre/post tests were administered. We discuss design implications for STEM courses and propose a replicable rubric for post hoc conceptual evaluation."

    "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to provide a comparison of channel characteristics for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication at 60 GHz and 80 GHz frequency bands in a high-mobility scenario where two vehicles pass each other in opposite directions. The study is based on measurements of the time-varying channel impulse response capturing the behavior of multi-path propagation during vehicle motion. By directly comparing these two frequency bands under identical measurement conditions, we attempt to quantify the differences in power delay profile, root mean square (RMS) delay spread, RMS Doppler spread, and intervals (regions) of stationarity in time domain. The results show that these bands do not differ significantly, but the 80 GHz band exhibits somewhat greater RMS delay spread and RMS Doppler spread when calculated over the entire delay-Doppler spectrum, and conversely exhibits shorter stationarity regions. However, the characteristics of the measurement setup in the two bands and their influence on comparative measurements must be considered. In particular, attention must be paid to the impact of antennas."

    "abstract": "The recent advancements in communication systems demand advanced modulation schemes to accomplish high speed data links with improved spectral efficiency. Optical modulation techniques are increasingly preferred due to its higher bandwidth and ultra-low loss transmission terabit link capabilities. These systems depend on Single Sideband (SSB), Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK), Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) schemes. These optical systems are highly dependent on Electro-Optical modulator based configurations with a critical requirement of operating it with high stability. The bias point of the modulator plays a pivotal role in defining its modulation characteristics for optimal performance. Conventional bias controllers are designed for specific requirements, often expensive and lacks flexibility for multi-format operation. In this work, we propose a low-cost, reconfigurable bias controller with comparatively less set up time for modulator configurations that is further extended for usage in optical QPSK communication applications. The paper includes various results obtained during the performance evaluation. The controller’s embedded program can be modified to adapt with different modulation formats without hardware-level changes. Experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness of these modulators with stable operations having minimal drift."

Our proposed method leverages prior knowledge of 4G-LTE cell information shared through 5G-NR signaling, allowing the UE to skip the primary synchronization signal (PSS) and secondary synchronization signal (SSS) detection phases and directly initiate master information block (MIB) decoding. This targeted optimization significantly reduces the processing latency and associated energy consumption.

    "abstract": "On April 28, 2025, the Iberian Peninsula experienced one of the most extensive blackouts in European history, affecting nearly all of mainland Spain and Portugal. This paper provides a structured technical synthesis of the event based solely on official documents and institutional communications available as of June 2025, including reports by the Spanish Government, Red Eléctrica (the national transmission system operator), ENTSO-E public updates, and selected expert commentary. At the time of writing, formal root-cause investigations are still ongoing, and final conclusions may evolve. However, the information currently available indicates that the blackout was not caused by a single fault or cyberattack, but by a complex sequence involving voltage instability, insufficient dynamic reactive support, uncoordinated generator tripping, and systemic protection cascades. These events occurred under conditions of low demand and high instantaneous solar generation, which reduced system inertia and voltage controllability. The incident underscores the need for updated grid code enforcement, more granular visibility of distributed generation, enhanced dynamic voltage support mechanisms, and stronger contingency planning frameworks for low-inertia, inverter-dominated systems."

    "abstract": "Power demand prediction is an essential task for an efficient energy management system, grid stability, and operational planning. This paper presents a novel method for time series forecasting that integrates advanced feature engineering, Optuna-based hyperparameter tuning techniques, and ensemble learning models. First, data is collected and preprocessed. Then, a feature engineering step is performed to create time series variables, lag features, and rolling window statistics. The created variables are used to detect seasonality, temporal dependencies, and consumption trends. The Optuna technique is employed to tune the parameters of three ensemble learning models: CatBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost. These models are trained and tested using a real-world power consumption dataset. The performance is computed based on a time-series cross-validation method. The results indicate that the CatBoost model, with optimal parameters, outperforms other models by reaching the highest <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}}$</tex> score of 0.9987 and the lowest error metrics (mean absolute percentage error of 0.50%). This study validates the effectiveness of the proposed methodology that incorporates advanced feature selection and model optimization to generate highly precise predictions."

    "abstract": "Early and accurate differentiation between Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and dementia is crucial in clinical practice: MCI represents a critical window where interventions ranging from lifestyle modifications and cognitive training to enrollment in disease-modifying trials can meaningfully slow or even halt progression. Misclassifying MCI as dementia risks exposing patients to unnecessary pharmacological treatments and the psychosocial burdens of a dementia diagnosis, while overlooking early dementia delays essential support services and increases the likelihood of safety-critical complications. Deep learning models for EEG-based dementia classification have achieved high accuracy. However, these methods lack transparency and do not provide prediction reliability. To this end, we introduce CP-EEGViT, a transformer-based framework that integrates conformal prediction (CP) to produce calibrated, uncertaintyaware prediction sets. We adapt a DINO-pretrained Vision Transformer to 3D EEG inputs via a novel spatiotemporal patch embedding and weight inflation technique, and evaluate two conformal methods, namely Split Conformal Prediction and Adaptive Log Conformal Prediction(ALCP), on a publicly available EEG dataset from Chung-Ang University Hospital, South Korea. At a 80% confidence level, margin-based conformal prediction reduces critical misclassifications from $\\mathbf{4 5. 2 \\%}$ (without CP) to 6.5% and defers 77.8% of ambiguous samples for expert review. The adaptive log-conformal approach yields more efficient singleton predictions (56.9%) with a false-negative rate of 22.6%. Our CP-EEGViT model also converges faster and outperforms non-pretrained baselines under limited data conditions. Integrating the adaptive log conformal prediction method within an EEG-based dementia, MCI decision system can enhance interpretability by providing calibrated prediction sets and coverage guarantees to every decision, while simultaneously safeguarding patient care by flagging low-confidence cases for expert review in safety-critical settings."

    "abstract": "Cooperative positioning enhances localization accuracy in intelligent artifact swarms through shared measurements, especially in environments such as urban canyons or disaster zones. Dynamic topologies, heterogeneous measurements, and scalability demands create complex challenges for state estimation. This paper introduces MRCA, the first comprehensive framework unifying heterogeneous measurements, reasoning processes, environment cognition, and scenario-based applications for cooperative positioning. The four-layer architecture comprises: i) the Measurement block converts signals into measurement parameters in a standard format independent of sensor types and measurement methods; ii) the Reasoning block uncovers the underlying principles of state transition using a four reasoning elements; iii) the Cognition block underscores the importance of node-environment interactions by identifying new valid radiation sources and verifying the ongoing validity of existing ones; iv) the Application block offers users task-driven cooperative positioning services, like execute potential navigation actions. Our proposed framework demonstrates performance improvements in various key metrics compared to legacy swarm positioning algorithms. Focusing on the framework itself, we employ the most basic algorithms within each block, and the experimental results are as follows: In scenarios featuring static unknown anchors, sparse perception, and collision interference, MRCA reduces cumulative positioning error by over 51% for dead-reckoning and 39% for traditional distributed cooperative positioning, while reducing average orientation error by over 31% and 27%, respectively.

Among conventional approaches, normalized scheduling with a unit weight factor emerges as a balanced solution, enabling more efficient utilization of spectrum while preserving fairness across users. The evaluation was carried out through controlled drive test campaigns in a mature multi-band LTE network, using a consistent methodology that yields results directly applicable to operator-grade benchmarking. Results demonstrate a significant increase in higher-order CA activations and measurable throughput gains, with average Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) rates improving by more than 16% compared to the baseline. These findings confirm that CA optimization provides both technical gains and a dependable basis for operator and regulatory performance evaluations."

Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) technology is a crucial facilitator of these developments, as it employs multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver ends to enhance spectral efficiency and link reliability. This paper investigates the influence of antenna configurations by analyzing radiation patterns generated in MATLAB. Simulations assume half-wavelength spacing and uniform linear array (ULA). Results indicate that increasing the number of antennas increases directional gain, narrows the main lobe, and improves angular resolution. These changes are reflected in the half-power beamwidth (HPBW), which is a key parameter in antennas characteristics. A narrower HPBW signifies enhanced directivity and spatial resolution, which are critical features for 5G networks and future wireless communication systems."

For this study, the mathematical model based on the Charge Simulation Method (CSM) was used. The analysis are performed for the case of 400 kV overhead transmission line. The electric field intensity is calculated over the circumference and in the immediate vicinity of the conductors. The obtained results show that increasing the thickness of the RTV coating has a strong influence on reducing electric field intensity values on the conductor surface and in its immediate vicinity. Furthermore, increasing the thickness of the RTV coating decreases the electric field intensity gradient in the vicinity of the conductor and consequently decreases the probability of the stationary AC corona occurrence."

A data-driven coordinated cyber-attack is injected on the adaptive load sharing commands (ALSC) and output voltage measurements in the communication line between the supervisory and primary controllers. To detect and mitigate such intrusions, a decentralized long short-term memory (LSTM) is proposed for each GFMI that predicts the ALSC based on the time series data of measured active power, frequency, and rate of change of frequency (ROCOF). The training dataset is developed during normal disturbances like step load changes of the network, which enables accurate detection of the ALSC deviation for each GFMI and identifies the anomalies in the communication line. Moreover, it minimizes the dependency on the centralized supervisory controller and the associated communication infrastructure. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed strategy are validated on a modified 9-bus IEEE system with multiple GFMI."

By enabling mobile wireless energy transfer between EVs, the solution overcomes one of the main drawbacks of permanent charging infrastructure. As a mobile power donor, a Magni Silver mobile robot with a WiBotic wireless charging kit autonomously finds its way to vehicles with low battery levels. Charging requests are coordinated by a central dispatch system. The effects of coil distance, ferrite material utilization, and battery state-of-charge (SoC) on charging efficiency are demonstrated experimentally, with peak efficiencies exceeding 80% under ideal circumstances. The results show that ferrite tiles greatly improve performance at longer ranges, and wireless power transfer works best at low SoC levels and at 20–50 mm coil separations. To guarantee successful deployment, the system also incorporates real-time mapping and robot operating system (ROS)-based autonomous navigation. With potential usage in fleet operations, smart campuses, and future EV ecosystems, this study offers a scalable and infrastructure-independent approach to EV energy replenishment."

NS-3 provides a suitable platform for testing real world Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) networks. However, the existing Mobility Models in NS-3 are deterministic and insufficient for real-world traffic network simulation, limiting the generation to small vehicle densities. There exist traffic simulators, such as the Simulator for Urban Mobility (SUMO) and Verkehr In Städten-SIMulationsmodell (VISSIM), that can provide various traffic engineering applications, and real world traffic data essential for testing V2X networks. To enable real world V2X network simulation in NS-3, an Application Programming Interface (API) is required to convert real traffic data to an NS-3 compatible data format. This paper designs and presents an API for integrating traffic data from SUMO and VISSIM into the NS-3 data format that can aid in future real V2X tests and implementations. Detailed simulation results present the efficacy of the proposed API in converting real-world traffic data through the successful compilation of NS-3, forming a platform for testing real world 5G and beyond V2X networks."

NDT is the considered to be the key enabler of the zero-touch networks to validate the configurations and policies before implementing in the actual network. For building an NDT, data-driven behaviour modelling is challenging due to the limited historical configurations changes done in the real network. We propose a method of building an NDT as a collection of causal behaviour models, replicating a specific aspect of the network. Our approach enables gradual scaling of the NDT by adding new causal behaviour models dynamically when enough observational data is available for each network configuration."

    "abstract": "Point clouds have gained prominence across numerous applications due to their ability to accurately represent 3D objects and scenes. However, efficiently compressing unstructured, high-precision point cloud data remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose NeRC<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>, a novel point cloud compression framework that leverages implicit neural representations (INRs) to encode both geometry and attributes of dense point clouds. Our approach employs two coordinate-based neural networks: one maps spatial coordinates to voxel occupancy, while the other maps occupied voxels to their attributes, thereby implicitly representing the geometry and attributes of a voxelized point cloud. The encoder quantizes and compresses network parameters alongside auxiliary information required for reconstruction, while the decoder reconstructs the original point cloud by inputting voxel coordinates into the neural networks. Furthermore, we extend our method to dynamic point cloud compression through techniques that reduce temporal redundancy, including a 4D spatio-temporal representation termed 4D-NeRC<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>.

For dynamic point clouds, 4D-NeRC<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup> achieves superior geometry compression performance compared to the latest G-PCC and V-PCC standards, while matching state-of-the-art learning-based methods.

    "abstract": "A wide variety of real-world data, such as sea measurements, e.g., temperatures collected by distributed sensors and multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) trajectories, can be naturally represented as graphs, often exhibiting non-Euclidean structures. These graph representations may evolve over time, forming time-varying graphs. Effectively modeling and analyzing such dynamic graph data is critical for tasks like predicting graph evolution and reconstructing missing graph data. In this paper, we propose a framework based on the Koopman autoencoder (KAE) to handle time-varying graph data. Specifically, we assume the existence of a hidden non-linear dynamical system, where the state vector corresponds to the graph embedding of the time varying graph signals. To capture the evolving graph structures, the graph data is first converted into a vector time series through graph embedding, representing the structural information in a finite-dimensional latent space. In this latent space, the KAE is applied to learn the underlying non-linear dynamics governing the temporal evolution of graph features, enabling both prediction and reconstruction tasks."

However, previous research has typically focused on either two-agent settings or large-scale well-mixed agent populations, where the considered interaction scenarios were far from realistic. In this article, we consider structured populations where agents can interact with immediate neighbors. By using the pair-approximation method, we develop a new dynamical model to describe the <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$Q$</tex-math> </inline-formula>-learning dynamics in stochastic games on regular graphs. Through comparisons with agent-based simulation results, we validate the accuracy of our dynamical model across various stochastic games, population structures, and algorithm parameters. Our research thus provides both qualitative and quantitative insights into the effects of state transition rules and graph topologies in population dynamics. In particular, we show that, under certain conditions, state transitions can significantly promote the evolution of cooperation in social dilemmas. We also explored the effects of agent degree on cooperation, and unlike previous findings, we show that this can have either positive or negative implications for cooperation depending on the transition rules."

In this paper, we propose an exact metering framework using the Arithmetic Tensor Transform (ATT), which resolves perharmonic real, reactive, and distortion powers without spectral leakage or loss of orthogonality. Unlike FFT-based estimations, ATT provides lossless, symbolic decomposition of power components, enabling precise, fair, and harmonics-aware billing, supporting fairer billing and improved compliance with IEEE 519 limits."

This case report details the death of a 59-year-old woman who succumbed to cerebral edema and encephalopathy following the use of a lead-contaminated herbal cream intended to treat hemorrhoids. The case underscores the dangers associated with unregulated herbal products, which may contain harmful substances such as heavy metals. Despite the perception that herbal remedies are safer and more affordable than conventional treatments, their natural appeal does not eliminate the risk of contamination. Many plants can accumulate metals from their environment, exacerbating the risk of lead exposure. This case underscores the urgent need for stricter regulations and oversight in the herbal medicine industry to prevent such health hazards. Implementing stronger regulatory measures are essential to ensure that all medicinal and cosmetic products are free from harmful contaminants and to safeguard public health against the significant risks associated with lead poisoning."

    "abstract": "Crack detection on concrete surfaces is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of aging infrastructure. However, supervised deep learning models often suffer from performance degradation when the training and test data distributions differ. This paper addresses covariate shift caused by differences in image resolution-termed Multi-Resolution Adaptation (MRA)-by introducing a one-step framework for crack segmentation. The proposed method jointly trains a U-Net-based segmentation model and a lightweight importanceestimation model that assigns weights to training images according to their estimated likelihood of appearing in the test domain. The training in this method is done in one step, reducing effects of underfitting inherent in two-step approaches and only requires unlabeled images in target domains. Class Activation Mapping (CAM) is employed to visualize the regions contributing to importance estimation, revealing that resolution differences are captured mainly through background surface texture rather than crack structures. Experiments conducted on a public dataset with artificially generated multi-resolution images demonstrate that the proposed approach improves Intersection over Union (IoU), particularly when low-resolution images constitute as little as 1% of the training data. These results confirm that one-step covariate shift adaptation effectively enhances model robustness to multiresolution domain shifts while requiring only unlabeled target domain images."

A temporally conditional latent diffusion model is proposed to synthesize the future image in the latent space for early cancer monitoring. Experiments conducted on the NLST dataset demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative models in both pixel-level fidelity and perceptual quality, achieving higher PSNR and SSIM, as well as lower FID and LPIPS scores.

Though rare, urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by Enterococcus faecalis can also trigger ReA. Diagnosis is clinical, established through a recent infection history and characteristic joint involvement. We present a 61 -year-old female with a history of depression and ADHD, who was found in a state of self-neglect and diagnosed with failure to thrive. During hospitalization, she developed symptoms of a UTI, and urine culture grew Enterococcus faecalis. Patient’s symptoms subsequently evolved to include joint stiffness, ocular discharge, and nasal congestion, she was diagnosed with reactive arthritis, likely triggered by her prolonged UTI. The patient was treated and showed improvement throughout her admission. This case highlights the importance of considering reactive arthritis in patients with atypical infectious triggers such as Enterococcus faecalis UTI, especially in the context of prolonged catheterization and persistent infection. Early recognition and appropriate management can improve outcomes. Further research is needed to better characterize the spectrum of pathogens implicated in ReA and to optimize diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. ()"

This paper presents an exploration into the design, implementation, and evaluation of multimodal gesture and speech-based interaction systems tailored for autonomous mobile robots in residential settings. We propose a hybrid interaction architecture that fuses real-time computer vision with natural language processing (NLP) models, leveraging deep learning frameworks such as CNN-LSTM for gesture recognition and Transformer-based ASR models for contextual speech understanding. The results indicate a significant improvement in command accuracy (92.7%), response time (1.4s), and user satisfaction score (4.6/5), particularly under noisy and dynamic conditions. The study also uncovers challenges in co-articulation, gesture segmentation, and crossmodal error compensation. Our findings provide valuable insights into multimodal HRI interface co-design for AIintegrated domestic robotics, paving the way toward inclusive, adaptive, and context-aware smart home ecosystems."

While these platforms—such as Tesla's Dojo, NVIDIA DRIVE, and Mobileye EyeQ—offer impressive advances in computational efficiency, energy management, and latency reduction, their approaches to fault tolerance remain less explored. Safety-critical systems require fault tolerance because any one piece of hardware or software could remove all trust in the system's reliability [1], [2]. This paper describes the types of heterogeneous architecture used in autonomous vehicles, and it concentrates on the way current systems avoid redundancy, failure, and graceful degradation. Based on public domain information and available research on top market players, the paper sheds light on the absence of elementary fault tolerance mechanisms. The study also emphasizes the lack of sufficient research attention to fault tolerance in heterogeneous autonomous systems and describes relevant research directions to improve safety in the next generation of vehicles."

In situations where disasters cause heavy losses, using the capacity of these resources can help to continue energy supply and reduce losses. In this regard, this research examines and compares the process of restoring the power grid after a storm in the presence of renewable resources, including wind and solar power plants, and its uncertainty is considered through the information gap method. Modeling is implemented on the IEEE standard 69-bus network, and recovery is examined in two cases of the presence and absence of renewable resources. The results show that using renewable resources in the recovery process can reduce the time of the recovery process by 28% and the losses caused by disasters due to the storage and continuity of energy up to 34%, especially in inaccessible locations."

This paper introduces MRCA, the first comprehensive framework unifying heterogeneous measurements, reasoning processes, environment cognition, and scenario-based applications for cooperative positioning. The four-layer architecture comprises: i) the Measurement block converts signals into measurement parameters in a standard format independent of sensor types and measurement methods; ii) the Reasoning block uncovers the underlying principles of state transition using a four reasoning elements; iii) the Cognition block underscores the importance of node-environment interactions by identifying new valid radiation sources and verifying the ongoing validity of existing ones; iv) the Application block offers users task-driven cooperative positioning services, like execute potential navigation actions.

    "abstract": "The identification of radio frequency fingerprint (RFF) extracted from wireless signals subjected to channel interference faces a formidable challenge. Traditional equalization-based channel removal methods require known pilot signals and may potentially eliminate RFF features while suppressing channel effects. To address this challenge, the channel divide-and-conquer normalization (CDCN) algorithm is proposed to remove effects of arbitrary channels while preserving RFF features in the sense of cosine similarity. Through cross-scenario experiments on 60 off-the-shelf ZigBee devices in eight different scenarios, the CDCN algorithm with region of interest (ROI) achieves high accuracy of up to 99.98% on ResNet-9 and is verified to be generalized and practical."

    "abstract": "Human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI) is a design philosophy that prioritizes humans in the design, development, deployment, and use of AI systems, aiming to maximize AI’s benefits while mitigating its negative impacts. Despite its growing prominence in literature, the lack of methodological guidance for its implementation poses challenges to HCAI practice. To address this gap, this article proposes a comprehensive HCAI methodological framework (HCAI-MF) comprising five key components: HCAI requirement hierarchy, approach and method taxonomy, process, interdisciplinary collaboration approach, and multilevel design paradigms. A case study demonstrates HCAI-MF’s practical implications, while the article also analyzes implementation challenges. Actionable recommendations and a “three-layer” HCAI implementation strategy are provided to address these challenges and guide future evolution of HCAI-MF. HCAI-MF is presented as a systematic and executable methodology capable of overcoming current gaps, enabling effective design, development, deployment, and use of AI systems, and advancing HCAI practice."

This model implements main flash operations: read, write or program, and block erase and is validated both functionally and quantitatively. The simulation results show read, write and erase latencies of 45-55 ns, 180-220 ns, and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1.5-2 \\mu \\mathrm{s}$</tex> respectively, achieving a data throughput between 8 and 12 MB/s. The architecture was simplified to a 1 KB single page design with separate address and data lines for improved clarity for the study. Despite the restrictions, the model successfully replicates the essential behavior of NAND flash memory serves as a tool for understanding memory architecture, logic and hierarchical VHDL design. To test functionality a testbench was developed, generating clock signals and applying stimulus to simulate memory access. As a practical application sample ECG (electrocardiogram) data was stored and retrieved from memory demonstrating a potential use in biomedical signal and embedded healthcare systems. This simulation results confirm the correct data storage, ensuring the reliability for implementation in FPGA systems. This work could be implemented to develop a layout design."

Pneumatic levitation relies on controlled airflow to counteract gravity, but its nonlinear dynamics and sensitivity to disturbances make control challenging. The proposed controller, implemented on an ESP32 platform, provides a low-cost and efficient realtime solution without requiring precise system modeling. An HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor was integrated for position measurement, chosen for its simplicity and affordability. Despite its susceptibility to fluctuations, the FLC demonstrated robustness in compensating for imprecise measurements, outperforming conventional model-based strategies. The experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving steady-state errors below 4 %, overshoot under 6 %, and settling times of around 2 seconds across different reference positions."

The system was evaluated under varying wind speeds, turbine inertia constants, and with/without reactive power compensation. Results show that increasing wind speed significantly enhances power generation and power factors, higher inertia improves dynamic stability, and capacitive compensation reduces reactive power drawn from the grid. A prototype of the system is implemented and illustrated. The proposed approach demonstrates technical feasibility for roadside renewable energy integration, with potential environmental and economic benefits."

    "abstract": "The increasing integration of inverterbased resources (IBRs) in modern power systems leads to a reduction in overall system inertia and stability margins. They produce power less than conventional fossil-fuel-based plants, positioning them as price followers in energy markets. Moreover, accurate modeling of IBRs is a hard task, requiring robust approaches to be developed. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel hierarchical <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$L_{1}$</tex> performance controller to shape a dynamic virtual power plant (DVPP). The proposed approach uses a two-layer control design. The first layer involves a global controller that uses the adaptive divide-and-conquer approach to design desired models for the IBRs. The second layer comprises local controllers that enable the DVPP to control the IBRs. The local controller uses the desired model to compute the operating point for the IBR and a robust state-feedback law to stabilize the tracking error dynamics of IBRs. Since the IIBR models are uncertain, the computed operating point is not accurate and introduces a persistent bounded disturbance in the tracking error dynamics. A robust <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$L_{1}$</tex> controller design is proposed to deal with the system uncertainties and minimize the effect of the persistent bounded disturbance on the IBR power. The controller gains are derived by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Unlike many existing methods, the proposed framework avoids directly coupling the dynamic reference and source models, thereby reducing design complexity and enhancing the scalability of the DVPP. Furthermore, this work explicitly incorporates parameter uncertainties in IBR models, which is not the case in state-of-the-art methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulations, highlighting its capability to maintain reliable power generation in the presence of faults."

The model may concentrate more on subtle visual features because the Inception-ResNet architecture is used as the feature extraction network; Following the approach of the Dual-Stream Network, the input is processed using both image flow and optical flow streams. Spatio-temporal attention mechanisms are incorporated into each stream to enhance the network’s focus on spatial and temporal information. Comparative experiments are conducted on both the public dataset UCF-101 and the self-built dataset UH-Face, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the network’s extraction of spatial and temporal information.

The labeled datasets created using software defined radio (SDR) for a typical indoor scenario. Leveraging the knowledge of polar feature extraction from the RF samples not only reduces the computational training overhead and the effects of multipath but also ensures more reliable for low-latency resource-limited applications. In this paper, we propose a convolutional RF classifier for classifying the modulation classes BPSK, 8-PSK and variants of QAM.

This study focused on the development of an integrated green infrastructure evaluation system utilizing digital twin technology to enable realtime monitoring and 3D visualization of environmental parameters within a unified platform. A preliminary deployment was conducted at two sites: the Electrical and Electronics Engineering Institute (EEEI) building, representing a non-GI baseline, and the National Engineering Center (NEC) building, which incorporates key green infrastructure features. The system combined wireless sensor nodes with digital twin visualization through Autodesk Revit and Tandem, enabling real-time data collection and spatial analysis. To reduce system power consumption, Thread mesh networking and battery-operated nodes were used. A Node-RED web application was also developed to interpret raw sensor data in relation to occupant comfort obtained through a survey interface. This approach facilitated a comprehensive analysis of the correlations and interactions among various GI parameters, allowing a comparative evaluation between the NEC and EEEI rooms. Results showed that the NEC building maintained better indoor air quality, more consistent environmental comfort, and lower pollutant accumulation compared to the EEEI, highlighting the environmental benefits of GI features."

    "abstract": "In this era of 5G and beyond, Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) plays a pivotal role in providing ubiquitous connectivity. Hence, it is essential to maintain connectivity with NTN, although a device is already connected to a Terrestrial Network (TN). The ideal approach would be to handle this at transport protocol layer as independent networks are involved. Establishing Multiple-Paths (MPs) between NTN and TN by means of MPTCP is a promising approach to realise this. Both the networks have different data rate and the available capacity, which varies over time based on the traffic demand. In this work, we start by presenting a solution to predict the traffic demand on NTN link based on federated Kolmogorov Arnold networks (fed-KANs). This predicted traffic demand is then used as an input to the MP scheduler to efficiently utilize the bandwidth available on both the NTN and TN. The goal is to minimize the data file transfer time and increase throughput. The proposed scheduling mechanism reduces the file transfer time compared to benchmark MP schedulers and achieves higher aggregated throughput. This shows that a scheduling mechanism with the knowledge of expected traffic demand performs better than classical schedulers which do take this into consideration."

    "abstract": "A Reliability Block Diagram (RBD) is a graphical tool to evaluate a system’s availability, depending on its components and their interconnections. In communication networks or electric power grids, maintaining high availability between a source and destination is crucial. However, in today’s large-scale networks with several nodes and edges, the network’s availability evaluation using RBDs is computationally intensive. Hence, we introduce (i) our novel Minimal Path Sets (MPSs)-based RBD evaluation technique, and (ii) PyRBD3, our open-source implementation of our novel method to evaluate availability using RBDs. Additionally, we compare PyRBD3’s performance on different topologies against the state-of-the-art solutions."

    "abstract": "In recent years, prostheses have become a means for amputees to return to their everyday activities, particularly transhumeral prostheses designed to restore arm mobility. However, the widespread adoption of prostheses is hindered by challenges related to restricted movement, a lack of tailored design, and high cost. One approach to tackling these obstacles is the integration of compliant mechanisms into the design of prostheses. Absence of maintenance and wear, fewer parts, higher precision, and ease of manufacture are some of the advantages of compliant mechanisms. This review summarizes recent developments in transhumeral prostheses as well as the integration of compliant mechanisms in the design of prostheses. Design guidelines encompassing material selection and topologies for compliant mechanisms are also addressed, as well as the challenges that prevent the widespread adoption of compliant mechanisms. It is anticipated that this review will serve as a starting point for researchers interested in compliant mechanisms and prosthetic design."

This paper presents a multi-layer device-level electro-thermal RTS methodology that simultaneously addresses electrical-thermal coupling effects and semiconductor switching characteristics while maintaining computational efficiency. A novel multi-purpose hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing framework is subsequently developed by systematically integrating the proposed electro-thermal RTS, enhancing both functional verification capabilities and testing efficiency. Experimental validation is conducted through an FPGA-based implementation for an interleaved bidirectional DC-DC converter. The real-time simulation results demonstrate high consistency compared to offline LTspice simulations. Successful integration with the HIL testing confirms the methodology's effectiveness in enabling concurrent electro-thermal analysis and control strategy verification, significantly advancing the development of reliable PECs for electrified transportation."

    "abstract": "Neural architecture search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful paradigm that enables researchers to automatically explore vast search spaces and discover efficient neural networks. However, NAS suffers from a critical bottleneck, i.e., the evaluation of numerous architectures during the search process demands substantial computing resources and time. In order to improve the efficiency of NAS, a series of methods have been proposed to reduce the evaluation time of neural architectures. However, they are not efficient enough and still only focus on the accuracy of architectures. Beyond classification accuracy, real-world applications increasingly demand more efficient and compact network architectures that balance multiple performance criteria. To address these challenges, we propose the SMEMNAS, a pairwise comparison relation-assisted multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (EA) based on a multipopulation (MP) mechanism. In the SMEMNAS, a surrogate model is constructed based on pairwise comparison relations to predict the accuracy ranking of architectures, rather than the absolute accuracy. Moreover, two populations cooperate with each other in the search process, i.e., a main population that guides the evolutionary process and a vice population that enhances search diversity. Our method aims to discover high-performance models that simultaneously optimize multiple objectives. We conduct comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets to validate the effectiveness of our approach. With only a single GPU searching for 0.17 days, competitive architectures can be found by SMEMNAS, which achieves 78.91% accuracy with the MAdds of 570 M on the ImageNet. This work makes a significant advancement in the field of NAS."

    "abstract": "Satellite-based retrievals of Arctic sea ice thickness and its thermodynamic modeling typically assume a constant sea ice bulk density (IBD), disregarding its intricate seasonal variations influenced by factors such as ice age, temperature, brine content, and air intrusion. This study investigates the seasonal variability of IBD during the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition, spanning from late October 2019 to April 2020. To achieve this, we integrated sea ice thickness and snow depth observations from 15 ice mass balance buoys, snow bulk density measurements from snow pits, along with high-resolution total freeboard data from airborne laser scanning (ALS) and the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) within the MOSAiC Distributed Network (DN; 50 km radius). Assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, the regionally integrated IBD was calculated for the buoy-deployed level ice floes, covering 11 sites on second-year ice (SYI) and 4 sites on first-year ice (FYI). These buoy-based IBD estimates were then compared with direct measurements obtained at the MOSAiC Main Coring Sites (MCS). Our findings provide preliminary evidence of IBD seasonality during the Arctic freezing season: (1) From late October to early December 2019 (transition phase), the IBDs derived from both MCS-FYI and regional integration increased from ~880 to 910 kg m<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−3</sub>, possibly due to a reduced air volume fraction in the ice; (2) From late December 2019 to late April 2020 (quasi-stable phase), all IBDs largely persisted within 900−920 kg m<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−3</sub>, with modal values near 910 kg m<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−3</sub>, consistent with historical observations for the same period. However, the IBD at MCS-SYI remained relatively stable throughout the study period due to the low porosity of the sampled SYI cores. For cross-validation, the regional-scale IBD retrievals were further upscaled to characterize mean level ice conditions across the MOSAiC DN, yielding IBD seasonal patterns consistent with those observed at the buoy and coring sites. To better represent IBD in the contemporary Arctic Ocean, we propose a time-varying proxy model and explore multiple parameterizations based on the MOSAiC synergistic observations. Furthermore, the uncertainties associated with IBD retrievals and developed parameterization schemes are also assessed."

    "abstract": "This work proposes a dynamic scheduling problem of a single-armed cluster tool (SACT) by considering the wafer lots simultaneously stored in a stocker to be processed at it. In other words, the investigated system integrates a stocker and an SACT, which is named as an S-SACT system. Multiple wafer types (more than two) may be processed simultaneously by different processing chambers (PCs) in the SACT. Thus, PC cleaning is necessary when switching between wafer types. Stochastic lot arrivals necessitate dynamic decisions on lot sequencing in the stocker and their PC assignments, generating a partially-determined schedule that is updated when a new lot arrives. Then, an activity-driven simulation is used to obtain the final schedule. Generating high-quality partially-determined schedules is challenging. To address this, we propose a two-stage learning-assisted evolutionary framework combining Multi-tree Genetic Programming (MTGP) and Deep Contextual Bandit (DCB). In stage one, MTGP automatically generates scheduling rules that produce high-quality partially-determined schedules in dynamic environments offline, forming the action set for stage two. In stage two, DCB is pre-trained to select the most effective action with over 90% probability, then deployed to choose actions in real time while continuously updating its rule-selection agent. Computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing approaches across all tested cases."

    "abstract": "Cooperative positioning enhances localization accuracy in intelligent artifact swarms through shared measurements, especially in environments such as urban canyons or disaster zones. Dynamic topologies, heterogeneous measurements, and scalability demands create complex challenges for state estimation. This paper introduces MRCA, the first comprehensive framework unifying heterogeneous measurements, reasoning processes, environment cognition, and scenario-based applications for cooperative positioning. The four-layer architecture comprises: i) the Measurement block converts signals into measurement parameters in a standard format independent of sensor types and measurement methods; ii) the Reasoning block uncovers the underlying principles of state transition using a four reasoning elements; iii) the Cognition block underscores the importance of node-environment interactions by identifying new valid radiation sources and verifying the ongoing validity of existing ones; iv) the Application block offers users task-driven cooperative positioning services, like execute potential navigation actions. Our proposed framework demonstrates performance improvements in various key metrics compared to legacy swarm positioning algorithms. Focusing on the framework itself, we employ the most basic algorithms within each block, and the experimental results are as follows: In scenarios featuring static unknown anchors, sparse perception, and collision interference, MRCA reduces cumulative positioning error by over 51% for dead-reckoning and 39% for traditional distributed cooperative positioning, while reducing average orientation error by over 31% and 27%, respectively.

This study presents a systematic literature review of peer-reviewed works published between 2018 and 2025 in IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and the ACM Digital Library. The review was conducted following a protocol for evidence-based software engineering. A total of 71 primary studies were included after deduplication and screening. A phase-based taxonomy of MLOps tools was synthesized and an SDLC-MLOps compatibility framework was derived to classify alignment levels as high, medium, or low across development phases. Inter-rater agreement, measured using Cohen's Kappa, yielded a value of 0.91, while the average study quality score was 0.73. The results show convergence around pipelines, model registries, and containerized deployment, alongside persistent fragmentation in process models and organizational practices. The findings provide implications for practice, including maturity-based adoption strategies, role definition, governance mechanisms, and continuous monitoring. Additionally, opportunities for future research are identified in the areas of ML-specific testing and harmonized metrics across software engineering and data science disciplines."

However, research on the impact of coding schemes, classifier choice, and separability metrics applied to LSM remains insufficient. In this work, six coding schemes, six classifiers, and three separability metrics across two synthetic benchmark tasks (Frequency and Pattern Recognition) are systematically evaluated. This allows us to contrast readout strategies and assess how well separability metrics align with classification accuracy. Our results showed that rate-based coders combined with linear classifiers yield the most accurate performance. Among separability metrics, K-Nearest Neighbor Overlap Score (KNN-OS) provides the most consistent correlation with accuracy, while Silhouette Score (SS) and Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI) display important limitations. These findings contribute to a clearer understanding of readout design in LSMs and provide practical guidance for selecting coding strategies, classifiers, and evaluating metrics in future applications."

Next-generation wireless technology testbeds are crucial for testing and validating emerging technologies in research institutions and industries. The feasibility of studying real-time next-generation wireless systems is significantly constrained by licensing restrictions from network operators and vendors. Therefore, to bridge the gap, an open source 5G network testbed is developed using open source software such as Open5GS, srsRAN, and programmable Software Defined Radio (SDR). The proposed 5G testbed focused on a typical 5G cellular system consisting of User Equipment (UE), gNodeB (gNB), and Core Network (CN). In addition, various elements of latency were analyzed using the proposed testbed to investigate and minimize latency in 5G networks. The results show that the developed 5G testbed experiences a general UE registration latency of 414 ms and a PDU session establishment latency of 15 ms. The results show that 57.2% of the registration delay is caused by Access and Mobility (AM) policy association, in the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF), while 38.5% of the session establishment delay occurs during the policy rules checking in the Policy and Control Function (PCF)."

In this approach, compute-intensive perception tasks, such as object detection, are instantiated as services on nearby edge nodes, with resources being allocated adaptively based on the locations and trajectories of the vehicles. The system was designed to support user mobility through service replication and seamless handovers between perception service instances in different edge nodes as vehicles move across coverage areas, ensuring continuous service delivery and Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. We evaluate the proposed architecture in a real-world 5G edge-enabled testbed using an autonomous vehicle running an object detection service. The results demonstrate that offloading perception via 5G and MEC yields substantially lower processing latency, and that smart orchestration mechanisms are able to react to user mobility and platform stress situations, avoiding service degradation, thus validating the approach for Cooperative, Connected, and Automated Mobility (CCAM) use cases."

Results highlight significant differences in segmentation capabilities, emphasizing the impact of hyperparameter selection on model effectiveness. The contribution of this work is the development of a novel dual-model approach. The first model, trained with Dice Loss, is dedicated to segmenting the liver, while the second model, using Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy, focuses exclusively on tumor detection within the previously segmented liver region. This division of tasks enhances both accuracy and specificity in tumor delineation.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a hardware-efficient implementation of a CRC computation algorithm compliant with 3GPP fifth generation (5G) new radio (NR) specifications. The proposed design utilizes parallel processing and precomputed CRC values stored in lookup tables to enable low-latency and high-throughput operation. Implemented on an Xilinx RFSoC platform, the architecture ensures that CRC computation completes well within the duration of a 5G-NR slot, across all numerologies. The design supports dynamic configuration for different CRC polynomials and payload lengths, enabling seamless adaptation across different physical layer channels. Compared to traditional bit-serial implementations, the proposed approach offers substantial improvements in latency and power efficiency while maintaining low hardware resource usage. These results demonstrate the suitability of the design for real-time 5G-NR physical layer processing. Its scalability and low-complexity architecture make it well-suited for integration into high-throughput baseband processing in 5G-NR systems."

Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment, approximately 30 % of patients experience recurrence after initial therapy. To address this challenge, we developed an integrated framework for recurrence prediction that combines classification, survival, and explainability models, using the Combined MSK Breast Cancer Cohort, derived from three public studies of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The dataset included clinical and molecular variables preprocessed through KNN imputation, standardization, class balancing with SMOTE, and strict data leakage control. Six classifiers (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, Gradient Boosting, SVM, and Logistic Regression) and two survival models (CoxPH and Random Survival Forest) were trained using stratified 5-fold cross-validation. Gradient Boosting achieved the best performance (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{AUC}=0.977; \\mathrm{F} 1=0.96$</tex>), while Random Survival Forest obtained the highest concordance index (C -index <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$=0.835$</tex>), outperforming the Cox model. SHAP and LIME values identified endocrine therapy, prior recurrence, and tumor laterality as key predictors, reflecting strong clinical consistency. The proposed approach demonstrated high accuracy, transparency, and reproducibility, establishing itself as a potential tool for risk stratification and therapeutic decision support in breast cancer patients."

    "abstract": "Overfitting is a persistent problem in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that limits the model's generalization capabilities. To counteract overfitting, network regularizers are incorporated into the training process. In this work, the impact of applying different regularization strategies to CNN architectures evolved with the Deep Genetic Algorithm (DeepGA) is studied. DeepGA follows an Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search (ENAS) process that considers both network performance and complexity. Experiments were conducted on the CIFAR-100 and CIFAR-10 datasets using the same set of evolved architectures, allowing a controlled comparison of performance and training cost. Random Erasing (RE), Dropout (DO), and Label Smoothing (LS) are the selected regularizers, which involve input, internal, and label regularization, respectively, and are applied individually and in combination. Results show that the combined configurations, especially <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{R E}+\\mathbf{D O}$</tex> and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{R E}+\\mathbf{D O}+\\mathbf{L S}$</tex>, resulted in the most significant improvement in test accuracy, significantly outperforming the non-regularized baseline. Nonetheless, the use of regularizers expanded the computational cost due to an increase in the training time. The findings provide insights into the role and interaction of regularizers in evolved CNN architectures, highlighting their benefits in boosting the model's performance."

    "abstract": "The state of charge (SOC) is a critical parameter for the battery management system in lithium-ion batteries to ensure safe and efficient operation. Many data-driven approaches for SOC estimation have gained attention in recent years. However, these models often lack generalizability across different charge and discharge cycles, even for lithium-ion batteries of the same chemistry and manufacturer. This study aims to improve the generalizability of SOC estimation of lithium-ion batteries using neural network-based models. Three neural network-based models are implemented and evaluated using standard electric vehicle (EV) discharge profiles, including UDDS, US06, HWFET, and WLTP Class 3 and two synthetic profiles generated through the combination of the aforementioned standard EV discharge profiles. The first model uses only voltage as input, resulting in a root mean square error (RMSE) between 4% and 5%. The second model adds current as an input feature, reducing RMSE to approximately 2%. In the third model, SOC from the previous time step is also included with voltage and current and achieves an RMSE of less than 1% across all tested profiles. The results demonstrate that the proposed third neural network-based model significantly improves the accuracy and generalizability of SOC estimation under real-world EV driving conditions."

    "abstract": "The demographic transition toward an aging society has introduced diverse challenges linked to anthropometric characteristics, lifestyle behaviors, and health-related attitudes. An in-depth understanding of health determinants is crucial for clarifying how variations in elderly health and their underlying factors interact, thereby enabling the development of effective and tailored interventions. This paper presents a multi-domain clustering framework that integrates physical (body measurements and composition), behavioral (dietary and sedentary patterns), and perceptual (self-perceived weight and weight control intentions) domains. Beyond data expansion, the framework addresses a fundamental limitation in prior health modeling—the omission of self-perception as a mediating determinant linking physical conditions and behavioral responses. Using data from 400 Thai older adults, the study evaluates multiple clustering methods and examines perception-action links across clusters. The analysis shows that k-means clustering provides the most robust structure, identifying three distinct health profiles. The first group, with balanced gender representation, exhibits the largest body sizes and strong weight-loss intentions. The second, predominantly male, underestimates weight status and shows low motivation to change. The third, mainly low-income females, presents smaller body frames but relatively high fat percentages and frequent misperceptions, reflecting both perceptual and socioeconomic challenges. These findings highlight the interplay among gender, socioeconomic status, body composition, and perception in shaping elderly health and provide a foundation for more targeted strategies to support healthy aging."

    "abstract": "Virtualized Radio Access Networks (vRAN) enable flexible and scalable network architectures by decoupling RAN functions from proprietary hardware and deploying them as software components on general-purpose platforms. This allows for dynamic scaling of resources — such as allocating additional resources during peak hours to meet traffic demands and reducing resources when activity is low, thereby optimizing resource utilization and reducing operational costs. The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) introduces openness and intelligence into traditionally closed and hardware-driven RAN. In 3GPP TS 28.552, highlights the importance of 5G network performance measurements and management metrics essential for intelligent orchestration and optimization in vRAN environments. This study proposes a lightweight µApp to monitor infrastructure-level parameters — CPU usage, memory consumption, and disk I/O — at both the Centralized Unit (CU) and Distributed Unit (DU). By leveraging O-RAN interfaces and modular design, the proposed system improves real-time visibility into vRAN environments and supports intelligent orchestration through fine-grained system-level telemetry. In addition, the proposed framework can be used to change the metrics real-time with the help of the considered µApp. This allows dynamic scale-in/scale-out of computing resources depending on traffic loads, which allows reduction in Operating Expense (OpEx)."

    "abstract": "The performance of the hemispherical resonator gyroscope (HRG) in whole-angle (WA) mode is affected by the angle-dependent harmonic drift. Suppressing this drift is essential to improve its temperature stability and operational range. In this article, a novel real-time method for eliminating harmonic drift based on a forward and reverse precession (FRP) control scheme is proposed. First, the sources of harmonic drift in HRG are analyzed. The HRG dynamical equations incorporating multiple error sources are derived and analyzed through numerical simulation. Subsequently, a real-time error identification algorithm is developed and validated through simulation. Finally, a temperature experiment is conducted to validate the method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately identify and compensate for errors at different temperatures, effectively suppressing the harmonic components in angular velocity by more than 97%. The bias instability (BI) of the HRG remains consistently around 0.024°/h across various temperatures, indicating strong temperature stability. Additionally, the scale factor nonlinearity (SFN) is reduced five-fold to 0.84 ppm. Most importantly, this method can be applied to all Coriolis vibratory gyroscopes to effectively eliminate their common angle-dependent harmonic drift."

    "abstract": "Cooperative positioning enhances localization accuracy in intelligent artifact swarms through shared measurements, especially in environments such as urban canyons or disaster zones. Dynamic topologies, heterogeneous measurements, and scalability demands create complex challenges for state estimation. This paper introduces MRCA, the first comprehensive framework unifying heterogeneous measurements, reasoning processes, environment cognition, and scenario-based applications for cooperative positioning. The four-layer architecture comprises: i) the Measurement block converts signals into measurement parameters in a standard format independent of sensor types and measurement methods; ii) the Reasoning block uncovers the underlying principles of state transition using a four reasoning elements; iii) the Cognition block underscores the importance of node-environment interactions by identifying new valid radiation sources and verifying the ongoing validity of existing ones; iv) the Application block offers users task-driven cooperative positioning services, like execute potential navigation actions. Our proposed framework demonstrates performance improvements in various key metrics compared to legacy swarm positioning algorithms. Focusing on the framework itself, we employ the most basic algorithms within each block, and the experimental results are as follows: In scenarios featuring static unknown anchors, sparse perception, and collision interference, MRCA reduces cumulative positioning error by over 51% for dead-reckoning and 39% for traditional distributed cooperative positioning, while reducing average orientation error by over 31% and 27%, respectively.

This study compares ACcoupled and DC-coupled solar PV systems with BESS as energy hubs for powering data centers. The analysis is conducted from the perspective of the energy hub developer, focusing on the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) prices offered to data center operators. The DC-coupled configuration offers advantages by reducing transformer CAPEX due to smaller size requirements, higher efficiency, and enhancing economic feasibility. The findings evaluate the impact of solar PV investment, BESS investment, and internal rate of return management to offer competitive PPA prices, ensuring the economic viability of renewable energy solutions for data centers."

This causes a substantial increase in the aerodynamic drag of vessels and high maintenance costs. Therefore, we present an aeration-based method to reduce microbial fouling without chemical treatments. We evaluated its efficiency using a test structure (120 cm wide by 90 cm high) and experimental panels measuring 15× 20 cm. These were placed in underwater systems behind the panels, which injected air bubbles into the base of the structure to inhibit the formation of biofilms by microorganisms. These field trials were conducted at the Aeronautics Port in São José da Barra, Rio de Janeiro. This makes it an attractive, non-invasive, and sustainable system for treating these types of structures."

Unlike conventional SAR platforms that utilize motorized translation stages or Global Positioning System (GPS)-based positioning, the proposed approach enables manual operation of the radar sensor along a quasi-linear trajectory. The sensor is continually detected using a deep learning approach and it's spatial position estimated using a stereo vision system comprising at least two synchronized video cameras. Through controlled experiments and SAR image simulations, we evaluate the performance of the tracking system and its suitability for coherent SAR image reconstruction. The results indicate that the achieved localization accuracy is sufficient to enable the application of robust autofocus algorithms, thereby supporting the feasibility of manually operated SAR imaging using vision-based position tracking."

In this study, smart EV charging optimization is combined with short-term load forecasting to address this concern in the Higher Colleges of Technology campus in Dubai. A 24-hour baseline demand was forecast by using an artificial neural network (ANN) model. A 50-EV simulated fleet was scheduled using four metaheuristic algorithms: Differential Evolution Particle Swarm Optimization (DEPSO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a GA-PSO hybrid, and Genetic Algorithm (GA) for peak demand reduction. Peak loads from peak of almost 680 kWh were successfully cut by the algorithms. Though DEPSO proved to be the most computationally efficient, the hybrid GA-PSO achieved the largest reduction, bringing the peak down by 27.4 %. In this study, it has been shown that, at the level of a campus, grid reliability can be enhanced using a simpler charging coordination system."

    "abstract": "Conventional heart-rate monitoring typically relies on adhesive Electrocardiography (ECG) electrodes or wrist-worn Photoplethysmography (PPG). These methods are effective but can compromise comfort during prolonged wear. They are also vulnerable to sweat, skin tone variation, and electrode loosening, which can degrade accuracy. In long-term clinical care or multiuser scenarios, frequent sensor replacement and disinfection are necessary, which increases the risk of cross-infection. We propose a non-contact heart-rate monitoring system based on the TI IWR6843AOPEVM 60-GHz Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (FMCW-MIMO) radar to address these limitations. The system first applies the Range-Angle Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to localise reflections from the thoracic region. Cardiac-related echoes are then selected for subsequent analysis. In the signal-processing stage, we employ a Wavelet DenoisingAdaptive Moving-Average Amplitude Processing (WaveletAMP) pipeline. Wavelet denoising is used to suppress noise, followed by adaptive moving-average amplitude amplification to enhance subtle cardiac micro-displacements. Short-time spectral analysis is performed in the $0.8-2 \\mathrm{~Hz}$ band, with additional strategies to reduce respiratory interference. Within each observation window, the median of per-packet estimates is reported. This approach minimizes the impact of outliers and transient noise. Experimental validation demonstrates that the proposed method yields a mean difference of approximately 1.3 beats per minute (bpm) compared to the electrocardiography (ECG) reference. The waveform trends also match closely. Overall, the technique avoids deep learning or computationally intensive spectrogram processing. It maintains a relatively low computational burden and can offer potential value for bedside monitoring and extended clinical care."

    "abstract": "With the improvement of information security and public health awareness, contactless biometric technology is gaining increasing attention. Palm prints and palm veins are heterogeneous and complementary, and are often used for identity verification, but a single feature is easy to imitate and offers limited protection. Although dual-feature fusion can enhance recognition accuracy, it remains susceptible to interference and alignment errors. As the sensing base expands, the centralized architecture faces challenges such as data integration and model synchronization delays, affecting overall performance. Thus, this study proposes a cloud recognition system combining palm print and vein. The system uses RGB and NIR dual camera modules to capture images synchronously. It improves fusion quality through adaptive grayscale conversion and weighted color channel overlay, while introducing a data-enhanced attention mechanism to focus on identifying areas. The images are stored in AWS S3, and Lambda triggers EC2 to perform YOLO v13 model recognition, with results written to DynamoDB for multi-point synchronization and centralized management. Experimental results show that fusion recognition accuracy reaches $\\mathbf{9 9. 5 0 \\%}$ (mAP@50), surpassing single-feature performance. Under the AIoT architecture, cloud inference only accounts for about one-fifth of local CPU usage, effectively reducing device load. Overall, this study optimizes non-contact image quality, verifies the feasibility of cloud integration, and compares recognition performance differences between devices and on-premises/cloud architectures."

We measured key performance indicatorss (KPIs) such as latency, jitter, throughput, reference signal received power (RSRP), Signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio ratio (SINR), and energy consumption using a robot-mounted user equipment (UE) at 31 locations. The results reveal significant differences in KPIs between the two systems, despite nearly identical measurement conditions, which raises important questions about their suitability for industrial environments. By providing the comparative analysis of open-source and commercial gNB implementations in a real-world deployment, this paper offers valuable insights to guide the selection of reliable solutions for critical industry applications."

    "abstract": "The deployment of 5G millimeter-wave (mmWave) technology has revolutionized wireless communication by providing high data rates and low latency. However, both short-term changes (such as moving pets or human hands) and long-term changes (such as human blockages) can severely impact the performance of beam tracking algorithms, which are essential for maintaining stable communication links in mmWave networks. This paper addresses the challenge of short-term changes in the environment resulting in sudden signal variations in 5G mmWave systems by proposing a novel anomaly detection setup.The proposed anomaly detection setup leverages machine learning-based techniques, specifically One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM), Random Forest and XGBoost to effectively identify and mitigate anomalies over a few tens of milliseconds, improving the beam tracking operation. By detecting and handling such anomalies, the proposed anomaly detection setup enables beam tracking algorithms to maintain accurate and consistent communication links even in the presence of changing environments.To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a comprehensive analysis is conducted using conventional beam tracking algorithm i.e. Round Robin (RR). The results show that the proposed anomaly detection setup significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of beam tracking by effectively mitigating the impact of short-term large signal variations, highlighting its utility even with conventional beam tracking algorithm."

    "abstract": "A major driver of connected and automated driving is cooperative active safety. The effectiveness of cooperative safety applications depends on the ability of vehicles to detect traffic safety risks in advance. Such risks can be identified either through ADAS (Advanced Driving Assistance Systems) or via V2X (Vehicle to Everything) communications. More vehicles are gradually being deployed with ADAS, but ADAS sensors can be limited by their sensing range and field of view. On the other hand, V2X can experience communication ranges beyond the ADAS sensing range, but its impact is highly dependent on the V2X penetration rate. This paper analyzes the impact of ADAS and V2X penetration rates on the effectiveness of cooperative active safety applications considering an emergency braking maneuver use case in a highway scenario. Results show that while ADAS and V2X each enhance traffic safety, their combined deployment further amplifies these gains, with the effect becoming more pronounced as V2X is deployed more rapidly."

These biological mechanisms have been applied to the design of various algorithms and optimization techniques. In network optimization, merging and integrating multiple networks requires careful selection of edges to ensure overall network stability and efficiency. In this study, we focus on the network formation behavior of the unicellular organism Physarum polycephalum, and propose a heuristic method for selecting fusion edges. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method enables the selection of candidate fusion edges and the formation of fusion paths. Furthermore, the distribution of flow along the fusion paths formed by the proposed method was found to be rapid. However, the shortest path property of the fusion routes is not guaranteed, and parameter tuning is required depending on the network size and the number of nodes and edges. In future work, we aim to incorporate automatic parameter adjustment mechanisms and dynamic extraction of path candidates, which may enable gradual and adaptive network integration."

To tackle this issue, we propose a parameter-free dual-granularity weighted multi-view fuzzy <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$c$</tex-math></inline-formula>-means clustering framework. The basic idea is to introduce a product-to-one constraint at both the view and attribute levels, enabling adaptive and balanced weight assignment without introducing extra parameters. Two weighting strategies are developed: (i) vector-form weighting, which assigns global importance to views and attributes, and (ii) matrix-form weighting, which further captures cluster-specific relevance. Moreover, both Euclidean and non-Euclidean (exponential transformation) distance measures are incorporated, yielding four algorithmic variants: PDW-MFC-V, PDW-MFC-M, PDW-MAFC-V, and PDW-MAFC-M. Extensive experiments on nine real-world datasets show that our algorithms outperform thirteen related algorithms across multiple metrics. These results confirm that dual-granularity weighting effectively models the relative importance of views and attributes, while the non-Euclidean distance improves robustness to noise. Overall, the proposed framework offers a flexible, parameter-free, and robust solution for multi-view clustering, providing fine-grained interpretability and stable performance across diverse datasets."

    "abstract": "Cooperative positioning enhances localization accuracy in intelligent artifact swarms through shared measurements, especially in environments such as urban canyons or disaster zones. Dynamic topologies, heterogeneous measurements, and scalability demands create complex challenges for state estimation. This paper introduces MRCA, the first comprehensive framework unifying heterogeneous measurements, reasoning processes, environment cognition, and scenario-based applications for cooperative positioning. The four-layer architecture comprises: i) the Measurement block converts signals into measurement parameters in a standard format independent of sensor types and measurement methods; ii) the Reasoning block uncovers the underlying principles of state transition using a four reasoning elements; iii) the Cognition block underscores the importance of node-environment interactions by identifying new valid radiation sources and verifying the ongoing validity of existing ones; iv) the Application block offers users task-driven cooperative positioning services, like execute potential navigation actions. Our proposed framework demonstrates performance improvements in various key metrics compared to legacy swarm positioning algorithms. Focusing on the framework itself, we employ the most basic algorithms within each block, and the experimental results are as follows: In scenarios featuring static unknown anchors, sparse perception, and collision interference, MRCA reduces cumulative positioning error by over 51% for dead-reckoning and 39% for traditional distributed cooperative positioning, while reducing average orientation error by over 31% and 27%, respectively. Running on <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${\\$}5$</tex-math> </inline-formula> consumer-grade IMUs, MRCA achieves a final RMSE of 10.27 m, outperforming even a <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${\\$}1~500$</tex-math> </inline-formula> industrial-grade IMU in dead-reckoning mode (11.99 m). Through the validation of real - scene datasets, the paper illustrates how this framework integrates into system-level solutions for real-world implementation, further advancing the theoretical understanding of state estimation in cooperative positioning systems."

By splitting each file into <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">F</i> equal packets (i.e., the subpacketization level <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">F</i>) and letting each user cache a set of packets, the transmission load can be significantly reduced via coded multicasting. It has been shown that a higher subpacketization level could potentially lead to a lower transmission load, as more packets can be combined for efficient transmission. On the other hand, a larger <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">F</i> indicates a higher coding complexity and is problematic from a practical perspective when <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">F</i> is extremely large. Despite many works attempting to design coded caching schemes with low subpacketization levels, a fundamental problem remains open: What is the minimum transmission load given any fixed subpacketization level? In this paper, we consider the classical cache-aided networks with identically uncoded placement and one-shot delivery strategy, and investigate the fundamental trade-off between the transmission load and the subpacketization level. We propose a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">general</i> lower bound on the transmission load for any fixed subpacketization by reformulating the centralized coded caching schemes via the combinatorial structure of the corresponding placement delivery array. The lower bound also recovers existing optimality results for the bipartite graph scheme (including the well-known Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MN) scheme and the conjugate MN scheme) as well as the grouping bipartite graph scheme. Furthermore, by carefully exploiting the combinatorial structure and computing the union size of sorted sets, we establish a new optimality result, i.e., the partition scheme can achieve the optimal rate-subpacketization trade-off."

This work presents the development of an EEPROM model designed in VHDL and simulated on the Xilinx ISE platform. The architecture is tailored to handle PPG signals, widely used in clinical and research environments to analyze cardiovascular conditions. Control signals such as clock (CLK), reset (RST), chip enable (CE), write enable (WE), and output enable (OE) were implemented, enabling complete control of read, write, and erase operations. A testbench validated memory performance under various scenarios, measuring capacity, speed, latency, and signal integrity.

    "abstract": "The use of Earth-Air-Water Heat Exchangers (EAWHE) for sustainable air conditioning has not been widely studied. Due to their experimental nature, methods of characterizing internal thermal air distribution impose high dependence on instrumentation by sensors and entail data acquisition and computational costs. This document presents an alternative method that estimates air temperature distribution while minimizing the need for a dense network of sensors in the experimental system. The proposed model, DARL (Data of Air and Random Length), can predict the temperature of air circulating inside EAWHEs. DARL is a significant methodological advance that integrates experimental data from boundary conditions with simulations based on pseudo-random numbers (PRNs). These PRNs are generated using Fermat's prime numbers as seeds to initialize the generator. Ordinary linear regressions and robust statistical validations, including the Shapiro-Wilk test and root mean square error, have demonstrated that the model can estimate the thermal distribution of air at different lengths with a relative error of less than 6.2 %. These results demonstrate the model's efficiency, predictive capacity, and potential to reduce dependence on sensors. The model is thus established as a viable alternative for designing, evaluating, and optimizing geothermal systems under real operating conditions."

These microgrids, often powered by distributed energy resources (DERs) such as solar PV and battery storage, introduce unique challenges due to limited fault currents, bidirectional power flows, and frequent transitions between grid-connected and islanded modes. In grid-connected mode, conventional protection may suffice, but in islanded operation, adaptive protection schemes are necessary—particularly to address low fault current scenarios. The paper explores solutions across various microgrid sizes, from LV networks below 200 kVA, where sensitive earth fault detection remains viable, to MV/LV networks where directional impedance and differential protection are recommended. Communication-assisted schemes and star topologies are also discussed for improved selectivity and coordination. Overall, the paper emphasizes the need for flexible, adaptive protection frameworks that accommodate the dynamic behavior of microgrids while ensuring safety and reliability."

Such phenomena are exerting pressures on the power grids that have never been experienced before, resulting in blackouts and the subsequent disruptions of societies. This paper proposes a Preventive Resilience Optimization Framework (PROF) to build a more resilient power system by integrating hydrogen (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{H}_{2}$</tex>) energy and controllable distributed generators (CDGs) into networked microgrids (NMGs). Instead of just focusing on how to recover after a disaster and ensure that power systems remain stable and reliable even in the face of increasingly frequent and severe natural disasters. The framework is developed using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) to minimize operational costs and maximize resilience by reducing dependence on the main utility grid. By incorporating large-scale and long-duration <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{H}_{2}$</tex> energy storage solutions the framework aims to provide a reliable and sustainable energy supply during and after extreme events.

In this study, the focus was on examining the complex relationship between covert (implicit, hidden) and overt (explicit, observable) attention and human memory through a memorability experiment on static images. Thirty images for the experiment were selected from the FIGRIM [1] dataset. The collected eye-tracking data were first used to compute fixation maps and visual saliency maps, and then the IOVC (Inter-Observer Visual Congruency) metric; together with the percentage of successful image memorization (the memorability score), these served as the key parameters of the study. A significant correlation between the IOVC score and the memorability score indicated the possibility of automating the prediction of whether viewing an image would lead to successful memorization based solely on its fixation map. Inspired by this insight, we first trained a machine learning model on the collected viewing data to infer, from a fixation map, which of the 30 images had been viewed. The goal was to train a classifier capable of distinguishing images using only their viewing (eye-tracking) data. The trained model achieved close to 90% accuracy in determining whether an arbitrary fixation map would lead to successful memorization of the given image. A web application that could be used for commercial use for memorability prediction was developed."

In Belgium, solar and wind energy capacity rose from under 5 GW in 2016 to about 15 GW by 2024, with considerable further expansion foreseen in the coming years. Transmission system operators (TSOs) must manage generation data from renewable sources and provide accurate forecasts to balance electricity supply with demand. Poor data quality and large forecast errors can disrupt grid operations and lead to costly interventions to minimize imbalances and congestions etc. In this paper, we examine the energy generation data and forecasts publicly shared by Belgium's TSO, Elia as part of its transparency commitments. Our analysis finds some minor data quality issues, but a tripling in (absolute) forecast errors for solar and wind energy from 2017 to 2024 across various time scales. Our analysis also shows that while it plays a part, these errors cannot be attributed solely to capacity growth, highlighting a decline in forecasting accuracy. We also show that machine learning techniques can improve these existing forecasts with publicly available data, and consequently reduce balancing and system operation costs."

Specifically, to enhance detection accuracy without increasing model complexity, the SRA attention module is integrated into the backbone network to fuse spatial positional information of icons and improve feature extraction capabilities. Subsequently, to further strengthen the model’s multi-scale perception, a Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) is incorporated into the neck network. This architecture effectively aggregates multi-scale feature information by incorporating weighted bidirectional connections and a feature reuse mechanism. The improved network is termed FSI-YOLO.

Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) is carried out, which includes histograms, thematic maps, and scatter plots. The Moran's index revealed a positive autocorrelation of 0.78 for population density and high clusters surrounded by high neighbors in 28 percent of the municipalities identified through Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA). Thematic maps highlight critical areas of low service coverage, underlining the need for integrated policies to improve water and housing infrastructure, which contribute to sustainable urban development in accordance with what a Sustainable Urban Development policy implies from the perspective of the smart cities paradigm"

    "abstract": "Alarm management in SCADA-driven power distribution networks remains a significant challenge, often over-whelming control room operators and compromising timely fault identification. This paper presents an integrated alarm management methodology to address alarm overload, redundancy, and poor geospatial association. Initially, a Python-based pre-processing engine is developed that performs operations such as cleaning, transformation and integration to handle raw SCADA alarm data. Subsequently, an advanced data-driven algorithm is implemented for classifying alarm groups, specifically battery charger alarms from the distribution automation (DA) secondary substation, thereby reducing the dependence on manual operator inspection. Furthermore, filtering techniques are designed to eliminate redundancies and prioritize critical alarms, along with a pattern recognition module that detects recurring power factor limit violations alarms and generates operator notifications. Additionally, to improve fault localization, an automated alarm correlation approach is created that links secondary substation events with the upstream network topology. The proposed modules are validated using real-world SCADA data from a utility in Dubai. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in alarm volume (e.g., <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$20-40 {\\%}$</tex> for voltage-related alarms), enhanced situational awareness through pattern recognition, and faster fault diagnosis enabled by alarm correlation. This work contributes to a scalable and interpretable framework for enhancing operational efficiency and resilience in power distribution control systems."

The developed method addresses the problem of data loss and involves hierarchical search for similar blocks and merging the found blocks using a neural network architecture. Testing on the Rosario dataset, which contains complex agricultural scenarios, demonstrated a significant improvement in the quality of depth maps. Compared to existing analogs, the mean error (RMSE) decreased by 20-30%, and the PSNR and SSIM metrics increased by 20-30%. The S-MSCKF algorithm was used to evaluate the impact on SLAM. After applying the reconstruction, the absolute trajectory error (ATE) decreased from 0.62 m to 0.25 m, and the RMSE decreased from 0.85 m to 0.39 m. The method significantly improves the accuracy of SLAM in challenging conditions, such as uneven terrain and variable lighting, and has high potential for implementation in autonomous agricultural machinery systems, increasing their reliability and safety."

    "abstract": "The expansion of wireless technologies such as IoT, 5G, and connected vehicles has significantly increased the demand for radio spectrum access, challenging conventional spectrum methods such as energy detection. The main purpose of spectrum sensing energy detection algorithms is to determine the state of the radio communication channel in order to avoid packet collisions and maintain a high level of performance. However, energy detection suffers in low signal-to-noise (SNR) environments and under dynamic channel conditions due to fixed threshold dependency and inaccurate noise estimation. This paper presents a novel framework for energy detection that embeds a feedforward neural network to enhance noise estimation for adaptive threshold computation without prior SNR parameter knowledge. Beyond wireless communications, the proposed method also supports ICT-driven infrastructures such as smart grids and IoT-based energy systems, where reliable spectrum sensing is essential for secure, scalable, and efficient data exchange. The main advantage of our approach is to increase detection capabilities in both low-SNR and dynamic spectrum environments by using a novel AI framework able to estimate the noise level and enhance radio channel state detection."

    "abstract": "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), an active remote sensing technology that can be deployed on various aerial plat forms, generates images by emitting microwaves and analyzing the intensity of backscattered signals. The penetration capability of microwaves enables observation of Earth at all weather, day and night, broadening the application of SAR. However, SAR image interpretation remains challenging for non-experts. In contrast, optical images provide intuitive visual features but are weather-sensitive. To synergize these modalities, SAR-to-Optical Translation (S2OT) has gained research attention, but most studies prioritize visual quality or similarity metrics over practical applicability to downstream tasks. This study proposes a high level vision task-coordinated S2OT framework to address this gap. Semantic segmentation, emulating land cover classification, is integrated as the downstream task. Semantic segmentation loss guides the network to generate optical images that enhance task-relevant features. To preserve structural information in SAR images, we introduce SSIM loss and incorporate SAR derived semantic segmentation maps as auxiliary inputs. An identity loss further aligns the distributions of generated and real optical images, mitigating domain discrepancies. Extensive experiments confirm that S2OT improves downstream land cover classification. The inclusion of task-specific losses elevates translation quality: our HVTC-GAN surpasses the baseline methods in SSIM and PSNR metrics. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of co-training S2OT with high-level vision tasks, demonstrating that task-oriented constraints enhance both translation fidelity and downstream utility.

    "abstract": "On-board chargers (OBCs) with conventional two-stage architecture, consisting of an active front-end (AFE) converter and an isolated dc-dc stage, require bulky line filters and dc-link capacitors, resulting in low volumetric efficiency. Active third-harmonic injection and current unfolding methods offer significant improvement in terms of efficiency and power density in power factor correction (PFC) applications. However, existing unfolding-based topologies require two isolated dc-dc converters capable of handling the rated power for PFC and output voltage regulation. This article presents a three-phase ac-dc converter with a third-harmonic current injection circuit that processes a fraction of the total power and a single isolated dc-dc converter for galvanic isolation. Line frequency switching in the rectifier produces varying dc-link voltages, eliminating the requirement of bulky electrolytic capacitors. The article discusses detailed operation and design procedures along with an elaborate comparative analysis between the proposed topology and the conventional two-stage and Swiss rectifier-based isolated topologies. A 6.6 kW prototype is developed and tested for experimental validation of the system in both balanced and unbalanced grid conditions. The experimental results demonstrate unity power factor (upf) operation throughout the operating range, achieving a peak efficiency above 97%."

In this paper, we investigate the joint design of optical phased array (OPA) beamforming and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform, thus extending the radio-frequency (RF)-ISAC paradigm to the optical band. First, the system model for the OPA-based OW-ISAC framework is introduced to facilitate simultaneous communication and sensing. Next, signal processing techniques are tailored for an optical OFDM waveform with precisely separated communication and sensing subcarriers. Then, the joint optimization problem of OPA beamforming and OFDM waveform design is formulated, decomposed, and resolved to reach a flexible compromise between communication and sensing performances. Moreover, numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed OW-ISAC scheme and reveal the trade-off between communication and sensing functionalities. Consequently, the capabilities of reliable communication and precise sensing will establish OW-ISAC as a powerful complement to RF-ISAC in the near future."

The researchers applied this new transform to abdominal electrocardiogram (AECG) signals from pregnant women to directly obtain the fetal heart rate (FHR). Using public data from the PhysioNet abdominal and direct fetal ECG database, the Adaptive Transform was applied to the AECG signals, achieving highly accurate FHR estimation.

The controller is structured as a PD scheme, where the proportional action is determined through fuzzy inference using seven linguistic input values, while the derivative action is computed conventionally. The output of the fuzzy system is obtained through a weighted average defuzzification method and converted into PWM signals to drive the DC motors via an H-bridge circuit. The proposed methodology was implemented on an ESP32-WROOM-32 embedded platform, integrating real-time data acquisition from an IMU (accelerometer and gyroscope) to estimate the tilt angle of the robot. Experimental tests were conducted under two scenarios: one without external disturbances and another with manually applied perturbations. Results demonstrate that the fuzzy controller maintains stability within <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\pm 2^{\\circ}$</tex> of the setpoint in disturbance-free conditions and successfully recovers equilibrium within a range of 75° to 105° under perturbations.

In many off-grid rural applications, a small microgrid must be implemented to manage generation, storage, and loads. In addition to other functionality, agrivoltaic control systems must implement integrated power and energy management, in addition to asset monitoring and control. In this paper, a prototype Integrated Energy Management and Control System (EMCS) for off-grid agrivoltaics implementations used in irrigation applications is presented, using a test system located in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, South India. The paper considers a novel integrated PV supply and irrigation system load power management design and presents simulation-based tests of the modified MPPT and coupled non-linear digital irrigation control system.

    "abstract": "In this study, a novel, multi-purpose, ultrawideband multiple input multiple output (MIMO) antenna design that is aimed to provide high data rate for 5G and WLAN communication applications, is presented. The dual-band antenna consists of 4 antenna elements. Its fractional bandwidths are 123% and 30% for first and second operating frequencies, respectively. For the whole operating frequencies, it has radiated with very good reflection performance better than −10 dB. Moreover, the isolation between antenna elements is better than −15 dB and −20 dB for the each of operating frequencies, respectively. Finally, Envelope Correlation Coefficient (ECC) is usually lower than 0.01."

    "abstract": "Energy storage solutions play a crucial role in ensuring grid stability, reducing energy costs, and improving overall system efficiency. Among emerging storage technologies, Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) systems have gained significant attention due to their dual functionality - enables bidirectional power flow, allowing electric vehicles (EVs) to store excess renewable energy and discharge it back to the grid or directly to buildings when needed. By leveraging V2G, buildings can improve their energy flexibility potential, reducing reliance on centralized power systems while enhancing demand response capabilities. This paper develops a simulation-based optimization framework for building-level V2G, applies it to a Romanian university dormitory, and benchmarks results against stationary lithiumion and second-life EV batteries. Results indicate that while daily cost savings at single-building scale are modest, aggregated V2G systems significantly increase cost reductions and emission savings. Compared to stationary storage, V2G leverages existing EV capacity, offering superior cost-effectiveness per unit of flexibility. The study highlights Romania's emerging regulatory framework, the scalability potential of V2G, and the need for market incentives to enable widespread adoption."

In the first phase, we construct the CSP model as a faithful representation of the real Python code. In the second phase, the model checker PAT automatically proves correctness of the third generic algorithm by proving its deadlock freeness (safety property) and successful termination (liveness property)."

    "abstract": "Designing cost-effective and reliable off-grid microgrids (MGs) is particularly challenging in rural regions where energy demand is shaped by both household consumption and productive use of energy (PUE). This paper presents an integrated planning and optimization framework that reduces the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCoE) while enabling scalable microgrid expansion. The approach combines demand-side management (DSM), consumer clustering, and a novel biomass-based Combined Heat and Power (BCHP) operation strategy adapted to seasonal Agro-processing loads. Using the XENDEE platform, the study performs system sizing and optimal energy dispatch based on real-world load data. Consumers are classified through a Multi-tier Framework (MTF), with PUE applications treated as high-tier loads requiring tailored energy support. DSM measures were selectively applied only to PUE loads, with household consumption patterns preserved as fixed constraints during optimization. The methodology is applied to extend an existing microgrid (MG) to serve additional demand, while maintaining the same LCoE and system size through strategic DSM and dynamic BCHP scheduling. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to validate the robustness of the proposed solution. Results confirm that the integrated approach ensures reliable power supply, improves load flexibility, and maintains cost stability—offering practical insights for microgrid planners and policymakers pursuing sustainable rural electrification."

This paper presents an updated MCS implementation featuring a modular architecture, Data Distribution Service (DDS) support, and a trajectory generation module aligned with the latest specifications. Validation in a two-vehicle overtaking scenario demonstrates that reliable trajectory exchange and real-time negotiation can be achieved, underscoring how V2X-enabled networks support safe and efficient cooperative driving."

    "abstract": "Next-generation vehicular communication systems require ultra-reliable and low-latency links to support safety critical and high-mobility scenarios. Full Duplex (FD) communication enhances spectral efficiency by enabling simultaneous transmission and reception; however, it is limited in its ability to suppress interference and maintain reliable coverage in the presence of wireless blind spots and dense traffic. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted FD Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol for New Radio Vehicle-to-Everything (NR-V2X) Mode 2 systems, where RIS improves signal coverage and reliability through intelligent reflection. The proposed design augments the standard Sensing-Based Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SB-SPS) framework by integrating machine learning (ML)-based predictions of key Quality-of-Service (QoS) metrics, namely Packet Reception Ratio (PRR) and Channel Busy Ratio (CBR), which trigger dynamic RIS activation and resource retention decisions. A Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) model further evaluates long-term link reliability and supports adaptive resource reselection. Extensive simulations conducted on the proposed framework demonstrate a favorable trade-off between Packet Reception Ratio (PRR) and Wireless Blind Spot Probability (WBSP), ensuring robust performance across diverse vehicular densities and mixed packet transmission patterns."

    "abstract": "As 5G networks evolve into dynamic, multi-domain architectures spanning wireless, transport, and core layers, traditional assurance tools struggle to deliver real-time, end-to-end visibility. Operational silos, reactive troubleshooting, and fragmented alarm handling prolong Mean Time to Repair (MTTR), increase costs, and leave user demand unmet in congested areas.This paper presents an AI-driven assurance framework, developed under the TM Forum Catalyst program—an industry initiative for collaborative telecom innovation. The framework addresses these challenges through three modules: intelligent topology visualization, automated root cause analysis (Auto RCA), and Expected Demand Not Served (EDNS) models.The methodology emphasizes algorithmic transparency. Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting models were trained on 1.2M multi-domain alarm records from production and simulated 5G environments. Feature sets span alarm attributes, topology metadata, and service-level KPIs, with hyperparameters tuned via grid search and validation using a 70/15/15 split.Results show that Auto RCA achieves 0.94 precision, 0.91 recall, and an F1-score of 0.925, outperforming baseline threshold-based engines by 38%. The EDNS model forecasts underserved demand with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 6.8%. Deployed across a multi-vendor testbed and integrated with OSS/BSS, the framework improved fault detection by 50%, reduced MTTR by 35%, and enhanced proactive demand handling by 27%. Recognized at TM Forum Catalyst 2024, it provides a replicable blueprint for intelligent, cross-domain assurance in next-generation networks."

    "abstract": "Confidential Computing is the protection of data in use by performing computation in a hardware-based, attested Trusted Execution Environment. However, even without specific hardware features, one can still protect computation to some extent using software solutions. Confidential Containers (CoCo) play a crucial role in providing confidential computing without specific hardware. Confidential Computing protects data in use. In contrast, data at rest and data in transit are only secured by means of traditional classical encryption algorithms such as Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) or Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH). These algorithms face a significant threat from the advent of quantum computers, a threat known as the Quantum Threat. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been leading efforts to standardize Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms such as — standardized quantum-resistant algorithms — CRYSTALS-Kyber and Dilithium that remain secure against quantum threats. These standardized PQC algorithms are built on mathematical problems believed to be hard for both classical and quantum computers, to protect our data against quantum attacks that powerful quantum computers could launch. This study presents an integration of confidential computing with PQC to secure data/computation in all stages of data —data in use, data at rest, and data in transit — even from quantum threats. Furthermore, the paper delivers a comparison of confidential computing with PQC to other traditional methods, such as Fully Homomorphic Encryption, and others. The study’s results demonstrate significantly lower overhead when using CC with PQC compared to FHE in experimental data payloads. It clearly stated that CC with PQC is a better feasible option than other traditional data in use methods."

    "abstract": "The integration of satellite networks into next-generation mobile communication systems has gained considerable momentum with the advent of 5G Non-Terrestrial Networks (5G-NTN). Since established technologies like DVB-S2/RCS2 are already widely used for satellite broadband, a detailed comparison with emerging 5G NTN solutions is necessary to understand their relative merits and guide deployment decisions. This paper presents a user-centric, end-to-end evaluation of these technologies under realistic traffic conditions, showing how differences in architecture and protocols impact application-layer performance. Utilizing the 6G Sandbox platform, we employ OpenAirInterface to emulate 5G NTN and OpenSAND for DVB-S2/RCS2, replicating transparent payload GEO satellite scenarios under uniform downlink conditions. A range of real-world applications, such as web browsing, file downloads, and video streaming, are tested across both systems and systematically analyzed. While the emulation lacks real-time capability, it reveals key strengths and limitations of each approach, helping identify suitable deployment scenarios for 5G NTN and DVB-S2/RCS2."

    "abstract": "All the traditional things, from infrastructure to supply chain, are rapidly being converted to smart things with the development of the Internet of Things and its massive sensor catalogue. The idea is theoretically amazing, but while implementing it, scaling becomes a major issue. Massive IoT methodologies take care of the pesky scaling issues, while enhancing the overall quality of the network’s communication. Smart cities are in the current research to make human life easy and comfortable. Most of the multi storied buildings are designed smart to achieve safety, security, and comfort. However, just deploying sensors into the buildings do not solve the purpose. Monitoring the buildings require data exchange between sensors to users for appropriate analysis and interpretation. It is really crucial to monitor all the sensor data to provide an amazing quality of life experience. However, the massive IoT technology solves the problem of handling hundreds of sensors at a time through light weight messaging protocols like MQTT and CoAP. An architecture is proposed that uses the MQTT Protocol paired with various sensors and edge devices for the monitoring of residential buildings and simplifying such projects. A methodology focusing on the scale, payload and quality of service is proposed in this manuscript. The edge broker scales the number of sensors from 217 per edge node to 1254 sensors with 5 Edge Broker nodes, which is an increment of 5.7 times."

In this work, we explore the potential of disaggregated and cloud-native Radio Access Network (RAN) architectures to support seamless gate-to-gate connectivity for commercial aircraft. We propose and analyze four deployment scenarios that distribute the functions of disaggregated gNB, the central unit (CU), the distributed unit (DU), and the radio unit (RU) across aircraft, satellite platforms, and ground infrastructure. Emphasizing latency budget considerations, we examine trade-offs between performance, scalability, and complexity across multi-orbit satellite constellations. We further argue that adopting cloud-native RAN principles, along with intelligent orchestration and AI-based adaptation, can enable flexible and resilient architectures for future 6G NTN-based aviation services."

    "abstract": "Wind turbine reliability is critical to the growing renewable energy sector, where early fault detection significantly reduces downtime and maintenance costs. This paper introduces a novel ensemble-based deep learning framework for unsupervised anomaly detection in wind turbines. The method integrates Variational Autoencoders (VAE), LSTM Autoencoders, and Transformer architectures, each capturing different temporal and contextual patterns from high-dimensional SCADA data. A unique feature engineering pipeline extracts temporal, statistical, and frequency-domain indicators, which are then processed by the deep models. Ensemble scoring combines model predictions, followed by adaptive thresholding to detect operational anomalies without requiring labeled fault data. Evaluated on the CARE dataset containing 89 years of real-world turbine data across three wind farms, the proposed method achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.947 and early fault detection up to 48 hours prior to failure. This approach offers significant societal value by enabling predictive maintenance, reducing turbine failures, and enhancing operational efficiencyin large-scale wind energy deployments."

This paper presents an overview of the most significant RL-based routing protocols for VANETs and FANETs, along with their classification and comparison.

    "abstract": "This paper presents an optimal power-sharing algorithm (OPSA) that can address the power sharing of gridforming inverters (GFMIs) in modern power systems with high penetrations of distributed energy resources (DERs). Unlike conventional techniques that adopt static assumptions of power availability, the method presented here includes real-time estimation of the available power reserve from PV units using a data-driven two-layered feed-forward neural network. Since the PV units are interfaced through GFMIs operating in a gridforming mode, they do not follow maximum power point tracking (MPPT), but rather operate under flexible generation to support power balancing and system stability. According to this estimated power reserve, the supervisory controller regulates virtual impedance in real-time to allocate the power demand optimally among GFMIs. The adaptive control approach avoids inverter overloading, enhances the utilization of renewable energy, and assists system stability under varying irradiation and loads. Simulation results in various scenarios confirm the effectiveness of the implemented OPSA for achieving well-balanced power sharing and higher grid resiliency."

    "abstract": "Among the 97 studies included in this systematic review, 81 (83.5%) investigate Parkinson’s Disease (PD), reflecting the broader research landscape and the established utility of wearable sensors in capturing PD-specific gait impairments rather than an intentional PD-focused search strategy. Building on this context, this review synthesizes recent advances in gait analytics using Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) and Plantar Pressure Sensors (PPS) across disorders with motor phenotypes. Gait analysis has emerged as a critical tool for understanding motor dysfunction, enabled by portable sensor technologies capable of precise, real-time measurements in naturalistic settings. This review, spanning publications from 2020 to April 2024, examines studies identified through four major databases (PubMed, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar). Eligible works were original, peer-reviewed studies applying quantitative gait analytics using IMUs and/or PPS in Arthritis, Diabetes Mellitus, or PD. Exclusion criteria comprised non-human studies, incompatible sensing modalities, use of more than ten different sensors, sensor-comparison–only studies, absence of gait protocols, and cohorts consisting solely of healthy individuals or those with gait-altering deformities. Together, IMUs and PPS are reshaping diagnostic and monitoring strategies for PD, Arthritis, and Diabetes, where gait abnormalities and neuropathic complications are central to functional impairment. Beyond PD, the review includes 12 Diabetes and 4 Arthritis studies, representing peripheral nerve and musculoskeletal conditions that remain comparatively underexplored. The included studies are synthesized by sensor modality, placement, analytical methodology, protocol design, cohort characteristics, and performance outcomes. Approaches ranged from statistical analysis to machine learning, deep learning, and rule-based models, with several reporting state-of-the-art results. The findings underscore the value of wearable sensors for monitoring disease progression, detecting gait-phase abnormalities, and supporting personalized interventions. Despite these advancements, significant limitations persist, including a lack of publicly available datasets, limited external validity, small or imbalanced samples, inconsistent sensor placement, and data integration challenges. Future directions emphasize standardized protocols, multi-center validation, and AI-driven multimodal fusion to unlock scalable, clinically reliable gait-analytics solutions across healthcare and rehabilitation."

    "abstract": "Due to the non-linear relation of Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE), an efficient resource assignment in mobile networks is challenging. To evaluate the impact of QoS variations on the perceived quality of data services, subjective tests for video streaming and web-browsing are performed in this study. The end user's view is assessed by rating the quality of different versions of a source using a modified version of the MUlti Stimulus test with Hidden Reference and Anchor (MUSHRA). Based on measurements in a live network, stimuli are generated by using a combination of network emulation and automatic user-interface control of a real mobile device. These stimuli include relevant effects observed in a live network, e.g. throughput dependent video startup time/resolution and interruptions caused by rebuffering. In this study, the contribution of each of these aspects to the overall quality impression is quantified. The results show that the highest subjective impairment is provided by an interruption of the video fluency, with the duration of the interruption having a significant influence. Increasing video startup times lead to a continuous decrease in the perceived quality but are rather tolerated than rebuffering interruptions. Video clarity plays a minor role. In contrast to streaming services, web-browsing as interactive service shows a smoother degradation of the perceived quality with decreasing throughput."

The investigation considers that the aforementioned system operates in sixth generation (6G) candidate bands: 4.6 GHz, 7.8 GHz, 15 GHz, and 40 GHz. The outage probability is utilized for the performance analysis. Analytical and asymptotic derivations are validated by means of Monte-Carlo simulations. The obtained results reveal that when residual loop-interference is sufficiently suppressed, FD attains slightly better outage performance than HD due to its pre-log advantage. A mild performance uptick at higher carrier frequencies stems from the frequency-dependent MT antenna gains assumed (2/3/6/10 dBi), rather than intrinsic frequency effects."

Conventional boost converters face limitations like high component stress and reduced efficiency at high duty cycles. The proposed converter employs two switches controlled by a single PWM signal, simplifying control while aiming to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and minimize the need for additional filtering components.

This paper presents an advanced NILM framework specifically designed for smart farming energy systems, where cost-effective, scalable, and accurate energy management is essential. The proposed model integrates hybrid deep learning architectures with wavelet scattering transforms for robust feature extraction. Wavelet scattering is employed to generate low-variance, translationinvariant features from time-series power data, enhancing the model's ability to distinguish between appliances with similar energy signatures and reducing the dimensionality of the input data. To perform appliance classification, the study investigates and compares three machine learning models: Subspace kNearest Neighbors (Subspace KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) Kernel, and Gaussian Naive Bayes. These classifiers are evaluated using MATLAB's Classification Learner. Due to the current lack of publicly available energy datasets specific to agricultural equipment and smart farm loads, the proposed NILM system was validated using home appliance datasets, which are widely accepted benchmarks in NILM research. The results validate the proposed system's capability to perform accurate and scalable energy disaggregation, with significant improvements in classification accuracy and computational efficiency."

However, due to significant variations in server performance and load, task latency exhibits high uncertainty, rendering traditional static or globally informationdriven offloading strategies ill-suited for dynamic changes. To address this, this paper proposes a Multi-Armed Bandit-based Dynamic Task Offloading algorithm (MAB_DTO). This method models the offloading process as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem. By obtaining a fractional solution through LP relaxation, it screens candidate server sets and combines dynamic thresholds to complete offloading decisions and state updates. Simulation results demonstrate that MAB_DTO achieves superior delay performance compared to the Greedy algorithm and the Multi-UAV Mobile Edge Computing via Deep Reinforcement Learning(MU_DRL) algorithm under various load conditions."

A custom dataset of various kitchen utensils was used, including both occluded and non-occluded conditions. We achieved an mAP50-95 of 0.72 and 0.80 for the occluded and non-occluded kitchen utensils datasets, respectively. While this initial study does not incorporate context- aware inference or real-time alert mechanisms, it demonstrates the potential of object detection models as a foundational step toward intelligent, safety-enhancing kitchen systems.

Respiration rate monitoring is a vital parameter for wearable healthcare applications. In addition to offering accurate and non-invasive respiration rate measurements, flexible strain sensors have been extensively tested for their potential to provide reliable long-term performance at low cost without compromising user comfort. In this work, we design and fabricated a disposable paper-based flexible silver/reduced graphene-oxide hybrid printed strain sensor for respiration rate monitoring. The inkjet-printed strain sensors exhibit a stable electromechanical response, validated through statistical analysis. Physiological evaluations were conducted by placing the sensors on chest and abdomen regions under spontaneous, normal and deep breathing conditions. The result revealed that sensors placed near the hypochondriac region provide the highest sensitivity, while challenges such as poor adhesion on chest curvature must also be addressed. To further enhance sensitivity and reliability, additional experiments were conducted on the upper chest and lumbar regions which improved the measurement of respiration rate. Overall, the inkjet-printed sensors achieve high accuracy for respiration rate measurements while maintaining user comfort, highlighting their potential as an affordable and practical wearable respiratory rate monitoring device."

On the Relink dataset, the proposed method achieves a maximum improvement of 29% in Recall compared to the baseline model; on the Eclipse project, the MCC score is improved by $3.2 \\%$. Furthermore, the introduction of the SMOTE algorithm results in an additional increase of up to $9.3 \\%$ in Recall on the Relink dataset, relative to the baseline without SMOTE.

The three networks, DenseNet201, InceptionV3, and Xception, are ImageNetpretrained and are adapted with custom heads. Training is done by 5-fold cross-validation.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a physics-grounded channel modeling and training framework for a Mechanical Tunable Antenna (MTA) system designed to mitigate fading and enhance reliability in wireless communication. Unlike conventional fixed-element systems, the MTA exploits actuator-driven scanning across discrete orientations to maximize the effective channel response. The channel model is developed by explicitly linking Maxwell’s equations and radiation integrals to antenna translation and rotation, yielding a spatial response coefficient that captures element pattern, polarization alignment, and phase variation due to mechanical displacement. A training-based estimation strategy is then proposed, where pilot symbols guide the selection of the optimal scanning orientation by maximizing received signal power. Both single-input single-output (SISO) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cases are analyzed, with the MIMO system offering faster convergence to the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) bound by halving the required scanning steps. Simulation results for BPSK modulation under Rayleigh fading demonstrate that increasing the number of scanning orientations significantly improves bit error rate (BER) performance, approaching the AWGN limit. These findings establish MTA as a viable candidate for achieving robust and adaptive communication links in dynamic environments, highlighting its potential role in future wireless networks."

    "abstract": "Sixth Generation (6G) networks are expected to support a wide variety of new use cases. The growing demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI) inference and other emerging applications will significantly increase the need for additional bandwidth and resources in mobile networks. Currently, mobile networks mainly rely on unicast delivery to serve users. However, by combining unicast with multicast and broadcast delivery methods, network resources can be used more efficiently. To manage the rising traffic load in future mobile networks, integrating mobile and broadcast networks is a promising approach. Broadcast to Everything (B2X) is an extension of the Advanced Television Systems Committee’s ATSC 3.0 standard that is being designed to enable interoperability between ATSC3 and Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) mobile networks. This convergence can enable more efficient multicast and broadcast delivery while freeing up capacity for unicast traffic. Terrestrial broadcast technologies like ATSC3, which are built for efficient multicast/broadcast and operate on dedicated spectrum, can be effectively combined with mobile networks. This converged setup can improve content delivery and better serve user demand. This paper highlights the importance of converging 3GPP mobile networks and non-3GPP broadcast networks, particularly ATSC3 to enable multicast and broadcast delivery to wireless users efficiently. Emerging use cases for converged networks are reviewed, along with methods for implementing a converged network. Technical aspects, research directions, standardization activities and collaboration opportunities are also included to cover operational dimensions."

However, validating controller performance under real-world conditions remains challenging. This study employs power hardware-in-the loop (PHIL) technology to analyze the difference between simulation and physical testing. A grid-following inverter is initially modelled in MATLAB and subsequently implemented in a PHIL test environment. The system comprises a DC source feeding an 11-level inverter, with its AC side synchronized to the grid. A real-time simulator interfaced with RT-LAB manages the closed loop control and switching of the modular multilevel converter (MMC). To evaluate the control method, various scenarios have been tested, including changes in the phase shifts of the grid voltage to verify phase shift spreading, and harmonic injection. The results of both methodologies are analyzed, including a detailed FFT analysis to assess performance metrics. The findings highlight the accuracy of the PHIL approach, as its real-time results closely align with those obtained from physical testing. Moreover, since PHIL integrates actual hardware into the testing process, it eliminates many uncertainties associated with purely software-based simulations, delivering highly reliable outcomes without significant risks. In addition to its ability to provide realistic and dependable results, HIL testing is also time and cost-efficient and allows for testing under extreme conditions that may be impractical or unsafe in real world scenarios. Consequently, HIL is emerging as a strong alternative to traditional simulations, with anticipated widespread adoption in various industries in the near future."

The suggested framework relies on blockchain to ensure updates to the models and impose data integrity as well as provide federated training of deep temporal data-driven models of heterogeneous IoT sensor data. The system allows providing secure performance even with adversarial or non-IID conditions by employing edge computing and smart contracts; thus minimizing the risks of data leakage or communication time. Wide-scale simulations of the renewable integration based on an IEEE 118-bus system reveal high accuracy of detection (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\approx 97 \\%$</tex>) along with a 60 % drop in the cost of communication as well as increased resilience to node compromise in comparison to standard FL schemes. The proposed B-FL paradigm establishes a scalable and transparent security infrastructure for next-generation urban energy systems, empowering sustainable and intelligent grid operations."

    "abstract": "Pavement crack severity is a commonly used indicator for measuring the quality of road structures and is also a main manifestation of pavement diseases. With the rapid development of sensor systems and sensor data analysis, semantic segmentation models that are based on sensor data are playing an increasingly important role in urban pavement crack detection. However, notably, the complexity of pavement cracks presents significant challenges for computer vision-based detection. This paper proposes a pavement crack detection method that is based on a deep-learning approach and image features. First, an algorithm that is based on a maximum eight-direction filter (MEDF) is proposed for enhancing crack features, which have no fixed direction or shape. Second, the loss function of the segmentation model is optimized by combining edge information to effectively capture crack features. Finally, compared with three state-of-the-art models (DeepLabV3, FCN, and U-Net), the method proposed in this paper achieved the highest average recall and mIoU scores, which reached 0.735 and 0.698, respectively. The visualization results for the segmentation also reached the comprehensive optimum."

    "abstract": "A relaxed modified FDTD (2,4) scheme (RM24) is proposed to alleviate the Courant condition. Extending the Modified FDTD (2,4) (M24) scheme, we incorporate third-degree spatial difference terms with fourth-order accuracy into the time-stepping formulas to relax the constraints of the Courant condition. Through the optimization of both the coefficients of the third-degree terms and the original coefficients in the M24 scheme, the global numerical dispersion error of the RM24 scheme is reduced to the minimum. For wideband applications, by selecting the above coefficients corresponding to an appropriate grid resolution while maintaining the spatial step size constant, the numerical dispersion error of the RM24 scheme can be further reduced within the operational frequency band. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RM24 scheme with large Courant numbers effectively ensures the numerical stability and low numerical dispersion characteristics, thereby enhancing its capability to efficiently achieve accurate results in long-time simulations and electrically large-scale scenarios."

    "abstract": "Intelligent Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks are an emerging threat to future network infrastructures like IoT and 5G, with traditional detection methods can’t keep up with their scale and complexity. Existing intelligent systems often face challenges with data privacy, computational overhead, and performance degradation on heterogeneous, non-identically distributed (non-IID) data. This paper introduces FL-MultiDDoSNet, a novel federated learning framework for detecting intelligent DDoS. Our approach transforms raw network traffic data into 2D image representations, drastically reducing computational and memory overhead during training. The framework operates over a decentralized heterogeneous future network trained on deep learning models individually at the client. These distributed models are then aggregated, and a final prediction is made using a voting-based fusion mechanism at the central server, enhancing detection accuracy and resilience. Experimental results show that FL-MultiDDoSNet achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 99.98%, with a minimal communication overhead of 7.3 MB and an ultra-low latency of 30 ms that outperforms existing models."

    "abstract": "The evolution of 5G New Radio (NR) categorizes users into three primary classes: Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC), and Massive Machine-Type Communication (mMTC). While eMBB users demand high data rates and coverage, URLLC devices require strict latency and reliability guarantees. In this paper, we address the joint scheduling challenge of eMBB and massive URLLC traffic in industrial scenarios, formulating it as a resource packing problem under heterogeneous quality-of-service constraints. To address this, we propose a Deep Q-Learning (DQN)-based resource allocation framework that integrates both orthogonal and non-orthogonal access strategies. A portion of Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs) is reserved exclusively for URLLC, while the remaining PRBs—primarily allocated to eMBB—can be dynamically punctured to accommodate bursty URLLC traffic. The proposed model adapts in real time to varying traffic loads, maximizing spectral efficiency while minimizing eMBB degradation and resource underutilization. Simulation results show that our DQN-based approach outperforms traditional static scheduling, achieving a favorable trade-off between throughput and latency in diverse load conditions."

    "abstract": "At present, green finance in China is showing a rapid development trend. Against this backdrop, predicting the prices of green financial products has become a key point in investment decision-making and risk management processes. This is because the prices of green financial products have high volatility and complex nonlinear characteristics. When traditional statistical models are used for prediction, It is often impossible to achieve satisfactory prediction accuracy. A new hybrid deep learning model, which is based on Snow Ablation Optimizer, it is alled SAO-CNN-BiLSTM-AM. This model integrates the feature extraction ability of convolutional neural networks, the temporal modeling ability of bidirectional long short-term memory networks, and all the global dependency capture capabilities of the attention mechanism. The SAO algorithm is also adopted to automatically optimize the hyperparameters, which enhances the accuracy and robustness of the prediction. In this paper, the daily data of the CSI environmental protection Industry Index from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2024 is taken as the empirical sample. The prediction performances of the two models, SAO-CNN-BiLSTMAM and CNN-BiLSTM-AM, were compared. It can be seen from the results obtained from the experiment that the SAO-CNN-BiLSTM-AM model is better than the CNN-BiLSTM-AM model in terms of RMSE, MAE and $\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}}$, and the prediction accuracy has been significantly improved. This study provides an effective method framework for price prediction in the green financial market."

    "abstract": "Estimating the Quality of Transmission (QoT) is crucial for designing an Elastic Optical Networks (EONs). In conventional method, QoT estimation rely on the physical-layer models with conservative margins, which can be computationally expensive along with wastage of bandwidth. In order to identify the QoT in EON faster, we propose the deep learning technique where we use data-driven method. In this method, we generated a dataset of around 2000 simulated lightpaths with 11 features each. We labeled it by providing the criteria that whether the lightpath is within the threshold Bit Error Rate (BER). We then train a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to classify lightpaths that are within the threshold limit and acceptable in terms of QoT or not. By using DNN, we achieve high accuracy (∼98% on test data) despite class imbalance, with strong precision and recall. From our simulation results we found that a DNN can learn the intricate connection between QoT and lightpath parameters, yielding predictions for QoT that are almost instantaneous. This approach enables faster and more efficient network provisioning by obviating the need for time-consuming physics-based QoT calculations."

Although these methods have shown decent performance, the underlying principles remain insufficiently explored. In this work, we investigate SFDA through the PAC-Bayesian generalization error bound, demonstrating that its generalization error is jointly constrained by model complexity and pseudo-label noise. Motivated by this, we propose PATH, a selective PArameter fine-tuning framework guided by Topological and Historical priors for SFDA medical image segmentation. Specifically, PATH identifies domain-variant and task-distinctive parameters and sparsely updates them, thereby reducing effective model complexity during adaptation. In addition, PATH estimates pseudo-label reliability by integrating topological structure and historical prediction consistency priors to suppress pseudo-label noise. Extensive experiments on cross-scanner fundus image segmentation and cross modality abdominal multi-organ segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that PATH outperforms competing SFDA methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

While traditional approaches are promising, they face challenges such as increased computation time in large networks and reduced efficiency in specific scenarios due to limited knowledge of network topology. The network is divided into areas, and only local measuring devices are used for state estimation within each area. Distance data that may lead to model misinterpretation is not included in this approach. By performing calculations in parallel for different areas, state estimation time is reduced, and the accuracy of the results is improved. This paper also develops a graph convolution network (GCN)-based model to enhance SE accuracy, which considers the topological information of the power system in the form of an adjacency matrix. The model is evaluated on an 118-bus network, with results confirming its effectiveness based on various evaluation metrics."

Although the accuracy of the predictive model is constrained by data limitations, the integrated architecture reveals patterns in tourist flows and spatial clustering that are not captured by traditional methods. The main contribution lies in establishing a generalizable analytical approach to tourism intelligence, bridging data silos, and improving the analytical capabilities of destination management systems."

The first module is a hybrid text processing system that combines grammatical rules with a fine-tuned multilingual transformer (mBART-50) to convert Macedonian sentences into glosses, achieving a BLEU score of 30.1 and a chrF of 45.0 after hybrid normalization. The second module focuses on visualization, using MediaPipe to extract keypoints from sign videos and Blender to render these into fluid 3D avatar animations. The third module performs recognition of the Macedonian manual alphabet using MobileNetV2 trained on an augmented dataset of over 38,000 images. The system achieves 97.2% validation accuracy and a macro F1-score of 0.936 in recognition tasks.

The proposed Rician wavelet filter is constructed by deriving the corresponding low-pass and high-pass filter coefficients using shifted and normalized Rician PDF samples, ensuring compliance with wavelet admissibility and orthogonality criteria. Using this wavelet, we perform discrete wavelet transform (DWT) decomposition of measured channel impulse responses. Energy features extracted from the first three DWT scales are used to train standard classifiers, including Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF). Evaluation on a observed dataset demonstrates that the proposed Rician wavelet outperforms traditional wavelet bases in terms of classification accuracy. Experimental results highlight the potential of PDF-driven wavelet design in enhancing the performance of signal classification tasks in wireless channel environments."

However, PECs face operational stresses and gradual degradation, which compromise their performance. To address these challenges, digital twin (DT) technology is introduced as a virtual counterpart that interacts with the physical PEC, enabling real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and performance optimization. Numerous DT implementations for PECs have been reported, yet most focus on modeling/control, leaving communication requirements and technology selection underexplored. To address this gap, in this paper we first review existing DT realizations to identify their key communication requirements. Based on that research, we proposed a classification framework that links DT functionality to appropriate communication solutions and provided practical guidance for selecting the optimal technologies. These guidelines specify which communication technologies are most suitable for each DT category, which makes informed decision-making easier when DT-enabled PECs are used in modern smart grids."

CIR features extracted from packets are treated as samples from a probability distribution, and authentication is performed by comparing the distribution observed in new packets with the distribution predicted from recent legitimate traffic. To perform these comparisons, distributions are embedded in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), where distances directly capture subtle deviations in channel behavior. To make this computationally feasible on low-resource devices, we approximate the embeddings using Random Fourier Features (RFF), which reduces the complexity of scoring each packet from quadratic to linear time. The scheme adapts to environmental variability through online calibration, deriving acceptance thresholds from the observed dispersion of legitimate packet features. The proposed approach provides both efficiency and robustness, enabling operation without labeled attack data or manual tuning. It delivers high authentication accuracy under static and time-varying sound speed profiles while substantially reducing computational overhead."

In this paper, a concise, modular framework is proposed, utilizing the capabilities of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). By combining AI-based threat detection examples with XAI visualizations, students learn how intelligent systems identify suspicious activity and understand the reasoning behind these decisions. This curriculum format, which prioritizes conceptual learning, can be easily integrated to interdisciplinary STEM contexts. The pedagogical rationale is presented, following an outline of the main modules of an AI-enabled 5G/6G network security course.

Yet, enabling such intelligence in ultra resource-constrained sensor systems demands highly efficient, low-power solutions. One promising approach is the use of neural networks with binary or ternary parameters, which significantly reduce memory requirements and computational load. In this paper, we present the training and deployment of binary and ternary neural networks for gesture and human activity recognition on off-the-shelf, ultra resource-constrained sensor systems. The proposed method introduces a fully differentiable, end-to-end framework for training and deploying mixed binary and ternary models directly on the target system. The proposed models offer broad applicability due to their minimal memory requirements and low energy consumption, as validated through experimental evaluation. Experimental results show that the proposed models reduce memory usage by over 80 % and latency by up to 32 %, even when running at a clock speed <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$5 x$</tex> slower than state-of-the-art systems."

    "abstract": "The evolution of telecommunication networks into 6G has introduced a paradigm shift, aiming to incorporate diverse and heterogeneous technologies along with targeting specialized use-cases tailored to private networks. Furthermore, the increased disaggregation of the network has enabled the ubiquity of Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) to function on Commercially-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware, opening an ecosystem of open interfaces and open software. Owing to this evolution, the management complexity of the network also grows correspondingly, mandating a shift in approach. In contrast to the static Policy Based Management and Control (PBMC) which requires the management system to be well thought out during the design phase, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to learn and address the requirements during the run-time, introducing flexibility and adaptability, making it easier for the operator to manage and at the same time reducing operations and costs to design the management system.

It is anticipated that ‘AI for networks’, i.e., incorporation of AI/ML technology into network design, will play a crucial role in future mobile networks. One area that may benefit significantly from the usage of ‘AI for networks’ is the design and optimization of communication protocols in mobile networks. Communication protocols, the building blocks of all communication networks, have traditionally been organized into fixed layered architectures. In addition, they typically possess immutable behaviour with limited user/service specific variations. For example, existing networks, such as the 5th Generation (5G) network, uses the same set of protocols to support all users and services, with limited user/service specific configurations. Considering the requirement to support a vast array of services in future mobile networks, it is time to rethink this traditional ossified layered protocol architecture. In this paper, we propose programmable and adaptive protocols based future mobile network architecture. The proposed architecture can harness AI/ML technology to dynamically design, program and optimize the communication protocols. As discussed in this paper, a mobile network architecture with an AI-driven flexible and customizable communication protocols, is better suited to handle diverse user/service/system requirements, network conditions, and performance requirements of future."

The proposed approach improves robustness by mitigating the impact of Byzantine IoT clients, ensuring a more accurate and efficient learning process. The computational complexity analysis of the proposed technique reveals that robustness is achieved with low computational complexity.

In addition, to mitigate the information leakage, a limited number of friendly jammers are randomly deployed to interfere with the untrusted RIS. The analysis considers active, passive, and absorptive operating modes of the RIS. Outage probability is employed for the LR analysis, and both analytical and asymptotic expressions are validated through Monte Carlo simulations. The results demonstrate that while non-orthogonal CCI and friendly jammers slightly degrade system performance, this degradation is effectively mitigated by increasing the number of reflecting elements. Moreover, as the RIS becomes larger, the adverse impact of non-orthogonal CCI is significantly reduced."

    "abstract": "Left-handedness, a prominent phenotype affecting approximately 10% of the global population, has long been hypothesized to possess a polygenic basis influenced by complex gene-environment interactions. Despite previous studies suggesting associations with loci involved in neurodevelopment and brain lateralization, the genetic determinants of handedness remain largely unresolved. This study proposes a comprehensive genome-wide association study (GWAS) across diverse ethnic populations to identify and validate genetic variants correlated with left-handedness. Using high-throughput genotyping data from cohorts in Europe, East Asia, Africa, and the Americas, we applied advanced bioinformatics pipelines-leveraging tools such as PLINK, BOLT-LMM, and FUMA-for quality control, association testing, population stratification correction, and functional annotation. We identified multiple statistically significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) ($\\mathbf{p}\\lt \\mathbf{5} \\times \\mathbf{1 0}^{-\\mathbf{8}}$) enriched in genes associated with axonogenesis (e.g., LRRTM1, PCSK6), synaptic plasticity, and corpus callosum development. Pathway enrichment analysis highlighted involvement in leftright asymmetry pathways and Wnt signaling cascades. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) demonstrated moderate predictive power (AUC > 0.68) in distinguishing handedness across populations, with notable variation in allele frequency and effect size due to ancestry-specific genetic backgrounds. Furthermore, functional annotation using GTEx and ENCODE revealed several SNPs acting as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in the prefrontal cortex and motor areas of the brain. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the heritability of handedness and underscores the importance of inclusive, multi-population genetic studies in unraveling complex neurobehavioral traits. The findings hold translational value for neurodevelopmental disorder research, where atypical handedness is often observed as a comorbid phenotype."

This paper extends previous research by characterizing the correlation between UE registration/de-registration cycles and the density of statistical outliers in network metrics. Through a series of controlled experiments simulating UE churn, we demonstrate that outlier density serves as a sensitive proxy for systemic instability and operational stress. Our findings reveal a strong, predictable pattern of correlation between the number of active UEs and outlier density, allowing us to establish a signature for benign, high-load conditions. As UEs are registered, the outlier density increases in a characteristic way, and as they are de-registered, it returns to a stable baseline. This research validates the utility of outlier density for characterizing the system’s response to dynamic UE activity, which is a critical step in distinguishing normal operational stress from anomalous patterns that precede network failures. This provides a more nuanced understanding of 5G CN behavior and enhances proactive failure prediction mechanisms by offering a simple and direct way to detect the state of the system and adapt to more robust operational configurations without relying on complex prediction algorithms."

    "abstract": "Non-contact palm-vein recognition has been widely adopted in security-critical applications owing to its contact-free acquisition paradigm and exceptional discriminative power. However, these systems remain susceptible to a spectrum of presentation attacks (PAs), creating significant security risks that require urgent mitigation. Progress on palm-vein anti-spoofing is currently impeded by three fundamental gaps: (i) the absence of an open-source, end-to-end pipeline for preprocessing liveness-detection data; (ii) a lack of publicly available datasets specifically tailored to anti-spoofing evaluation; and (iii) the unavailability of benchmark studies employing standardized protocols and reference implementations. In light of these key issues, we make the following four contributions. Firstly, we propose a new open-source preprocessing pipeline that can significantly improve model performance, reducing errors by up to 53.3%. Secondly, we introduce PVASD, a new largest known dataset comprised of 1,187,519 images belonging to 5,515 subjects, which consists of 880,241 live palm vein images along with 307,278 spoof attack images including 16 different attack types – both 2d (printed stuff) and 3d (gloves and prosthesis models) attacks captured under a variety of environments using off-the-shelf commercial-grade sensors at five resolutions. Lastly, comprehensive benchmarks are also created by evaluating three types of representative methods namely classical image classification models, face anti-spoofing methods adapted from face domain and anomaly-detection-based approaches, while our experimental results reveal unique characteristics intrinsic only to palm vein spoof attacks, which will hopefully provide valuable guidance to researchers for further investigation. Furthermore, we also expanded PVASD by adding 20,000 spoof samples generated by artificial intelligence, and evaluated the vulnerability of the existing models to deepfake attacks. We will release our preprocessing pipeline, dataset, and benchmark codes at https://github.com/valhongli/PVASD to advance future reproducible studies and accelerate palm-vein anti-spoofing algorithmic research."

    "abstract": "A novel wideband co-linearly-polarized magnetoelectric (ME) dipole antenna with stable gain has been designed for vehicular sensing and communications applications, which uses folded ME dipole, decoupling plate, irregular metal wall, slots on the bottom of the suspended rectangular tube, and parasitic metal posts. Firstly, by using folded ME dipole, the operating bandwidth can be broadened significantly. Then, a series of technologies for adjusting the transmission zero are introduced to improve the isolation across the whole bandwidth, by using decoupling plate, irregular metal wall, slots on the bottom of the suspended rectangular tube to change the current distribution. Furthermore, several methods modifying the field distribution are employed to realize the stable and high gain covering the working band, by utilizing the additional metal posts combined with the irregular metal wall, slots on the bottom of the suspended rectangular tube for changing the deteriorated field distribution. Finally, the proposed antenna with the above three significant contributions is fabricated and measured to validate the proposed design. The experiment results show that the wide operational bandwidth across 1.75-3.95 GHz (77.2%), good polarization isolation higher than 22 dB, and the peak gain of 9.1 dBi with a stable fluctuation less than 1.5 dBi are obtained. These superiorities demonstrate a very promising candidate for applications in in-band full-duplex fields, which will greatly facilitate the development of vehicular sensing and communications."

The enhanced bandwidth is achieved through bow-tie patches incorporating integratedvias in the transmission cell design, while independent control of dual-polarized responses is realized by four strategically placed PIN diodes. To significantly reduce the feed-to-RTA distance, a specifically designed phase-controlled re f lectarray (PCRA) with two-degree-of-freedom cells is employed to generate a virtual focal point, reducing the profile height to one-third of conventional designs. A 16 × 16-cell DP-RTA proto type operating at 11.5 GHz was fabricated to validate the design. Utilizing the designed 1-bit phase distributions optimization method based on the discrete human evolutionary optimization algorithm (DHEOA), the antenna achieves good ±50° 2D beam scanning performance. Measurements demonstrate a 38.3% 3-dB gain bandwidth (9.5-14 GHz) and a peak gain of 21.7 dBi."

The study evaluates the revenue potential and market participation of five ESS technologies, Li-Ion, Advanced Lead-Acid, Flywheel, Li-Iron Phosphate, and Vanadium Redox Flow, in arbitrage and frequency regulation services using QuEST software. Results show that each market structure and each technology attribute strongly affect profitability. Fast-response storage technologies excel in frequency regulation services, whereas longer-duration systems achieve steadier returns from energy arbitrage. The comparative analysis indicates that MISO generally provides greater revenue opportunities for storage optimized for sustained output and rapid cycling, whereas NYISO market conditions lead to different optimal strategies. In both markets, adding frequency regulation to arbitrage operations (revenue stacking) significantly boosts total revenue for all technologies."

By integrating Geographic Information Systems (GIS), the framework spatially represents network vulnerabilities and assesses the effects of resilience-enhancing strategies, including Fault Location, Isolation, and Service Restoration (FLISR) and Demand Response Management (DRM). In contrast to traditional models that depend on static input data, the proposed system incorporates real-time sensor feedback and adaptive controls, forming a dynamic decision-support loop. The framework is validated using data from four operational feeders, demonstrating its capability to guide resilience-focused investment and improve system performance under uncertain conditions."

This paper presents a Wavelet Ensemble Denoising approach with Segment-Wise Morphological Alignment (WEMSA) to enhance PD signal clarity in smart grid environments. The method fuses detail coefficients from multiple wavelet bases using energy-based weighting and refines them through local shape-preserving adjustments. Experimental results on synthetic PD signals demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms conventional techniques such as Energy-Based Wavelet Selection (EBWS) and SNR-Based Wavelet Selection (SNRBWS) in terms of Mean Squared Error (MSE), Correlation Coefficient (CC), and output Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). The WEMSA framework exhibits robust performance under low-SNR conditions and shows strong potential for real-time and embedded diagnostics in smart grid systems."

We formulate the resilient fronthaul network design problem using Integer Linear Programming (ILP) to ensure survivability under single-point failures. Due to computational complexity, we develop a relaxed formulation ensuring splitter-disjoint paths and introduce the Redundant Randomized Successive Splitter Assignment (RRSSA) heuristic algorithm. Numerical evaluation across 100 topologies shows RRSSA achieves near-optimal performance with 35-40% cost savings over baseline methods while maintaining polynomial-time complexity for practical deployment."

    "abstract": "The progressive adoption of O-RAN architectures enables greater flexibility and innovation through programmability and modularization but also introduces novel cybersecurity risks due to increased system complexity and exposure. The core innovation of this paper is an embedded security framework operating inside the Near-RT RIC – the real-time \"brain\" of open cellular networks. Unlike traditional telecom security tools that guard the network perimeter or analyze data offline, this paper proposes developing modular defense mechanisms that run within the RIC itself. It leverages containerized security xApps (extensible applications) inside the RIC to perform real-time anomaly detection and automated threat mitigation. These xApps use hybrid artificial intelligence models to detect both high-volume attacks (e.g. DDoS flooding, jamming) and stealthy adversarial attacks targeting the RAN’s control logic. Upon detection, the framework enforces mitigation actions—such as quarantining rogue xApps, throttling malicious traffic, or detaching compromised user equipment—within the RIC’s control loop. This approach elevates the RIC from a potential weakness to a resilient, autonomous control point—capable of rapid, trustworthy, and intelligent defense against both volumetric and adversarial threats in AI-native O-RAN networks."

Microservice architectures enable scalability and modularity, but placing dependent microservices across heterogeneous edge service providers (ESPs) remains a critical challenge. Existing placement strategies often treat services independently, ignoring inter-service dependencies, which leads to increased inter-node communication delays and degraded performance. In this paper, we propose a dependency-aware microservice placement framework for VEC using deep reinforcement learning. Our approach leverages a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) based actor–critic agent to learn placement decisions that jointly minimize end-to-end service latency and maximize resource utilization while respecting capacity and SLA constraints. Experiments on real vehicular mobility traces from Luxembourg City demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces service latency and SLA violations compared to random and greedy baselines, while efficiently utilizing edge resources."

These applications require reliable communication networks and appropriate scheduling that meet strict Quality of Service (QoS) standards for safety and responsiveness. However, existing 5G scheduling algorithms like Round Robin and Proportional Fair do not meet the necessary latency and reliability demands of robotic surgeries, often causing delays. To solve this, a new scheduling algorithm is proposed that uses 5G features like network slicing and prioritization to ensure low-latency communication for healthcare robotics. This algorithm assigns network resources based on task urgency and channel conditions, improving the performance of critical medical operations. Testing of the new scheduler on the Open-Air Interface 5G simulation platform shows better throughput and reduced latency for high-priority tasks.

The overall TAM mean was 3.06 on a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$0-4$</tex> Likert scale, indicating favorable acceptance of the app, with perceived ease of use as the strongest dimension. These findings confirm MMQ's potential as a scalable, student-centered tool that fosters both measurable academic progress and positive attitudes toward digital learning and extend previous pilot results with undergraduate students by demonstrating similar benefits for high school learners."

    "abstract": "Recently, the concept of inherent cyber resilience has emerged, advocating the use of passive mitigation strategies that leverage the natural dynamics of microgrid components. Prior work has demonstrated that when the phase-locked-loop (PLL) of a grid-following (GFL) inverter is under attack, reducing the droop gain of the closest located grid forming (GFM) inverter effectively mitigates the exhibited voltage sags due to routine load changes. Building on this foundation, this paper first investigates the impact of PLL attacks under major disturbances, such as electrical faults. Simulation studies reveal that fault-induced effects can be magnified, leading to more severe voltage drops, increasing the risk of generator disconnection or even systemwide blackout. Second, it is shown that reducing the droop gain of the GFM inverter effectively restores fault responses to levels observed in an uncompromised system, enhancing system robustness and demonstrating that the concept of inherent cyber resilience remains effective even under fault scenarios."

    "abstract": "Interference mitigation is one of the primary challenges in radar technology, particularly for automotive radars that utilize frequency-modulated continuous wave radars, where reliability is crucial. In this study, the RetNet-ED model, an encoder-decoder architecture that adapts the retentive network for the signal-to-signal task of interference mitigation, is proposed. The core innovation is the design of a stable, deep architecture that successfully applies the RetNet mechanism to the complex domain of radar signals. Specifically, a segmented processing pipeline to handle long sequences of signal and gated residual connections are added, a key stabilization technique that enables the deep network to converge effectively. Extensive experiments using the open-source ARIM-v2 dataset demonstrate that RetNet-ED delivers state-of-the-art performance. In particular, it exceeds a robust Transformer baseline in Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR) and sets a new benchmark for both Amplitude and Phase Estimation Error, demonstrating superior reconstruction accuracy across all tested Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR). This work demonstrates that the RetNet model, with proper architectural adaptation, is a successor to the transformer model, providing a high-performance alternative for complex signal processing tasks and offering a new, validated approach to developing high-quality interference cancellation models."

    "abstract": "The global transition toward sustainable energy systems is accelerating, driven by increasing environmental concerns, the volatility of fossil fuel markets, and the need for energy security. In regions like Mosul, Iraq-where infrastructure has faced significant disruption-developing resilient and sustainable energy solutions is particularly urgent. Microgrids, powered by renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, offer a viable path to decentralize electricity supply, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and decrease reliance on costly diesel generators. However, effective integration and management of renewable resources in microgrids remain technically challenging due to their intermittent and unpredictable nature. Conventional control strategies often struggle to maintain system stability, especially when renewable supply exceeds demand or fluctuates rapidly. In this context, intelligent control methods are essential to ensure efficient energy dispatch and storage coordination. This study proposes a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) to enhance power management across four interconnected microgrid zones in Mosul. The controller dynamically balances load demands, optimizes energy storage usage, and reduces diesel dependency, providing a cost-effective and environmentally sustainable solution. Through simulation in MATLAB/Simulink, the system demonstrates its potential to transform microgrid operations, contributing to a smarter, cleaner, and more resilient energy future for regions."

The Optimal PMU Placement problem was formulated using a mixed-integer linear programming framework and solved through a customized combinatorial setcover search refined with observability redundancy metrics. A constrained variant of the algorithm was further developed to determine optimal PMU siting under limited deployment budgets, identifying the top five critical substations that maximize network observability. Comparative benchmarking with Depth-First Search and commercial-solver-based MILP approaches verified the method's accuracy, achieving full topological observability with 21 PMUs. A pilot PMU installation provided 50 frames-per-second synchrophasor data, which analyzed, revealed interarea oscillations. These results demonstrate the value of highresolution synchrophasor analytics and establish a scalable, datadriven framework for resilient grid modernization in emerging power systems."

The architecture incorporates a cycle-length smoothing filter and confidence threshold to stabilize decisions. Results show that while several models achieved nearperfect offline accuracies (up to 99.9%), only the MLP sustained robust coverage (98-99%) under streaming, whereas ensembles preserved perfect anomaly precision but abstained frequently (10-49% coverage). These findings demonstrate that offline accuracy alone is an unreliable indicator of field readiness and underscore the need for realistic testing and inference pipelines to ensure dependable classification in inverter-based resources (IBR)-rich networks."

To overcome these limitations, recent works adopt zero-shot learning by using rich textual descriptions to guide the alignment and recognition of unlabeled skeleton features. However, these methods still struggle with similar actions (e.g., reading vs. writing), due to ambiguity arising from noise in both modalities. We propose the Discriminative Dual-Prototype TextAlignment (DDPTA) framework. Our framework introduces a novel dual-prototype design with tailored refinement strategies to effectively distill these two complementary prototypes. For the Spatial Prototype, our CycleSpatial module first distills the action's core joint form from noisy spatial features, which is then guided by a Sieve-based Alignment. For the Temporal Prototype, our MambaTempo module leverages the Selective State Space Model to extract representations across distinct temporal stages, enabling fine-grained alignment with descriptions of different time periods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method, showcasing its effectiveness in advancing the field of zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition."

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) holds significant promise for enabling automatic modulation classification (AMC) across distributed wireless Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems while preserving data privacy. Yet, its deployment in real-world scenarios is hindered by two fundamental limitations: the inability to generalize across non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) clients without sacrificing personalization, and the lack of fast, data-efficient local adaptation mechanisms under non-IID, resource-constrained conditions. In this work, we present FedPML, a novel federated prototype-based meta-learning framework that directly addresses these challenges through a unified and scalable approach. FedPML leverages a lightweight Reptile-based meta-optimization strategy and class-level prototypes to jointly optimize for cross-client consistency and local task adaptability. This design enables rapid personalization with minimal data and computation, while preserving global knowledge alignment across heterogeneous clients. Extensive experiments on standard AMC benchmarks under a wide range of IID and non-IID conditions show that FedPML consistently outperforms strong FL baselines, achieving higher accuracy, faster convergence, and reduced communication overhead. The results demonstrate that FedPML is a powerful and practical solution for realizing resilient, low-latency AMC in decentralized IoT networks."

    "abstract": "Rotation modulation technology significantly enhances the navigation accuracy of inertial navigation systems (INS), thereby facilitating the widespread application of rotational inertial navigation systems (RINS). In marine or airborne applications, it is common to install two or more RINS units on the same carrier. By employing information fusion techniques, the navigation performance can be significantly enhanced. This paper proposes an online error estimation method for two RINSs. This method is based on the information fusion of two systems. It employs two RINSs with rotation strategies around different axes and utilizes rotation modulation technology to improve the observability of inertial sensor errors. Through Kalman filtering, the online optimal estimation of the gyro drift, accelerometer bias, scale factors and installation misalignment angles of two systems can be achieved. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in performing online estimation of inertial sensors errors for the two RINSs. Specifically, the estimation accuracy reaches about 0.001°/h for gyroscope drift, about 2μg for accelerometer bias, about 2″for misalignment angles, and about 2 ppm for scale factors in both static and dynamic conditions. Through error compensation and information fusion, the navigation accuracy has increased by 62% in a static state and by 57% in a dynamic condition, thereby validating the efficacy of the proposed methodology."

Unlike existing methods which primarily rely on a large amount of human annotations for training neural networks, we proposes GrowSP++, an unsupervised method to successfully identify complex semantic classes for every point in 3D scenes, without needing any type of human labels. Our method is composed of three major components: 1) a feature extractor incorporating 2D-3D feature distillation, 2) a superpoint constructor featuring progressively growing superpoints, and 3) a semantic primitive constructor with an additional growing strategy. The key to our method is the superpoint constructor together with the progressive growing strategy on both super points and semantic primitives, driving the feature extractor to progressively learn similar features for 3D points belonging to the same semantic class. We extensively evaluate our method on five challenging indoor and outdoor datasets, demonstrating state of-the-art performance over all unsupervised baselines. We hope our work could inspire more advanced methods for unsupervised 3D semantic learning."

It features a unique single rotary joint that enables rapid transformation into an ultranarrow profile. Although quadrotors have seen widespread adoption in applications, such as cinematography, agriculture, and disaster management, with increasingly sophisticated control systems, their hardware configurations have remained largely unchanged, limiting their capabilities in certain environments. Our design addresses this by enabling the hardware configuration to change on the fly when required. In standard flight mode, the MorphoCopter adopts an <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">X</i> configuration, functioning as a traditional quadcopter, but can quickly fold into a stacked bicopters arrangement or any configuration in between. Existing morphing designs often sacrifice controllability in compact configurations or rely on complex multijoint systems. Moreover, our design achieves a greater width reduction than any existing solution. We develop a new inertia and control-action aware adaptive control system that maintains robust performance across all rotary-joint configurations. The prototype can reduce its width from 447 to 138 mm (nearly 70% reduction) in just a few seconds. We validated the MorphoCopter through rigorous simulations and a comprehensive series of flight experiments, including robustness tests, trajectory tracking, and narrow-gap passing tests."

It is concluded that, although the algorithms identify a consistent bipartite structure in the data, this does not correspond to the predefined racial categories.

Machine learning projections are obtained for the time evolution of the indexes with the purpose of knowing in what percentage the sustainability objectives set by the 2030 United Nations agenda will be achieved by our study case Mexico. Using Pearson correlations, multiple linear approximations of the SGD index are proposed based on indexes that have a statistically significant correlation with it. Our findings suggest that indexes correlated with de SDGI can be used as predictors, thus a close monitoring of these predictor variables can give us valuable information on how the SDGI will change. Machine learning projections show us the future behavior not only of the SDGI but also of the predictor indexes that are correlated with it. Currently to evaluate progress in achieving the goals, the United Nations periodically reports the measurement of the distance to the SDG targets for various countries. However, oftentimes not enough data is provided for the indicators, which makes it difficult to establish progress towards a certain SDG. Therefore, understanding the multiple linear relationship between the SDGI and other predictive indexes might help gauge the SDGI's advancement."

    "abstract": "Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) ensures reliability in LTE and 5G but faces challenges in low-latency scenarios like URLLC, including feedback delays, signaling errors, retransmission overhead, and performance issues in high-mobility environments. Moreover, lost or misdecoded HARQ feedback at gNBs can cause unnecessary retransmissions, exacerbating these issues. In this paper, to address the limitations of the current HARQ feedback method, we introduced an ML-based HARQ bit predictor to reduce latency, enhance data transmission reliability and throughput in 5G and emerging 6G networks. By predicting HARQ bits, the system initiates immediate retransmissions, minimizing delays associated with traditional feedback mechanisms. The proposed method is a generalized approach that benefits 5G systems using the OFDM waveform and can also be applied to technologies like OTFS, which may be used in 6G and future communications. The Machine Learning-based HARQ bit predictor is a binary classification model utilizing advanced feature selection and an optimized neural network. It exhibits near-perfect performance with rapid convergence of accuracy and loss curves, minimal misclassifications in the confusion matrix, and an almost ideal precision-recall curve. The close alignment of training and validation curves indicates no overfitting. This model’s outstanding performance in HARQ bit prediction suggests significant potential for future wireless communication systems."

This paper proposes and describes one method that reduces and generally solves such problems. It is proposed to gradually transform existing traditional petrol stations into battery stations and to apply modern electronic and information technologies in their design. Also, it is proposed that instead of electric vehicles with built-in fixed batteries, electric vehicles with replaceable batteries be used. In such vehicles, when the battery is discharged, it is replaced with a previously charged battery of the same type. So, the petrol stations are transformed into battery stations for charging or for replacing electric vehicles batteries. Also, electronic and information technologies should be used for efficient control and monitoring of battery charging, for managing and monitoring status of the entire system and for informing users about battery charging locations and available charging points at those locations. It is also proposed to maximally use solar and wind energy in such systems. The paper considers and describes the proposed method in more detail, way of implementation and application."

Existing AI-based surgical image segmentation and annotation are insufficient and complicated to meet the requirement of surgeons: What’s next? In this article, by collaborating computer researchers and surgeons, we designed and implemented a new system named SurgAR. The system transfers surgical image segmentation and annotation results into IN information to identify the subsequent step in the surgery, socalled “snipe point”. The decision-making process for determining the “snipe point” is grounded in the expert knowledge accumulated by highly experienced senior surgeons. This system combined three importance dimensions of endoscopic surgery: time information of the surgical procedures, space information of the anatomical landmarks from surgical images segmentation, and 3D reconstruction registration based on the experience. SurgAR can overlay “snipe point” on the real surgical video stream and through head-mounted Augmented Reality (AR) device to assist surgeons."

    "abstract": "Diabetic Retinopathy affects 103.12 million people annually, with the number expected to climb to 191.0 million by 2030. Unfortunately, this issue disproportionately impacts those in low-resource regions, where 90% of all blindness occurs due to minimal basic eye care systems. Here, we propose an all-in-one non-mydriatic fundus camera integrated with a three-step machine learning pipeline designed for automatic diagnosis. The fundus capture system is powered by a Raspberry Pi connected to a camera module, 2 LEDs for fundus illumination, and an ophthalmic lens for magnification. We solely utilized off-the-shelf components to ensure that our device remained low-cost and accessible to all. Our machine learning pipeline consists of three key components. First, a Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network was fine-tuned for retinal images to enhance image quality. Second, an ensemble model was developed by combining DenseNet121, InceptionV3, and MobileNetV2 models, rigorously testing and fine-tuning these pre-trained models to achieve optimal performance. Finally, we implemented a YOLOv8 Object Detection model to identify and draw bounding boxes around potential lesions in the fundus, improving AI explainability. Ultimately, our ensemble model achieved an impressive accuracy of 95.2%, surpassing many current benchmarks. This system, costing under ${\\$} 100$, has the potential to bridge the gap in global eye care inequality, offering a cost-effective and accessible solution for early detection and diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy in underserved regions."

    "abstract": "To address the body defect issues existing in the automobile factory assembly process, current detection technologies still suffer from limitations such as restricted detection accuracy, high false detection rates in defect classification, great difficulties in small defect recognition, and low detection efficiency. This paper proposes an improved automobile body defect detection algorithm based on the YOLOv11s architecture, named EDD4-YOLOv11.On the basis of the original YOLOv11s model, firstly, the C3K2 modules in the backbone and neck parts are replaced with C3K2-EIEM modules. By virtue of the dynamic attention and cross-scale interaction capabilities of C3K2-EIEM, the characterization of defect features is enhanced. Secondly, in the detection head part, the original detection head is replaced with the high-performance Dyhead detection head. The ability of Dyhead to dynamically adapt to multi-scale targets complements that of EIEM, jointly improving the accuracy of capturing multi-scale defects. Finally, to achieve lightweight design, the standard convolutions inside Dyhead are replaced with DCNv4 (Deformable Convolutional Network v4). This modification reduces computational complexity and parameter scale while ensuring detection accuracy, facilitating edge deployment on embedded devices.Experimental results show that compared with the original YOLOv11s algorithm, the improved EDD4-YOLOv11 algorithm increases precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP) by 1.7%, 2.4%, and 3.9% respectively, further enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of automobile body defect detection."

Unlike conventional coherent approaches that rely on precise synchronization and continuous feedback to emulate MISO systems, our method leverages standardized 5G NR pilot symbols and statistical detection to enable reliable distributed transmission. The receiver estimates channel magnitude, as well as phase and frequency offsets, using maximum likelihood estimation, and performs symbol detection through a likelihood ratio test framework. Simulation results under 5G channel conditions show that the proposed receiver design remains effective under offset-induced interference and achieves reliable performance in an NCDT system without feedback and synchronization."

    "abstract": "Error-correcting codes play a central role in digital communication, ensuring that transmitted information can be accurately reconstructed despite channel impairments. Recently, autoencoder (AE)-based approaches have gained attention for the end-to-end design of communication systems, offering a datadriven alternative to conventional coding schemes. However, enforcing binary codewords within differentiable AE architectures remains difficult, as discretization breaks gradient flow and often leads to unstable convergence. To overcome this limitation, a simplified two-stage training procedure is proposed, consisting of a continuous pretraining phase followed by direct binarization and fine-tuning without gradient approximation techniques. For the (7,4) block configuration over a binary symmetric channel (BSC), the learned encoder-decoder pair learns a rotated version (coset code) of the optimal Hamming code, naturally recovering its linear and distance properties and thereby achieving the same block error rate (BLER) with maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding. These results indicate that compact AE architectures can effectively learn structured, algebraically optimal binary codes through stable and straightforward training."

However, to address the intermittent nature of these renewable resources, efficient and robust control is required for the hybrid energy storage system (HESS) in DCMGs.

The performance of the proposed controller is examined using MATLAB simulations, ensuring power balance in the system and tight regulation of the DC bus voltage amid solar intermittency and load demand variations. The superiority of the proposed controller is established through comparison with Lyapunov function control (LFC) and integral backstepping sliding mode control (IBSSMC), demonstrating an enhanced dynamic response with the fastest settling time of 7 ms (LFC: 120 ms, IBS-SMC: 20 ms), the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0029 V (LFC: 1.138 V, IBS-SMC: 0.0034 V), and the absence of chattering."

The Australian Federal Government supports this shift by aiming for stable electricity prices, supply security, and a cleaner energy sector. However, renewable energy integration complicates voltage control in distribution networks. Maintaining voltage within limits is a key responsibility of utilities, influenced by system design, operational methods, loads, and now decentralized sources like solar PV. This paper explores the use of distributed static synchronous compensators (dSTATCOM) and battery energy storage (BES) to manage voltage and reduce peak demand. A voltage regulation strategy using both technologies is developed, with optimal placement determined by a differential evolution algorithm. Simulations are performed on a low-voltage rural distribution feeder in Central Queensland, Australia.

    "abstract": "Solar home systems and centralised solar microgrids have traditionally been utilised to electrify offgrid communities. However, in these systems, maximum energy utilization is a challenge due to (a) limited storage (due to cost constraints) and (b) mismatch between energy production and usage. Decentralized solar-powered microgrids (DSMGs) with household generation and storage offer a clean and reliable solution to deliver electricity in off-grid areas. This paper evaluates DSMGs and presents a forecast-based energy management strategy for a DSMG consisting of interconnected houses with individual solar generation and storage. Each house can act as a prosumer (ability to share power with others) in the grid. Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, day-ahead forecasts of solar generation and load demand along with battery energy storage system (BESS) parameters are fed into an optimization framework that manages how energy is stored, consumed, or shared. The goal is to maximize the use of solar energy while keeping BESS usage within allowable limits. The developed framework is tested using practical data from an off-grid deployment with four interconnected houses. The results show that the proposed approach increases overall <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{P V}$</tex> utilization by 9.47 %, with individual houses achieving improvements of up to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 3. 0 4 \\%}$</tex>.

Following PRISMA guidelines, this review systematically analyses studies published between 2020 and 2024, categorizing current BP measurement techniques into cuff-based, cuffless, and contactless methods. Special attention is given to emerging technologies such as photoplethysmography (PPG), electrocardiography (ECG), bioimpedance, radar sensing, and remote PPG (rPPG), as well as the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) for signal processing and BP estimation. The review evaluates the comparative performance, clinical relevance, and readiness for real-world application across modalities. While cuffless and contactless approaches show significant promise for continuous and user-friendly monitoring, their accuracy often depends on calibration, multimodal data fusion, and robust algorithm design. Ethical considerations related to unobtrusive monitoring are also discussed. This work highlights current limitations, identifies future research opportunities, and supports the development of next-generation, AI-driven BP monitoring systems suitable for both clinical and consumer use."

    "abstract": "This paper explores the application of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for enhancing image quality following the removal of additive Gaussian noise. In the first stage, image denoising is performed using fractional-order anisotropic diffusion with a resolution parameter. Fractional differentiation is applied in the Fourier domain, as is standard in the literature. However, this initial denoising stage requires empirical tuning of several parameters. To address this challenge and further improve denoising performance, an additional deep learning-based stage is introduced. The combination of these two consecutive denoising stages results in both visual and numerical improvements. Quality metrics such as PSNR and SSIM confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with notable enhancements particularly at higher noise levels."

    "abstract": "Dust accumulation on solar panels dramatically reduces their energy output, especially in remote and dry areas where water-based cleaning is not feasible. This article presents the design and execution of an intelligent, waterless self-cleaning system controlled by Arduino. A DC gear motor powers the system's revolving brushes, which are managed by a motor driver. Light, dust, rain, and ultrasonic sensors allow the system to operate independently relying completely on its surroundings. The system is powered by 12 V DC battery, which guarantees economical and environmentally friendly operation, appropriate for off-grid locations. According to experimental data, the prototype enhances captured energy by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$20-30 {\\%}$</tex> and restores up to 97% of the panel's rated output when compared to grimy panels.

Manual inspections are time-consuming and error-prone, while automated approaches enable faster and more reliable damage detection. This paper presents the application of multilevel thresholding for the segmentation of power line insulator images using two metaheuristic optimization methods: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Ant Colony Optimization for Continuous Domains (ACOR). By comparing these methods, their basic differences and effectiveness are analyzed. Two entropy-based objective functions are used to optimize thresholding: Kapur's and Otsu's criteria. On the proposed data set, the segmentation was evaluated according to the accuracy and execution time of the algorithms. The results show that the combination of PSO and Kapur's entropy criterion provides a good trade-off between accuracy and time required, which makes this method particularly suitable for high-volume inspection tasks."

    "abstract": "In this work, we introduce a novel post-quantum public key encryption scheme over integers, leveraging a hybrid approach that combines large random numbers with the Learning With Errors (LWE) system. The scheme addresses the security challenges posed by quantum computing advancements, aiming to provide a robust solution resistant to quantum-based attacks. By using the unknown random number hardness assumption with enhancements to the traditional LWE framework and operating directly on integers, this approach ensures a high level of cryptographic security while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that the proposed encryption system achieves state-of-the-art performance: encryption execution time as low as <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$2.45 \\times 10^{-5}$</tex> seconds, decryption time of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$4.47 \\times 10^{-5}$</tex> seconds, and an integrity check time of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$5.30 \\times 10^{-5}$</tex> seconds. Moreover, the ciphertext size is reduced to only 1330 bits while maintaining a 256 -bit security level, representing a significant reduction in storage requirements compared to conventional lattice-based approaches. These results confirm that our scheme not only provides strong quantum-resistant security guarantees but also delivers excellent efficiency and scalability, making it a viable candidate for secure communications in bandwidth-limited and resource-constrained environments in the quantum era."

    "abstract": "The United Arab Emirates is well-endowed with superior solar energy resources and vehicular market strength. Combining them, however, raises a key question: Might a national fleet of electric vehicles (EVs), in tandem with widescale deployment of photovoltaic (PVs) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) systems (which currently experiences an increase in market size) [11], offer sufficient nocturnal storage to offset daily renewable generation? To answer it, the study adopts a tripartite forecasting framework: (i) a logistic model of EV adoption from Norway's experience; (ii) forecasts of electricity demand from a combination of historical growth and global benchmarks; and (iii) a regression forecasting of the trends of the costs of solar PVs. The study reveals that, on current trajectories, the cumulative storage of the EVs alone will be insufficient to cover prospective loads at night even in the face of rapidly decreasing solar prices. Nonetheless, this study identifies a plethora of methods that are capable of shrinking the deficit. These range from utility-scale batteries and boosting of purchase of EVs to stimulation of demand and diversified renewable power penetration and cross-border energy collaborations. The overarching conclusion is that the conquest of renewable self-sufficiency is not a passive corollary of existing trends but a task that necessitates a combination of coordinated effort at the technological, legislative, and behavioural levels."

AAM includes on-demand air transportation services for both cargo and passengers by utilizing unmanned aerial system (UAS) or other small aircraft like electric vertical takeoff and landing (eV-TOL) vehicles. These vehicles operate within designated pathways known as \"Air Corridors.\" Air corridors are performance-based controlled airspaces where UASs adhere to specific protocols, including skylane assignment, route availability, traffic control, collision avoidance, etc. In this paper, we explore the urban air mobility (UAM) ecosystem, with an emphasis on the air corridors. We propose a novel design concept for building the infrastructure to support safe operations in the air corridors. Specifically, our proposed design entails utilizing a multi-beam subarray antenna system that can keep the UAS within the air corridor and detect malicious objects within the air corridor to avoid collision. Moreover, we present a case study to demonstrate the operation of an air corridor. Finally, we highlight the challenges involved in implementing the proposed air corridor concept."

It employs a domainagnostic ontology defining procedural semantics, compiled into a structured procedural database and a specification knowledge graph for retrieval-augmented reasoning. The dual-agent architecture—Context-Analysis-and-Scoping Agent (CASA) and Constrained-Testcase-Synthesis Agent (CTSA)—interprets SCAs or NLQs, validates functionalities through ontology-grounded databases, and synthesizes constraint-compliant sequences. Dynamic coverage databases use greedy set-cover selection and cross-impact expansion to expose cousin bugs in adjacent modules. Human-in-the-loop feedback refines ontology instantiations. Deployed locally for data-security compliance, IntelliTest was validated on commercial modem firmware (>50,000 files, >250,000 functions), achieving 95% functionality identification, 92% code-change coverage, 90% constraint satisfaction, and a five-fold reduction in generation time, shrinking regression suites by 40–60% while maintaining comprehensive coverage"

This necessitates different approaches to DRX configuration optimization. 3GPP is studying artificial intelligence-based machine learning (AI-ML) techniques to address the above issue and has recently shown robustness and efficiency compared to classical approaches. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based framework to optimize the DRX configuration. The proposed method determines the optimal DRX configuration for different types of network traffic while meeting the key performance objectives."

    "abstract": "Accurate indoor localization is prominent in enabling seamless connectivity and context-aware applications across smart buildings, healthcare, robotics, and industrial IoT environments. However, the traditional methods and datasets, such as RSSI datasets, struggle in complex indoor environments where SNR, doppler effects, and non-line of sight (NLoS) conditions dominate. Further, CSI datasets for indoor localization methods captured important features but did not consider required environment-aware characteristics and lacked ultra-precise localization. We proposed a novel CSI dataset DenseLoc, captured at the 3.5 GHz mid-band frequency to address complex indoor localization challenges in a 2.5D space where the z axis was kept constant. The dataset was developed across five realistic scenarios designed to be environment-aware, spanning line of sight (LoS), NLoS, and mixed visibility conditions. A customized GNU Radio with USRP 2953R’s based framework extracts rich signal features, focusing on spectral correlation function (SCF)-based cyclostationary sensing, which robustly distinguishes LoS/NLoS environments. Moreover, we introduce the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)-based data augmentation technique that enhances the dataset’s diversity while preserving spatial continuity. The dataset was tested on our Deep MLP model, in which we achieved millimeter-level 2.5D localization accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and establishing a new benchmark for precise indoor localization."

    "abstract": "We present a novel fusion algorithm that enhances vehicular perception in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) networks. Traditional fusion methods face significant implementation challenges since these networks have limited available bandwidth for data transmission. Although intermediate-layer processing reduces overall message size, compatibility is often limited to vehicles operating under application-or platform-specific standardization. Due to these transmission and implementation issues, we have developed a novel system that uses raw-level positional telemetry data to generate global perception maps. We combine data pipelines and transformation matrices with Kalman Filtering techniques to generate a dynamic, unified representation of a multi-vehicle environment. Our algorithm increases detection precision by over 21 percent for the overall perception system and by over 59 percent when measured on a median-per-grid basis across various detection scenes and network delays for different sample sizes. This mechanism permits the efficient transmission of essential information while maintaining the integrity of perception and tracking processes. We improve upon existing methodologies in multi-vehicle environments and complex traffic scenarios by enhancing performance under challenging network conditions. Our work provides foundational support for systems related to cooperative perception, autonomous driving, and safety-critical maneuvering by enabling robust data fusion. This is essential for developing vehicular autonomy at scale and supporting network operations for ground-level V2X infrastructure."

    "abstract": "The subject of mMIMO has gained considerable importance because of its capability to enhance the system’s performance while minimizing the need for transmission power. In 5G frequency division duplex (FDD) systems, the feedback from the downlink channel state information (CSI) is sent by user equipment (UE) to the base station (BS), significantly increasing network throughput. However, in massive MIMO systems, CSI feedback is required by all BSs, which increases transmission overhead and latency. This paper presents deep learning-based techniques for CSI prediction in the uplink, offering a thorough evaluation of these techniques in the massive MIMO architecture that can be implemented in 5G and beyond-5G networks. It also outlines notable research gaps, persistent challenges, and potential research areas, highlighting the critical urgency for further advanced deep learning patterns and new technologies to support the effectiveness of Channel State Information forecasting. This study 21.8% increase in inference rate along with a 43% decrease in memory consumption, while a 63% rise in Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE) shows the trade-off in balancing accuracy and efficiency."

    "abstract": "In domestic environments, most users lack access to detailed, real-time data on their electricity consumption. This limitation hinders their ability to make informed decisions that promote energy efficiency and cost savings. Existing utility tools typically present historical consumption data in static formats, making identifying specific usage patterns or high-consumption devices challenging. Furthermore, the lack of visual and accessible digital interfaces in this area prevents users, especially those without technical knowledge, from understanding their energy consumption. To address this problem, we present Power Track, an interactive, user-centric system designed to monitor, control, and visualize real-time domestic energy consumption. The platform integrates sensors, ESP32 microcontrollers, and Wi-Fi communication via the MQTT protocol to collect data stored in a cloud-based relational database. The system features a responsive web interface, developed with React and Node.js, that graphically displays historical and current consumption. This design fosters energy awareness and facilitates informed decision-making, encouraging sustainable consumption habits. Development followed a User-Centered Design (UCD) methodology, which included requirements specification, prototyping, and user validation to ensure usability and relevance. Power Track represents a scalable and user-friendly tool that aligns with the principles of smart cities and energy efficiency."

Each meta-element of RRIPMA can be digitally programmed to operate in either the radiation mode or the reflection mode; moreover, it can achieve 2-bit radiation phase modulation and 1-bit reflection phase modulation from 9.6 to 10.6 GHz. By applying the space-time coding method based on particle swarm optimization algorithm, RRIPMA enables flexible control of radiated and reflected waves in both space and frequency domains. A prototype of RRIPMA array was fabricated and experimentally validated, demonstrating capabilities including low-sidelobe radiated beam scanning and wide-angle reflected beam scanning. In addition, its ability to simultaneously and independently control the radiated and reflected waves at multiple harmonic frequencies has been demonstrated. It is notable that the total power consumption of the entire RRIPMA system (including its control module) is only 188 mW, showing excellent low-power feature. The RRIPMA architecture offers a promising alternative to the conventional phased arrays, enabling highly integrated, low-cost, and low-power multi-tasking systems for applications such as wireless communications and sensing."

    "abstract": "Securing the near-real-time (near-RT) control operations in Open Radio Access Networks (Open RAN) is increasingly critical, yet remains insufficiently addressed, as new runtime threats target the control loop while the system is operational. In this paper, we propose a multi-layer defence framework designed to enhance the security of near-RT RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) operations. We classify operational-time threats into three categories—message-level, data-level, and control logic-level—and design and implement a dedicated detection and mitigation component for each: a signature-based E2 message inspection module performing structural and semantic validation of signalling exchanges, a telemetry poisoning detector based on temporal anomaly scoring using an LSTM network, and a runtime xApp attestation mechanism based on an execution-time hash challenge–response. The framework is evaluated on an Open RAN testbed comprising FlexRIC and a commercial RAN emulator, demonstrating effective detection rates, low latency overheads, and practical integration feasibility. Results indicate that the proposed safeguards can operate within near-RT time constraints while significantly improving protection against runtime attacks, introducing less than 80 ms overhead for a network with 500 User Equipment (UEs). Overall, this work lays the foundation for deployable, layered, and policy-driven runtime security architectures for the near-RT RIC control loop in Open RAN, and provides an extensible framework into which future mitigation policies and threat-specific modules can be integrated."

This article presents a topical survey and comparative analysis of the transition strategies adopted by leading cybersecurity agencies—including National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Agence Nationale de la Sécurité des Systèmes d’Information (ANSSI), Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI), Cryptography Research and Evaluation Committees (CRYPTREC), and European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA). The technical foundations of standardized PQC algorithms (Module Lattice–Key Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM), Module Lattice–Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA), Fast-Fourier Lattice-based Compact Signatures over NTRU (FALCON), and Stateless Hash-based–Digital Signature Algorithm (SLH-DSA)) are reviewed, alongside a critical examination of hybrid cryptography, crypto-agility, and strategic alignment on standards and migration principles, despite jurisdictional differences in policy enforcement. The survey highlights shared priorities, such as phased implementation, backward compatibility, and risk mitigation via hybrid adoption. To enhance analytical depth, the study introduces the Institutional–Sectoral PQC Migration Convergence Framework, linking institutional pillars to sectoral readiness for reproducible comparative assessment. National strategies are shown to serve as potential roadmaps for global institutions, underscoring the importance of international coordination and adaptability. These insights support the development of secure, interoperable, and future-proof cryptographic infrastructures in the quantum era, operationalized via the proposed 10-step migration playbook."

Their stringent timing requirements make it prohibitively expensive to deploy cryptographic mechanisms to ensure confidentiality and integrity of the messages exchanged. Considering the security implications of breaches in such critical infrastructure, this work analyses the benefits of using the upcoming NIST lightweight cryptography standard Ascon to perform integrity protection and authenticated encryption in the context of IEC 61850 GOOSE and SV protocols. Profiling experiments on a Raspberry Pi 5 edge computing device demonstrate that an Ascon-based implementation achieves a two-fold speed-up compared to a traditional AES-based implementation. Our study shows that Ascon can be considered as a viable option for fast lightweight cryptography to secure latency-critical message payloads communicated in substation networks."

Its practical use is limited by the weak intrinsic nonlinearity of most optical platforms. We address this limitation in a coupled-cavity architecture by engineering two-photon dissipation as a control resource rather than a detrimental loss. Within a quantum-master-equation framework, we model single-photon loss, engineered two-photon decay, and pure dephasing, and analyze their joint impact on the steady-state statistics of the driven cavities. We track the zero-delay correlation, photon populations, and detuning/drive dependences under distinct driving schemes (both cavities driven vs. single-cavity drive with. The results show that adding two-photon dissipation (i) suppresses multiphoton occupation and strengthens antibunching, (ii) broadens the operating window in detuning and drive amplitude, and (iii) improves robustness against moderate dephasing and device imperfections. A mechanism analysis attributes these gains to interference between coherent second-order processes and dissipative selection that stabilizes the odd-photon manifold. The study yields design guidelines for realizing stable, cavity-based single-photon sources using dissipation engineering."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of smart community systems, optimizing data transmission has become essential for improving community management and overall system efficiency. Static associations between devices and community access points often result in excessive workloads, low resource utilization, and uneven data distribution, especially during peak usage periods. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Preference-aware Data Segmentation and Scheduling method for community networks. The method includes three stages. First, a segmentation strategy divides large data packets into smaller parallel units for efficient allocation. Second, a preference list-based scheduling mechanism evaluates access points according to transmission speed, latency, and available capacity. Third, a preference-driven matching process assigns data units to the most suitable access points. Extensive simulations were performed under varying user loads and device densities. The results show that the proposed method reduces data transmission latency compared with traditional static strategies and baseline approaches. Resource utilization of community access points is improved, and load distribution across access points is more balanced. These findings indicate that the method effectively enhances efficiency, resource utilization, and load distribution, providing a practical solution for data transmission optimization in smart community networks."

Zero Touch Network (ZTN) management has emerged as a key approach to automating network operations, minimizing manual intervention, and improving service reliability. Digital Twin (DT) creates a virtual representation of the physical network in real-time, allowing continuous monitoring, predictive analytics, and intelligent decision-making by simulating what-if scenarios. This paper integrates DT with ZTN proactive bandwidth management in end-to-end (E2E) next-generation networks. The integrated architecture applies Few-Shot Learning (FSL) to a memory-augmented Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) model to predict a new network state to augment the known and trained states. Using Q-learning, it determines the optimal action (e.g. traffic shaping) under varying network conditions such that user Quality of Service (QoS) requirements are met. Three scenarios have been considered: 1) normal ZTN operation with closed-loop control, 2) a what-if scenario of DT, and 3) network state unknown to DT. The simulation results show that the network can adapt to underlying changing conditions. The ZTN assisted by DT achieves only 0. 18% deviation from the no bandwidth variation scenario."

At the same time, indoor air quality (IAQ) influences cognition, comfort, and health - typically managed by limiting CO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> concentrations below regulatory or de-facto thresholds. Traditional timetable-based or rule-based ventilation struggles to track rapidly varying occupancy, causing IAQ excursions and energy waste. Leveraging IoT sensors and CCTV analytics to obtain real-time occupancy signals to correlate with indoor environment variables, together with predictive control, enables proactive ventilation that better balances IAQ and energy. This paper presents a novel occupancy-aware predictive HVAC framework that fuses real-time occupant estimates from CCTV analytics with a disturbance-aware ARX model for CO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> concentration (recursively identified from measured data), along with a real-time, energy-aware MPC scheme. The MPC includes a cubic-law fan power model and a dynamic minimum-ventilation constraint derived from static designed occupancy (per-area and per-person outdoor-air requirements) and zonal airflow characteristics. Using measured hourly occupancy estimates and CO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> data from the Net Zero Industry Innovation Centre (NZIIC) in Middlesbrough, UK, we identify an accurate ARX(2,2) model and use it in Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) experiments to validate the approach. Results demonstrate that the controller varies airflow predictively and in step with occupancy, maintaining optimal Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) well under a 1000 ppm limit, while substantially reducing fan energy requirement by 85% versus a static preprogrammed ventilation strategy designed for average designed daytime occupancy with night setback as a comparative baseline."

This paper introduces a machine learning-based approach, leveraging the TabTransformer model, to accurately forecast the throughput of a Basic Service Set (BSS) in IEEE 802.11 networks. Instead of relying on time-consuming field measurements, we use Komondor—a robust network simulator—to generate diverse deployment scenarios, enabling efficient training of our predictive model. Our results demonstrate that TabTransformers can capture complex feature interactions in tabular WLAN data and offer strong predictive performance across varying conditions. This proactive prediction capability can significantly enhance real-time network design and resource allocation."

    "abstract": "Anisotropic Magnetoresistance (AMR) angle sensors are widely utilized in industrial applications owing to their non-contact operation, cost efficiency, and miniaturization potential. However, harmonic distortion inherent in AMR measurements fundamentally limits angle encoder accuracy. This work introduces a high-precision AMR sensor employing a wave-type topology that suppresses harmonic errors through geometric innovation, demonstrating significant performance enhancements versus conventional strip-type sensors: 64.3% reduction in maximum angular error (0.50° vs. 1.4°), 65.3% lower worst-case nonlinearity (0.2% vs. 0.576%), and minimal change in repeatability (0.14° vs. 0.137°). Systematic evaluation of dynamic responses under variable field angles through Stoner–Wohlfarth modeling and experimental validation exhibits excellent agreement, confirming curvature optimization effectively minimizes angular errors. Mechanistic analysis identifies demagnetizing fields and induced anisotropy as dominant error sources. Crucially, this architecture maintains fabrication simplicity, demonstrating exceptional cost-performance synergy for automotive, robotics, and industrial automation applications requiring sub-0.5° accuracy."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a radar-centric framework for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) that utilizes affine frequency-division multiplexing (AFDM). We propose chirp-domain index modulation (CDIM) as a method to embed data without compromising radar performance. In this method, each AFDM block is assembled using a pair of predetermined chirp coefficients chosen from a radar-compliant lookup table. These chirp pairs are equivalent in terms of ambiguity, meaning that the embedded communication symbols preserve the radar’s correlation properties and compactness of ambiguity. The suggested AFDM-IM waveform maintains a constant signal envelope and performs matched filtering for high-resolution range-Doppler estimation. Chirp selection embeds communication data structurally, rather than using traditional amplitude or phase modulation. This enables the receiver to detect the index with low complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that AFDM-IM can estimate radar signals even when transmitted over doubly dispersive channels and can also efficiently send modest amounts of data. The proposed framework strikes a good balance between sensing fidelity and communication throughput, making it a viable choice for next-generation ISAC systems."

    "abstract": "This paper reports the first dual-principle microwave displacement sensor, capable of operating in either frequency-shift or single-frequency amplitude-variation mode, thereby offering unprecedented flexibility for displacement measurement. The sensor consists of a metallic strip printed on a high-permittivity circular dielectric slab, forming a cylindrical dielectric resonator (CDR) positioned between two parallel microstrip transmission lines. A key feature is that the operating mode is selected simply by changing the orientation of the resonator relative to the feedlines, enabling effortless reconfiguration. In the frequency-shift mode (strip perpendicular to the feed lines), displacement is detected through variations in open-stub lengths on the feedlines, achieving 40 MHz/mm sensitivity over a 0–40 mm range. In the amplitude-variation mode (strip parallel to the feedlines), two resonances- strip and dielectric-resonator modes- are exploited, yielding sensitivities of 2 dB/mm (0–12 mm) and 1 dB/mm (0–17 mm), respectively. The sensor further exhibits a wide dynamic range in swept-frequency operation and simultaneous multi-resonance detection in fixed-frequency mode, with high agreement between simulations and measurements. The proposed design introduces a new class of reconfigurable resonator-based displacement sensors with strong potential for robotics, industrial automation, structural health monitoring, and aerospace vibration detection."

Given this, the usage of machine learning has become popular, including artificial neural networks and also convolutional neural networks. However, such models are usually handcrafted and not optimized. Therefore, this paper proposes to perform software requirements classification using a neuroevolved convolutional neural network using an adapted version of the genetic algorithm named DeepGA. A sevenclass software requirements dataset is used in the experiments. The results suggest that the neuroevolutionary process improves the classification capabilities of the deep neural networks even in unbalanced scenarios."

In 2021, the Universidad Veracruzana implemented a hybrid learning model as a strategy for the safe return to both face-to-face and virtual class, utilizing hybrid classrooms and its learning management system (LMS) known as EMINUS. The objective of the study was to analyze students' satisfaction with the LMS in the hybrid context, assessing its usefulness in the teaching-learning process. The study employed a quantitative approach, with a descriptive and longitudinal design, using a properly validated instrument divided into dimensions related to the LMS, the hybrid modality, communication, and technological infrastructure. Students expressed a favorable perception regarding the functionality, accessibility, and ease of use of the LMS, as well the instructional design and communication with the hybrid modality. However, areas for improvement were identified in aspects such as training in the use of the platform and the performance of hybrid classroom. It is concluded that the LMS is valued as a key resource for hybrid learning. Student satisfaction is influenced by instructional planning and teacher support, although technical and training challenges persist. The research provides empirical evidence on the student experience with an LMS in a hybrid modality, offering a reference point for the design of educational improvement strategies in similar contexts."

On the other hand, optical and optoelectronic methods are non-contact and telemetric, making them attractive alternatives under specific conditions. In this research, the adaptive photodetection method, based on the non-stationary photoelectromotive force (P-EMF) effect with optical speckle patterns was performed on three metallic materials, for mechanical vibrations detection and natural frequency characterization. Experimental results obtained with speckle P-EMF tests were compared and discussed with contact methods."

    "abstract": "Due to the fragile and limited skin of newborns and premature babies, traditional electrocardiograms require longterm skin contact. At the same time, photovolume change technology is susceptible to sweating and interference from ambient light, which is not conducive to long-term monitoring. Although millimeter-wave radar (mmWave Radar) offers the advantage of non-contact measurement, most studies employ single-layer filtering, which does not fully align with the characteristics of ECG PQRST waves, thereby limiting its clinical applications. In this study, an improved composite filtering method is proposed to align the mmWave Radar heart rhythm waveform more closely with the ECG RR interval graph, thereby enhancing the accuracy of heart rhythm calculation. The system collected data from 20 test subjects. It used three methods: bandpass filtering (BPF), wavelet noise reduction (WD), and matching filtering (MF) to combine them into seven filtering schemes for comparison IWR6843AOPEVM. Through multidimensional similarity index (MSRI) analysis, combined with dynamic time warping (DTW) distance, spectral coherence, and sample entropy similarity, the results showed that the BPF+WD combination had the best effect. After recalculating the $\\mathbf{R R}$ interval, the difference between the mmWave radar heart rate and the ECG was approximately one beat per minute (BPM), with an accuracy rate of 98.57%. These findings provide a reference for improving non-contact heart rhythm monitoring and may support the future clinical adoption of mmWave Radar."

    "abstract": "In modern SD-WAN architectures, maintaining the health of transport tunnels is essential for supporting high quality audio and video streams. Most SD-WAN solutions require customers to manually configure the tunnel health probing protocol (THPP) probe frequency, yet offer no clear guidance for determining an optimal value. Motivated by this research gap we propose a novel framework called tactical assessment-based SD-WAN control (TASC). TASC dynamically adjusts THPP probe frequency based on a real time assessment of network conditions using topology-agnostic parameters, including the mainstream traffic’s effective available bandwidth (EABW), bandwidth utilization (BWU), queue service rate (QSR), THPP’s one-way delay (OWD), CPU utilization, and operational status. Further, these parameters have been used to compute a novel Mainstream Traffic Health (MTH) score. Unlike static approaches, TASC applies positive weights to reinforce factors that promote tunnel stability and negative weights to those that indicate degradation. Experimental results demonstrate that TASC significantly outperforms traditional SD-WAN."

    "abstract": "Maritime domain awareness increasingly relies on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. Yet, traditional monolithic backends struggle to scale with rising message volumes and offer limited resilience, data sovereignty, or rapid deployability. This study addresses the challenges by introducing a novel federated learning and microservices architecture for distributed vessel tracking. Each end node trains local models on a proprietary AIS Maritime environment via Dockerized microservices: Data Pre-Processor, Client Trainer, Aggregator, Global Model Updater, and XAI Service, enabling independent scaling, fault isolation, and federated governance without exposing raw feeds. A global model is aggregated using FedAvg and served with a sub-second latency of 10 ms of aggregation and 406 ms of inference. Experimental evaluation on four benchmark AIS snapshots yields strong predictive performance (MAE = 0.31, RMSE = 0.39, R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> = 0.78) and demonstrates transparent feature attribution via SHAP. These results validate the proposed architecture’s capability to deliver accurate, low-latency energy predictions while preserving data sovereignty and cross-node consistency. This study lays the foundation for robust, interoperable maritime analytics by bridging microservice agility with federated intelligence and XAI."

    "abstract": "Underwater communication is constrained by limited bandwidth, high latency, and signal attenuation, particularly in acoustic transmission scenarios. To address these challenges, this paper investigates a simulation-based framework for underwater image transmission using discrete cosine transform (DCT) and quantization-based compression. Grayscale images are compressed at varying quantization levels (3-bit to 8-bit) and transmitted over a simulated underwater acoustic channel with relay-based attenuation and noise. The impact of compression on image fidelity is evaluated using Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio and Structural Similarity Index (PSNR, SSIM), while object detection robustness is assessed via classification accuracy using a MobileNetV2 model. Experimental results demonstrate a clear trade-off between compression efficiency and detection accuracy, offering insights into optimal quantization strategies for bandwidth-limited underwater environments. This simulation framework, developed entirely in MATLAB, provides a scalable testbed for evaluating vision-centric Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) applications prior to real-world deployment on resource-constrained devices."

    "abstract": "Sixth Generation (6G) and beyond networks present challenges in managing quality of service (QoS) of diverse applications and meeting Service Level Agreements (SLAs) under varying network conditions. Hence, network management needs automation using machine Learning (ML) and artificial Intelligence (AI) to meet real-time requirements. Zero touch network (ZTN) is one of the frameworks to automate network management with mechanisms, such as, closed loop control to ensure that the goals are met perpetually. Intent-Based Networking (IBN) specifies the user intents with diverse network requirements which are then translated into specific network configurations and actions. This paper presents a novel architecture for integrating IBN and ZTN to serve the intent goals. Users provide the intent in natural language, e.g., English, which is then translated using natural language processing (NLP) techniques (e.g., retrieval augmented generation (RAG)) into Network Intent LanguagE (Nile). The Nile intent is passed to the BiLSTM and Q-learning based ZTN closed loop as a goal which maintains the intent under varying network conditions. The integrated architecture is also implemented on a testbed using OpenAirInterface (OAI). Additionally, to evaluate the architecture, an optimization problem is formulated which evaluated with Monte Carlo simulations. Results demonstrate how ZTN achieves goals set by user intent 98% of the duration. Simulation and testbed results are compared which show similar trend. Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for Quality of Experience (QoE) is also measured to indicate satisfaction of user intent."

We therefore address this gap by developing a controlled pipeline where we freeze operating points on validation and apply them unchanged to the test set in order to measure the impact of pretraining. Our results show significant improvements in the left tail of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) against randomly initialized baseline. Additionally, within pretrained model variants, increase in the number of pretraining steps had the most impact when more labeled data were available for fine-tuning."

This paper aims to fill that gap by demonstrating the integration of these technologies applied to spatial data in order to analyze tourist movement patterns. Spatial data processing was performed using QGIS (Quantum Geographic Information System), an open-source Geographic Information System (GIS), while Python was used to apply clustering algorithms on the data points. The resulting insights are visualized clearly through Power BI dashboards for better interpretability. This approach allows for understanding the relationship between tourists' routes and the proximity of hotels and museums. By combining AI, BI, and spatial data, more effective tourism planning can be achieved, helping to maintain well-organized and sustainable destinations."

    "abstract": "As radio access networks (RAN) are being deployed over cloud-based platforms for several benefits, it is essential to understand the difference between the execution of the RAN software workloads when presented to these platforms built around general-purpose processors (GPP) and those built using specialized DSP architectures. Hard real-time guarantees, which the RAN software demands, are different from traditional applications that are hosted on public and on-premise cloud platforms. To meet these requirements, several techniques are employed, ranging from manipulation of cache lines to restricting the processor performance states, which try to asymptotically meet the real-time requirements. While there are enough studies on processor scheduling, the aspect of scheduling RAN software on a multicore GPP platform is limited. Hence, providing limits on guarantees of performance has been overlooked. This paper describes the specific characteristics of the RAN software and formulates the scheduling problem. Heuristic solutions to the scheduling problem are presented, given different requirements for RAN workloads. The shortcomings of deploying these real-time workloads on GPP are illustrated, and conclusions about further possibilities are presented."

    "abstract": "The Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network (SAGIN) has emerged as a promising solution to bridge the digital divide by extending connectivity to users in remote and underserved regions. Within SAGIN, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites play a pivotal role in providing global coverage and reduced latency. However, the limited resources of LEO satellites make the deployment of hardware-based network functions impractical. This challenge can be addressed by Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and efficient Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) placement. However, due to the dynamic nature of satellite networks, VNF placement remains a significant challenge. Previous studies often overlook the temporal stability of satellite connectivity and lead to frequent VNF migrations and degraded service performance. To address this gap, we propose an heuristic algorithm with two phases: the Long Connectivity-Based Path Selection (LCBPS) phase to identify paths with longer satellite connectivity durations and the Long Connectivity-Based VNF Placement with VNF Sharing (LCBVPVS) phase that leverages both long-connectivity-based VNF placement and VNF sharing to reduce deployment time and cost. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approach in terms of longer connectivity duration, more than 35% of service acceptance rate and less than 50% to 60% of end-to-end delay in dynamic satellite networks."

    "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) products are now extensively deployed and play a significant role in the daily lives of individuals. The increasing adoption of IoT applications generates numerous computationally intensive tasks. However, they are unable to perform these tasks locally due to their limited battery life, storage capacity, and processing power. To solve this, multi access edge computing (MEC) servers are required to handle computationally intensive tasks. In addition, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) approaches are suggested as a solution to the issue caused by the constraints of wireless transmission resources. However, when the direct connections between the base station and the IoT devices are obstructed, intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) are introduced to offload the tasks. This study examines the performance of an IRS assisted NOMA-MEC for IoT networks under Rayleigh fading. To assess the performance of the proposed system, the closed form formula for delay outage probability (DOP) is derived. According to simulation data, the proposed design minimizes DOP by ≈0.5309 compared to NOMA-MEC at SNR =14dB."

    "abstract": "The increasing complexity of modern antenna systems demands flexible measurement solutions that overcome the limitations of conventional setups, particularly regarding advanced sampling schemes and portability. Robotic arm-based systems have emerged as a key option for implementing advanced antenna measurement techniques due to their flexibility. However, these systems face challenges such as positioning errors and restricted range of motion, which limit the size of the acquisition surfaces. This work presents a portable antenna measurement system that integrates a collaborative robot (cobot) mounted on a mobile platform with an Optical Tracking System (OTS) for in situ antenna characterization. To address the range of motion limitations, a composite plane technique is introduced, enabling the combination of individual measurement surfaces into a larger composite surface. These individual surfaces are acquired after manually repositioning the mobile platform, relying on the OTS data for precise alignment and compensation for probe displacements. The proposed system features a simple calibration procedure and post-processing techniques to correct positioning errors without requiring complex robot calibrations or additional hardware. The system has been experimentally validated through measurements in the X- and V-bands, demonstrating good results and highlighting its effectiveness, accuracy, and adaptability for advanced in situ antenna measurements."

    "abstract": "Cooperative positioning enhances localization accuracy in intelligent artifact swarms through shared measurements, especially in environments such as urban canyons or disaster zones. Dynamic topologies, heterogeneous measurements, and scalability demands create complex challenges for state estimation. This paper introduces MRCA, the first comprehensive framework unifying heterogeneous measurements, reasoning processes, environment cognition, and scenario-based applications for cooperative positioning. The four-layer architecture comprises: i) the Measurement block converts signals into measurement parameters in a standard format independent of sensor types and measurement methods; ii) the Reasoning block uncovers the underlying principles of state transition using a four reasoning elements; iii) the Cognition block underscores the importance of node-environment interactions by identifying new valid radiation sources and verifying the ongoing validity of existing ones; iv) the Application block offers users task-driven cooperative positioning services, like execute potential navigation actions. Our proposed framework demonstrates performance improvements in various key metrics compared to legacy swarm positioning algorithms. Focusing on the framework itself, we employ the most basic algorithms within each block, and the experimental results are as follows: In scenarios featuring static unknown anchors, sparse perception, and collision interference, MRCA reduces cumulative positioning error by over 51% for dead-reckoning and 39% for traditional distributed cooperative positioning, while reducing average orientation error by over 31% and 27%, respectively.

The design reduces the required power rating of all the DVR's components significantly. A stator voltage control scheme is proposed to ensure voltage support under symmetrical fault conditions. The performance of the proposed topology was evaluated using PSCAD/EMTDC and compared with the conventional DVR voltage restoration circuit. The results confirm that the proposed scheme successfully maintains the stator voltage at pre-fault levels while utilizing a substantially lower-rated DVR."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes reliable time-synchronization sequence for secure data transmission over voice channels. We propose and evaluate a compact synchronization preamble derived from the eCall emergency standard, specifically optimized for OFDM-based speech-like signals transmitted through nonlinear voice channel processing. The preamble employs overlapping pseudo-noise sequences with intentional polarity changes to maintain detection robustness while minimizing overhead. Through extensive testing across diverse real-world environ-ments-including 3G networks, all AMR codec compression modes, and VoIP platforms (Signal, Telegram)-our detection algorithm demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving 100% synchronization success in most scenarios, despite significant signal degradation. The detection maintains reliability even under substantial amplitude attenuation and partial signal loss, while automatically detecting and compensating for channel-induced polarity inversion. This work provides a practical synchronization framework that enables robust real-time communication while preserving the speech-like characteristics necessary for seamless transmission through voice channels."

    "abstract": "Service restoration is crucial for the operation of smart distribution grids during emergency conditions. Self-healing capable microgrids, employing remotely controlled switches and distributed generation, make distribution networks resilient against extreme events by restoring the out-of-service loads. This paper proposes the first application of a recent aphid-ant mutualism (AAM) algorithm with an adaptive exploration-exploitation balance. The AAM algorithm efficiently navigates the highly combinatorial nonconvex solution space to maximize the service restoration of out-of-service loads while satisfying operational constraints. To tackle the key challenge of maintaining a radial topology in subsequent microgrids, this paper proposes a novel graph theory-based heuristic involving a concept of connected components and subgraphs to produce radial configurations. The proposed heuristic repairs the non-radial topologies during the position update process of metaheuristics without limiting the solution space. Case studies on an IEEE 33-bus system under multiple faults indicate that the load restored with switches on all lines is 33 % more than with switches on selected lines."

    "abstract": "The ocean provides a vast and sustainable energy reserve capable of powering autonomous networks and distributed sensors in marine environments. Efficient exploitation of this resource is crucial to reduce carbon emissions, enhance scientific exploration, and support coastal surveillance operations. Hybrid nanogenerators—combining triboelectric, piezoelectric, electromagnetic, and thermoelectric mechanisms—have emerged as promising technologies for harvesting wave and current energy while simultaneously functioning as self-powered sensors. Their versatility and cost-effectiveness make them attractive for large-scale deployment, although challenges such as corrosion, biofouling, dielectric degradation, and mechanical fatigue must be addressed to ensure long-term performance. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of recent progress in the structural design, material engineering, and hybrid configurations of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) for marine energy harvesting. Special emphasis is placed on the integration of smart polymeric materials and device architectures optimized for harsh oceanic environments. Finally, we provide a forward-looking perspective on the opportunities of TENG-based self-powered sensors within marine IoT frameworks, highlighting their strategic role in advancing blue energy technologies and enabling autonomous monitoring systems."

Yet their performance varies markedly across provinces, industries and years, and single-factor explanations fail to capture the complex causal recipes. Integrating the Strategy Tripod Perspective with configuration theory, this study pioneers the use of dynamic Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) to examine panel data (2021-2024) of 356 innovation consortia that include listed firms, thereby capturing the temporal evolution of causal configurations. Drawing on multi-source databases, we test the configurational effects of three-dimensional antecedents-resources, industry and institutions. Four equifinal pathways to high-performing consortia are identified: (1) institutional synergy and innovation-resource integration, (2)industry-transition orientation, (3)high-level talent traction, and(4)multi-dimensional resource endowment. No single condition is necessary; instead, high performance requires multifactor alignment. Intellectual-property protection and scientific human capital constitute core conditions, while the importance of industrial-cluster advantages increases with policies such as the“chain-master” system. By overcoming the“net-effect” limitation of traditional regressions, the study offers theoretical insights and policy tools for governments to design differentiated and precision support schemes."

In this study, we investigated the effect of multiple types of neural plasticity, such as spike-time-dependent plasticity (STDP) and synaptic scaling, on the learning in a winner-take-all (WTA) network composed of spiking neurons. We implemented a WTA network with multiple types of neural plasticity using Python. The MNIST and the Fashion-MNIST datasets were used for training and testing. We varied the number of neurons, the time constant of STDP, and the normalization method used in synaptic scaling to compare classification accuracy. The results demonstrated that synaptic scaling based on the $\\mathbf{L 2}$ norm was the most effective in improving classification performance. By implementing L2-normbased synaptic scaling and setting the number of neurons in both excitatory and inhibitory layers to 400, the network achieved classification accuracies of 88.84% on the MNIST dataset and 68.01% on the Fashion-MNIST dataset after one epoch of training."

In addition, the interactions and relationships among the 3D printing and Gamma irradiation parameters are also examined and modelled. For this purpose, type-1 fuzzy logic systems (T1FLSs) are established to extract and linguistically represent these relationships before and after irradiation. Such systems allow users to predict the mechanical properties of 3D printed parts before and after irradiation Validated on a real set of experimental data conducted according to the Taguchi L9 orthogonal array, the T1FLSs can successfully predict the mechanical properties with significant performance measures."

In this study, an analytical normalization factor is proposed to correct the inaccurate field values (amplitudes and magnitudes) at resonance frequencies caused by the FDTD spatial discretization. This factor is derived from the identity of the Dirac delta function. The correction is applied using uniform, Type I, II, III, and Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto (CGL) grids for a three-dimensional (3D) rectangular resonator problem. The numerical results are validated against an exact analytical time domain solution. The proposed correction operation is found to be effective across various grid types."

This response is governed by both soil ionization and frequency-dependent properties. Previous studies often faced challenges in accurately modeling soil ionization and validations limited to experimental currents featuring either short wavefronts or high amplitudes. This paper proposes a transient model for a grid-type grounding system that accounts for both soil ionization and frequency-dependent effects, solved using a Fourier transform-based time-frequency domain transformation method. By integrating layered soil modeling with an electric field-dependent soil ionization model, the approach significantly enhances computational accuracy. The model is validated under triggered lightning conditions considering a soil resistivity of 230 Ω·m, and effectively addresses both short wavefronts and high-amplitude currents, with model predictions deviating from measurements by only 3.5%."

    "abstract": "We investigate optimal resource allocation techniques for enabling coexistence between filtenna (filter with antenna) equipped multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) terrestrial networks (TNs) and passive satellite (SAT) services. We design a digital beamforming strategy that minimizes total transmit power while satisfying user-specific Quality of Service (QoS) constraints and minimizing out-of-band (OOB) interference to passive satellite receivers. By jointly optimizing the digital precoding matrix and the filtenna parameters—especially the number of varactor stages—we achieve significant suppression of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) to satellite systems. We present two case studies of RFI mitigation in the context of terrestrial base stations operating in: (i) the FR2 n258 band (24.25–27.5 GHz mmWave), focusing on protecting passive weather satellites operating at 23.8 GHz; and (ii) the proposed FR3 band (10–10.5 GHz), focusing on protecting passive Earth Exploration Satellite Service (EESS) operating at 10.6–10.7 GHz. Simulation results show that the joint precoder–filtenna design enables effective mitigation of RFI from TNs to passive SAT services, including designing for trade-offs between TNs’ QoS and RFI levels. Specifically, our results reveal that tightening the RFI-to-SAT suppression by 2 dB at 10.6–10.7 GHz and 23.8 GHz, results in an average rate loss of approximately 45 Mbps and 95 Mbps, respectively."

    "abstract": "In this paper, a non-terrestrial network (NTN) using low earth orbit (LEO) satellite as the base station and the narrowband internet of things (NB-IoT) as the wireless communication standard is considered. The user equipment (UE) in this NTN is intended to operate without the global navigation satellite system (GNSS), which in turn presents the challenge of accurately estimating the propagation delay and Doppler shift for reliable communication with the LEO satellite. A non-coherent, frequency domain synchronization method is proposed to estimate the delay (timing offset) and Doppler (frequency offset) using the downlink synchronization signal of NB-IoT, i.e., the narrowband primary synchronization signal (NPSS). It is found that the accuracy of estimation obtained by adopting the proposed algorithm meets the benchmark set by the third-generation partnership project (3GPP)s. For subsequent uplink transmissions, first for random access and then for data transmission, it is proposed that the UE pre-compensates for these offsets. It is shown that the precompensation not only helps in UE detection being successful at the random access stage using conventional algorithms used for terrestrial networks, but also results in acceptable data decoding performance."

Human evaluation of the top five generated outputs revealed that the system cannot rely solely on RAG similarity scores and that an additional rescoring mechanism is required to improve output relevance. Two automatic approaches were tested. The performance of the first one, based on atomic fact extraction combined with LLM-based scoring, did not achieve a sufficient level of accuracy. However, the second automatic approach, using a general-purpose large language model (LLM), demonstrated a strong correlation with both expert and non-expert human assessments, confirming its potential as a reliable surrogate for human evaluation."

This study uses cameras to measure driver behavior. The parameters used are body and head posture, gaze, and changes in driver expression. While driving, the driver is given cognitive tasks with certain scenarios. By implementing a one-class support vector machine (OCSVM), it was found that, in general, although each parameter tends to vary between individuals, there are significant anomalies in facial position and rotation along with driving duration, indicating driver fatigue. Meanwhile, there was a slight anomaly in body position, although subjective measurements indicated that all participants felt a higher workload after using the driving simulator."

The system combines real-time EMG biofeedback, precise current-controlled FES stimulation, and comprehensive performance analysis software to deliver personalized and adaptive therapy. SmartRehab features a dual-microcontroller architecture, enabling uniform coordination between EMG signal processing, high-voltage stimulation control, and wireless communication. The system employs an EMG biofeedback-based stimulation modulation algorithm that dynamically adjusts the current output in response to voluntary muscle activity. This promotes active patient engagement while minimizing the risk of muscle spasms. The SmartRehab Controlling and Analysis Software (CAS) provides an interactive platform for device calibration, therapy execution, real-time monitoring, and structured data management and analysis. A pilot validation study with a single healthy subject demonstrated the system’s capability for smooth, proportional stimulation control based on voluntary EMG activity. The processed EMG envelope triggered FES activation when exceeding a maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) threshold, with stimulation current amplitude modulated proportionally to the EMG signal. The system maintained stable closed-loop control during sustained contractions and ensured smooth termination of stimulation during relaxation. SmartRehab’s integrated approach enables personalized, adaptive therapy and quantitative assessment of functional recovery, paving the way for more targeted and effective stroke rehabilitation protocols."

This study investigates stability classification in SLJ by analysing the rotational movements of the lower limbs. Inertial sensors were used to collect kinematic data from 10 healthy subjects. Segment and joint angles were derived based on angular velocities in the sagittal plane. Functional principal component analysis (fPCA) was performed on two datasets: joint angles (MfPCAjoint) and segment angles (MfPCAsegment). The resulting fPCA scores were used as inputs for support vector machine classifiers. The classification accuracy was 86% for MfPCAjoint and 85% for MfPCAsegment, with MfPCAjoint also showing more consistent performance metrics. These results suggest that fPCA scores can effectively describe stability, although a larger dataset is necessary for further validation."

    "abstract": "This paper examines the integration of Big Data analytics with the Aura Blockchain platform to enhance supply chain management in the luxury goods industry. The Aura Blockchain Consortium, established in 2019-2021 by leading luxury brands including LVMH, Prada, and Cartier, provides a permissioned blockchain infrastructure for product traceability and authenticity verification. By 2025, the consortium has grown to 50+ member brands with over 50 million luxury products registered on its blockchain. This study explores how combining blockchain's immutable ledger capabilities with big data analytics techniques can yield valuable insights including end-to-end traceability, anti-counterfeiting measures, supply chain optimization, quality control, and enhanced customer engagement. The paper presents a technical architecture for integration, discusses real-world implementations such as digital product passports, and addresses challenges including data privacy, scalability, interoperability, and organizational adoption. The findings suggest that this technological convergence enables luxury brands to transition from reactive to proactive supply chain management, meeting both regulatory requirements like the EU's Digital Product Passport initiative and evolving consumer expectations for transparency and sustainability."

    "abstract": "Coordinated flight of multiple small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a key enabler for mapping, inspection, disaster response, and ad-hoc wireless networking. However, the robustness of such swarms is strongly affected by limited communication range and stochastic wind disturbances. This paper presents a lightweight Monte-Carlo simulation framework to quantify mission-level reliability for small quadcopter teams, using a four-vehicle DJI-class swarm as a reference. Each UAV is modeled as a discrete-time self-driven particle with Reynolds-style alignment and separation terms, a virtual-structure term for formation keeping, and smooth collision avoidance. Communication links follow a random geometric graph; connectivity is checked via breadth-first search. Wind is modeled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process fitted to low-altitude gust statistics. For each operating point (communication radius, wind level) hundreds of randomized trials are run to estimate success probability (no collisions, maintained connectivity) and its confidence interval. Results for light wind show a clear connectivity-driven S-transition in success rate as the communication radius increases, with a practical operating knee around <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$100-120 ~\\mathrm{m}$</tex>.

    "abstract": "Respiration is a critical vital sign, and its continuous, fine-grained monitoring provides essential insights for clinical assessment and daily health management. Millimeter-wave radar offers a promising contactless and privacy-preserving solution for respiratory monitoring. However, accurately reconstructing respiratory waveforms from radar echoes remains challenging due to the distributed scattering of the human thorax resulting in the respiratory signals across multiple range bins, especially in a high range-resolution radar system, as well as interferences from the body micro-motions such as random body movements (RBMs). In this paper, we propose mmBreath, a fine-grained respiration monitoring system based on a 60 GHz frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar. mmBreath adaptively integrates phase signals from multiple range bins to capture comprehensive respiratory dynamics, and employs an attention-enhanced variational autoencoder (VAE) to reconstruct high-fidelity respiratory waveforms. Furthermore, we introduce a respiratory spectrogram reconstruction task as an auxiliary objective to incorporate time-frequency features, which effectively suppresses interference from RBMs, thus further improving reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments on 17 hours of data from 12 human subjects demonstrate that mmBreath achieves superior accuracy and robustness, highlighting its potential for practical, contactless respiratory monitoring in real-world scenarios."

    "abstract": "Blockchain is a decentralized distributed ledger technology in which consensus algorithms ensure data consistency and system security among mutually untrusted nodes. The choice of a consensus algorithm significantly affects key performance indicators of a blockchain system, such as transaction throughput and energy consumption. This paper presents a systematic review of blockchain consensus algorithms. Based on their underlying principles, mainstream consensus algorithms are categorized into two major types: proof-based and voting-based mechanisms. Proof-based algorithms, such as Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS), rely on resource investment to obtain the right to produce blocks; voting-based algorithms, including Raft and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), achieve consensus through node collaboration and voting. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of nine representative consensus algorithms and compares them in terms of efficiency, scalability, fault tolerance, and complexity. Finally, the paper summarizes the current challenges and potential research directions in the field, offering theoretical support and reference for the design of future blockchain systems."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Autonomous parking technology faces significant challenges in narrow environments, primarily due to the complexity of path planning caused by space constraints. In tight spaces, feasible parking paths are limited by environmental constraints, and the vehicle must perform complex maneuvers and adjustments within a confined area. Tight spaces refer to parking slots where the clearance between the vehicle width(Wv) and the surrounding obstacles is less than 0.85 meters on either side, complex maneuvers denotes multi-stage re-orientation movements (one-, two- or three-maneuver strategies) required when the available corridor width H falls below $5 m$, necessitating additional backup or forward arcs to reach the target pose, based on Case B and Case C in Section IV.A. This not only increases the difficulty of path planning but also demands higher precision in the path’s execution. Previous research on path planning has mainly been categorized into two types: learning-based methods and non-learning-based methods. The former excels in exploring feasible paths through environmental learning but suffers from reduced path planning capability when the actual environment differs significantly from the learned one. The latter relies on predefined constraints to plan paths, but these constraints are often stringent in narrow environments, reducing path feasibility. To address these limitations, the proposed hybrid planner (1) maps reinforcement-learning agent actions to Reeds-Shepp (RS) curves, constraining the search space and thereby preserving planning capability in previously unseen layouts; and (2) introduces an environment partitioning mechanism that divides the parking zone into subregions, enabling the agent to focus exploration where constraints are tightest and thus substantially improving overall path feasibility in constrained scenarios. We trained and validated the model in a simulated environment. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves a high planning success rate in progressively narrower parking scenarios, with a success rate of over 83.6% across all tested cases."

    "abstract": "Concrete crack detection is essential for maintaining aging infrastructure. However, conventional deep learning methods rely heavily on pixel-level annotations, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. To overcome this limitation, we propose a weakly supervised crack extraction framework that eliminates the need for pixel-level labels. A ResNet- $\\mathbf{5 0}$ model with a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) is trained using image-level or patch-level annotations, and Score-CAM is employed to visualize crack regions. To enhance detection accuracy, a Multi-Scale Patch Fusion (MSPF) module is introduced, which processes subdivided image patches and fuses their outputs, thereby emphasizing local features and improving the detection of fine cracks. Although MSPF enhances crack detection, it can occasionally generate false positives due to background textures. To further address this issue, we introduce a False-Positive Patch Filtering (FPPF) module, an auxiliary CNN that automatically suppresses erroneous detections. Experiments on a benchmark dataset show that the combination of MSPF and FPPF achieves higher recall and IoU than the baseline, enabling robust crack detection without pixel-level annotations. Overall, the proposed framework substantially reduces annotation costs while maintaining high extraction accuracy, providing a scalable and practical solution for automated infrastructure inspection."

This paper proposes a novel architecture that integrates the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with Home Assistant (HA) to manage a 3D DT dashboard for a smart campus for better energy consumption using a natural language interface powered by Cursor. The system employs an intermediary component, “mcp-proxy”, which bridges the MCP client (Cursor) and the HA MCP server, allowing bidirectional communication over standard input/output and SSE protocols. Through natural language queries, users can monitor and control IoT devices represented within a 3D DT model. The deployment includes smart equipment in the lab, kitchen and mailroom, demonstrating the complete data flow from user interaction to structured response. A case study on energy consumption monitoring illustrates how the proposed system can be used in practical applications. Experimental evaluations with various LLMs confirm the feasibility, responsiveness, and contextual accuracy of the proposed solution. This work highlights the potential of agentic LLMs and open protocols in enabling intuitive and intelligent management of smart sustainable environments."

    "abstract": "Driven by the urgent need to address climate change and achieve significant reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy systems worldwide are undergoing transformative changes. In New York State, the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) has set ambitious decarbonization targets. Meeting these goals necessitates the large-scale integration of distributed energy resources (DERs), such as solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, electric vehicles (EVs), and battery energy storage systems (BESS), into the electrical distribution network (EDN). However, a critical question arises: can the existing distribution infrastructure handle this transition without requiring costly or prohibitive upgrades? This study examines New York State's decarbonization policies through the lens of distribution grid constraints, leveraging available tools to analyze the interplay between policy goals and infrastructure capabilities. A central aspect of this research involves leveraging an actual distribution network model from a dense urban region in New York City. The study evaluates scenarios of load growth, driven by electrification—and the intermittency of renewable energy. Projections for 2025, 2030, 2035, and 2045 form the basis for these analyses. Preliminary results reveal critical insights into the challenges and opportunities of grid modernization. High penetration of DERs and electrification can lead to an increase in undervoltage issues, network transformer and feeder loading up to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$70 \\%, 40 \\%$</tex> and 19 % respectively, till 2045 as compared to the base case.

This question guided our participation in the 2025 Competition on Electric Energy Consumption Forecast Adopting Multi-criteria Performance Metrics, which challenged teams to predict next-day power demand using real-world high-frequency data. We proposed a robust yet lightweight Deep Learning (DL) pipeline combining hourly downsizing, dual-mode imputation (mean and polynomial regression), and comprehensive normalization, ultimately selecting Standard Scaling for optimal balance. The lightweight GRU-LSTM sequence-to-one model achieves an average RMSE of 601.9 W, MAE of 468.9 W, and 84.36 % accuracy. Despite asymmetric inputs and imputed gaps, it generalized well, captured nonlinear demand patterns, and maintained low inference latency. Notably, spatiotemporal heatmap analysis reveals a strong alignment between temperature trends and predicted consumption, further reinforcing the model's reliability. These results demonstrate that targeted pre-processing paired with compact recurrent architectures can still enable fast, accurate, and deployment-ready energy forecasting in real-world conditions."

We benchmark both scenarios with emulated network latency to assess their performance. The second scenario is further deployed on an Open RAN 6G research infrastructure, where ROS 2 node deployment strategies are investigated for meeting strict latency requirements. The results show that a 100ms latency increase can significantly impact mission outcomes in the first scenario, increasing completion time by 50% and quadrupling the failure rate. In the second scenario, proactive resource scheduling is essential for meeting real-time requirements. These findings validate 6G’s hyper-reliable low-latency goals as essential for real time robotic controlDemo video available online at: https://tiny.cc/6GRealtimeRobotics."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel Low Latency, Low Loss, Scalable Throughput (L4S)-enabled NaaS API framework for dynamic QoS (Quality of Service) enforcement and congestion-aware traffic management in 5G Core networks. By integrating the Network Exposure Function (NEF), Policy and Charging Control (PCC), and AI-driven User Plane Function (UPF), the framework enables Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)-based congestion signaling, dual-queue architectures, and predictive policy adjustments for latency-sensitive applications such as AR/VR, cloud gaming, and industrial automation. Modeled congestion scenarios show significant improvements over static QoD (Quality on Demand) approaches, with average end-to-end latency reduced by over 80% and SLA violations decreased by nearly 80%. The proposed design also supports monetization through intent-based QoS provisioning and premium service tiers, offering CSPs a scalable, programmable alternative to static resource allocation."

In this paper, we study how to accurately estimate the duration of network interruption time caused by user mobility in cellular network. We generate a data traffic, collect timestamps of packets and information about the serving cell delivering the packet, and calculate packet inter-arrival times during the cell change. The results show that using the user datagram protocol traffic, the network interruption time had the least variance."

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes the functional requirements and architectural considerations for Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) in a 5G Open Radio Access Network (OpenRAN) environment, with emphasis on secure and modular deployment. Focusing on a mono-static, half-duplex sensing approach, it evaluates radar setup options, signal types, and processing placement within the Radio Access Network (RAN), considering performance and security implications. The proposed architecture minimizes hardware modifications by leveraging sniffer Radio Units (RUs) and existing OpenRAN fronthaul interfaces, while protecting sensitive In-phase and Quadrature (I/Q) data and control traffic against potential attacks. Security threats, such as passive sensing, spoofing, and privacy violations, are mapped to mitigation strategies within the OpenRAN framework. The result is a deployment blueprint applicable to both Public Land Mobile Networks (PLMNs) and Non-Public Networks (NPNs), supporting future 6G ISAC capabilities in a standards-compliant manner."

    "abstract": "This study evaluates the techno-economic performance of a rule-based grid-interactive hybrid system combining solar photovoltaic (PV), battery energy storage (BESS), and proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis for green hydrogen production. The proposed model uses real hourly PV generation data for Middlesbrough, UK (2024) and day-ahead market price signals to drive a rule-based dispatch. The novelty lies in the analysis of the prioritized control sequence serving a fixed 1 MW load, charging the BESS, conditionally running the electrolyser, and exporting to the grid optimised to capture value from both price-responsive arbitrage and hydrogen sales. Simulations for PV capacities from 1.0-3.0 MW with a 0.5 MW/2 MWh BESS and a 250 kW electrolyser show that PV oversizing strongly improves utilisation of surplus energy.

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "As communication networks collect ever more detailed operational data, fueled by advancements in big data analytics and AI — and with quantum computing on the horizon to enable quick data analytics at very large scales — the risk of malicious actors exploiting these data using side-channel attack techniques to reveal sensitive operational details that network operators wish to keep confidential also increases significantly. To address this emerging threat, the author proposes a proactive and preemptive defense: deliberately injecting noise and uncertainty into network operations data by integrating \"no-op\" (no operation) primitives into protocol designs and normal network traffic. By obfuscating network behavior through these benign operations, the approach aims to undermine the efficacy of side-channel analytics, protect network privacy, and complicate reconnaissance efforts by adversaries. The discussion also takes into consideration the complexity of modern network deployments, emphasizing the myriad intermediaries and operators that handle traffic and data, and highlights the growing potential for exploitation as data collection proliferates. The proposed method provides a defense mechanism against the evolving landscape of network-based side-channel attacks."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Semantic and task-oriented Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications have been recently proposed to address the scalability challenges of future V2X networks by focusing on the relevance of the exchanged information. Relevance captures the impact of the transmitted information meaning on the intended receiver’s task by taking into account the intended receiver’s context, e.g., its position, speed, and planned driving intentions. Due to its context-dependent nature, relevance can greatly vary across different driving scenarios and different intended receivers, as each vehicle experiences unique context conditions. Hence, selecting the content of the transmitted messages to provide all intended receivers with the required relevant information can be a challenging task, especially in the broadcast V2X communication domain where each transmitting vehicle has multiple intended receivers. This work analyses the impact of different content-selection strategies on the performance of semantic and task-oriented V2X communications. The obtained results show that contentselection strategies play a critical role, particularly under constrained communication scenarios, and that their impact can significantly vary under different driving scenarios. Our analysis highlights key tradeoffs in the content-selection task and offers valuable insights for the design of effective contentselection strategies able to maximize the performance of semantic and task-oriented V2X communications."
