    "abstract": "Detecting unknown deepfake manipulations remains one of the most challenging problems in face forgery detection. Current state-of-the-art approaches fail to generalize to unseen manipulations, as they primarily rely on supervised training with existing deepfakes or pseudo-fakes, which leads to overfitting to specific forgery patterns. In contrast, self-supervised methods offer greater potential for generalization, but existing work struggles to learn discriminative representations only from self-supervision. In this paper, we propose ExposeAnyone, a fully self-supervised approach based on a diffusion model that generates expression sequences from audio. The key idea is, once the model is personalized to specific subjects using reference sets, it can compute the identity distances between suspected videos and personalized subjects via diffusion reconstruction errors, enabling person-of-interest face forgery detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 1) our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.22 percentage points in the average AUC on DF-TIMIT, DFDCP, KoDF, and IDForge datasets, 2) our model is also capable of detecting Sora2-generated videos, where the previous approaches perform poorly, and 3) our method is highly robust to corruptions such as blur and compression, highlighting the applicability in real-world face forgery detection."

    "abstract": "The exploration of topological and transport properties of collinear antiferromagnets and the role of Kitaev interactions in realising topological states therein have rarely been systematically addressed in literature. In this context, we consider a zigzag-ordered antiferromagnet with both extended Kitaev and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) in presence of an external magnetic field to focus on the topological phases demonstrated by the magnon band structure and validated by the transport properties. The hybridization between the up- and down-spin sectors carries evidences of opening bulk gaps in the magnon band structure, giving rise to nontrivial topological phases characterized by finite Chern numbers, chiral edge modes, and a nonzero thermal Hall conductivity. Furthermore, generally speaking, a finite magnon orbital moment can exist and contribute to the Nernst response even when the net spin moment vanishes owing to the fundamental independence of the spin and orbital magnetizations. This motivates us to investigate the magnon orbital moment, orbital Berry curvature, and the resulting orbital Nernst conductivity associated with the magnon bands. We find that a giant orbital Nernst conductivity emerges even in the absence of an external magnetic field. Moreover, the distinction between different topological phases is more lucidly manifested via the orbital Nernst conductivity, thereby highlighting an enhanced sensitivity of the orbital transport to the underlying band topology. For completeness, we briefly discuss the scenario corresponding to a Néel-ordered spin alignment, which leads to a vanishing Chern number and consequently suppressed thermal Hall and orbital Nernst conductivities compared to the zigzag-ordered case, even in the presence of DMI and Kitaev interactions."

At the same time, gradient-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms, most notably the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), provide an efficient way to explore high-dimensional parameter spaces. In this work we present SHARPy, a Bayesian inference framework that combines the parallelism and evidence-estimation capabilities of SMC with the state-of-the-art sampling performance of NUTS. Moreover, SHARPy exploits the local geometric structure of the posterior to further improve efficiency. Built on JAX and accelerated on GPUs, SHARPy performs gravitational-wave inference on binary black-hole events in around ten minutes, yielding posterior samples and Bayesian evidence estimates that are consistent with those obtained through Nested Sampling. This work sets a new milestone in GW inference with likelihood-based methods and paves the way for model comparison tasks to be accomplished in minutes."

Yet, their efficient generation at high average power remains limited by thermal effects, phase-matching constraints, and material damage. Here, we demonstrate broadband THz and UV generation driven by a common Yb:KGW laser operating from at 40 - 600 kHz. THz radiation is produced by optical rectification in stoichiometric MgO:LiNbO$_3$ using a line-focus geometry, yielding single-cycle pulses of 55 - 92 nJ energy with peak electric fields of 37 - 90 kV/cm. Electro-optic sampling and beam-quality measurements reveal tunable control between central frequency, bandwidth and field amplitude by translating the generation region transversely within the crystal. Using shorter pump pulses preserves THz conversion efficiency, while longer pulses at 100 kHz reduce THz output by up to a factor of four due to cumulative thermal effects. Femtosecond 257.5 nm UV pulses are generated by cascaded fourth-harmonic generation in $β$-barium borate with conversion efficiencies exceeding 10% at 40 kHz and stable operation up to 600 kHz. These results demonstrate a compact, thermally robust platform for high-average-power nonlinear conversion and are directly relevant to next-generation high-repetition-rate ultrafast electron diffraction and spectroscopy systems."

    "abstract": "Understanding real-time dynamics of interacting quantum fields in curved spacetime remains a major theoretical challenge. We employ tensor network methods to study such dynamics using interacting scalar and gauge theories in 1+1 spacetime dimensions, subject to a quench modeling a homogeneously expanding gravitational background. The models considered are the scalar $λφ^4$ theory and the Schwinger model, i.e. a Dirac fermion coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field which is equivalent via bosonization to a scalar field with a cosine self-interaction. In the free scalar limit, both theories reproduce known analytical results, providing a nontrivial numerical validation of bosonization in curved spacetime for the Schwinger model. Our central finding is that self-interactions lead to a suppression of gravitational particle production compared to the free-field case, as evidenced by two-point functions and the spectra of produced particles. We further examine the behavior of entanglement generation and find that interactions suppress entanglement growth in the $λφ^4$ theory, while in the Schwinger model, the interplay between suppressed particle production and enhanced inter-particle correlations leads to more complex entanglement behavior. Our results pave the way for further explorations of nonperturbative quantum real-time dynamics of interacting scalar and gauge theories in arbitrary gravitational backgrounds."

Although this framework has been highly successful in characterizing macroscopic fluctuations and correlations, a systematic derivation of fluctuating hydrodynamics from underlying stochastic microscopic dynamics remains obscure for broad classes of interacting systems. For stochastic lattice gas models with gradient dynamics and a single conserved density, we develop a path-integral based coarse-graining procedure that recovers fluctuating hydrodynamics in a controlled manner. Our analysis highlights the essential role of local-equilibrium averages, which go beyond naïve mean-field-type gradient expansions. We further extend this approach to interacting Brownian particles by coarse-graining the Dean-Kawasaki equation, revealing a mobility proportional to the density and a diffusivity determined by the thermodynamic pressure."

This review presents a mechanism-based classification of SPEs, offering a physics-oriented framework to clarify the performance limitations of conventional sources, including quantum emitters and nonlinear optical processes. Particular attention is given to hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite quantum dots (HOIP QDs), which provide size- and composition-tunable emission with narrow linewidths and room-temperature operation. Through comparative analysis of physical mechanisms and performance metrics, we show how HOIP QDs may address key limitations of established SPE platforms. Recognizing the constraints of current deterministic sources, we introduce a performance framework to guide the development of scalable SPEs, and examine the theoretical potential of bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) states, discussing how BSV mechanisms could serve as a promising avenue for multiplexable, high-purity photon generation beyond conventional heralded schemes. The review concludes by outlining future directions for integrating HOIP- and BSV-based concepts into scalable quantum photonic architectures."

    "abstract": "Statistical inference for spatial processes from partially realized or scattered data has seen voluminous developments in diverse areas ranging from environmental sciences to business and economics. Inference on the associated rates of change has seen some recent developments. The literature has been restricted to Euclidean domains, where inference is sought on directional derivatives, rates along a chosen direction of interest, at arbitrary locations. Inference for higher order rates, particularly directional curvature has also proved useful in these settings. Modern spatial data often arise from non-Euclidean domains. This manuscript particularly considers spatial processes defined over compact Riemannian manifolds. We develop a comprehensive inferential framework for spatial rates of change for such processes over vector fields. In doing so, we formalize smoothness of process realizations and construct differential processes -- the derivative and curvature processes. We derive conditions for kernels that ensure the existence of these processes and establish validity of the joint multivariate process consisting of the ``parent'' Gaussian process (GP) over the manifold and the associated differential processes. Predictive inference on these rates is devised conditioned on the realized process over the manifold. Manifolds arise as polyhedral meshes in practice. The success of our simulation experiments for assessing derivatives for processes observed over such meshes validate our theoretical findings. By enhancing our understanding of GPs on manifolds, this manuscript unlocks a variety of potential applications in machine learning and statistics where GPs have seen wide usage. We propose a fully model-based approach to inference on the differential processes arising from a spatial process from partially observed or realized data across scattered location on a manifold."

    "abstract": "Tabular data constitute a dominant form of information in modern data lakes and repositories, yet discovering the relevant tables to answer user questions remains challenging. Existing data discovery systems assume that each question can be answered by a single table and often rely on resource-intensive offline preprocessing, such as model training or large-scale content indexing. In practice, however, many questions require information spread across multiple tables -- either independently or through joins -- and users often seek specific cell values rather than entire tables. In this paper, we present Octopus, a lightweight, entity-aware, and training-free system for multi-table data discovery and cell-level value retrieval. Instead of embedding entire questions, Octopus identifies fine-grained entities (column mentions and value mentions) from natural-language queries using an LLM parser. It then matches these entities to table headers through a compact embedding index and scans table contents directly for value occurrences, eliminating the need for heavy content indexing or costly offline stages. The resulting fine-grained alignment not only improves table retrieval accuracy but also facilitates efficient downstream NL2SQL execution by reducing token usage and redundant LLM calls. To evaluate Octopus, we introduce a new benchmark covering both table- and cell-level discovery under multi-table settings, including five datasets for independent discovery and two for join-based discovery. Experimental results show that Octopus consistently outperforms existing systems while achieving substantially lower computational and token costs.

Site-specific beamforming (SSBF) has emerged as a promising paradigm to mitigate the channel acquisition bottleneck in multiantenna systems by exploiting environmental priors. However, classical SSBF based on discriminative deep learning struggles: 1) to properly represent the inherent multimodality of wireless propagation and 2) to effectively capture the structural features of beamformers. In contrast, by leveraging conditional generative models, GenSSBF addresses these issues via learning a conditional distribution over feasible beamformers. By doing so, the synthesis of diverse and high-fidelity beam candidates from coarse channel sensing measurements can be guaranteed. This article presents the fundamentals, system designs, and implementation methods of GenSSBF. Case studies in both indoor and outdoor scenarios show that GenSSBF attains near-optimal beamforming gain with ultra-low channel acquisition overhead. Finally, several open research problems are highlighted."

This raises a significant challenge for implementation, especially for Edge devices. Unlike cloud computing, memory and processing power for Edge devices are very limited, which necessitates developing novel ideas to make such applications feasible. In this work, we investigate compressing weights with a special quantization that limits numbers to only power-of-two (PoT). This helps save a huge amount of memory as only exponents need to be stored, more importantly, it significantly reduces processing power by replacing costly multiplication with low cost bit shifting. To overcome performance loss due to this strict quantization, we investigate Quantization Aware Training (QAT) to enhance performance through additional training. Results on GPT-2 124M show a major enhancement for quantized PoT model after additional training, with a perplexity enhancement of 66% and BERT-Score loss to baseline GPT-2 of 1%. The memory saving is estimated to be 87.5% while the inference speed is expected to be 3-10x faster with PoT quantization versus full-precision."

A lot of recent studies have focused on the observables associated with near merger binary black-holes (BBHs) embedded in a circumbinary disk (CBD) but we still we lack knowledge of observables of BBHs in their early stage. In that stage the separation between the two black holes is so large that both black holes could potentially retain their individual accretion disk existing before the creation of the BBH. For such early BBH systems, it is interesting to look for observables originating in those individual disks whose structure is likely to differ from mini-disks often observed in simulations of later stages of BBHs. Aims. In a companion paper we presented a set of hydrodynamical simulations of an individual disk surrounding a primary black hole while being impacted by the presence of a secondary black-hole in an early BBH system, leading to the creation of three well-known characteristic features in the disk's structure. Here we explore the imprints of these three features on the observables associated with the thermal emission of the pre-existing black hole disk. The aim is two-fold, first to see which observables are best suited for detecting those early systems and, secondly, what could be extrapolated about these systems from observations. Methods. We used general relativistic ray-tracing in order to produce synthetic observations of the thermal emission emitted by early BBHs with different mass ratio and separations in order to search for distinctive observational features of early systems. Results. We found that in the case of early BBH with pre-existing disk(s) a necessary, although not unique, observational feature is the truncation of their disk(s). Conclusions. Such observable could be used for automated search of potential BBHs and discriminate some existing candidates."

Previously, D. Ambika et al. [Phys. Rev. B 105, L220403 (2022)] have reported the possible coexistence of ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin fluctuations in UTe$_2$ under pressure from their nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. To delve the relationship between the magnetic fluctuations and the two SC phases, we have carried out detailed $^{125}$Te NMR measurements on a single crystal of UTe$_2$ with $T_{\\rm c}$ = 1.6 K at various pressures ranging from 0 to 2.05 GPa. By comparing the temperature $T$ dependence of nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rates divided by temperature 1/$T_1T$ with that of the Knight shift $K$ for magnetic fields along the $a$, $b$, and $c$ directions, we evidence the enhancement of AFM spin fluctuations with increasing pressure. Based on the results, we suggest that FM spin fluctuations are more favorable for SC1 and AFM spin fluctuations are crucial for SC2. Our findings will inspire further study on this material to understand the peculiar SC phases in detail."

Existing approaches are fundamentally limited: replay-based methods are impractical and privacy-violating, while strict orthogonality-based methods collapse under scale: each new task is projected onto an orthogonal complement, progressively reducing the residual degrees of freedom and eliminating forward transfer by forbidding overlap in shared representations. In this work, we introduce ELLA, a training framework built on the principle of selective subspace de-correlation. Rather than forbidding all overlap, ELLA explicitly characterizes the structure of past updates and penalizes alignments along their high-energy, task-specific directions, while preserving freedom in the low-energy residual subspaces to enable transfer. Formally, this is realized via a lightweight regularizer on a single aggregated update matrix. We prove this mechanism corresponds to an anisotropic shrinkage operator that bounds interference, yielding a penalty that is both memory- and compute-constant regardless of task sequence length. ELLA requires no data replay, no architectural expansion, and negligible storage. Empirically, it achieves state-of-the-art CL performance on three popular benchmarks, with relative accuracy gains of up to $9.6\\%$ and a $35\\times$ smaller memory footprint. Further, ELLA scales robustly across architectures and actively enhances the model's zero-shot generalization performance on unseen tasks, establishing a principled and scalable solution for constructive lifelong LLM adaptation."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel channel-estimation (CE) method that mitigates residual phase drifts in backscatter links and a full hardware and signal-processing pipeline for a single-antenna monostatic system. The platform comprises a semi-passive tag, a software-defined radio (SDR) reader, and a 2x1 planar Yagi-Uda array (7 dBi with higher than 30 dB isolation) operating at 2.4 ~ 2.5 GHz. The developed backscatter fading model accounts for round-trip propagation and temporal correlation, and employs an analytically derived resource-optimal pilot allocation strategy. At the receiver, optimized least square (LS) and linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) CE with pilot-aided carrier frequency offset (CFO) compensation feed a zero-forcing (ZF) equalizer to suppress ISI. The prototype delivers 500 kbps at 1 m with power of 158 uW (SDR baseband) and 10 uW (RF switch), yielding 320 pJ/bit. OOK and BPSK modulations achieve measured EVMs of 2.97 % and 4.02 %, respectively. Performance is validated by BER measurements and successful reconstruction of a full-color image in an over-the-air experiment. The results demonstrate an ultra-low-power, multimedia-capable backscatter IoT link and provide practical hardware-software co-design guidance for scalable deployments."

The impact of the number of tags and their phase adjustment on system performance remains a challenging issue though. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the channel gain of backscatter-assisted communication with multiple tags in straight tunnels. In particular, we derive the probabilities that the backscatter link gain is greater than the direct link under adjustable and random phase assumptions by applying the Gaussian and Gamma approximations to derive tractable expressions. The simulation results show that phaseadjustable tags significantly improve the channel gain of the backscatter links compared to the random phase case. Moreover, the number of tags has an upper threshold for an effective tag deployment pattern. These insights provide valuable guidelines for the efficient design of backscatter communication systems in tunnel environments."

This allows us to explore the role of quark-gluon interactions in the spin-orbit correlation within a model calculation. We investigate the kinetic and canonical spin-orbit correlations of quarks in the pion, which arise from different decompositions of the energy-momentum tensor.

Here, we apply a correlative tomography-based mass balance framework to Cr$_2$AlC, a coating candidate for accident tolerant nuclear fuel claddings and turbine blades, and show that decomposition and pore evolution during oxidation, quantified by integrating volumetric, structural and compositional data, are strongly governed by grain morphology. The oxidation of sputtered Cr$_2$AlC coatings with equiaxed and columnar grain morphologies was analyzed. While Cr$_7$C$_3$ formed in both coating morphologies, pores formed exclusively in columnar coatings. The expected Cr$_7$C$_3$ volume was estimated by mass-balance calculations assuming that Al-deintercalation enables oxide scale and Al-O-C-N precipitate formation, leading to complete transformation of the Al-deintercalated Cr$_2$AlC into Cr$_7$C$_3$. In equiaxed coatings, the predicted carbide volume agreed with tomography within 3 $\\pm$ 3 %, confirming Al-deintercalation-driven Cr$_7$C$_3$ formation. Despite the smaller molar volume of Cr$_7$C$_3$ relative to Cr$_2$AlC, absence of pores imply that transformation shrinkage is likely accommodated by coating thickness reduction. In columnar coatings, the predicted Cr$_7$C$_3$ volume exceeds the measured value by 22 $\\pm$ 4 %, and the pore volume expected from transformation shrinkage alone is 13-16 % lower than measured, indicating partial Al deintercalation and clustering of pre-existing defects. This combined methodology provides a general route to quantitatively resolve degradation mechanisms."

Existing LVSR methods often struggle to recover fine details due to limited contrast and insufficient high-frequency information. To overcome these challenges, we present RetinexEVSR, the first event-driven LVSR framework that leverages high-contrast event signals and Retinex-inspired priors to enhance video quality under low-light scenarios. Unlike previous approaches that directly fuse degraded signals, RetinexEVSR introduces a novel bidirectional cross-modal fusion strategy to extract and integrate meaningful cues from noisy event data and degraded RGB frames. Specifically, an illumination-guided event enhancement module is designed to progressively refine event features using illumination maps derived from the Retinex model, thereby suppressing low-light artifacts while preserving high-contrast details. Furthermore, we propose an event-guided reflectance enhancement module that utilizes the enhanced event features to dynamically recover reflectance details via a multi-scale fusion mechanism. Experimental results show that our RetinexEVSR achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets. Notably, on the SDSD benchmark, our method can get up to 2.95 dB gain while reducing runtime by 65% compared to prior event-based methods. Code: https://github.com/DachunKai/RetinexEVSR."

However, existing approaches for ACD, such as deep reinforcement learning (RL), often face difficult exploration in complex networks with large decision/state spaces and thus require an expensive amount of samples. Inspired by the need to learn sample-efficient defense policies, we frame ACD in CAGE Challenge 4 (CAGE-4 / CC4) as a context-based partially observable Markov decision problem and propose a planning-centric defense policy based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). It explicitly models the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in ACD and uses statistical sampling to guide exploration and decision making. We make novel use of graph neural networks (GNNs) to embed observations from the network as attributed graphs, to enable permutation-invariant reasoning over hosts and their relationships. To make our solution practical in complex search spaces, we guide MCTS with learned graph embeddings and priors over graph-edit actions, combining model-free generalization and policy distillation with look-ahead planning. We evaluate the resulting agent on CC4 scenarios involving diverse network structures and adversary behaviors, and show that our search-guided, graph-embedding-based planning improves defense reward and robustness relative to state-of-the-art RL baselines."

In this model, an adversary, upon looking at a \"clean\" i.i.d. dataset, inserts additional \"corrupted\" points of their choice into the dataset. These added points are constrained to be monotone corruptions, in that they get labeled according to the ground-truth target function. Perhaps surprisingly, we demonstrate that in this setting, all known optimal learning algorithms for binary classification can be made to achieve suboptimal expected error on a new independent test point drawn from the same distribution as the clean dataset. On the other hand, we show that uniform convergence-based algorithms do not degrade in their guarantees. Our results showcase how optimal learning algorithms break down in the face of seemingly helpful monotone corruptions, exposing their overreliance on exchangeability."

    "abstract": "We develop a fractional-order Ginzburg-Landau (GL) framework for nonreciprocal superconducting transport in Josephson junctions formed by fractal superconductors or superconducting media with nonlocal correlations, separated by a noncentrosymmetric normal layer. We show that nonreciprocity and the superconducting diode effect arise from the interplay between the Lifshitz invariant and fractional kinetics, with the latter serving as an effective, symmetry-consistent representation of fractal geometry and finite-range memory. Two complementary approaches are pursued. In a fractional integral GL formulation, spatial integration on a fractal space yields analytic solutions and reveals how rectification scales with the dimensionality of the fractal media and the strength of the Lifshitz-like drift. In a fractional derivative-based formulation derived via the Agrawal variational principle with left/right Caputo operators, we obtain a gauge-invariant free energy, the corresponding GL equations, and a current density. We use fractional orders as effective parameters that represent nonlocal and memory effects induced by fractal microstructure. Within a two-mode plane-wave approximation we derive a compact current-phase relation and an expression for the diode efficiency, and we map the rectification amplitude across the fractional kinetic and the Lifshitz/memory order. An exact single-sided solution in terms of Prabhakar functions further confirms robust, tunable nonreciprocity, including a near-ideal diode response. This identifies a pathway to near-perfect superconducting diodes by engineering fractal (fractional-kinetic) transport achieved by tuning the fractional orders and Lifshitz strength without invoking magnetic fields or geometric ratchets. In the integer limit of local kinetics and Lifshitz-like drift, both constructions reduce to the standard $\\varphi_0$ Josephson junction."

Our system simultaneously publishes real-time altitude data from both a stationary base station and a mobile sensor, enabling precise and drift-free vertical localization. Empirical evaluations conducted in challenging scenarios -- such as fully enclosed stairwells and elevators, demonstrate that our proposed barometric pipeline achieves sub-meter vertical accuracy (RMSE: 0.29 m) and perfect (100%) floor-level identification. In contrast, our results confirm that standalone height estimates, obtained solely from visual- or LiDAR-based SLAM odometry, are insufficient for reliable vertical localization. The proposed ROS-compatible barometric module thus provides a practical and cost-effective solution for robust vertical awareness in real-world robotic deployments.

The dynamics of model confidence in multi-turn conversations, where context accumulates and ambiguity is progressively resolved, remain largely unexplored. Reliable confidence estimation in multi-turn settings is critical for many downstream applications, such as autonomous agents and human-in-the-loop systems. This work presents the first systematic study of confidence estimation in multi-turn interactions, establishing a formal evaluation framework grounded in two key desiderata: per-turn calibration and monotonicity of confidence as more information becomes available. To facilitate this, we introduce novel metrics, including a length-normalized Expected Calibration Error (InfoECE), and a new \"Hinter-Guesser\" paradigm for generating controlled evaluation datasets. Our experiments reveal that widely-used confidence techniques struggle with calibration and monotonicity in multi-turn dialogues. We propose P(Sufficient), a logit-based probe that achieves comparatively better performance, although the task remains far from solved. Our work provides a foundational methodology for developing more reliable and trustworthy conversational agents."

We systematically evaluate six diverse signal separation methods (FastICA, SOBI, PCA, NMF, Wavelet, Tensor Decomposition) across seven scenarios with 1-10 people using commodity ESP32 WiFi sensors--a simple, low-cost, off-the-shelf solution. Through novel diagnostic metrics (intra-subject variability, inter-subject distinguishability, performance degradation rate), we reveal that all methods achieve similarly low accuracy (45-56\\%, $σ$=3.74\\%) with statistically insignificant differences (p $>$ 0.05). Even the best-performing method, NMF, achieves only 56\\% accuracy. Our analysis reveals high intra-subject variability, low inter-subject distinguishability, and severe performance degradation as person count increases, indicating that commodity ESP32 sensors cannot provide sufficient signal quality for reliable multi-person separation."

Long-lived correlation effects (non-Markovianity), system-environment hybridization, and the necessity for accuracy beyond the Born-Markov approximation form particular challenges. Approaches to meet these challenges have been introduced, originating from different fields, such as hierarchical equations of motion, Lindblad-pseudomode formulas, chain-mapping approaches, quantum Brownian motion master equations, stochastic unravelings, and refined quantum master equations. This diversity, while indicative of the field's relevance, has inadvertently led to a fragmentation that hinders cohesive advances and their effective cross-community application to current problems for complex systems. How are different approaches related to each other? What are their strengths and limitations? Here we give a systematic overview and concise discussion addressing these questions. We make use of a unified framework which very conveniently allows to link different schemes and, this way, may also catalyze further progress. In line with the state of the art, this framework is formulated not in a fully reduced space of the system but in an extended state space which in a minimal fashion includes effective reservoir modes.

The method is designed to guide the learning process through successive approximations, starting from reduced-order and full Stokes models, and progressively approaching the Navier--Stokes solution. To effectively capture both local and long-range dependencies in the velocity and pressure fields, we combine graph neural networks with Transformer and Mamba architectures. While Transformers achieve the highest accuracy, we show that Mamba can be successfully adapted to graph-structured data through an unsupervised node-ordering strategy. The Mamba approach significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining performance. Physical knowledge is embedded directly into the architecture through an encoding -- processing -- physics informed decoding pipeline. Derivatives are computed through algebraic operators constructed via the Weighted Least Squares method. The flexibility of these operators allows us not only to make the output obey the governing equations, but also to constrain selected hidden features to satisfy mass conservation. We introduce additional physical biases through an enriched graph convolution with the same differential operators describing the PDEs. Overall, we successfully guide the learning process by physical knowledge and fluid dynamics insights, leading to more regular and accurate predictions"

When frequency shifts extracted from week-long BiSON datasets are fitted to a linear combination of observed near-side activity and a far-side proxy made from the near-side measures shifted by half the solar rotation period, the solution favours a slightly higher weighting from the far-side contribution. Here, we demonstrate that this unphysical mismatch is due to the inherent inaccuracy of the far-side proxy, which fails to capture active regions that evolve fully on the solar far side, or that evolve (or have evolved) significantly as they rotate off (or onto) the visible disc. By simulating the evolution of sunspot group areas over time, which act as a suitable measure of solar activity, we show that the solution is sensitive to the lifetime of the activity. Assuming an underlying mapping from maximum group areas $A_{\\rm max}$ (measured in millionths of the solar hemispheric area, MSH) to group lifetimes $τ$ (measured in days) of the form $τ= αA_{\\rm max}$, we find that $α\\simeq 0.025^{+0.055}_{-0.016}\\,\\rm d\\,MSH^{-1}$ gives results consistent with the BiSON finding. This is to be compared with the value of $α= 0.1\\,\\rm d\\,MSH^{-1}$ implied by the well-known Gnevyshev-Waldmeier rule.

We investigate this discrepancy and identify a fundamental distributional gap: while RL aligns with the model's internal belief, SFT forces the model to fit external supervision. This mismatch often manifests as \"Confident Conflicts\" tokens characterized by low probability but low entropy. In these instances, the model is highly confident in its own prediction but is forced to learn a divergent ground truth, triggering destructive gradient updates. To address this, we propose Entropy-Adaptive Fine-Tuning (EAFT). Unlike methods relying solely on prediction probability, EAFT utilizes token-level entropy as a gating mechanism to distinguish between epistemic uncertainty and knowledge conflict. This allows the model to learn from uncertain samples while suppressing gradients on conflicting data. Extensive experiments on Qwen and GLM series (ranging from 4B to 32B parameters) across mathematical, medical, and agentic domains confirm our hypothesis. EAFT consistently matches the downstream performance of standard SFT while significantly mitigating the degradation of general capabilities."

Typically, this router is trained once and then frozen, rendering routing decisions brittle under distribution shifts. We address this limitation by introducing kNN-MoE, a retrieval-augmented routing framework that reuses optimal expert assignments from a memory of similar past cases. This memory is constructed offline by directly optimizing token-wise routing logits to maximize the likelihood on a reference set. Crucially, we use the aggregate similarity of retrieved neighbors as a confidence-driven mixing coefficient, thus allowing the method to fall back to the frozen router when no relevant cases are found. Experiments show kNN-MoE outperforms zero-shot baselines and rivals computationally expensive supervised fine-tuning."

    "abstract": "Smoking remains the leading cause of preventable mortality worldwide. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to the development of tobacco addiction due to ongoing brain maturation and susceptibility to social influences, such as exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Craving -the strong desire to use drugs -already emerges with non-daily tobacco use and predicts continued use and relapse. However, the roles of craving and ETS exposure during the early stages of tobacco use in adolescence remain poorly understood. In this pre-registered study, we harness a recently developed fMRI marker of craving -the Neurobiological Craving Signature (NCS) -to compare craving-related brain responses to smoking versus social cues in adolescent Experimental Smokers (N=100) and Non-smokers (N=48) with varying levels of ETS exposure levels. Results showed that NCS responses to smoking cues compared to alternative social rewards were higher in Experimental Smokers compared to Non-smokers and predicted individual differences in self-reported craving and monthly smoking. Both smoking behavior and NCS responses were correlated with the relative amount of ETS exposure from peers compared to exposure from family members. Together, these findings indicate a heightened sensitivity of craving-related brain circuits already during experimental smoking and highlight the important role of peer social norms on craving and smoking initiation in the critical period of adolescence."

In this work, we present a domain partitioning strategy and normal operator approximations that enable the training of end-to-end reconstruction models incorporating forward operators of arbitrarily large problems into their architecture. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D X-ray cone-beam tomography and 3D multi-coil accelerated MRI, while requiring only a single GPU for both training and inference."

Here we present a doubly-connected gradiometric transmon (the ``8-mon\") that incorporates a nano-airbridge to link its two loops. This design preserves full electrical tunability and remains fully compatible with standard X-mon control and readout, requiring no additional measurement overhead. The airbridge interconnect eliminates dielectric loss, which enables the 8-mon to achieve both energy relaxation times $T_{\\rm 1}$ comparable to reference X-mons and, in the small flux-bias regime, a nearly threefold enhancement in Ramsey coherence time $T_{\\rm 2}^*$. This improved $T_{\\rm 2}^*$ reaches the same order as $T_{\\rm 1}$ without employing echo decoupling. The device also exhibits superior long-term frequency stability even without any magnetic field shielding. We develop a spatially correlated flux-noise model whose simulations quantitatively reproduce the experimental coherence trends, revealing the coexistence of short- and long-correlation-length magnetic noise in the superconducting chip environment. By unifying high tunability with intrinsic flux-noise suppression through a robust geometric design, the 8-mon provides a practical pathway toward more coherent and stable superconducting quantum processors."

However, its sequential computation pattern struggles to efficiently leverage GPU parallelism, which leads to low compute resource utilization. Furthermore, frequent off-chip weight accesses create a memory bottleneck. To address these challenges, we propose HFRWKV, an FPGA-based hardware accelerator specifically designed for RWKV. Within the matrix operation module, we propose a novel hardware-friendly hybrid-precision quantization strategy, which enhances performance while maintaining acceptable accuracy. For the complex operations including exponentiation and division, we introduce a method featuring reusable architectures combined with lookup tables or piecewise linear approximation, which is algorithmically refined to effectively balance precision and hardware resource consumption. Based on this foundation, we adopt a fully on-chip computing system integrating parallel matrix-vector processing array and an efficient pipeline architecture. Through computation reordering and chunked double buffering, it effectively eliminates data transfer bottlenecks and improves overall throughput. We implement HFRWKV on the Alveo U50 and U280 platform. Experimental results show that compared to a CPU, a throughput improvement of 63.48$\\times$ and an energy efficiency improvement of 139.17$\\times$.

Using atomistic simulations of entangled polyethylene, we re-evaluate these foundational quantities. By fitting end-to-end distance distributions of C--C bond blocks and validating with higher-moment analyses, we identify for the first time the minimal sizes corresponding to a statistical segment and an entropic spring. A single Kuhn segment (approximately 11 bonds) is the smallest statistically uncorrelated unit, but its distance distribution is strongly non-Gaussian, while the monomer-based segment $b$, used in rheology and classical tube-theory formulations, is not statistical at all. True Gaussianity emerges only for blocks containing multiple Kuhn segments. At the Kuhn scale, we uncover a previously unresolved conformational heterogeneity. Each segment samples a broad range of conformations, from coiled (approximately 4~Å) to extended (approximately 14~Å), giving rise to three distinct substructures: aligned chain segments (ACS), random conformational sequences (RCS), and chain ends (CE). These exhibit distinct dynamical signatures. ACS relax with a stretched-exponential exponent $β\\approx 0.5$, consistent with quasi-one-dimensional, defect-mediated localized modes, whereas RCS and CE relax with $β\\approx 0.7$. By connecting these results to localized-mode theory and continuous-time random-walk models, we provide a molecular interpretation of stretched-exponential relaxation in polymer melts."

We propose CS$^2$, which explicitly models structure-state coupling to capture how topology modulates steady states and how the two signals jointly improve edge discrimination for formation-order recovery. Experiments on six real temporal networks, evaluated under multiple dynamical processes, show that CS$^2$ consistently outperforms strong baselines, improving pairwise edge precedence accuracy by 4.0% on average and global ordering consistency (Spearman-$ρ$) by 7.7% on average. CS$^2$ also more faithfully recovers macroscopic evolution trajectories such as clustering formation, degree heterogeneity, and hub growth. Moreover, a steady-state-only variant remains competitive when reliable topology is limited, highlighting steady states as an independent signal for evolution inference."

Epitaxial (110) strains may indeed outperform the widely studied (100) orientation, as even modest strain values stabilize a diverse set of metastable nanoscale states with potential high functional tunability. In this regime, the films exhibit multidomain configurations with domain wall normal oriented along the clamped in-plane or the relaxed out-of-plane directions and heterophases in BaTiO$_3$ and KNbO$_3$. Besides, complex superdomain patterns and antiferroelectric-like domains are observed in PbTiO$_3$. These metastable nanoscale configurations may allow for large reversible responses."

In this context, surface-enhanced vibrational spectroscopies stand up as well-established techniques to study molecular vibrational lines and populations with a sensitivity that can reach the singe-molecule level. However, to date, this possibility has not been fully developed to address IVR. Here, we establish a quantum mechanical framework based on molecular optomechanics that accounts for IVR, and adopt it to analyze strategies to optimize IVR characterization by vibrational spectroscopy. In particular, we model two different pump-and-probe configurations where the vibrational pumping is provided either by infrared laser illumination or by Stokes SERS. We show for the two pumping configurations the existence of clear signatures on the anti-Stokes SERS spectra of population transfer between coupled vibrational modes in a molecule. Our calculations adopt realistic molecular and SERS parameters, suggesting that these signatures of IVR are accessible at the single-molecule level with current experimental platforms."

    "abstract": "The automotive industry's pursuit of enhanced fuel economy and performance necessitates efficient aerodynamic design. However, traditional evaluation methods such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and wind tunnel testing are resource intensive, hindering rapid iteration in the early design stages. Machine learning-based surrogate models offer a promising alternative, yet many existing approaches suffer from high computational complexity, limited interpretability, or insufficient accuracy for detailed geometric inputs. This paper introduces a novel lightweight surrogate model for the prediction of the aerodynamic drag coefficient (Cd) based on a sequential slice-wise processing of the geometry of the 3D vehicle. Inspired by medical imaging, 3D point clouds of vehicles are decomposed into an ordered sequence of 2D cross-sectional slices along the stream-wise axis. Each slice is encoded by a lightweight PointNet2D module, and the sequence of slice embeddings is processed by a bidirectional LSTM to capture longitudinal geometric evolution. The model, trained and evaluated on the DrivAerNet++ dataset, achieves a high coefficient of determination (R^2 > 0.9528) and a low mean absolute error (MAE approx 6.046 x 10^{-3}) in Cd prediction. With an inference time of approximately 0.025 seconds per sample on a consumer-grade GPU, our approach provides fast, accurate, and interpretable aerodynamic feedback, facilitating more agile and informed automotive design exploration."

    "abstract": "Imaging systems are represented as linear operators, and their singular value spectra describe the structure recoverable at the operator level. Building on an operator-based information-theoretic framework, this paper introduces a minimal geometric structure induced by the normalised singular spectra of imaging operators. By identifying spectral equivalence classes with points on a probability simplex, and equipping this space with the Fisher--Rao information metric, a well-defined Riemannian geometry can be obtained that is invariant under unitary transformations and global rescaling. The resulting geometry admits closed-form expressions for distances and geodesics, and has constant positive curvature. Under explicit restrictions, composition enforces boundary faces through rank constraints and, in an aligned model with stated idealisations, induces a non-linear re-weighting of spectral states. Fisher--Rao distances are preserved only in the spectrally uniform case. The construction is abstract and operator-level, introducing no optimisation principles, stochastic models, or modality-specific assumptions. It is intended to provide a fixed geometric background for subsequent analysis of information flow and constraints in imaging pipelines."

Although prior studies have advanced the overall design of LLM-based agents, systematic optimization of their internal reasoning and tool-use pipelines remains underexplored. This paper introduces an agent framework grounded in real-world practical experience, with three key innovations: (1) an adaptive prompt generation strategy that aligns with the agent's state and task goals to improve reliability and robustness; (2) a context-aware tool orchestration module that performs tool categorization, semantic retrieval, and adaptive invocation based on user intent and context; and (3) a layered memory mechanism that integrates session memory, task history, and external summaries to improve relevance and efficiency through dynamic summarization and compression. An end-to-end framework named Jenius-Agent has been integrated with three key optimizations, including tools based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), file input/output (I/O), and execution feedback. The experiments show a 20 percent improvement in task accuracy, along with a reduced token cost, response latency, and invocation failures.

    "abstract": "Feature-based anomaly detection is widely adopted in industrial inspection due to the strong representational power of large pre-trained vision encoders. While most existing methods focus on improving within-category anomaly scoring, practical deployments increasingly require task-agnostic operation under continual category expansion, where the category identity is unknown at test time. In this setting, overall performance is often dominated by expert selection, namely routing an input to an appropriate normality model before any head-specific scoring is applied. However, routing rules that compare head-specific anomaly scores across independently constructed heads are unreliable in practice, as score distributions can differ substantially across categories in scale and tail behavior. We propose GCR, a lightweight mixture-of-experts framework for stabilizing task-agnostic continual anomaly detection through geometry-consistent routing. GCR routes each test image directly in a shared frozen patch-embedding space by minimizing an accumulated nearest-prototype distance to category-specific prototype banks, and then computes anomaly maps only within the routed expert using a standard prototype-based scoring rule. By separating cross-head decision making from within-head anomaly scoring, GCR avoids cross-head score comparability issues without requiring end-to-end representation learning. Experiments on MVTec AD and VisA show that geometry-consistent routing substantially improves routing stability and mitigates continual performance collapse, achieving near-zero forgetting while maintaining competitive detection and localization performance. These results indicate that many failures previously attributed to representation forgetting can instead be explained by decision-rule instability in cross-head routing.

Our approach leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct 3D scenes and render videos, ensuring efficient generation of 3D consistent results. We propose an emotion-audio-guided spatial attention method that effectively integrates emotion features with audio content features. Through emotion-guided attention, the model is able to reconstruct facial details across different emotional states more accurately. To achieve emotional and stylized deformations of the 3D Gaussian points through emotion and style features, we introduce two 3D Gaussian deformation predictors. Futhermore, we propose a multi-stage training strategy, enabling the step-by-step learning of the character's lip movements, emotional variations, and style features. Our generated results exhibit high efficiency, high quality, and 3D consistency.

However, free electrons generally only absorb/emit one photon at a time, while the physical mechanism and phenomena of free electron-two-photon interaction have not been studied yet. Moreover, the relationship between PINEM and Kapitza-Dirac (KD) effect and nonlinear Compton scattering is still unclear. Here we develop the full quantum theory of electron-photon interaction considering the two-photon process. It is revealed that the emission/absorption of two photons by electrons can be greatly enhanced by manipulating the electric field component of optical near field, and the quantum interference between single-photon and two-photon processes can occur in some circumstances, which affects the photon number state, electron energy states and electron-photon entanglement. Meanwhile, it is found that the KD effect (elastic electron-photon scattering) and nonlinear Compton scattering (inelastic electron-photon scattering) are also a kind of two-photon process and the distribution of electrons can be deduced analytically based on the full quantum theory. Our work uncovers the possible abundant phenomena when free electron interacting with two photons, paves the way for more in-depth studies of nonlinear processes in electron-photon quantum interactions in the future."

In this paper, we present an open source NWDAF framework integrated into an existing Free5GC implementation, which serves as an open-source 5G core implementation. Our implementation extends the session management function to support standardized event exposure interfaces and introduces custom-built notification mechanisms into the SMF and the access and mobility management function for seamless data delivery. The NWDAF subscribes to events and generates analytics on user equipment (UE) behavior, session lifecycle, and handover dynamics. We validate our system through a two-week deployment involving four virtual next-generation NodeBs (gNBs) and multiple virtual UEs with dynamic mobility patterns. To demonstrate predictive capabilities, we incorporate a mobility-aware module that achieves 80.65\\% accuracy in forecasting the next gNB handover cell. The framework supports reliable UE registration, state tracking, and cross-cell handovers."

    "abstract": "We present Yukthi Opus (YO), a multi-chain hybrid metaheuristic designed for NP-hard optimization under explicit evaluation budget constraints. YO integrates three complementary mechanisms in a structured two-phase architecture: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for global exploration, greedy local search for exploitation, and simulated annealing with adaptive reheating to enable controlled escape from local minima. A dedicated burn-in phase allocates evaluations to probabilistic exploration, after which a hybrid optimization loop refines promising candidates. YO further incorporates a spatial blacklist mechanism to avoid repeated evaluation of poor regions and a multi-chain execution strategy to improve robustness and reduce sensitivity to initialization. We evaluate YO on three benchmarks: the Rastrigin function (5D) with ablation studies, the Traveling Salesman Problem with 50 to 200 cities, and the Rosenbrock function (5D) with comparisons against established optimizers including CMA-ES, Bayesian optimization, and accelerated particle swarm optimization. Results show that MCMC exploration and greedy refinement are critical for solution quality, while simulated annealing and multi-chain execution primarily improve stability and variance reduction. Overall, YO achieves competitive performance on large and multimodal problems while maintaining predictable evaluation budgets, making it suitable for expensive black-box optimization settings."

    "abstract": "Emerging single-cell technologies that integrate CRISPR-based genetic perturbations with single-cell RNA sequencing, such as Perturb-seq, have substantially advanced our understanding of gene regulation and causal influence of genes. While Perturb-seq data provide valuable causal insights into gene-gene interactions, statistical concerns remain regarding unobserved confounders that may bias inference. These latent factors may arise not only from intrinsic molecular features of regulatory elements encoded in Perturb-seq experiments, but also from unobserved genes arising from cost-constrained experimental designs. Although methods for analyzing largescale Perturb-seq data are rapidly maturing, approaches that explicitly account for such unobserved confounders in learning the causal gene networks are still lacking. Here, we propose a novel method to recover causal gene networks from Perturb-seq experiments with robustness to arbitrarily omitted confounders. Our framework leverages proxy and instrumental variable strategies to exploit the rich information embedded in perturbations, enabling unbiased estimation of the underlying directed acyclic graph (DAG) of gene expressions. Simulation studies and analyses of CRISPR interference experiments of K562 cells demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline approaches that ignore unmeasured confounding, yielding more accurate and biologically relevant recovery of the true gene causal DAGs."

We introduce CSCBench, a 2.3K+ single-choice benchmark for CSC reasoning, instantiated through our PVC 3D Evaluation Framework (Process, Variety, and Cognition). The Process axis aligns tasks with SCOR+Enable; the Variety axis operationalizes commodity-specific rule systems under coupled material-information-financial constraints, grounded in authoritative exchange guidebooks/rulebooks and industry reports; and the Cognition axis follows Bloom's revised taxonomy.

Our pulsar population simulations revealed a set of observational parameters that optimize pulsar detection. An observation frequency of ~ 1420 MHz and a channel width of ~10 kHz emerge as the optimal configuration to maximize the pulsar detection efficiency. By applying a scintillation-based technique to future radio telescopes like DSA-2000, we can detect 56% of normal pulsars and 84% of MSPs in addition to those detected using non-imaging, time-domain surveys. These detected pulsars cannot be verified by time-domain searches."

A direct consequence of the obtained general formulas is the relationship between the acceleration-induced shear viscosity in flat space and the conformal quantum anomaly in curved space, pointing to a possible novel probe of the conformal anomaly in systems with extreme acceleration. Moreover, for conformal field theories, we explicitly show that globally entanglement viscosity saturates the Kovtun-Son-Starinets bound."

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are rapidly advancing and are expected to play a central role in future mobility. Ensuring their safe deployment requires reliable interaction with other road users, not least pedestrians. Direct testing on public roads is costly and unsafe for rare but critical interactions, making simulation a practical alternative. Within simulation-based testing, adversarial scenarios are widely used to probe safety limits, but many prioritise difficulty over realism, producing exaggerated behaviours which may result in AV controllers that are overly conservative. We propose an alternative method, instead using a cognitively inspired pedestrian model featuring both inter-individual and intra-individual variability to generate behaviourally plausible adversarial scenarios. We provide a proof of concept demonstration of this method's potential for AV control optimisation, in closed-loop testing and tuning of an AV controller. Our results show that replacing the rule-based CARLA pedestrian with the human-like model yields more realistic gap acceptance patterns and smoother vehicle decelerations. Unsafe interactions occur only for certain pedestrian individuals and conditions, underscoring the importance of human variability in AV testing. Adversarial scenarios generated by this model can be used to optimise AV control towards safer and more efficient behaviour. Overall, this work illustrates how incorporating human-like road user models into simulation-based adversarial testing can enhance the credibility of AV evaluation and provide a practical basis to behaviourally informed controller optimisation."

A baseline model using Tacotron2 was built, and then, with the same data, another TTS model was built with VITS. In both subjective and objective evaluations, the VITS model outperformed the Tacotron2 model. In terms of tone synthesis, the VITS model showed significantly lower tone errors than the Tacotron2 model.

We point to simple biological details -- e.g. nonnegative firing and energetic/space budgets in connectionist architectures -- which, when mixed with the requirements of solving a task, produce models that predict brain responses down to single-neuron tuning. We understand this as details constraining the set of plausible algorithms, and their implementations, such that only `brain-like' algorithms are learned. In particular, each biological detail breaks a symmetry in connectionist models (scale, rotation, permutation) leading to interpretable single-neuron responses that are meaningfully characteristic of particular algorithms. This view helps us not only understand the brain's choice of algorithm but also infer algorithm from measured neural responses. Further, this perspective aligns computational neuroscience with mechanistic interpretability in AI, suggesting a more unified approach to studying the mechanisms of intelligence, both natural and artificial."

The bulk action in $AdS_{d+1}$ has an $SO(1,d+1)$ symmetry and is obtained from the evolution operator of the Polchinski's ERG equation by a map that involves a field redefinition and requires a $\\textit{special}$ form of the UV cutoff function in the ERG equation.

Using the PB86/def2-SVP level of theory with dispersion corrections, the research examines how sulfur substitution and non-covalent interactions influence cluster stability, electronic structure, spectra, and optoelectronic potential. Comparative analysis of the syn- and anti-isomers reveals the impact of molecular conformation on frontier molecular orbitals and related energetic and photophysical properties. Sulfur doping is shown to enhance charge delocalization, stabilize excited states, and improve thermal stability, which form key factors for tunable laser applications. The inclusion of advanced dispersion correction methods proves essential for accurately capturing many-body interactions that govern electronic behavior. By elucidating the interplay between structural features, substitution patterns, and computational modeling, the work provides valuable insights into structure-property relationships critical for designing borane-based materials with tailored optoelectronic and thermal characteristics. In addition to doping and dispersion effects, functionals' effects were examined through comparison amidst various ones with different asymptotic exchange on excitation and gap energies. In summary, the computational methodology combined good DFT/Basis/dispersion set to accurately predict geometries, IR/UV spectra, NMR chemical shifts, dipole moments, polarizability and excited-state properties, thereby offering a comprehensive theoretical understanding of syn-, anti- isomers of B18H22 and its sulfur doped variants."

Existing methods often rely on lightweight modules for fast feature extraction, which struggles to preserve structured patterns and fine-grained details, leading to texture attenuation during generation.To address these issues, we propose AlignVTOFF, a novel parallel U-Net framework built upon a Reference U-Net and Texture-Spatial Feature Alignment (TSFA). The Reference U-Net performs multi-scale feature extraction and enhances geometric fidelity, enabling robust modeling of deformation while retaining complex structured patterns. TSFA then injects the reference garment features into a frozen denoising U-Net via a hybrid attention design, consisting of a trainable cross-attention module and a frozen self-attention module. This design explicitly aligns texture and spatial cues and alleviates the loss of high-frequency information during the denoising process.Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate that AlignVTOFF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing flat-lay garment results with improved structural realism and high-frequency detail fidelity."

    "abstract": "Recent advancements adopt online reinforcement learning (RL) from LLMs to text-to-image rectified flow diffusion models for reward alignment. The use of group-level rewards successfully aligns the model with the targeted reward. However, it faces challenges including low efficiency, dependency on stochastic samplers, and reward hacking. The problem is that rectified flow models are fundamentally different from LLMs: 1) For efficiency, online image sampling takes much more time and dominates the time of training. 2) For stochasticity, rectified flow is deterministic once the initial noise is fixed. Aiming at these problems and inspired by the effects of group-level rewards from LLMs, we design Group-level Direct Reward Optimization (GDRO). GDRO is a new post-training paradigm for group-level reward alignment that combines the characteristics of rectified flow models. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we point out that GDRO supports full offline training that saves the large time cost for image rollout sampling. Also, it is diffusion-sampler-independent, which eliminates the need for the ODE-to-SDE approximation to obtain stochasticity. We also empirically study the reward hacking trap that may mislead the evaluation, and involve this factor in the evaluation using a corrected score that not only considers the original evaluation reward but also the trend of reward hacking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GDRO effectively and efficiently improves the reward score of the diffusion model through group-wise offline optimization across the OCR and GenEval tasks, while demonstrating strong stability and robustness in mitigating reward hacking."

A specific instability that often occurs for large learning rates at the end of training is output logit divergence. The most widely used mitigation strategy, z-loss, merely addresses the symptoms rather than the underlying cause of the problem. In this paper, we analyze the instability from the perspective of the output embeddings' geometry and identify its cause. Based on this, we propose output embedding centering (OEC) as a new mitigation strategy, and prove that it suppresses output logit divergence. OEC can be implemented in two different ways, as a deterministic operation called μ-centering, or a regularization method called μ-loss. Our experiments show that both variants outperform z-loss in terms of training stability and learning rate sensitivity. In particular, they ensure that training converges even for large learning rates when z-loss fails. Furthermore, we find that μ-loss is significantly less sensitive to regularization hyperparameter tuning than z-loss."

The studies were carried out in-situ using transmission electron diffraction technique (THEED) on clusters with an average size ranging from 2000 to 100000 atoms/cluster and across the entire range of component concentrations. The independence of the threshold size of clusters, corresponding to the beginning of the formation of the hcp phase, from the component composition was revealed. It was established that clusters larger than this threshold size have a two-phase fcc-hcp structure with an identical concentration of components in each phase. The fraction of the hexagonal phase increases with the size of the aggregations and depends on the component content, reaching maximum in clusters with an equimolar composition. Arguments are presented in favor of the formation of two-phase clusters in the supersonic jet, rather than separate single-phase fcc and hcp ones. These findings are in good agreement with the previously proposed thermally activated diffusion mechanism for the nucleation and growth of the hcp phase in rare gas clusters."

For global and local fitness variables, the power spectral density exhibits $1/f^α$ with $0< α< 2$, indicative of long-range correlations. We also investigate the cover time, defined as the duration required for the extinction or mutation of species across the entire system in the critical state of the barycentric BS model. Using finite-size scaling and extreme value theory, we analyze the statistical properties of the cover time. Our results show power-law scaling with system size for the mean, variance, mode, and peak probability. Furthermore, the cumulative probability distribution exhibits data collapse, and the associated scaling function is well described by the generalized extreme value density, closely approximating the Gumbel family."

Fine-grid parabolic wave equation (PWE) solvers provide high-fidelity field predictions but are computationally expensive for large-scale tunnels, whereas coarse-grid models lose essential modal and geometric details. To address this challenge, we propose a physics-informed recurrent back-projection propagation network (PRBPN) that reconstructs fine-resolution received-signal-strength (RSS) fields from coarse PWE slices. The network integrates multi-slice temporal fusion with an iterative projection/back-projection mechanism that enforces physical consistency and avoids any pre-upsampling stage, resulting in strong data efficiency and improved generalization. Simulations across four tunnel cross-section geometries and four frequencies show that the proposed PRBPN closely tracks fine-mesh PWE references. Engineering-level validation on the Massif Central tunnel in France further confirms robustness in data-scarce scenarios, trained with only a few paired coarse/fine RSS. These results indicate that the proposed PRBPN can substantially reduce reliance on computationally intensive fine-grid solvers while maintaining high-fidelity tunnel propagation predictions."

In this article, we present MindChat, a privacy-preserving LLM for mental health support, together with MindCorpus, a synthetic multi-turn counseling dataset constructed via a multi-agent role-playing framework. To synthesize high-quality counseling data, the developed dialogue-construction framework employs a dual closed-loop feedback design to integrate psychological expertise and counseling techniques through role-playing: (i) turn-level critique-and-revision to improve coherence and counseling appropriateness within a session, and (ii) session-level strategy refinement to progressively enrich counselor behaviors across sessions. To mitigate privacy risks under decentralized data ownership, we fine-tune the base model using federated learning with parameter-efficient LoRA adapters and incorporate differentially private optimization to reduce membership and memorization risks. Experiments on synthetic-data quality assessment and counseling capability evaluation show that MindCorpus improves training effectiveness and that MindChat is competitive with existing general and counseling-oriented LLM baselines under both automatic LLM-judge and human evaluation protocols, while exhibiting reduced privacy leakage under membership inference attacks."

    "abstract": "Real-world image dehazing is a fundamental yet challenging task in low-level vision. Existing learning-based methods often suffer from significant performance degradation when applied to complex real-world hazy scenes, primarily due to limited training data and the intrinsic complexity of haze density distributions.To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Adaptive Patch Importance-aware (API) framework for generalizable real-world image dehazing. Specifically, our framework consists of an Automatic Haze Generation (AHG) module and a Density-aware Haze Removal (DHR) module. AHG provides a hybrid data augmentation strategy by generating realistic and diverse hazy images as additional high-quality training data. DHR considers hazy regions with varying haze density distributions for generalizable real-world image dehazing in an adaptive patch importance-aware manner. To alleviate the ambiguity of the dehazed image details, we further introduce a new Multi-Negative Contrastive Dehazing (MNCD) loss, which fully utilizes information from multiple negative samples across both spatial and frequency domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world benchmarks, delivering strong results in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visual quality, and exhibiting robust generalization across diverse haze distributions."

Indeed, the former completely ignores the acoustic excitation branch - the phonons - of the superfluid, while the latter explicitly takes it into account, as well as the quantum fluctuations induced by the broken-pair continuum. Unlike the first, the second theory (i) reflects the effect of these collective excitations on the system's equation of state, including at zero temperature, (ii) allows the function $g_{\\uparrow\\downarrow}(\\vec{r},\\vec{r}\\,')$ to go at sufficiently large distances strictly below its asymptotic value $(ρ/2)^2$ where $ρ$ is the gas density, as expected according to the quantum hydrodynamics of Landau and Khalatnikov at low temperatures, and (iii) predicts in the function $g_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}(\\vec{r},\\vec{r}\\,')$ at short distances subdominant contributions $|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}\\,'|^2\\ln|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}\\,'|$ in 3D and $|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}\\,'|^2\\ln(-\\ln|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}\\,'|)$ in 2D, alongside the dominant contributions $|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}\\,'|$ in 3D and $|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}\\,'|^2\\ln|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}\\,'|$ in 2D already present in static BCS theory but with a lower coefficient.

    "abstract": "The register tube marks the invention of the clarinet in the early eighteenth century, tripling the range of its ancestor, the chalumeau, and giving it the widest range among wind instruments. Opening this narrow tube causes the fundamental frequency of the played note to increase by a factor of three, from the first to the second register of the resonator. The geometry and location of the register hole condition not only this mode selection mechanism, but also the global tuning of the second register. However, existing self-sustained nonlinear models of reed instruments fail to predict whether a register transition can occur, limiting optimization of the register hole geometry. Here, we introduce a sparse self-oscillating clarinet model that includes localized nonlinear acoustic losses in the register hole. This nonlinear mechanism is shown to be necessary to reproduce register transitions observed experimentally. Using systematic exploration of the control and design parameter spaces, we identify combinations of register hole diameter, position, and chimney length that ensure reliable register transitions. We show that the competing demands of playability and tuning are only satisfied by a long and narrow tube. Our findings provide a predictive tool for instrument making, assisting manufacturers in refining clarinets as well as other reed instruments, including oboes, bassoons, and saxophones."

However, due to language bias, LVLMs are susceptible to object hallucination, which can be primarily divided into category, attribute, and relation hallucination, significantly impeding the trustworthy AI applications. Editing the internal activations of LVLMs has shown promising effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations with minimal cost. However, previous editing approaches neglect the effective guidance offered by factual textual semantics, thereby struggling to explicitly mitigate language bias. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Factual-guided Visual-Textual Editing for hallucination mitigation (AFTER), which comprises Factual-Augmented Activation Steering (FAS) and Query-Adaptive Offset Optimization (QAO), to adaptively guides the original biased activations towards factual semantics. Specifically, FAS is proposed to provide factual and general guidance for activation editing, thereby explicitly modeling the precise visual-textual associations. Subsequently, QAO introduces a query-aware offset estimator to establish query-specific editing from the general steering vector, enhancing the diversity and granularity of editing. Extensive experiments on standard hallucination benchmarks across three widely adopted LVLMs validate the efficacy of the proposed AFTER, notably achieving up to a 16.3% reduction of hallucination over baseline on the AMBER benchmark. Our code and data will be released for reproducibility."

However, transferring complex motions between videos remains challenging. In this work, we present MotionAdapter, a content-aware motion transfer framework that enables robust and semantically aligned motion transfer within DiT-based T2V models. Our key insight is that effective motion transfer requires \\romannumeral1) explicit disentanglement of motion from appearance and \\romannumeral 2) adaptive customization of motion to target content. MotionAdapter first isolates motion by analyzing cross-frame attention within 3D full-attention modules to extract attention-derived motion fields. To bridge the semantic gap between reference and target videos, we further introduce a DINO-guided motion customization module that rearranges and refines motion fields based on content correspondences. The customized motion field is then used to guide the DiT denoising process, ensuring that the synthesized video inherits the reference motion while preserving target appearance and semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MotionAdapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Moreover, MotionAdapter naturally supports complex motion transfer and motion editing tasks such as zooming."

Using Raman scattering and (magneto)-optical experiments, we describe the magnetic and optical properties of alloys of CrSBr$_{(1-x)}$Cl$_x$ with $x<0.46$. Similar to CrSBr, these alloys are direct band gap semiconductors with a coupling of their electronic and magnetic properties. Exciton energies evolve weakly with composition and we describe the large changes in the saturation magnetic fields and their implications on the magnetic properties. We show that both the interlayer magnetic exchange and electronic interactions are modified by the halogen mixing, offering the possibility to tune magnon energies with alloy composition."

We propose that this dynamics arises from a fundamental symmetry principle: the Spontaneous Breaking of Scale Invariance. We introduce the Dilaton ($χ$), a Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Boson (PNGB) associated with dilatation symmetry breaking. We demonstrate that a simple quadratic mass term in the fundamental theory transforms, via conformal coupling to gravity, into a ''thawing'' exponential potential $V(φ) \\propto e^{-λφ}$ in the Einstein frame. Using recent Bayesian reconstructions of dark energy dynamics from Planck, Pantheon+, and SH0ES data, we constrain the potential slope to be $λ\\approx 0.056$. We show that this observational value is not arbitrary but corresponds to a fundamental non-minimal coupling strength of $ξ\\approx 7.8 \\times 10^{-4}$. The Dilaton mechanism naturally generates the late-time equation of state evolution ($w_0 \\approx -0.85$) required to alleviate the Hubble tension while protecting the field mass $m \\sim H_0$ through approximate shift symmetry."

Starting from self-dual Yang--Mills configurations, we restrict to \\emph{symmetric instantons} with spatial rotation symmetry so that dimensional reduction preserves conformal equivalence. This requirement maps $\\mathbb{R}^4$ to curved backgrounds with compact directions and, in particular, identifies the reduced configurations with (i) hyperbolic magnetic monopoles of Atiyah type on $H^3\\simeq \\mathrm{AdS}_3$ (from an $SO(2)\\simeq S^1$ symmetry) and (ii) hyperbolic vortices of Witten--Manton type on $H^2\\simeq \\mathrm{AdS}_2$ (from an $SO(3)\\simeq SU(2)$ symmetry). We provide an explicit field map relating the monopole and vortex variables, enabling a unified treatment of these defects within the original four-dimensional setting. Moreover, the hyperbolic monopole on $H^3$ is completely determined by its holographic data on the conformal boundary $S^2_\\infty$, which reduces a non-Abelian Wilson loop placed on $\\partial H^3$ to an Abelian loop determined by the vortex $U(1)$ field (Abelian dominance and monopole dominance), without further dynamical assumptions beyond the symmetry reduction. In the semiclassical dilute-gas regime of these finite-action defects, the framework yields the Wilson area law, thereby providing analytic support for the dual-superconductor picture of confinement."

To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework with adaptive memory allocation and global noise filtering called MacVQA for visual question answering. MacVQA fuses visual and question information while filtering noise to ensure robust representations, and employs prototype-based memory allocation to optimize feature quality and memory usage. These designs enable MacVQA to balance knowledge acquisition, retention, and compositional generalization in continual VQA learning. Experiments on ten continual VQA tasks show that MacVQA outperforms existing baselines, achieving 43.38% average accuracy and 2.32% average forgetting on standard tasks, and 42.53% average accuracy and 3.60% average forgetting on novel composition tasks."

Most approaches rely on fixed output heads and bespoke tracking pipelines, making them difficult to extend to more complex or instruction-driven tasks. To address these limitations, we propose AR-MOT, a novel autoregressive paradigm that formulates MOT as a sequence generation task within a large language model (LLM) framework. This design enables the model to output structured results through flexible sequence construction, without requiring any task-specific heads. To enhance region-level visual perception, we introduce an Object Tokenizer based on a pretrained detector. To mitigate the misalignment between global and regional features, we propose a Region-Aware Alignment (RAA) module, and to support long-term tracking, we design a Temporal Memory Fusion (TMF) module that caches historical object tokens. AR-MOT offers strong potential for extensibility, as new modalities or instructions can be integrated by simply modifying the output sequence format without altering the model architecture. Extensive experiments on MOT17 and DanceTrack validate the feasibility of our approach, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while laying the foundation for more general and flexible MOT systems."

Hyperbolic geometry naturally provides tree-like relationships between embeddings, enabling us to guide the action label denoising process in a coarse-to-fine manner: higher diffusion timesteps are influenced by abstract, high-level action categories (root nodes), while lower timesteps are refined using fine-grained action classes (leaf nodes).

    "abstract": "Autonomous path planning requires a synergy between global reasoning and geometric precision, especially in complex or cluttered environments. While classical A* is valued for its optimality, it incurs prohibitive computational and memory costs in large-scale scenarios. Recent attempts to mitigate these limitations by using Large Language Models for waypoint guidance remain insufficient, as they rely only on text-based reasoning without spatial grounding. As a result, such models often produce incorrect waypoints in topologically complex environments with dead ends, and lack the perceptual capacity to interpret ambiguous physical boundaries. These inconsistencies lead to costly corrective expansions and undermine the intended computational efficiency. We introduce MMP-A*, a multimodal framework that integrates the spatial grounding capabilities of vision-language models with a novel adaptive decay mechanism. By anchoring high-level reasoning in physical geometry, the framework produces coherent waypoint guidance that addresses the limitations of text-only planners. The adaptive decay mechanism dynamically regulates the influence of uncertain waypoints within the heuristic, ensuring geometric validity while substantially reducing memory overhead. To evaluate robustness, we test the framework in challenging environments characterized by severe clutter and topological complexity. Experimental results show that MMP-A* achieves near-optimal trajectories with significantly reduced operational costs, demonstrating its potential as a perception-grounded and computationally efficient paradigm for autonomous navigation."

Furthermore, we review emerging benchmarks that move the evaluation from pixel-level accuracy to trajectory-aware reasoning correctness. By critically examining limitations in grounding, safety, and orchestration, this work outlines a strategic roadmap for the development of robust, autonomous geospatial intelligence."

    "abstract": "The time-space fractional cable equation arises from extending the generalized fractional Ohm's law to model anomalous diffusion processes. In this paper, we develop and analyze a numerical approximation for stochastic nonlinear time-space fractional cable equation driven by rough noise. The model involves both two nonlocal terms in time and one in space. By an operator theoretic approach, we establish the existence, uniqueness, and regularities of solutions. We also obtain a convergence result for the regularized equation via Wong-Zakai approximation to regularize the rough noise. The numerical scheme approximates the model in space by the standard spectral Galerkin method and in time by the backward Euler convolution quadrature method. After that, error estimates are established."

We systematically derived the one-phase periodic solutions and the corresponding Whitham equations. For all feasible initial discontinuous conditions, we delineate a classification of wave structures during the evolutionary process by virtue of the initial distribution of Riemann invariants, including both convex and non-convex cases. In this classification, we find that the evolved wave structures in non-convex cases incorporate an additional and more complex region-contact DSW region, compared with those in convex cases. So we analyze the propagation behavior of this region. Additionally, we also take into account the problem that the initial wave at the instant of wave breaking approximated by the cubic root function, and elaborately analyze the propagation of photons in optical fibers under the effects of high-order dispersion and quintic nonlinearity."

Some recent works recognize that visual perception is a bottleneck in visual mathematical reasoning, but their solutions are limited to improving the extraction and interpretation of visual inputs. Notably, they all ignore the key issue of whether the extracted visual cues are faithfully integrated and properly utilized in subsequent reasoning. Motivated by this, we present CogFlow, a novel cognitive-inspired three-stage framework that incorporates a knowledge internalization stage, explicitly simulating the hierarchical flow of human reasoning: perception$\\Rightarrow$internalization$\\Rightarrow$reasoning. Inline with this hierarchical flow, we holistically enhance all its stages. We devise Synergistic Visual Rewards to boost perception capabilities in parametric and semantic spaces, jointly improving visual information extraction from symbols and diagrams. To guarantee faithful integration of extracted visual cues into subsequent reasoning, we introduce a Knowledge Internalization Reward model in the internalization stage, bridging perception and reasoning. Moreover, we design a Visual-Gated Policy Optimization algorithm to further enforce the reasoning is grounded with the visual knowledge, preventing models seeking shortcuts that appear coherent but are visually ungrounded reasoning chains. Moreover, we contribute a new dataset MathCog for model training, which contains samples with over 120K high-quality perception-reasoning aligned annotations. Comprehensive experiments and analysis on commonly used visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks validate the superiority of the proposed CogFlow."

For the dynamical modelling, we used the updated parallel N-body code phi-GPU, including stellar evolution. We prepared three sets of GC models with different half-mass radii (r_hm), each consisting of 50 full N-body GC models, and integrated these models in an external, time-variable MW-like potential taken from the cosmological database IllustrisTNG-100. The simulations cover the time interval from -10 Gyr to -5 Gyr, enabling us to assess the rate of early stellar accretion onto the proto-NSC. We find that GC models with average orbital eccentricities of 0.4-0.5 and orbits oriented perpendicular to the galactic disc contribute most significantly to the mass of the proto-NSC formation. Accretion is especially efficient in the first billion years and in compact GC models with r_hm = 1 pc. In all sets, the dominant accreted stellar population consists of low-mass stars (~0.33 Msun). However, the accreted mass alone is insufficient to fully account for the current NSC mass. Based on our extended set of numerical simulations, we obtained an average lower limit of mass contribution (~6 percent) to the NSC from investigated GCs. The fraction of mass contribution from individual disrupted GCs can significantly vary from 0.1 percent up to 90 percent. Generally, we conclude that the GC stellar accretion channel alone might not be sufficient to ensure the present-day MW galaxy NSC mass budget."

Falcon-H1R stands out for its parameter efficiency, consistently matching or outperforming SOTA reasoning models that are $2\\times$ to $7\\times$ larger across a variety of reasoning-intensive benchmarks. These results underscore the importance of careful data curation and targeted training strategies (via both efficient SFT and RL scaling) in delivering significant performance gains without increasing model size. Furthermore, Falcon-H1R advances the 3D limits of reasoning efficiency by combining faster inference (through its hybrid-parallel architecture design), token efficiency, and higher accuracy. This unique blend makes Falcon-H1R-7B a practical backbone for scaling advanced reasoning systems, particularly in scenarios requiring extensive chain-of-thoughts generation and parallel test-time scaling. Leveraging the recently introduced DeepConf approach, Falcon-H1R achieves state-of-the-art test-time scaling efficiency, offering substantial improvements in both accuracy and computational cost. As a result, Falcon-H1R demonstrates that compact models, through targeted model training and architectural choices, can deliver robust and scalable reasoning performance."

    "abstract": "We present a quantitative spectroscopic and kinematic analysis of a volume-complete sample of hot subluminous stars within 500 pc of the Sun, assembled using accurate parallax measurements from Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3). In total, 3226 spectra of 253 hot subdwarf stars were analysed to derive atmospheric parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity, and helium abundance) and radial velocities. Spectral energy distributions (SEDs) combined with Gaia parallaxes were used to measure stellar radii, luminosities, and masses. The derived atmospheric parameters reveal a consistent alignment between sdB and sdO stars in the Kiel diagram when compared to theoretical evolutionary models. We identify a population (about 10%) of hot subdwarfs located below the 0.45 Msun zero-age EHB in both the Kiel and Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams, which likely originate from intermediate-mass progenitors (1.8-8 Msun). The overall mass distribution peaks at 0.48 pm 0.12 Msun, while hot subdwarfs below the EHB peak at 0.43 pm 0.10 Msun, supporting non- or semi-degenerate helium ignition characteristic of intermediate-mass stars. Interpolation of EHB and post-EHB tracks yields mass distributions consistent with those derived from SEDs and parallaxes. Assuming a mass range between 0.40 and 0.50 Msun, we find that the post-EHB birthrate is 2-3 times higher than the EHB birthrate, suggesting overestimated EHB lifetimes or contamination from additional formation channels. Our kinematic analysis shows that 86 pm 2% of the stars belong to the Galactic thin disk, with 13 pm 1% and 1 pm 1% associated with the thick disk and halo. The below-EHB population is found exclusively in the thin disk, the only Galactic component young enough to host intermediate-mass progenitors. Its absence from other large samples suggests that non-degenerate formation channels play a more prominent role in the Galactic disk."

Systems like DiariZen leverage these rich single-channel representations, but are limited to single-channel audio, preventing the use of spatial cues available in multi-channel recordings. This work analyzes the impact of incorporating spatial information into a state-of-the-art single-channel diarization system by evaluating several strategies for conditioning the model on multi-channel spatial features. Experiments on meeting-style datasets indicate that spatial information can improve diarization performance, but the overall improvement is smaller than expected for the proposed system, suggesting that the features aggregated over all WavLM layers already capture much of the information needed for accurate speaker discrimination, also in overlapping speech regions. These findings provide insight into the potential and limitations of using spatial cues to enhance foundation model-based diarization."

These models are primarily guided through natural language prompts, making prompt engineering a critical factor in system performance and behavior. Despite their growing role in SE research, prompt-related decisions are rarely documented in a systematic or transparent manner, hindering reproducibility and comparability across studies. To address this gap, we conducted a two-phase empirical study. First, we analyzed nearly 300 papers published at the top-3 SE conferences since 2022 to assess how prompt design, testing, and optimization are currently reported. Second, we surveyed 105 program committee members from these conferences to capture their expectations for prompt reporting in LLM-driven research. Based on the findings, we derived a structured guideline that distinguishes essential, desirable, and exceptional reporting elements. Our results reveal significant misalignment between current practices and reviewer expectations, particularly regarding version disclosure, prompt justification, and threats to validity. We present our guideline as a step toward improving transparency, reproducibility, and methodological rigor in LLM-based SE research."

    "abstract": "Many real-world scale-free networks, such as neural networks and online communication networks, consist of a fixed number of nodes but exhibit dynamic edge fluctuations. However, traditional models frequently overlook scenarios where the node count remains constant, instead prioritizing node growth. In this work, we depart from the assumptions of node number variation and preferential attachment to present an innovative model that conceptualizes node degree fluctuations as a state-dependent random walk process with stasis and variable diffusion coefficient. We show that this model yields stochastic dynamic networks with stable scale-free properties. Through comprehensive theoretical and numerical analyses, we demonstrate that the degree distribution converges to a power-law distribution, provided that the lowest degree state within the network is not an absorbing state. Furthermore, we investigate the resilience of the fraction of the largest component and the average shortest path length following deliberate attacks on the network. By using three real-world networks, we confirm that the proposed model accurately replicates actual data. The proposed model thus elucidates mechanisms by which networks, devoid of growth and preferential attachment features, can still exhibit power-law distributions and be used to simulate and study the resilience of attacked fixed-size scale-free networks."

Existing approaches struggle to handle regional variations, numerical expressions, and generalize poorly to previously unseen words. To address these limitations, we propose BanglaIPA, a novel IPA generation system that integrates a character-based vocabulary with word-level alignment. The proposed system accurately handles Bengali numerals and demonstrates strong performance across regional dialects. BanglaIPA improves inference efficiency by leveraging a precomputed word-to-IPA mapping dictionary for previously observed words. The system is evaluated on the standard Bengali and six regional variations of the DUAL-IPA dataset. Experimental results show that BanglaIPA outperforms baseline IPA transcription models by 58.4-78.7% and achieves an overall mean word error rate of 11.4%, highlighting its robustness in phonetic transcription generation for the Bengali language."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a Wachspress-based transfinite formulation on convex polygonal domains for exact enforcement of Dirichlet boundary conditions in physics-informed neural networks. This approach leverages prior advances in geometric design such as blending functions and transfinite interpolation over convex domains. For prescribed Dirichlet boundary function $\\mathcal{B}$, the transfinite interpolant of $\\mathcal{B}$, $g : \\bar P \\to C^0(\\bar P)$, $\\textit{lifts}$ functions from the boundary of a two-dimensional polygonal domain to its interior. The trial function is expressed as the difference between the neural network's output and the extension of its boundary restriction into the interior of the domain, with $g$ added to it. This ensures kinematic admissibility of the trial function in the deep Ritz method. Wachspress coordinates for an $n$-gon are used in the transfinite formula, which generalizes bilinear Coons transfinite interpolation on rectangles to convex polygons. The neural network trial function has a bounded Laplacian, thereby overcoming a limitation in a previous contribution where approximate distance functions were used to exactly enforce Dirichlet boundary conditions. For a point $\\boldsymbol{x} \\in \\bar{P}$, Wachspress coordinates, $\\boldsymbolλ : \\bar P \\to [0,1]^n$, serve as a geometric feature map for the neural network: $\\boldsymbolλ$ encodes the boundary edges of the polygonal domain. This offers a framework for solving problems on parametrized convex geometries using neural networks. The accuracy of physics-informed neural networks and deep Ritz is assessed on forward, inverse, and parametrized geometric Poisson boundary-value problems."

    "abstract": "The proliferation of large-scale datasets poses a major computational challenge to model training. The traditional data subsampling method works as a static, task independent preprocessing step which usually discards information that is critical to downstream prediction. In this paper, we introduces the antagonistic soft selection subsampling (ASSS) framework as is a novel paradigm that reconstructs data reduction into a differentiable end-to-end learning problem. ASSS uses the adversarial game between selector network and task network, and selector network learning assigns continuous importance weights to samples. This direct optimization implemented by Gumbel-Softmax relaxation allows the selector to identify and retain samples with the maximum amount of information for a specific task target under the guidance of the loss function that balances the fidelity and sparsity of the prediction. Theoretical analysis links this framework with the information bottleneck principle. Comprehensive experiments on four large-scale real world datasets show that ASSS has always been better than heuristic subsampling baselines such as clustering and nearest neighbor thinning in maintaining model performance. It is worth noting that ASSS can not only match, but also sometimes exceed the training performance of the entire dataset, showcasing the effect of intelligent denoising. This work establishes task aware data subsampling as a learnable component, providing a principled solution for effective large-scale data learning."

However, the manual development of tool wrappers is a time-consuming, error-prone, and knowledge-intensive process. This bottleneck significantly affects the rapid deployment of new and updated tools, creating a gap between tool development and its availability to the scientific community. We have developed a novel, automated approach that directly translates Python tool interfaces into Galaxy-compliant tool wrappers. Our method leverages the argparse library, a standard for command-line argument parsing in Python. By embedding structured metadata within the metavar attribute of input and output arguments, our system programmatically parses the tool's interface to extract all necessary information. This includes parameter types, data formats, help text, and input/output definitions. The system then uses this information to automatically generate a complete and valid Galaxy tool XML wrapper, requiring no manual intervention. To validate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach, we applied it to the anvi'o framework, a comprehensive and complex bioinformatics platform comprising hundreds of individual programs. Our method successfully parsed the argparse definitions for the entire anvi'o suite and generated functional Galaxy tool wrappers. The resulting integration allows for the seamless execution of anvi'o workflows within the Galaxy environment. This work presents a significant advancement in the automation of tool integration for scientific workflow systems. By establishing a convention-based approach using Python's argparse library, we have created a scalable and generalizable solution that dramatically reduces the effort required to make command-line tools available in Galaxy."

Owing to its rapid spread characteristics, early and precise identification is crucial to prevent outbreaks and ensure timely intervention. In this paper, we propose a hybrid deep learning-based approach called LUMPNet for the early detection of LSD. LUMPNet utilizes image data to detect and classify skin nodules -- the primary indicator of LSD. To this end, LUMPNet uses YOLOv11, EfficientNet-based CNN classifier with compound scaling, and a novel adaptive hybrid optimizer. More precisely, LUMPNet detects and localizes LSD skin nodules and lesions on cattle images. It exploits EfficientNet to classify the localized cattle images into LSD-affected or healthy categories. To stabilize and accelerate the training of YOLOv11 and EfficientNet hybrid model, a novel adaptive hybrid optimizer is proposed and utilized. We evaluate LUMPNet at various stages of LSD using a publicly available dataset. Results indicate that the proposed scheme achieves 99% LSD detection training accuracy, and outperforms existing schemes. The model also achieves validation accuracy of 98%. Moreover, for further evaluation, we conduct a case study using an optimized EfficientNet-B0 model trained with the AdamW optimizer, and compare its performance with LUMPNet. The results show that LUMPNet achieves superior performance."

    "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often learn policies that achieve the same episodic return yet behave very differently, due to a combination of environmental (random transitions, initial conditions, reward noise) and algorithmic (minibatch selection, exploration noise) factors. In continuous control tasks, even small parameter shifts can produce unstable gaits, complicating both algorithm comparison and real-world transfer. Previous work has shown that such instability arises when policy updates traverse noisy neighborhoods and that the spread of post-update return distribution $R(θ)$, obtained by repeatedly sampling minibatches, updating $θ$, and measuring final returns, is a useful indicator of this noise. Although explicitly constraining the policy to maintain a narrow $R(θ)$ can improve stability, directly estimating $R(θ)$ is computationally expensive in high-dimensional settings. We propose an alternative that takes advantage of environmental stochasticity to mitigate update-induced variability. Specifically, we model state-action return distribution through a distributional critic and then bias the advantage function of PPO using higher-order moments (skewness and kurtosis) of this distribution. By penalizing extreme tail behaviors, our method discourages policies from entering parameter regimes prone to instability. We hypothesize that in environments where post-update critic values align poorly with post-update returns, standard PPO struggles to produce a narrow $R(θ)$. In such cases, our moment-based correction narrows $R(θ)$, improving stability by up to 75% in Walker2D, while preserving comparable evaluation returns."

Understanding how information, and its counterpart, uncertainty, propagates is central to predictability studies and has significant implications for applications such as forecast uncertainty quantification and risk management. It also offers valuable insight into the underlying physics of the system. Information propagation is closely linked to causality: how one part of a system influences another, and how some regions remain dynamically isolated. We apply this framework to the one-dimensional, highly nonlinear Kuramoto-Sivashinsky model and to the shallow-water equations, representing a mid-latitude atmospheric strip. Notably, we observe that information can propagate against the fluid flow, and that different model variables exhibit distinct patterns of information evolution. For example, pressure-related information propagates differently from relative vorticity, reflecting the influence of gravity waves versus balanced flow dynamics. This new framework offers a promising addition to the diagnostic tools available for studying complex dynamical systems."

By consolidating multimodal understanding and generation into a single model rather than separate modality-specific pipelines, HyperCLOVA X 8B Omni serves as an 8B-scale omni-pathfinding point toward practical any-to-any omni assistants. At a high level, the model unifies modalities through a shared next-token prediction interface over an interleaved multimodal sequence, while vision and audio encoders inject continuous embeddings for fine-grained understanding and grounding. Empirical evaluations demonstrate competitive performance against comparably sized models across diverse input-output combinations spanning text, audio, and vision, in both Korean and English. We anticipate that the open-weight release of HyperCLOVA X 8B Omni will support a wide range of research and deployment scenarios."

    "abstract": "Semantic communication (SemCom) improves communication efficiency by transmitting task-relevant information instead of raw bits and is expected to be a key technology for 6G networks. Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI) further enhance SemCom by enabling robust semantic encoding and decoding under limited channel conditions. However, these efficiency gains also introduce new security and privacy vulnerabilities. Due to the broadcast nature of wireless channels, eavesdroppers can also use powerful GenAI-based semantic decoders to recover private information from intercepted signals. Moreover, rapid advances in agentic AI enable eavesdroppers to perform long-term and adaptive inference through the integration of memory, external knowledge, and reasoning capabilities. This allows eavesdroppers to further infer user private behavior and intent beyond the transmitted content. Motivated by these emerging challenges, this paper comprehensively rethinks the security and privacy of SemCom systems in the age of generative and agentic AI. We first present a systematic taxonomy of eavesdropping threat models in SemCom systems. Then, we provide insights into how GenAI and agentic AI can enhance eavesdropping threats. Meanwhile, we also highlight potential opportunities for leveraging GenAI and agentic AI to design privacy-preserving SemCom systems."

    "abstract": "The experimental advances in realizing artificial spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and non-Hermitian potentials in ultracold atomic system open a new avenue for exploring their significant roles in quantum many-body physics. Here, we investigate a non-Hermitian, two-component Fermi system in a cubic lattice with Rashba SOC and complex-valued interaction arising from two-body loss. We adopt the non-Hermitian mean field theory and map out the phase diagram at zero temperature. The interplay of dissipation and on-site interaction drives a dissipation-induced phase transition from superfluid (SF) to normal phase (N). Notably, for weak interaction strengths, this leads to a reentrance of the superfluid state. The presence of SOC significantly expands the parameter regime for both the normal phase and the metastable superfluid phase(MSF). Whereas, the Zeeman field can drive the system from a conventional superfluid into a topological superfluid phase(TSF), characterized by a nontrivial topological invariant. These results enrich our knowledge of pairing superfluidity in Fermi systems."

    "abstract": "Issue assignment is a critical process in software maintenance, where new issue reports are validated and assigned to suitable developers. However, manual issue assignment is often inconsistent and error-prone, especially in large open-source projects where thousands of new issues are reported monthly. Existing automated approaches have shown promise, but many rely heavily on large volumes of project-specific training data or relational information that is often sparse and noisy, which limits their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose LIA (LLM-based Issue Assignment), which employs supervised fine-tuning to adapt an LLM, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B in this work, for automatic issue assignment. By leveraging the LLM's pretrained semantic understanding of natural language and software-related text, LIA learns to generate ranked developer recommendations directly from issue titles and descriptions. The ranking is based on the model's learned understanding of historical issue-to-developer assignments, using patterns from past tasks to infer which developers are most likely to handle new issues. Through comprehensive evaluation, we show that LIA delivers substantial improvements over both its base pretrained model and state-of-the-art baselines. It achieves up to +187.8% higher Hit@1 compared to the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B pretrained base model, and outperforms four leading issue assignment methods by as much as +211.2% in Hit@1 score. These results highlight the effectiveness of domain-adapted LLMs for software maintenance tasks and establish LIA as a practical, high-performing solution for issue assignment."

    "abstract": "Superspreading wetting is traditionally attributed to surfactant-driven mechanisms. However, recent observations of superspreading in surfactant-free nanofluids defy standard theoretical explanations. This study considers a data-driven approach to model droplet dynamics with the thickness of liquid films on the nanometer-micrometer scale in a compact form of a partial differential equation. We examine spatiotemporal film-thickness profiles resolved at the nanometer scale via phase-shifting imaging ellipsometry. For a pure solvent, the present governing equation recovers the classical lubrication physics driven by disjoining pressure and evaporation. In contrast, the nanofluid dynamics necessitates a unique transport term scaling with the gradient of the inverse film thickness. Theoretical analysis suggests this term represents a nanoparticle-induced bias flux, consistent with a hypothesized capillary wicking mechanism within the precursor film. The identification of the current nanofluid-specific term underscores the efficacy of integrating high-precision experimental measurements with data-driven modeling to unravel complex wetting dynamics."

    "abstract": "For satellites in the cislunar space, solar radiation pressure (SRP) is the third largest perturbation, which is only less significant than the lunisolar gravity perturbations. It is the primary factor limiting the accuracy of orbit determination for such satellites. Up to now, numerous SRP models have been proposed for artificial satellites close to the Earth, but these models have their shortcomings when applied to satellites in the cislunar space. In this study, we concentrate on various scenarios of cislunar satellites in periodic or quasi-periodic orbits. We first employ the box-wing model to simulate the SRP effects and then propose an appropriate general SRP model based on these simulations, termed Empirical NJU Cislunar Model (ENCM). Additionally, several scenario-specific sub-models suited to different mission profiles are developed. Furthermore, the proposed model is verified in the orbit determination process. Comparisons with the conventional cannonball and ECOM models demonstrate that the ENCM model yields a significant improvement in orbit determination accuracy, showing promising potential for future cislunar missions."

    "abstract": "Transcendental equations requiring iterative numerical solution pervade engineering practice, from fluid mechanics friction factor calculations to orbital position determination. We systematically evaluate whether Large Language Models can solve these equations through direct numerical prediction or whether a hybrid architecture combining LLM symbolic manipulation with classical iterative solvers proves more effective. Testing six state-of-the-art models (GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, Gemini-3-Flash, Gemini-2.5-Lite, Claude-Sonnet-4.5, Claude-Opus-4.5) on 100 problems spanning seven engineering domains, we compare direct prediction against solver-assisted computation where LLMs formulate governing equations and provide initial conditions while Newton-Raphson iteration performs numerical solution. Direct prediction yields mean relative errors of 0.765 to 1.262 across models, while solver-assisted computation achieves 0.225 to 0.301, representing error reductions of 67.9% to 81.8%. Domain-specific analysis reveals dramatic improvements in Electronics (93.1%) due to exponential equation sensitivity, contrasted with modest gains in Fluid Mechanics (7.2%) where LLMs exhibit effective pattern recognition. These findings establish that contemporary LLMs excel at symbolic manipulation and domain knowledge retrieval but struggle with precision-critical iterative arithmetic, suggesting their optimal deployment as intelligent interfaces to classical numerical solvers rather than standalone computational engines."

In addition, we investigate the interplay between ionized gas, molecular gas, and dust to probe how massive stars influence their parental clumps. We observed the $J_{K_aK_c}$ transitions of para-H2CO (within its J = 3-2 and 4-3 states) with the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) 12 m submillimeter telescope using the nFLASH230 and SEPIA345 receivers towards a sample of 61 HII regions. Spectral line parameters are derived via multi-component Gaussian fitting, which was then used to constrain the physical conditions determined using PyRADEX, a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) radiative transfer code in combination with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. The non-LTE analysis yielded kinetic temperatures ($T_{kin}$) ranging from 33.7 K to 265 K and H2 densities (n(H$_2$)) between 0.8 X $10^4$ to 1.05 X $10^7$ cm$^{-3}$, providing a detailed characterization of the dense molecular gas contained in these clumps. In addition to the para-H$_2$CO emission arising from the targeted clump a large fraction (57%) of the sources exhibit multiple para-H$_2$CO components, with the secondary components being characterized by higher $T_{kin}$ and broader linewidths. Investigating the nature of the secondary component revealed its association with supersonic non-thermal motions and turbulent gas. When comparing the physical properties of the molecular gas and dust components with those of the ionizing gas, we find that parameters directly linked to the central high-mass star such as bolometric luminosity and Lyman continuum photon rate, show stronger and more systematic correlations.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown groundbreaking capabilities across diverse multimodal tasks. However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial jailbreak attacks, where adversaries craft subtle perturbations to bypass safety mechanisms and trigger harmful outputs. Existing white-box attacks methods require full model accessibility, suffer from computing costs and exhibit insufficient adversarial transferability, making them impractical for real-world, black-box settings. To address these limitations, we propose a black-box jailbreak attack on LVLMs via Zeroth-Order optimization using Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (ZO-SPSA). ZO-SPSA provides three key advantages: (i) gradient-free approximation by input-output interactions without requiring model knowledge, (ii) model-agnostic optimization without the surrogate model and (iii) lower resource requirements with reduced GPU memory consumption. We evaluate ZO-SPSA on three LVLMs, including InstructBLIP, LLaVA and MiniGPT-4, achieving the highest jailbreak success rate of 83.0% on InstructBLIP, while maintaining imperceptible perturbations comparable to white-box methods. Moreover, adversarial examples generated from MiniGPT-4 exhibit strong transferability to other LVLMs, with ASR reaching 64.18%. These findings underscore the real-world feasibility of black-box jailbreaks and expose critical weaknesses in the safety mechanisms of current LVLMs"

    "abstract": "To address the challenges of wireless video transmission over multipath fading channels, we propose a robust deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) framework by effectively exploiting temporal redundancy and incorporating robust innovations at the modulation, coding, and decoding stages. At the modulation stage, tailored orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for robust video transmission is employed, decomposing wideband signals into orthogonal frequency-flat sub-channels to effectively mitigate frequency-selective fading. At the coding stage, conditional contextual coding with multi-scale Gaussian warped features is introduced to efficiently model temporal redundancy, significantly improving reconstruction quality under strict bandwidth constraints. At the decoding stage, a lightweight denoising module is integrated to robustly simplify signal restoration and accelerate convergence, addressing the suboptimality and slow convergence typically associated with simultaneously performing channel estimation, equalization, and semantic reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed robust framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art video DeepJSCC methods, achieving an average reconstruction quality gain of 5.13 dB under challenging multipath fading channel conditions."

This research focuses on enhancing MRI's role in medical imaging, especially in its application to guide intravascular interventions using robot-assisted devices. A newly developed computational system is introduced, designed for seamless integration with the MRI scanner, including a computational unit and user interface. This system processes MR images to delineate the vascular network, establishing virtual paths and boundaries within vessels to prevent procedural damage. Key findings reveal the system's capability to create tailored magnetic field gradient patterns for device control, considering the vessel's geometry and safety norms, and adapting to different blood flow characteristics for finer navigation. Additionally, the system's modeling aspect assesses the safety and feasibility of navigating pre-set vascular paths. Conclusively, this system, based on the Qt framework and C/C++, with specialized software modules, represents a major step forward in merging imaging technology with robotic aid, significantly enhancing precision and safety in intravascular procedures."

Typical SPT and SubSy boundary states decay exponentially into the bulk, which means they are not confined in just few lattice sites close to the boundary. Here, we introduce topologically compact edge states protected by SubSy, featuring extreme two-site localization at boundaries of a lattice, without any decay into the bulk. The compactness arises from local destructive interference at the boundary, while topological protection is ensured by SubSy, characterized by quantized winding numbers. Experimentally, we observe compact edge states in laser-written photonic lattices with engineered rhombic-like unit cells, confirming their robustness against perturbations under both chiral symmetry and SubSy conditions. Our results highlight the potential of SubSy protection for achieving topological confinement of light, paving the way for applications in compact waveguides, lasers, and high-sensitivity photonic sensors."

    "abstract": "First-Frame Propagation (FFP) offers a promising paradigm for controllable video editing, but existing methods are hampered by a reliance on cumbersome run-time guidance. We identify the root cause of this limitation as the inadequacy of current training datasets, which are often too short, low-resolution, and lack the task diversity required to teach robust temporal priors. To address this foundational data gap, we first introduce FFP-300K, a new large-scale dataset comprising 300K high-fidelity video pairs at 720p resolution and 81 frames in length, constructed via a principled two-track pipeline for diverse local and global edits. Building on this dataset, we propose a novel framework designed for true guidance-free FFP that resolves the critical tension between maintaining first-frame appearance and preserving source video motion. Architecturally, we introduce Adaptive Spatio-Temporal RoPE (AST-RoPE), which dynamically remaps positional encodings to disentangle appearance and motion references. At the objective level, we employ a self-distillation strategy where an identity propagation task acts as a powerful regularizer, ensuring long-term temporal stability and preventing semantic drift. Comprehensive experiments on the EditVerseBench benchmark demonstrate that our method significantly outperforming existing academic and commercial models by receiving about 0.2 PickScore and 0.3 VLM score improvement against these competitors."

In the present work, we additionally confirm that, for 21 of the 23 samples examined, Verlinde's emergent gravity follows the trend of the observed values within each dwarf spheroidal more closely than MOND. Combining the statistical significance of all the 23 samples, ranging from $-0.25σ$ to 3.41$σ$, we conclude that Verlinde's emergent gravity is favored over MOND at 5.2$σ$."

We argue that when embodied agents operate in human environments that are inherently social, multimodal, and fluid, reliability is contextually determined and only has meaning in relation to the goals and expectations of humans involved in the interaction. This calls for a fundamentally different approach to achieving reliable embodied AI that is centred on building and updating an accessible \"explicit world model\" representing the common ground between human and AI, that is used to align robot behaviours with human expectations."

Using halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling of the two-point angular correlation function, we trace the galaxy-halo relationships across the first billion years of cosmic history. Our analysis reveals that galaxies at $z = 10.6$ reside in dark matter halos over an order of magnitude less massive ($M_{\\rm{h}} \\sim 10^{10.12} M_{\\odot}$) than their counterparts at $z = 5.5$ ($M_{\\rm{h}} \\sim 10^{11.45} M_{\\odot}$), while exhibiting correspondingly higher effective bias values ($b_{\\rm{g}}^{\\rm{eff}} = 8.13^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$ compared to $5.64^{+0.10}_{-0.13}$). Correspondingly, the satellite galaxy fraction hints at a declining trend with decreasing redshift, reaching $<1\\%$ by $z \\sim 5-6$. However, the significant systematic and random uncertainties in the data-model comparison prevent us from drawing robust conclusions on the evolution - if any - of the satellite fraction during the epoch of reionization.

Deep learning models can detect diseases from leaf images with high accuracy, but these models are typically too large and computationally expensive to run on low-cost edge devices such as Raspberry Pi. Furthermore, collecting thousands of labeled disease images for training is both expensive and time-consuming. This paper addresses both challenges by combining neural network pruning -- removing unnecessary parts of the model -- with few-shot learning, which enables the model to learn from limited examples. This paper proposes Disease-Aware Channel Importance Scoring (DACIS), a method that identifies which parts of the neural network are most important for distinguishing between different plant diseases, integrated into a three-stage Prune-then-Meta-Learn-then-Prune (PMP) pipeline. Experiments on PlantVillage and PlantDoc datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces model size by 78\\% while maintaining 92.3\\% of the original accuracy, with the compressed model running at 7 frames per second on a Raspberry Pi 4, making real-time field diagnosis practical for smallholder farmers."

The lack of deployable techniques for ageing monitoring on these devices has spread the application of guard bands to prevent timing errors due to degradation. Applying this static technique can limit performance and lead to sudden failures as devices age. In this paper, we follow a software-based self-testing approach to design monitoring of hardware degradation for microcontrollers. Deployable in the field, our technique leverages timing windows of variable lengths to determine the maximum operational frequency of the devices. We empirically validate the method on real hardware and find that it consistently detects temperature-induced degradations in maximum operating frequency of up to 13.79 % across devices for 60 °C temperature increase."

Instead of relying on task-specific models or independent modules for each modality, VINO uses a shared diffusion backbone that conditions on text, images and videos, enabling a broad range of visual creation and editing tasks under one model. Specifically, VINO couples a vision-language model (VLM) with a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT), where multimodal inputs are encoded as interleaved conditioning tokens, and then used to guide the diffusion process. This design supports multi-reference grounding, long-form instruction following, and coherent identity preservation across static and dynamic content, while avoiding modality-specific architectural components. To train such a unified system, we introduce a multi-stage training pipeline that progressively expands a video generation base model into a unified, multi-task generator capable of both image and video input and output. Across diverse generation and editing benchmarks, VINO demonstrates strong visual quality, faithful instruction following, improved reference and attribute preservation, and more controllable multi-identity edits. Our results highlight a practical path toward scalable unified visual generation, and the promise of interleaved, in-context computation as a foundation for general-purpose visual creation."

However, it leads to another tension in the form of a factor of two correction in Hawking's temperature. This discrepancy is concerning because the Rindler temperature is universal and complies with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We demonstrate that the mismatch in the Boltzmann factor gets fixed if the state that forms the corresponding density matrix adopts a generalised thermofield double structure.

The complete decoding process can be performed using only the parity-check matrix, without requiring any other pre-constructed information (such as trellis diagrams or error-pattern lists), and it can also be customized by exploiting the algebraic properties of the code. We formally define error-building blocks, and derive a recursive theorem that allows efficient construction of larger locally optimal blocks from smaller ones, thereby effectively searching for the block associated with the most likely error pattern. The EBD framework is further optimized for extended Hamming codes as an example, through offline and online exclusion mechanisms, leading to a substantial complexity reduction without loss of ML performance. Complexity analysis shows that, for extended Hamming codes of lengths 64, 128, and 256, the fully optimized EBD requires approximately an order of magnitude fewer floating-point operations on average than minimum-edge trellis Viterbi decoding at a frame error rate of $10^{-3}$."

Estimates for these commutators play a central role in the analysis of the mean-field limit and fluctuations for systems of particles with pairwise Riesz interactions, which we start by reviewing. Our first new result shows that the usual $L^\\infty$ assumption on the gradient of the velocity field cannot, in general, be relaxed to a BMO assumption. We construct counterexamples in all dimensions and all Riesz singularities $-2< s<d$, except for the one-dimensional logarithmic endpoint $s=0$. At this exceptional endpoint, such a relaxation is possible, a fact related to the classical Coifman-Rochberg-Weiss commutator bound for the Hilbert transform. Our second result identifies a trade-off between the singularity of the interaction potential and the required regularity of the velocity field. Roughly speaking, smoother (less singular) interactions require stronger velocity control if one wants a commutator estimate in the natural energy seminorm determined by the potential. We formulate this principle for a broad class of potentials and show that, in the sub-Coulomb Riesz regime, the velocity regularity appearing in the known commutator inequality is sharp. Despite these negative findings, we show as our third result that a defective commutator estimate holds for almost-Lipschitz transport fields. Such a defective estimate, which is a consequence of the celebrated Brezis-Wainger-Hansson inequality, allows us to prove rates of convergence when the mean-field density belongs to the scaling-critical Sobolev space."

To address this, we present 360DVO, the first deep learning-based OVO framework. Our approach introduces a distortion-aware spherical feature extractor (DAS-Feat) that adaptively learns distortion-resistant features from 360-degree images.

Despite its rich cultural heritage, which dates back to the 15th century, Nawatl is a language with few computer resources. The problem is compounded when it comes to its dialectal varieties, with approximately 30 varieties recognised, not counting the different spellings in the written forms of the language. In this research work, we addressed the problem of classifying Nawatl varieties using Machine Learning and Neural Networks."

    "abstract": "The hyperfine interaction in the ground state of a hydrogen atom of assumed radius $R$ is proportional to $-1/R^3$, raising the question of why the hyperfine interaction does not lead to collapse of hydrogen, or positronium. We approach the problem in terms of a minimax variational calculation based on the exact Gordon solution of the Dirac equation for the hydrogen atom ground state. The full Dirac treatment leads to the result that in an assumed variational state of size $R$, when $R$ minimizes the total energy the magnetic moment of the electron assumes its usual value, $e\\hbar/2mc$, but when $R<\\hbar/mc$, the effective electron magnetic moment becomes essentially $eR/2$, softening the hyperfine interaction and eliminating an energy minumum at small $R$. The magnetic moment of the proton is similarly suppressed, and the hyperfine interaction of a small size atom becomes bounded by the kinetic energy, thus assuring stability. We extend the Dirac variational calculation to positronium where we find simple results for the ground state energy and hyperfiine interaction, and then extend this variational calculation to Coulombic atoms of two fermions of arbitrary masses. This paper also lays out a framework for treating diquarks as relativistic Coulombic systems, in the presence of color electric and magnetic interactions."

    "abstract": "The unique Galactic Center non-thermal filaments (NTFs) have been a focus of investigations for over 40 years. The most prominent manifestation of the NTFs is a bundle of parallel filaments known as the Radio Arc. Radio polarimetric observations made with the Very Large Array (VLA) at 10 GHz have revealed an alternating magnetic field pattern in the Radio Arc that could either be a result of multiple field systems being encountered along the line of sight or an intrinsic feature of the Radio Arc. These VLA observations were not able to distinguish between these possibilities due to the large rotation measures encountered towards the source. We present ALMA 100 GHz observations of the Radio Arc that are not impacted by significant Faraday effects. The observations reported here represent both the first time that ALMA has been used to study the NTFs and the first time 100 GHz polarimetric observations have been conducted on the Radio Arc. We find a uniformly rotated magnetic field with respect to the NTF filament orientation, with the angle of rotation being constant along the length of each filament. However, we find a systematically different magnetic field orientation in different Radio Arc filaments. We use this field pattern to update our understanding of the line-of-sight structures local to the Radio Arc. We find that the magnetic field inferred from our ALMA observations is likely a result either of confusion from multiple magnetic field systems or because the polarization is centrally concentrated within the NTF filaments."

    "abstract": "Estimation of brain functional connectivity from EEG data is of great importance both for medical research and diagnosis. It involves quantifying the conditional dependencies among the activity of different brain areas from the time-varying electric field recorded by sensors placed outside the scalp. These dependencies may vary within and across individuals and be influenced by covariates such as age, mental status, or disease severity. Motivated by this problem, we propose a novel neighbour selection approach based on functional-on-functional regression for the characterization of conditional Gaussian functional graphical models. We provide a fully automated, data-driven procedure for inferring conditional dependence structures among observed functional variables. In particular, pairwise interactions are directly identified and allowed to vary as a function of covariates, enabling covariate-specific modulation of connectivity patterns. Our proposed method accommodates an arbitrary number of continuous and discrete covariates. Moreover, unlike existing methods for direct estimation of differential graphical models, the proposed approach yields directly interpretable coefficients, allowing discrimination between covariate-induced increases and decreases in interaction strength. The methodology is evaluated through extensive simulation studies and an application to experimental EEG data. The results demonstrate clear advantages over existing approaches, including higher estimation accuracy and substantially reduced computational cost, especially in high-dimensional settings."

This paper presents a comprehensive dataset collected from a three-phase asynchronous motor under various fault types and severities, operating under diverse speed and load conditions. The dataset includes both single faults and mechanical-electrical compound faults, such as rotor unbalance, stator winding short circuits, bearing faults, and their combinations.

NaD absorption profiles reveal that 3 out of 13 exhibit blueshifted absorption indicative of outflows, and a further 2 objects show signs of inflowing gas.

This result holds when we include comparable objects from recent literature. We derive mass outflow rates over two orders of magnitude higher than current levels of star formation in our sample, indicating that the winds are unlikely to be driven by supernovae, and likely play a significant role in keeping the galaxies quenched. The majority of the outflow sample have anomalously high energy and momentum outflow rates compared to those predicted for current levels of star formation or AGN activity. We conclude that we are likely observing fossil outflows driven by previous, more luminous AGN activity which has since faded. We then compare with the EAGLE simulation to explore a potential 'outflow cycle', finding that our observations are consistent with a model in which z $\\sim$ 3 quiescent galaxies undergo short $\\simeq$ 5 Myr periods of AGN activity strong enough to drive outflows, which occur every $\\simeq$ 40 Myr on average.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that POSEIDON achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks, outperforming gradient boosting, random forest, and CNN baselines with the highest average F1 score among all compared methods. Crucially, the learned physics parameters converge to scientifically interpretable values -- Gutenberg-Richter b-value of 0.752 and Omori-Utsu parameters p=0.835, c=0.1948 days -- falling within established seismological ranges while enhancing rather than compromising predictive accuracy.

    "abstract": "Benign termination, in which magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities deconfine runaway electrons (REs) following hydrogenic injections, is a promising strategy for mitigating dangerous RE loads after disruptions. Recent experiments on the Joint European Torus (JET) have explored this scenario at higher pre-disruptive plasma currents than are achievable on other devices, revealing challenges in obtaining benign terminations at $I_p \\geq 2.5$ MA. This work analyzes the evolution of these high-current RE beams and their terminating MHD events using fast magnetic sensor measurements and EFIT equilibrium reconstructions for approximately $40$ JET and $20$ DIII-D tokamak discharges. On JET, unsuccessful non-benign terminations occur at low edge safety factor ($q_{\\text{edge}} \\approx 2$), and are preceded by intermittent, non-terminating MHD events at higher rational $q_{\\text{edge}}$. Trends in the internal inductance $l_i$ indicate more peaked RE current profiles in the high-$I_p$ non-benign population, which may hinder successful recombination through re-ionization. In contrast, benign terminations on JET typically occur at higher $q_{\\text{edge}} \\geq 3$ and exhibit less peaked RE current profiles. DIII-D displays a range of terminating edge safety factors, correlated with the measured $l_i$ values. Across both tokamaks, the RE current peaking is therefore found to determine which MHD instability boundary is encountered, confirmed by linear resistive MHD modeling with the CASTOR3D code. Measured growth rates are similar for benign and non-benign cases, indicating that ideal MHD timescales at low density after hydrogenic injection do not alone explain efficient RE deconfinement. Instead, non-benign cases are characterized by their lower MHD perturbation amplitudes $δB$. These observations suggest that the interplay between ideal and resistive dynamics governs the termination process."

    "abstract": "Multimodal object detection leveraging RGB and Infrared (IR) images is pivotal for robust perception in all-weather scenarios. While recent adapter-based approaches efficiently transfer RGB-pretrained foundation models to this task, they often prioritize model efficiency at the expense of cross-modal structural consistency. Consequently, critical structural cues are frequently lost when significant domain gaps arise, such as in high-contrast or nighttime environments. Moreover, conventional static multimodal fusion mechanisms typically lack environmental awareness, resulting in suboptimal adaptation and constrained detection performance under complex, dynamic scene variations. To address these limitations, we propose SLGNet, a parameter-efficient framework that synergizes hierarchical structural priors and language-guided modulation within a frozen Vision Transformer (ViT)-based foundation model. Specifically, we design a Structure-Aware Adapter to extract hierarchical structural representations from both modalities and dynamically inject them into the ViT to compensate for structural degradation inherent in ViT-based backbones. Furthermore, we propose a Language-Guided Modulation module that exploits VLM-driven structured captions to dynamically recalibrate visual features, thereby endowing the model with robust environmental awareness. Extensive experiments on the LLVIP, FLIR, KAIST, and DroneVehicle datasets demonstrate that SLGNet establishes new state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on the LLVIP benchmark, our method achieves an mAP of 66.1, while reducing trainable parameters by approximately 87% compared to traditional full fine-tuning. This confirms SLGNet as a robust and efficient solution for multimodal perception."

We formulate the dispatch decision problem of a profit-maximizing WDP, capturing operational, technological, and market-based coupling between water and electricity flows. The threshold-based structure we derive provides computationally tractable coordination suitable for large-scale deployment, offering operational insights into how thermal generation and membrane-based loads complementarily provide continuous bidirectional flexibility. The thresholds are analytically characterized in closed form as explicit functions of technology and tariff parameters. We examine how small changes in the exogenous tariff and technology parameters affect the WDP's profit. Extensive simulations illustrate the optimal WDP's operation, profit, and water-electricity exchange, demonstrating significant improvements relative to benchmark algorithms."

For pure bipartite states, the witnesses yield lower bounds on entanglement measures, thereby outperforming most linear steering inequalities in the pure-state regime. Moreover, the construction extends in full generality to certify measurement and instrument incompatibility, where the witnesses act as genuine incompatibility monotones. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach with two operationally relevant functionals: the Wigner-Yanase skew information and an $\\ell_{2}$-type coherence functional."

Diffusion language models (DLMs) promise parallel generation but suffer from a fundamental static-to-dynamic misalignment: Training optimizes local transitions under fixed schedules, whereas efficient inference requires adaptive \"long-jump\" refinements through unseen states. Our goal is to enable highly parallel decoding for DLMs with low number of function evaluations while preserving generation quality. To achieve this, we propose CD4LM, a framework that decouples training from inference via Discrete-Space Consistency Distillation (DSCD) and Confidence-Adaptive Decoding (CAD). Unlike standard objectives, DSCD trains a student to be trajectory-invariant, mapping diverse noisy states directly to the clean distribution. This intrinsic robustness enables CAD to dynamically allocate compute resources based on token confidence, aggressively skipping steps without the quality collapse typical of heuristic acceleration. On GSM8K, CD4LM matches the LLaDA baseline with a 5.18x wall-clock speedup; across code and math benchmarks, it strictly dominates the accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier, achieving a 3.62x mean speedup while improving average accuracy.

FMVP physically shatters global adversarial structures via a masking strategy and reconstructs clean video dynamics using Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) with an inpainting objective. To further decouple semantic content from adversarial noise, we design a Frequency-Gated Loss (FGL) that explicitly suppresses high-frequency adversarial residuals while preserving low-frequency fidelity.

Specifically, we introduce three innovations for quantized equivariant transformers: (1) a magnitude-direction decoupled quantization scheme that separately quantizes the norm and orientation of equivariant (vector) features, (2) a branch-separated quantization-aware training strategy that treats invariant and equivariant feature channels differently in an attention-based $SO(3)$-GNN, and (3) a robustness-enhancing attention normalization mechanism that stabilizes low-precision attention computations. Experiments on the QM9 and rMD17 molecular benchmarks demonstrate that our 8-bit models achieve accuracy on energy and force predictions comparable to full-precision baselines with markedly improved efficiency. We also conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each component to maintain accuracy and equivariance under quantization, using the Local error of equivariance (LEE) metric. The proposed techniques enable the deployment of symmetry-aware GNNs in practical chemistry applications with 2.37--2.73x faster inference and 4x smaller model size, without sacrificing accuracy or physical symmetry."

To understand the internal mechanism of MMDiT-based models, existing methods tried to analyze the effect of specific components like positional encoding and attention layers. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of how different blocks and their interactions with textual conditions contribute to the synthesis process remains elusive. In this paper, we first develop a systematic pipeline to comprehensively investigate each block's functionality by removing, disabling and enhancing textual hidden-states at corresponding blocks. Our analysis reveals that 1) semantic information appears in earlier blocks and finer details are rendered in later blocks, 2) removing specific blocks is usually less disruptive than disabling text conditions, and 3) enhancing textual conditions in selective blocks improves semantic attributes. Building on these observations, we further propose novel training-free strategies for improved text alignment, precise editing, and acceleration. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our method outperforms various baselines and remains flexible across text-to-image generation, image editing, and inference acceleration. Our method improves T2I-Combench++ from 56.92% to 63.00% and GenEval from 66.42% to 71.63% on SD3.5, without sacrificing synthesis quality.

Yet, the performance of pathology foundation models across magnifications and the effect of magnification sampling during training remain poorly understood. We model magnification sampling as a multi-source domain adaptation problem and develop a simple theoretical framework that reveals systematic trade-offs between sampling strategies. We show that the widely used discrete uniform sampling of magnifications (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 mpp) leads to degradation at intermediate magnifications. We introduce continuous magnification sampling, which removes gaps in magnification coverage while preserving performance at standard scales. Further, we derive sampling distributions that optimize representation quality across magnification scales. To evaluate these strategies, we introduce two new benchmarks (TCGA-MS, BRACS-MS) with appropriate metrics. Our experiments show that continuous sampling substantially improves over discrete sampling at intermediate magnifications, with gains of up to 4 percentage points in balanced classification accuracy, and that optimized distributions can further improve performance. Finally, we evaluate current histopathology foundation models, finding that magnification is a primary driver of performance variation across models. Our work paves the way towards future pathology foundation models that perform reliably across magnifications."

Conversely, shallow networks (e.g., AlexNet, VGG) offer efficiency but fail to distinguish visually similar sub-categories. This is because standard Global Average Pooling (GAP) heads capture only first-order statistics, missing the subtle high-order feature interactions required for FGVC. While Bilinear CNNs address this, they suffer from high feature dimensionality and instability during training. To bridge this gap, we propose the Quantum-inspired Interaction Classifier (QuIC). Drawing inspiration from quantum mechanics, QuIC models feature channels as interacting quantum states and captures second-order feature covariance via a learnable observable operator. Designed as a lightweight, plug-and-play module, QuIC supports stable, single-stage end-to-end training without exploding feature dimensions. Experimental results demonstrate that QuIC significantly revitalizes shallow backbones: it boosts the Top-1 accuracy of VGG16 by nearly 20% and outperforms state-of-the-art attention mechanisms (SE-Block) on ResNet18. Qualitative analysis, including t-SNE visualization, further confirms that QuIC resolves ambiguous cases by explicitly attending to fine-grained discriminative features and enforcing compact intra-class clustering."

    "abstract": "Due to the non-renormalizability of continuum gravity, the perturbative expansion makes sense, say, for its discrete simplicial (Regge calculus) version. The finite-difference form of the gravity action has diffeomorphism symmetry at leading order over metric variations from site to site, and we add a term bilinear in $n^λ( g_{λμ} - g_{λμ}^{(0 ) } )$, $n^λ= [ 1, - \\varepsilon ( Δ^{(s ) α} Δ^{(s ) }_α)^{- 1} Δ^{(s ) β} ]$, to \"softly\" fix the synchronous gauge $g_{0 λ} = g_{0 λ}^{(0 ) } = - δ_{0 λ}$ at $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, thereby resolving singularities at $p_0 = 0$. For the symmetric form of the derivative $Δ^{(s ) }_λ$, the propagator has a graviton pole at $p_0$ close to 0 or $\\pm π$ at small $p_α$. This pole doubling compared to the continuum case is removed by using the action $\\check{S}_{\\rm g}$ with the usual derivative $Δ_λ= \\exp ( i p_λ) - 1$ instead of $Δ^{(s ) }_λ= i \\sin p_λ$ in some terms, including in the $k$ part of some term, and $Δ^{(s ) }_λ$ in the $1 - k$ part of that term. Given the propagator $\\check{G} ( n, \\overline{n} )$, we form the principal value type propagator $\\frac{1}{2} [ \\check{G} ( n, n ) + \\check{G} ( \\overline{n}, \\overline{n} ) ]$ by analytically continuing from real $n$. Singularities are roughly resolved as $p_0^{-j} \\Rightarrow [ (p_0 + i \\varepsilon )^{-j} + (p_0 - i \\varepsilon )^{-j} ] / 2$. We find that it is $k = 1$ that provides this prescription to properly work and match the continuum case. The gauge-fixing term required for this propagator and its finiteness are considered; the ghost contribution is found to vanish at $\\varepsilon \\to 0$. The results are used for the diagram technique in our recent paper. The calculations are illustrated by the electromagnetic (Yang-Mills) case."

We prove square function inequalities for ergodic averages arising from actions of groups of polynomial volume growth on a fixed noncommutative $L_p$-space for $1<p<\\8$. To achieve this, we establish two endpoint estimates for a noncommutative square function on non-homogeneous space. Our approach relies on semi-commutative non-homogeneous harmonic analysis, including the non-doubling Calderón-Zygmund arguments for non-smooth kernels and $\\mathrm{BMO}$ space theory, operator-valued inequalities related to balls and cubes in groups equipped with non-doubling measures, and a noncommutative generalization of the classical transference method for amenable group actions. As an application, we establish a quantitative ergodic theorem for the ergodic averages associated with the positive power of modulus representation arising from a Lamperti representation on noncommutative $L_p$-spaces, extending some results in \\cite{Templeman2015}. To obtain quantitative ergodic theorem for semigroups of operators, in this paper, we address the open question of extending dilation theorem of Fackler-Glück from single operators to commuting tuples on Banach spaces including noncommutative $L_p$-spaces. Indeed our approach provides genuine joint $N$-dilations for commuting families, unifying and extending the classical dilation theorems of Sz.-Nagy--Foiaş and Akçoglu--Sucheston for a natural class of commuting tuple of contractions extending the abstract dilation theorem of of Fackler-Glück for commuting tuple of contractions.

In this theoretical work, a statistical model of relaxation by recurrent fluorescence is formally developed, including Herzberg-Teller and Duschinsky rotation effects as well as a full account of vibrational progressions. Using canonical and harmonic approximations, the RF rate constants can be determined from the transition dipole moment time autocorrelation functions. Application to the naphthalene, anthracene, and pyrene cations is presented based on quantum chemical inputs obtained from time-dependent density-functional theory. For these highly symmetric molecules, the low-lying, symmetry-forbidden electronic excited states are predicted to contribute possibly even more than higher energy, non-forbidden states. Such an unexpected contribution could increase the cooling efficiency of PAHs and, in turn, stabilize them further under the highly ionized environments of the ISM."

    "abstract": "We consider here several aspects of the following challenging question: is it possible to use a passive cloak to make invisible a dielectric inclusion on a finite frequency interval in the quasistatic regime of Maxwell's equations for an observer close to the object? In this work, by considering the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map, we not only answer negatively this question, but we go further and provide some quantitative bounds on this map that provide fundamental limits to both cloaking as well as approximate cloaking. These bounds involve the following physical parameters: the length and center of the frequency interval, the volume of the cloaking device, the volume of the obstacle, and the relative permittivity of the object. Our approach is based on two key tools: i) variational principles from the abstract theory of composites and ii) the analytic approach to deriving bounds from sum rules for passive systems. To use i), we prove a new representation theorem for the DtN map which allows us to interpret this map as an effective operator in the abstract theory of composites. One important consequence of this representation is that it allows one to incorporate the broad and deep results from the theory of composites, such as variational principles, and to apply the bounds derived from them to the DtN map. These results could be useful in other contexts other than cloaking. Next, to use ii), we show that the passivity assumption allows us to connect the DtN map (as function of the frequency) with two important classes of analytic functions, namely, Herglotz and Stieltjes functions. The sum rules for these functions, combined with the variational approach, allows us to derive new inequalities on the DtN map which impose fundamental limitations on passive cloaking, both exact and approximate, over a frequency interval. We consider both cases of lossy and lossless cloaks."

We show that, with appropriate training, a deep vision-transformer network can efficiently memorize relation between Hamiltonian parameters and structures on conductance maps and use it to propose parameters update for a quantum dot chain that drive the system toward topological phase. Starting from a broad range of initial detunings in parameter space, a single update step is sufficient to generate nontrivial zero modes. Moreover, by enabling an iterative tuning procedure - where the system acquires updated conductance maps at each step - we demonstrate that the method can address a much larger region of the parameter space."

Existing debiasing approaches often address a single modality either visual or textual leading to partial robustness and unstable adaptation under distribution shifts. We propose a bilateral prompt optimization framework (BiPrompt) that simultaneously mitigates non-causal feature reliance in both modalities during test-time adaptation. On the visual side, it employs structured attention-guided erasure to suppress background activations and enforce orthogonal prediction consistency between causal and spurious regions. On the textual side, it introduces balanced prompt normalization, a learnable re-centering mechanism that aligns class embeddings toward an isotropic semantic space. Together, these modules jointly minimize conditional mutual information between spurious cues and predictions, steering the model toward causal, domain invariant reasoning without retraining or domain supervision. Extensive evaluations on real-world and synthetic bias benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in both average and worst-group accuracies over prior test-time debiasing methods, establishing a lightweight yet effective path toward trustworthy and causally grounded vision-language adaptation."

Applying redox potential sweeps (vs Ag/AgCl) using copper sulfate (CuSO4) solution on such sensor facilitates the CuNP embedding process inside the conjugated polymer matrix which has been further validated by supporting techniques. We predicted and validated the formation and contribution of two Cu-CT coordination complexes corresponding to Cu(I) and Cu(II) states, which are responsible for CT detection. The fabricated CT sensor exhibits high selectivity against major artificial urine interferents and is stable for a month showing minimal degradation (0.53%) in peak current value.

By constructing a conjugation map involving a time-dependent weight $ω(t)$ and a scale function $ψ(t)$, we define a new class of fractional operators that preserve the spectral tractability of time-invariant systems. We derive the Spectral Mapping Theorem for these operators and prove that Weighted Mittag-Leffler functions act as their fundamental eigenfunctions, demonstrating that the Weighted Fourier Transform naturally diagonalizes the associated evolution equations. As a physical application, we formulate a constitutive law for aging viscoelastic materials with infinite memory. Crucially, we analytically demonstrate the \"Amnesia Phenomenon\": we prove that rapid aging modulates the system's history, effectively transforming the hereditary power-law decay into a short-range exponential relaxation. This result provides a closed-form explanation for the loss of memory in fast-aging media, overcoming the computational bottlenecks of standard discretization methods."

    "abstract": "Marine oil spills are urgent environmental hazards that demand rapid and reliable detection to minimise ecological and economic damage. While Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery has become a key tool for large-scale oil spill monitoring, most existing detection methods rely on deep learning-based segmentation applied to single SAR images. These static approaches struggle to distinguish true oil spills from visually similar oceanic features (e.g., biogenic slicks or low-wind zones), leading to high false positive rates and limited generalizability, especially under data-scarce conditions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Oil Spill Change Detection (OSCD), a new bi-temporal task that focuses on identifying changes between pre- and post-spill SAR images. As real co-registered pre-spill imagery is not always available, we propose the Temporal-Aware Hybrid Inpainting (TAHI) framework, which generates synthetic pre-spill images from post-spill SAR data. TAHI integrates two key components: High-Fidelity Hybrid Inpainting for oil-free reconstruction, and Temporal Realism Enhancement for radiometric and sea-state consistency. Using TAHI, we construct the first OSCD dataset and benchmark several state-of-the-art change detection models. Results show that OSCD significantly reduces false positives and improves detection accuracy compared to conventional segmentation, demonstrating the value of temporally-aware methods for reliable, scalable oil spill monitoring in real-world scenarios."

Here, using the Manchester Inhomogeneous Radiation Chemistry by Linear Expansions (MIRaCLE) toolkit, we introduce and benchmark a novel approach to simulating these processes. Although the initial conditions are determined stochastically, the subsequent time evolution is calculated deterministically using a continuum representation, derived from those initial conditions. This hybrid approach essentially averages over many chemistry ``trajectories'' simultaneously, often converging to the 1% level in one shot, not requiring multiple runs. We demonstrate this new approach through the calculation of time-dependent G-values for e_{aq}^-$, \\dot{\\mathrm{OH}} and other radiolytic products, including at unprecedented dose rates where calculations which would take years with a conventional Monte Carlo approach can be performed in mere hours on a commercial laptop. We demonstrate that the main artifact of continuum modelling can be mitigated by a correction term.

In quantum information theory, the quantum mutual information, $I(A;B)$, is a measure of correlation between the subsystems $A,B$ in a quantum state, and is defined by the means of the von Neumann entropy: $I\\left(A;B\\right)=S\\left(ρ_{A}\\right)+S\\left(ρ_{B}\\right)-S\\left(ρ_{AB}\\right)$. However, such a computation requires an exponential amount of resources. This is a defining feature of quantum systems, the infamous ``curse of dimensionality'' . Other measures, which are based on Rényi divergences instead of von Neumann entropy, were suggested as alternatives in a recent paper showing them to possess important theoretical features, and making them leading candidates as mutual information measures. In this work, we concentrate on the maximal Rényi divergence. This measure can be shown to be the solution of a generalized eigenvalue problem. To calculate it efficiently for a 1D state represented as a matrix product state, we develop a generalized eigenvalue version of the density matrix renormalization group algorithm. We benchmark our method for the paradigmatic XXZ chain, and show that the maximal Rényi divergence may exhibit different trends than the von Neumann mutual information."

We show that photon propagation through an axion dark matter background in the presence of a magnetic field is governed by Floquet physics, distinct from conventional static or adiabatic mixing paradigms. Coherent photon-axion mode conversion occurs when the mismatch between the photon and axion dispersion relations is compensated by integer harmonics of the axion oscillation frequency, $Δ_γ- Δ_a \\approx n m_a$ ($n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$) with the axion mass $m_a$, even far from the standard level-crossing condition $Δ_γ\\approx Δ_a$. Crucially, this resonance disappears entirely if the axion oscillations are averaged over, and is therefore systematically missed in conventional static or adiabatic treatments. This driven resonance represents a unitary Floquet mode-mixing process and is fundamentally distinct from parametric instability or stimulated axion decay, preserving the axion dark matter number density. We develop a general Floquet framework for photon propagation in oscillating axion backgrounds, revealing that resonant mixing generates robust polarization effects during propagation. As an astrophysical application, we apply this mechanism to the realistic environment of the blazar 3C 279 to derive concrete constraints on the axion-photon coupling. While the observational manifestation depends on environmental conditions, the underlying driven mixing mechanism is generic to coherent axion dark matter, revealing a previously overlooked regime of photon-axion conversion."

The Fourier-domain analysis reveals alternating transparency/absorption and normal/anomalous dispersion with frequency-dependent sign reversals, enabling spectrally selective filtering and group-delay effects. Slow oscillatory behavior in the radio-frequency range makes the system suitable for weak magnetic-field sensing, while fast oscillations at optical frequencies suggest applications in spectral filtering and frequency-comb-like signal shaping.

In this work, we demonstrate that LLMs often fail to accurately measure input text length, leading to poor adherence to length constraints. To address this issue, we propose a novel length regulation approach that incorporates dynamic length feedback during generation, enabling adaptive adjustments to meet target lengths. Experiments on summarization and biography tasks show our training-free approach significantly improves precision in achieving target token, word, or sentence counts without compromising quality. Additionally, we demonstrate that further supervised fine-tuning allows our method to generalize effectively to broader text-generation tasks."

    "abstract": "End-to-end autonomous driving has rapidly progressed, enabling joint perception and planning in complex environments. In the planning stage, state-of-the-art (SOTA) end-to-end autonomous driving models decouple planning into parallel lateral and longitudinal predictions. While effective, this parallel design can lead to i) coordination failures between the planned path and speed, and ii) underutilization of the drive path as a prior for longitudinal planning, thus redundantly encoding static information. To address this, we propose a novel cascaded framework that explicitly conditions longitudinal planning on the drive path, enabling coordinated and collision-aware lateral and longitudinal planning. Specifically, we introduce a path-conditioned formulation that explicitly incorporates the drive path into longitudinal planning. Building on this, the model predicts longitudinal displacements along the drive path rather than full 2D trajectory waypoints. This design simplifies longitudinal reasoning and more tightly couples it with lateral planning. Additionally, we introduce a planning-oriented data augmentation strategy that simulates rare safety-critical events, such as vehicle cut-ins, by adding agents and relabeling longitudinal targets to avoid collision. Evaluated on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark, our method sets a new SOTA, achieving a driving score of 89.07 and a success rate of 73.18%, demonstrating significantly improved coordination and safety"

    "abstract": "Biclustering is an essential unsupervised machine learning technique for simultaneously clustering rows and columns of a data matrix, with widespread applications in genomics, transcriptomics, and other high-dimensional omics data. Despite its importance, existing biclustering methods struggle to meet the demands of modern large-scale datasets. The challenges stem from the accumulation of noise in high-dimensional features, the limitations of non-convex optimization formulations, and the computational complexity of identifying meaningful biclusters. These issues often result in reduced accuracy and stability as the size of the dataset increases. To overcome these challenges, we propose Sparse Convex Biclustering (SpaCoBi), a novel method that penalizes noise during the biclustering process to improve both accuracy and robustness. By adopting a convex optimization framework and introducing a stability-based tuning criterion, SpaCoBi achieves an optimal balance between cluster fidelity and sparsity. Comprehensive numerical studies, including simulations and an application to mouse olfactory bulb data, demonstrate that SpaCoBi significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy. These results highlight SpaCoBi as a robust and efficient solution for biclustering in high-dimensional and large-scale datasets."

    "abstract": "Modern recommender systems trained on domain-specific data often struggle to generalize across multiple domains. Cross-domain sequential recommendation has emerged as a promising research direction to address this challenge; however, existing approaches face fundamental limitations, such as reliance on overlapping users or items across domains, or unrealistic assumptions that ignore privacy constraints. In this work, we propose a new framework, MergeRec, based on model merging under a new and realistic problem setting termed data-isolated cross-domain sequential recommendation, where raw user interaction data cannot be shared across domains. MergeRec consists of three key components: (1) merging initialization, (2) pseudo-user data construction, and (3) collaborative merging optimization. First, we initialize a merged model using training-free merging techniques. Next, we construct pseudo-user data by treating each item as a virtual sequence in each domain, enabling the synthesis of meaningful training samples without relying on real user interactions. Finally, we optimize domain-specific merging weights through a joint objective that combines a recommendation loss, which encourages the merged model to identify relevant items, and a distillation loss, which transfers collaborative filtering signals from the fine-tuned source models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MergeRec not only preserves the strengths of the original models but also significantly enhances generalizability to unseen domains. Compared to conventional model merging methods, MergeRec consistently achieves superior performance, with average improvements of up to 17.21% in Recall@10, highlighting the potential of model merging as a scalable and effective approach for building universal recommender systems.

    "abstract": "Automatic pronunciation assessment plays a crucial role in computer-assisted pronunciation training systems. Due to the ability to perform multiple pronunciation tasks simultaneously, multi-aspect multi-granularity pronunciation assessment methods are gradually receiving more attention and achieving better performance than single-level modeling tasks. However, existing methods only consider unidirectional dependencies between adjacent granularity levels, lacking bidirectional interaction among phoneme, word, and utterance levels and thus insufficiently capturing the acoustic structural correlations. To address this issue, we propose a novel residual hierarchical interactive method, HIA for short, that enables bidirectional modeling across granularities. As the core of HIA, the Interactive Attention Module leverages an attention mechanism to achieve dynamic bidirectional interaction, effectively capturing linguistic features at each granularity while integrating correlations between different granularity levels. We also propose a residual hierarchical structure to alleviate the feature forgetting problem when modeling acoustic hierarchies. In addition, we use 1-D convolutional layers to enhance the extraction of local contextual cues at each granularity. Extensive experiments on the speechocean762 dataset show that our model is comprehensively ahead of the existing state-of-the-art methods."

Here, we focus on modeling fold-switching proteins, which remodel their secondary and/or tertiary structures and change their functions in response to cellular stimuli. These underrepresented members of the protein universe serve as test cases for a method's generalizability. They reveal that DL models often predict conformational ensembles by association with training-set structures, limiting generalizability. These observations suggest use cases for when DL methods will likely succeed or fail. Developing computational methods that successfully identify new fold-switching proteins from large pools of candidates may advance modeling conformational ensembles more broadly."

Its star formation history suggests that half of the stellar mass was in place $\\sim1\\,{\\rm Gyr}$ before the observed epoch, with quenching occurring $\\sim0.2\\,{\\rm Gyr}$ prior to $z=2.08$. These results confirm that AURORA-LQG1 is genuinely quenched, rather than in a temporary phase of suppressed star formation rate. AURORA-LQG1 is consistent with the mass fundamental plane at $z\\sim2$, previously constrained only by massive quiescent systems. Compared with more massive counterparts at the same epoch observed with NIRSpec grating spectroscopy, the time since quenching for AURORA-LQG1 is among the shortest observed. The galaxy resides in a possible dense group-scale ($\\sim50$ kpc) environment containing one companion with tentative spectroscopic redshift and five companion candidates, and it is embedded in a known protocluster on Mpc scales. A potential environmental influence on its evolution could explain the outside-in quenching suggested by the positive gradient of size with wavelength.

Recently, these two scenarios have been unified under a more general framework known as anyonic-PT symmetry, yet its physical implications in waveguide platforms and corresponding topological features in extended lattice systems remain largely unexplored. Here, the phase transitions and topological protection in anyonic-PT-symmetric systems are systematically investigated in waveguide lattices. In the symmetry-unbroken regime, the arguments of all bulk eigenvalues are constrained to two discrete values separated by π, leading to distinctive oscillatory propagation dynamics accompanied by controlled amplification or dissipation. In the case of one-dimensional lattice, the energy bands exhibit a gap closing and reopening during phase transition. Moreover, in the symmetry-unbroken regime, the topological edge states emerge within the bulk gap and are protected by a generalized pseudo-anyonic-Hermiticity (PAH) symmetry. Our results establish anyonic-PT symmetry as a new tunable degree of freedom for non-Hermitian waveguide systems, where the eigenvalue argument provides a natural quantity for information encoding. This work broadens the conceptual foundation of topological protection under generalized non-Hermitian symmetries."

Lateral optical forces, which act perpendicular to the direction of beam propagation, are particularly intriguing but have largely been restricted to interface geometries such as air - water boundaries. Here, we realize tunable lateral optical force entirely within a fluid environment by using Janus particles: dielectric microspheres half-coated with gold. We show that the lateral optical force arises from scattering asymmetry induced by the asymmetric structure of the particles; it can be tuned by adjusting the polarization angle of a linearly polarized beam, but also particle parameters including their size and orientation. Experimentally, we directly observe fully reversible lateral propulsion of Janus particles in water merely by rotating the polarization direction, in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. These results establish a new mechanism for programmable, polarization-controlled optical manipulation, with promising implications for biophotonics, microfluidics, and active soft-matter systems."

    "abstract": "Prediction markets are designed to aggregate dispersed information about future events, yet today's ecosystem is fragmented across heterogeneous operator-run platforms and blockchain-based protocols that independently list economically identical events. In the absence of a shared notion of event identity, liquidity fails to pool across venues, arbitrage becomes capital-intensive or unenforceable, and prices systematically violate the Law of One Price. As a result, market prices reflect platform-local beliefs rather than a single, globally aggregated probability, undermining the core information-aggregation function of prediction markets. We address this gap by introducing a semantic alignment framework that makes cross-platform event identity explicit through joint analysis of natural-language descriptions, resolution semantics, and temporal scope. Applying this framework, we construct the first human-validated, cross-platform dataset of aligned prediction markets, covering over 100 000 events across ten major venues from 2018 to 2025. Using this dataset, we show that roughly 6% of all events are concurrently listed across platforms and that semantically equivalent markets exhibit persistent execution-aware price deviations of 2-4% on average, even in highly liquid and information-rich settings. These mispricings give rise to persistent cross-platform arbitrage opportunities driven by structural frictions rather than informational disagreement. Overall, our results demonstrate that semantic non-fungibility is a fundamental barrier to price convergence, and that resolving event identity is a prerequisite for prediction markets to aggregate information at a global scale."

Due to the continuous nature of the marks, observations at each specific mark are sparse, making the identification and estimation of causality a challenging task. To address this issue, we define a new mark-specific treatment effect within the potential outcomes framework and characterize its identifying conditions. We then propose a local smoothing causal estimand and establish its asymptotic properties. We evaluate our method using simulation studies as well as a real dataset from the Antibody Mediated Prevention trials."

Beyond controlling steady-state production levels, allostery also regulates the timing and duration over which information is transmitted. By tuning the temporal operating regime of signaling pathways, allosteric regulation enables distinct dynamical outcomes from identical molecular components, providing a physical mechanism for temporal information flow, signaling specificity, and coordination without changes in metabolic pathways."

We demonstrate that the three-point trajectory available from a virtual reality (VR) device can effectively serve as a dancer's motion descriptor, simplifying the modeling and synthesis of interplay between dancers' full-body motions down to sparse trajectories. Thanks to the low dimensionality, we can employ an efficient MLP network to predict the follower's three-point trajectory directly from the leader's three-point input for certain types of ballroom dancing, addressing the challenge of modeling high-dimensional full-body interaction. It also prevents our method from overfitting thanks to its compact yet explicit representation. By leveraging the inherent structure of the movements and carefully planning the autoregressive procedure, we show a deterministic neural network is able to translate three-point trajectories into a virtual embodied avatar, which is typically considered under-constrained and requires generative models for common motions. In addition, we demonstrate this deterministic approach generalizes beyond small, structured datasets like ballroom dancing, and performs robustly on larger, more diverse datasets such as LaFAN. Our method provides a computationally- and data-efficient solution, opening new possibilities for immersive paired dancing applications.

Model performance was assessed using point cloud shape error (Hausdorff distance), surface deviation error, and landmark localization error (Euclidean distances of craniomaxillofacial landmarks) between predicted facial shapes and corresponding ground truths. A total of 135 patients who underwent combined orthodontic and orthognathic treatment were included for model training and validation. Quantitative analysis demonstrated that PhysSFI-Net achieved a point cloud shape error of 1.070 +/- 0.088 mm, a surface deviation error of 1.296 +/- 0.349 mm, and a landmark localization error of 2.445 +/- 1.326 mm.

To estimate hardware costs, we interpret our protocols as finite Markov processes. This viewpoint allows to cast the expected number of fusion measurements until success as a first passage problem. We then deploy a pipeline of polynomial algorithms to optimize arbitrary graph states, extract fusion networks and find beneficial orderings of fusions with the goal of lowering the corresponding mean first passage times. We evaluate our pipeline for different initial resource states and fusion mechanisms with varying success probabilities. Results show that our strategies can reduce the fusion overhead by several orders of magnitude when compared to simple repeat until success protocols, especially for realistic fusion success probabilities between 50-75 %."

    "abstract": "Pharmaceutical three-dimensional (3D) printing is an advanced fabrication technology with the potential to enable truly personalised dosage forms. Recent studies have integrated artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate formulation and process development, drastically transforming current approaches to pharmaceutical 3D printing. To date, most AI-driven efforts remain narrowly focused, while failing to account for the broader formulation challenges inherent to the technology. Recent advances in AI have introduced artificial general intelligence concepts, wherein systems extend beyond conventional predictive modelling toward more generalised, human-like reasoning. In this work, we investigate the application of large language models (LLMs), fine-tuned on a fused deposition modelling (FDM) dataset comprising over 1400 formulations, to recommend suitable excipients based on active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) dose, and predict filament mechanical properties. Four LLM architectures were fine-tuned, with systematic evaluation of both fine-tuning and generative parameter configurations. Our results demonstrate that Llama2 was best suited for recommending excipients for FDM formulations. Additionally, model selection and parameterisation significantly influence performance, with smaller LLMs exhibiting instances of catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, we demonstrate: (i) even with relatively small dataset of over 1400 formulations, it can lead to model catastrophic forgetting; (ii) standard LLM metrics only evaluate linguistic performance but not formulation processability; and (iii) LLMs trained on biomedically-related data do not always produce the best results. Addressing these challenges is essential to advancing LLMs beyond linguistic proficiency and toward reliable systems for pharmaceutical formulation development."

    "abstract": "Replication packages are crucial for enabling transparency, validation, and reuse in software engineering (SE) research. While artifact sharing is now a standard practice and even expected at premier SE venues such as ICSE, the practical usability of these replication packages remains underexplored. In particular, there is a marked lack of studies that comprehensively examine the executability and reproducibility of replication packages in SE research. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by evaluating 100 replication packages published as part of ICSE proceedings over the past decade (2015--2024). We assess the (1) executability of the replication packages, (2) efforts and modifications required to execute them, (3) challenges that prevent executability, and (4) reproducibility of the original findings. We spent approximately 650 person-hours in total executing the artifacts and reproducing the study findings. Our findings reveal that only 40\\% of the 100 evaluated artifacts were executable, of which 32.5\\% (13 out of 40) ran without any modification. Regarding effort levels, 17.5\\% (7 out of 40) required low effort, while 82.5\\% (33 out of 40) required moderate to high effort to execute successfully. We identified five common types of modifications and 13 challenges leading to execution failure, spanning environmental, documentation, and structural issues. Among the executable artifacts, only 35\\% (14 out of 40) reproduced the original results. These findings highlight a notable gap between artifact availability, executability, and reproducibility. Our study proposes three actionable guidelines to improve the preparation, documentation, and review of research artifacts, thereby strengthening the rigor and sustainability of open science practices in SE research."

    "abstract": "Access to reliable agricultural advisory remains limited in many developing regions due to a persistent language barrier: authoritative agricultural manuals are predominantly written in English, while farmers primarily communicate in low-resource local languages such as Bengali. Although recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable natural language interaction, direct generation in low-resource languages often exhibits poor fluency and factual inconsistency, while cloud-based solutions remain cost-prohibitive. This paper presents a cost-efficient, cross-lingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for Bengali agricultural advisory that emphasizes factual grounding and practical deployability. The proposed system adopts a translation-centric architecture in which Bengali user queries are translated into English, enriched through domain-specific keyword injection to align colloquial farmer terminology with scientific nomenclature, and answered via dense vector retrieval over a curated corpus of English agricultural manuals (FAO, IRRI). The generated English response is subsequently translated back into Bengali to ensure accessibility. The system is implemented entirely using open-source models and operates on consumer-grade hardware without reliance on paid APIs. Experimental evaluation demonstrates reliable source-grounded responses, robust rejection of out-of-domain queries, and an average end-to-end latency below 20 seconds. The results indicate that cross-lingual retrieval combined with controlled translation offers a practical and scalable solution for agricultural knowledge access in low-resource language settings"

    "abstract": "Compilers transform code into action. They convert high-level programs into executable hardware instructions - a crucial step in enabling reliable and scalable quantum computation. However, quantum compilation is still in its infancy, and many existing solutions are ad hoc, often developed independently and from scratch. The resulting lack of interoperability leads to significant missed potential, as quantum software tools remain isolated and cannot be seamlessly integrated into cohesive toolchains. The Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) has addressed analogous challenges in the classical domain. It was developed within the LLVM project, which has long powered robust software stacks and enabled compilation across diverse software and hardware components, with particular importance in high-performance computing environments. However, MLIR's steep learning curve poses a significant barrier to entry, particularly in quantum computing, where much of the software stack is still predominantly built by experimentalists out of necessity rather than by experienced software engineers. This paper provides a practical and hands-on guide for quantum software engineers to overcome this steep learning curve. Through a concrete case study linking Xanadu's PennyLane framework with the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT), we outline actionable integration steps, highlight best practices, and share hard-earned insights from real-world development. This work aims to support quantum tool developers in navigating MLIR's complexities and to foster its adoption as a unifying bridge across a rapidly growing ecosystem of quantum software tools, ultimately guiding the development of more modular, interoperable, and integrated quantum software stacks."

    "abstract": "Functional programming provides strong foundations for developing reliable and secure software systems, yet its adoption remains not widespread due to the steep learning curve. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation present new opportunities to lower these barriers. However, extensive evaluations of LLMs largely focus on imperative programming languages, and their capabilities in functional programming languages (FP) remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce FPEval, a holistic evaluation framework built on FPBench, a new benchmark of 721 programming tasks across three difficulty levels on three mainstream FP languages: Haskell, Ocaml and Scala. FPEval provides compehensive evaluation infrastructures with both test validations with comprehensive test suites and static analysis tools to assess both functional correctness and code style and maintainability. Using this framework, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and GPT-5, for code generation in functional programming languages and Java as an imperative baseline. Our results demonstrate that LLM performance in functional programming improves substantially with model advancement; however, error rates remain significantly higher in purely functional languages (Haskell and OCaml) than in hybrid (Scala) or imperative (Java) languages. Moreover, LLMs frequently generate non-idiomatic functional code that follows imperative patterns, raising concerns about code style and long-term maintainability. Finally, we show that LLMs can partially self-repair both correctness and quality issues when provided with static analysis feedback and hand-crafted instructions for common types of issues."

    "abstract": "We investigate the ultrafast dynamics of photo-induced non-thermal lattice disorder in a polycrystalline aluminium thin film to elucidate transient short- and long-range lattice distortions, their thermalization and electron-phonon coupling timescales. Using a high-repetition-rate 95-keV ultrafast electron diffraction setup (UED), we measured the transient dynamics for the differential scattering signal in a momentum transfer, $q$, range longer than in conventional keV UED setups. Analysis of ten Bragg and six diffuse scattering revealed a prompt increase in the mean-square displacement (MSD), indicating rapid energy transfer from the excited electronic system to the lattice. The subsequent relaxation dynamics of the elastic scattering intensities exhibit a pronounced dependence on diffraction order. Lower-order reflections relax more rapidly, whereas higher-order reflections show significantly slower relaxation or near-plateau behaviour, indicating that lattice equilibration proceeds on multiple $q$-dependent timescales. Exponential fits to the MSD dynamics reveal oscillatory residuals, indicative of coherent non-thermal lattice motion. Power spectral density analysis of these residuals uncovers coherent lattice oscillations with a fundamental frequency of $ω_0 = 0.192$ THz, corresponding to the acoustic breathing (A$_{1g}$) mode of aluminium. Higher frequency components are also observed, consistent with coherent phonon oscillations originating from a single zero-wavevector mode populated by multiple coherent phonons. While individual phonon branches are not directly resolved, the observed dependence on the lattice plane of the relaxation behaviour and oscillatory signatures are consistent with a mode-selective lattice response and non-thermal energy redistribution as described by non-thermal lattice models."

The Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) has been used to conduct a medium-resolution spectroscopic survey of 697 helium-rich hot subdwarfs and related stars. Using 587 stars from the full SALT sample, we define an unsupervised data-led classification system based on Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Spectral Clustering (SC), designed as a data-discovery tool to identify possible new groups and sequences within the data. Using the first 3 principal components (PCs), we identify 6 major clusters of hot subdwarf spectra, identified with the traditional spectral classes of classical sdB and sdO stars, helium-rich He-sdO stars and very hot subdwarfs. Two clusters covering large volumes of PC space include a) He-sdB and He-sdOB stars and b) intermediate iHe-sdB and iHe-sdOB stars. Most spectra in these major clusters form connected sequences in PC space. Using a second stage of PCA and SC, we identify sub-clusters within 4 major clusters, particularly in the He-sdB/OB and iHe-sdB/OB clusters. In comparison with traditional MK-like classification, we find that the PC clusters are reasonably well separated, with some overlap at cluster boundaries. For very hot sdOs, where the number of standards is small, PC classification has led to a revision of the Drilling MK-like system. Gaia DR3 measurements have been used to determine kinematic parameters for the PC-defined classes. Although disk stars account for a significant fraction of all classes, He-sdOs and Hot-sdOs include a higher fraction of halo stars."

The proof follows from a three level approximation scheme -- the Galerkin approximation, the classical parabolic regularization of the continuity equation, and the convex regularization of the potential generating the viscous stress. New techniques are required to deal with non-Newtonian stress tensor, larger classes of admissible pressure potentials and nonhomogeneous boundary conditions."

    "abstract": "Polar antiferromagnetic metals have recently garnered increasing interests due to their combined traits of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets for spintronic applications. However, the inherently incompatible nature of antiferromagnet, metallicity and polarity pose a significant challenge. We propose that charge disproportionation can lead to this novel state in negative charge transfer gap regime in molecular orbital crystal by molecular orbital analyses of first-principles DFT+$U$ electronic band structure for representative Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer perovskite oxides Sr$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$, corroborated by Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculation. Due to the negative charge transfer nature of Co$^{4+}$ and imposed by strong interlayer coupling, localized molecular orbitals stemming from the hybridization of Co $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{xz/yz}$ orbitals through the apical oxygen $p$ orbitals are preferably emergent within each bilayer unit, which develop antiferromagnetic ordering by invoking Hubbard repulsion. Charge disproportionation driven by Hund's physics, makes an occupation imbalance with broken inversion symmetry in the remaining $d_{xy}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals from distinct Co atoms within the bilayer unit, resulting in the polar metallicity. Meanwhile, this charge disproportionation scenario allows consequent conducting carriers to couple with interlayer local spins via Hund's coupling, giving rise to in-plane double-exchange ferromagnetism. Our molecular orbital formulation further provides a guide towards an effective Hamiltonian for modelling the unconventional synergy of metallicity, polarity and antiferromagnetism in Sr$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$, which may be a unified framework widely applicable to double-layer Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite oxides."

Existing refinement approaches either perform costly iterative re-generation or rely on vision-language models (VLMs) with weak spatial grounding, leading to semantic drift and unreliable local edits. To close this gap, we propose Agentic Retoucher, a hierarchical decision-driven framework that reformulates post-generation correction as a human-like perception-reasoning-action loop. Specifically, we design (1) a perception agent that learns contextual saliency for fine-grained distortion localization under text-image consistency cues, (2) a reasoning agent that performs human-aligned inferential diagnosis via progressive preference alignment, and (3) an action agent that adaptively plans localized inpainting guided by user preference. This design integrates perceptual evidence, linguistic reasoning, and controllable correction into a unified, self-corrective decision process. To enable fine-grained supervision and quantitative evaluation, we further construct GenBlemish-27K, a dataset of 6K T2I images with 27K annotated artifact regions across 12 categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Agentic Retoucher consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in perceptual quality, distortion localization and human preference alignment, establishing a new paradigm for self-corrective and perceptually reliable T2I generation."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) increasingly support very long input contexts. Yet it remains unclear how reliably they extract and infer information at scale. Performance varies with context length and strongly interacts with how information is distributed in real-world corpora. Motivated by these observations, we study how fact placement, corpus-level fact distributions, and Don't Make It Up prompts influence model behavior. We introduce an extended needle-in-a-haystack benchmark across four production-scale models: Gemini-2.5-flash, ChatGPT-5-mini, Claude-4.5-haiku, and Deepseek-v3.2-chat. Unlike prior work, we separately evaluate literal extraction, logical inference, and hallucination risk. Our study considers both positional effects and realistic distributions of evidence across long contexts, as well as prompts that explicitly discourage fabrication. We find that longer contexts alone do not guarantee better performance and can be detrimental when relevant evidence is diluted or widely dispersed. Performance varies substantially across models: some show severe degradation under realistic conditions, while others remain more robust at longer context lengths. Anti-hallucination (AH) instructions can make some models overly conservative, sharply reducing accuracy in literal extraction and logical inference. While we do not directly compare retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and cache-augmented generation (CAG), our results suggest many failures stem from ineffective context utilization. Models often struggle to identify and prioritize relevant information even when it is present. These findings have direct practical implications, as enterprise workflows increasingly involve pasting large volumes of unfiltered documents into LLM prompts. Effective context length and model-specific robustness to long contexts are therefore critical for reliable LLM deployment in research and business."

    "abstract": "Robust depth estimation under dynamic and adverse lighting conditions is essential for robotic systems. Currently, depth foundation models, such as Depth Anything, achieve great success in ideal scenes but remain challenging under adverse imaging conditions such as extreme illumination and motion blur. These degradations corrupt the visual signals of frame cameras, weakening the discriminative features of frame-based depths across the spatial and temporal dimensions. Typically, existing approaches incorporate event cameras to leverage their high dynamic range and temporal resolution, aiming to compensate for corrupted frame features. However, such specialized fusion models are predominantly trained from scratch on domain-specific datasets, thereby failing to inherit the open-world knowledge and robust generalization inherent to foundation models. In this work, we propose ADAE, an event-guided spatiotemporal fusion framework for Depth Anything in degraded scenes. Our design is guided by two key insights: 1) Entropy-Aware Spatial Fusion. We adaptively merge frame-based and event-based features using an information entropy strategy to indicate illumination-induced degradation. 2) Motion-Guided Temporal Correction. We resort to the event-based motion cue to recalibrate ambiguous features in blurred regions. Under our unified framework, the two components are complementary to each other and jointly enhance Depth Anything under adverse imaging conditions. Extensive experiments have been performed to verify the superiority of the proposed method. Our code will be released upon acceptance."

    "abstract": "Many real-world matrix datasets arrive as high-throughput vector streams, making it impractical to store or process them in their entirety. To enable real-time analytics under limited computational, memory, and communication resources, matrix sketching techniques have been developed over recent decades to provide compact approximations of such streaming data. Some algorithms have achieved optimal space and communication complexity. However, these approaches often require frequent time-consuming matrix factorization operations. In particular, under tight approximation error bounds, each matrix factorization computation incurs cubic time complexity, thereby limiting their update efficiency. In this paper, we introduce AeroSketch, a novel matrix sketching framework that leverages recent advances in randomized numerical linear algebra (RandNLA). AeroSketch achieves optimal communication and space costs while delivering near-optimal update time complexity (within logarithmic factors) across persistent, sliding window, and distributed streaming scenarios. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that AeroSketch consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in update throughput. In particular, under tight approximation error constraints, AeroSketch reduces the cubic time complexity to the quadratic level. Meanwhile, it maintains comparable approximation quality while retaining optimal communication and space costs."

    "abstract": "Segment Anything Models (SAMs), known for their exceptional zero-shot segmentation performance, have garnered significant attention in the research community. Nevertheless, their performance drops significantly on severely degraded, low-quality images, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose GleSAM++, which utilizes Generative Latent space Enhancement to boost robustness on low-quality images, thus enabling generalization across various image qualities. Additionally, to improve compatibility between the pre-trained diffusion model and the segmentation framework, we introduce two techniques, i.e., Feature Distribution Alignment (FDA) and Channel Replication and Expansion (CRE). However, the above components lack explicit guidance regarding the degree of degradation. The model is forced to implicitly fit a complex noise distribution that spans conditions from mild noise to severe artifacts, which substantially increases the learning burden and leads to suboptimal reconstructions. To address this issue, we further introduce a Degradation-aware Adaptive Enhancement (DAE) mechanism. The key principle of DAE is to decouple the reconstruction process for arbitrary-quality features into two stages: degradation-level prediction and degradation-aware reconstruction. Our method can be applied to pre-trained SAM and SAM2 with only minimal additional learnable parameters, allowing for efficient optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GleSAM++ significantly improves segmentation robustness on complex degradations while maintaining generalization to clear images. Furthermore, GleSAM++ also performs well on unseen degradations, underscoring the versatility of our approach and dataset."

In a previous article, the author discussed the most accepted explanation to the dimming caused by episodic mass loss that released large dust grains, which obscured Betelgeuse's light and made it appear fainter. This interpretation suggested that the dimming was not a precursor to a supernova, as Betelgeuse is likely still far from reaching that stage. On 21 July 2025, the existence of the companion star was confirmed with direct imaging, for the first time, by the alopeke instrument on the 8.1 m Gemini North telescope. The companion is 6 magnitudes fainter than Betelgeuse and orbits close to Betelgeuse itself, within the supergiant star's extended outer atmosphere. The stellar companion was detected at an angular separation of 52 mas and a position angle of 115 deg east of north. These measurements, along with its brightness, being roughly 6 magnitudes fainter than Betelgeuse at 466 nm, are in excellent agreement with dynamical predictions. Although this was only a 1.5 sigma detection, the agreement in the companion's appearance, separation, position angle, magnitude difference, and estimated mass is reasonable, making the result tentatively acceptable. The next optimum period for observations is November 2027, when we hope to get better observations. This article describes the interesting twists and turns of this study and what lies in the future for Betelgeuse and its companion, Betelbuddy or Siwarha."

    "abstract": "Pathological hubs in the brain networks of epilepsy patients are hypothesized to drive seizure generation and propagation. In epilepsy-surgery patients, these hubs have traditionally been associated with the resection area (RA): the region removed during the surgery with the goal of stopping the seizures, and which is typically used as a proxy for the epileptogenic zone. However, recent studies hypothesize that pathological hubs may extend to the vicinity of the RA, potentially complicating post-surgical seizure control. Here we propose a neighbourhood-based analysis of brain organization to investigate this hypothesis. We exploit a large dataset of pre-surgical magnetoencephalography-derived whole-brain networks from 91 epilepsy-surgery patients. Our neighbourhood focus is 2-fold. Firstly, we propose a partition of the brain regions into three sets, namely resected nodes, their neighbours and the remaining network nodes. Secondly, we introduce generalized centrality metrics that describe the neighbourhood of each node, providing a regional measure of hubness. Our analyses reveal that both the RA and its neighbourhood present large hub status, but with significant variability across patients. For some, hubs appear in the RA; for others, in its neighbourhood. Moreover, this variability does not correlate with surgical outcome. These results highlight the potential of neighbourhood-based analyses to uncover novel insights into brain connectivity in brain pathologies, and the need for individualized studies, with large enough cohorts, that account for patient-specific variability."

    "abstract": "Recent observations by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory have revealed a significant excess of high-energy neutrinos from nearby Seyfert galaxies, such as NGC~1068, without a corresponding flux of high-energy gamma-rays. This suggests that neutrinos are produced via hadronic interactions in a region opaque to gamma-rays, likely a hot corona surrounding the central supermassive black hole. However, the mechanism responsible for accelerating the parent protons to the required energies ($\\sim 100$ TeV) remains an open question. In this study, we investigate diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) in active galactic nucleus (AGN) coronae using a suite of one-dimensional Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations spanning a broad range of plasma parameters. We find that DSA is a robust and efficient mechanism for proton acceleration, consistently channeling approximately 10\\% of the shock's kinetic energy into non-thermal ions, even for shocks with sonic Mach number as low as $ M_s \\approx 2$. In contrast, the efficiency of electron acceleration is highly variable and less efficient ($<1\\%$) in our parameter survey. These findings provide strong, first-principles support for the hadronic models of neutrino production in AGN and offer quantitative constraints that can explain the observed gamma-ray deficit."

    "abstract": "Semiconducting Barrier Discharges (SeBDs) generate uniform ionization waves in air at atmospheric pressure. In this work, we investigate how externally applied irradiation synchronized with the discharge can mimic photoconductive-type coupling between the plasma and the semiconductor surface. By illuminating the Si-SiO$_2$ interface with nanosecond pulsed irradiation at wavelengths from 532 nm to 1064 nm, and using fast imaging, optical emission spectroscopy, and current-voltage measurements, we demonstrate that the photoexcitation of charge carriers in silicon enhances the plasma emission and increases the reduced electric field, with no detectable change in the electrical energy. The magnitude and thresholds of these responses depend on wavelength. By comparing the SeBD to a MOS photodetector, this behaviour can be explained by the absorption length. This length determines whether carriers are photogenerated inside the depletion region at the SiO$_2$-Si interface, where they are efficiently separated and undergo impact-ionization amplification, or deeper in the silicon bulk where carrier separation is weaker and free-carrier absorption diminishes the quantum efficiency. These results focus on the microscopic processes governing the plasma-semiconductor coupling and demonstrate how the optoelectronic properties of silicon can influence surface ionization waves."

    "abstract": "Unitary designs are unitary ensembles that emulate Haar-random unitary statistics. They provide a vital tool for studying quantum randomness and have found broad applications in quantum technologies. However, existing research has focused on discrete ensembles, despite that many physical processes, such as in quantum chaos, thermalization, and control, naturally involve continuous ensembles generated from continuous time-evolution. Here we initial the study of continuous unitary designs, addressing fundamental questions about their construction and practical utility. For single-qubit system, we construct explicit unitary 1-design paths from spherical 2-design curves and Hopf fibration theory. For arbitrary dimensions, we develop two systematic construction frameworks, one based on topological bundle theory of the unitary group and the other based on the Heisenberg-Weyl group. On the practical front, our unitary design paths provide analytical solutions to universally robust quantum control. Simulations show they outperform conventional pulse techniques in mitigating arbitrary unknown static noises, demonstrating immediate utility for quantum engineering. Extending unitary designs to the continuous domain not only introduces powerful geometric and topological tools that complement conventional combinatorial and group-theoretic methods, but also enhances experimental feasibility over discrete counterparts which usually involve instantaneous pulses. As an outlook, we anticipate that this work will pave the way for using continuous unitary designs to explore complex quantum dynamics and devise quantum information protocols."

Existing approaches either revisit local image patches, improving fine-grained perception but weakening global spatial awareness, or mark isolated coordinates, which capture object locations but overlook their overall organization. In this work, we integrate the cognitive concept of an object-centric blueprint into VLMs to enhance spatial reasoning. Given an image and a question, the model first constructs a JSON-style blueprint that records the positions, sizes, and attributes of relevant objects, and then reasons over this structured representation to produce the final answer. To achieve this, we introduce three key techniques: (1) blueprint-embedded reasoning traces for supervised fine-tuning to elicit basic reasoning skills; (2) blueprint-aware rewards in reinforcement learning to encourage the blueprint to include an appropriate number of objects and to align final answers with this causal reasoning; and (3) anti-shortcut data augmentation that applies targeted perturbations to images and questions, discouraging reliance on superficial visual or linguistic cues. Experiments show that our method consistently outperforms existing VLMs and specialized spatial reasoning models."

Within this context, the SKA Regional Centres Network (SRCNet) must operate in a near-exascale environment where traditional data-centric computing models based on moving large datasets to centralised resources are no longer viable due to network and storage bottlenecks. To address this limitation, this work proposes a shift towards distributed and in-situ computing, where computation is moved closer to the data. We explore the integration of Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) with an intelligent decision-making entity based on Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to optimise data-intensive workflows within SRCNet. FaaS enables lightweight and modular function execution near data sources while abstracting infrastructure management. The proposed decision-making entity employs Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) to explore near-optimal execution plans considering execution time and energy consumption, together with constraints related to data location and transfer costs. This work establishes a baseline framework for efficient and cost-aware computation-to-data strategies within the SRCNet architecture."

    "abstract": "Koopman operator theory has emerged as a leading data-driven approach that relies on a judicious choice of observable functions to realize global linear representations of nonlinear systems in the lifted observable space. However, real-world data is often noisy, making it difficult to obtain an accurate and unbiased approximation of the Koopman operator. The Koopman operator generated from noisy datasets is typically corrupted by noise-induced bias that severely degrades prediction and downstream tracking performance. In order to address this drawback, this paper proposes a novel autoencoder-based neural architecture to jointly learn the appropriate lifting functions and the reduced-bias Koopman operator from noisy data. The architecture initially learns the Koopman basis functions that are consistent for both the forward and backward temporal dynamics of the system. Subsequently, by utilizing the learned forward and backward temporal dynamics, the Koopman operator is synthesized with a reduced bias making the method more robust to noise compared to existing techniques. Theoretical analysis is used to demonstrate significant bias reduction in the presence of training noise. Dynamics prediction and tracking control simulations are conducted for multiple serial manipulator arms, including performance comparisons with leading alternative designs, to demonstrate its robustness under various noise levels. Experimental studies with the Franka FR3 7-DoF manipulator arm are further used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a practical setting."

Over 12 days we alternated three conditions--Baseline (no robot), Robot-only, and Robot+Fixture--and video-annotated the service funnel from passersby to purchase. An explanatory sequential design then used six post-experiment staff interviews to interpret the quantitative patterns. Quantitatively, the robot increased stopping per passerby (highest with the fixture), yet clerk-led downstream steps per stopper--clerk approach, store entry, assisted experience, and purchase--decreased. Interviews explained this divergence: clerks avoided interrupting ongoing robot-customer talk, struggled with ambiguous timing amid conversational latency, and noted child-centered attraction that often satisfied curiosity at the doorway. The fixture amplified visibility but also anchored encounters at the threshold, creating a well-defined micro-space where needs could ``close'' without moving inside. We synthesize these strands into an integrative account from the initial show of interest on the part of a customer to their entering the store and derive actionable guidance. The results advance the understanding of interactions between customers, staff members, and the robot and offer practical recommendations for deploying service robots in high-touch retail."

Starting with quiescent particle settling, the chiral particle's orientation dynamics are studied, revealing a preferred alignment and a strong translation-rotation coupling. The particle chirality determines the preferred rotation direction, though the alignment and translation-rotation coupling gradually vanish with increasing turbulence. We identify multiple settling modes for the chiral particles, which are characterised by the evolution of the rotation angles. Finally, a theoretical model assuming a simplified chiral particle in Stokes flow clarifies the emergence of each settling mode."

A specific forcing frequency of $\\widehatω=\\sqrt{2}\\widehatΩ$, where $\\widehatΩ$ denotes the rotation rate, is introduced to generate a closed rectangular path of characteristics for the inertial wave beam generated at the critical latitude. Our approach extends previous results by Le Dizès (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 899, 2020, A21) and reveals that nonlinear interactions are predominantly localized around regions where the wave beam reflects on the boundary. We derive specific scaling laws governing the nonlinear interactions: the width of the interaction region scales as $E^{1/3}$, and the amplitude of the resulting mean zonal flow scales as $E^{1/6}$ in general. However, near the rotation axis, where the singularity of the self-similar solution becomes more pronounced, the amplitude exhibits a scaling of $E^{-1/2}$. In addition, our study also examines the nonlinear interactions of beams which are governed by different scaling laws. Through comparison with numerical results, we validate the theoretical predictions of the asymptotic framework, observing good agreement as the Ekman number decreases."

    "abstract": "We investigate the evolution of anisotropies in Bianchi I spacetimes within the framework of the 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar field theory. The field equations are formulated using dimensionless variables, and the asymptotic dynamics are studied through a combination of analytical and numerical techniques. For the locally rotationally symmetric case, we analytically explore the stationary points of the field equations. The analysis reveals the existence of accelerating solutions in which the scalar field and the Gauss-Bonnet scalar effectively play the role of a cosmological constant. As a result, both anisotropic and isotropic expanding solutions are recovered, along with the Minkowski spacetime. No scaling solutions are supported by the gravitational model. For the general anisotropic Bianchi I geometry with three distinct scale factors, we find that a class of compactified Kasner-like solutions is obtained. In addition, a new family of solutions follows, describing a two-dimensional splitting of the background geometry. This behavior is similar to the previously observed pure Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory in higher-dimensional spacetimes."

    "abstract": "We study data-driven construction of spatial discretizations for the one-dimensional Maxwell system. Given high-fidelity training data generated by a spectral discretization, we learn a linear convolution stencil that approximates the spatial derivative operator appearing in Maxwell's equations. The stencil is obtained by solving a convex quadratic optimization problem, subject to linear constraints that enforce skew-adjointness of the discrete derivative. These constraints guarantee a semi-discrete energy identity for the resulting Maxwell system. We prove that our constraints characterize the class of skew-symmetric convolution operators and express the associated numerical wave speed and CFL restriction for the classical leapfrog scheme in terms of the learned stencil's Fourier symbol. We then compare several convex solvers for the resulting quadratic program -- projected gradient, Nesterov-accelerated gradient, ADMM, and an interior-point reference implemented in CVXPY -- and evaluate the learned schemes in time-dependent one-dimensional Maxwell simulations using a Crank--Nicolson (CN) time discretization. Our numerical experiments show that (i) energy-constrained learned stencils achieve accuracy comparable to standard central differences while exactly preserving the discrete electromagnetic energy under CN time-stepping, and (ii) ADMM and interior-point methods produce nearly identical operators, with ADMM offering a favorable tradeoff between accuracy, constraint satisfaction, and runtime."

    "abstract": "Claims documents are fundamental to healthcare and insurance operations, serving as the basis for reimbursement, auditing, and compliance. However, these documents are typically not born digital; they often exist as scanned PDFs or photographs captured under uncontrolled conditions. Consequently, they exhibit significant content heterogeneity, ranging from typed invoices to handwritten medical reports, as well as linguistic diversity. This challenge is exemplified by operations at Fullerton Health, which handles tens of millions of claims annually across nine markets, including Singapore, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mainland China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Papua New Guinea, and Cambodia. Such variability, coupled with inconsistent image quality and diverse layouts, poses a significant obstacle to automated parsing and structured information extraction. This paper presents a robust multi-stage pipeline that integrates the multilingual optical character recognition (OCR) engine PaddleOCR, a traditional Logistic Regression classifier, and a compact Vision-Language Model (VLM), Qwen 2.5-VL-7B, to achieve efficient and accurate field extraction from large-scale claims data. The proposed system achieves a document-type classification accuracy of over 95 percent and a field-level extraction accuracy of approximately 87 percent, while maintaining an average processing latency of under 2 seconds per document. Compared to manual processing, which typically requires around 10 minutes per claim, our system delivers a 300x improvement in efficiency. These results demonstrate that combining traditional machine learning models with modern VLMs enables production-grade accuracy and speed for real-world automation. The solution has been successfully deployed in our mobile application and is currently processing tens of thousands of claims weekly from Vietnam and Singapore."

By embedding concept representations within a Lorentzian manifold, naturally suited to modeling tree-like hierarchies, we define parent-child relationships in which previously learned concepts serve as guidance for adapting to new ones. Our method not only preserves prior knowledge but also supports continual integration of new concepts. We validate FLLP on three public datasets and one synthetic benchmark, showing consistent improvements in both robustness and generalization."

    "abstract": "Memory overload is a common form of resource exhaustion in cloud data warehouses. When database queries fail due to memory overload, it not only wastes critical resources such as CPU time but also disrupts the execution of core business processes, as memory-overloading (MO) queries are typically part of complex workflows. If such queries are identified in advance and scheduled to memory-rich serverless clusters, it can prevent resource wastage and query execution failure. Therefore, cloud data warehouses desire an admission control framework with high prediction precision, interpretability, efficiency, and adaptability to effectively identify MO queries. However, existing admission control frameworks primarily focus on scenarios like SLA satisfaction and resource isolation, with limited precision in identifying MO queries. Moreover, there is a lack of publicly available MO-labeled datasets with workloads for training and benchmarking. To tackle these challenges, we propose SafeLoad, the first query admission control framework specifically designed to identify MO queries. Alongside, we release SafeBench, an open-source, industrial-scale benchmark for this task, which includes 150 million real queries. SafeLoad first filters out memory-safe queries using the interpretable discriminative rule. It then applies a hybrid architecture that integrates both a global model and cluster-level models, supplemented by a misprediction correction module to identify MO queries. Additionally, a self-tuning quota management mechanism dynamically adjusts prediction quotas per cluster to improve precision. Experimental results show that SafeLoad achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance with low online and offline time overhead. Specifically, SafeLoad improves precision by up to 66% over the best baseline and reduces wasted CPU time by up to 8.09x compared to scenarios without SafeLoad."

Previous approaches require many safety samples or calibration sets, which not only incur significant computational overhead during realignment but also lead to noticeable degradation in model utility. Contrary to this belief, we show that safety alignment can be fully recovered with only a single safety example, without sacrificing utility and at minimal cost. Remarkably, this recovery is effective regardless of the number of harmful examples used in fine-tuning or the size of the underlying model, and convergence is achieved within just a few epochs. Furthermore, we uncover the low-rank structure of the safety gradient, which explains why such efficient correction is possible. We validate our findings across five safety-aligned LLMs and multiple datasets, demonstrating the generality of our approach."

Existing methods typically handle long-term memory (LTM) and short-term memory (STM) as separate components, relying on heuristics or auxiliary controllers, which limits adaptability and end-to-end optimization. In this paper, we propose Agentic Memory (AgeMem), a unified framework that integrates LTM and STM management directly into the agent's policy. AgeMem exposes memory operations as tool-based actions, enabling the LLM agent to autonomously decide what and when to store, retrieve, update, summarize, or discard information. To train such unified behaviors, we propose a three-stage progressive reinforcement learning strategy and design a step-wise GRPO to address sparse and discontinuous rewards induced by memory operations. Experiments on five long-horizon benchmarks demonstrate that AgeMem consistently outperforms strong memory-augmented baselines across multiple LLM backbones, achieving improved task performance, higher-quality long-term memory, and more efficient context usage."

    "abstract": "The Edge Interdiction Clique Problem (EICP) aims to remove at most $k$ edges from a graph so as to minimize the size of the largest clique in the remaining graph. This problem captures a fundamental question in graph manipulation: which edges are structurally critical for preserving large cliques? Such a problem is also motivated by practical applications including protein function maintenance and image matching. The EICP is computationally challenging and belongs to a complexity class beyond NP. Existing approaches rely on general mixed-integer bilevel programming solvers or reformulate the problem into a single-level mixed integer linear program. However, they are still not scalable when the graph size and interdiction budget $k$ grow. To overcome this, we investigate new mixed integer linear formulations, which recast the problem into a sequence of parameterized Edge Blocker Clique Problems (EBCP). This perspective decomposes the original problem into simpler subproblems and enables tighter modeling of clique-related inequalities. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage exact algorithm, \\textsc{RLCM}, which first applies problem-specific reduction techniques to shrink the graph and then solves the reduced problem using a tailored branch-and-cut framework. Extensive computational experiments on maximum clique benchmark graphs, large real-world sparse networks, and random graphs demonstrate that \\textsc{RLCM} consistently outperforms existing approaches."

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that prompting can enable large language models (LLMs) to simulate specific personality traits and produce behaviors that align with those traits. However, there is limited understanding of how these simulated personalities influence critical web search decisions, specifically relevance assessment. Moreover, few studies have examined how simulated personalities impact confidence calibration, specifically the tendencies toward overconfidence or underconfidence. This gap exists even though psychological literature suggests these biases are trait-specific, often linking high extraversion to overconfidence and high neuroticism to underconfidence. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive study evaluating multiple LLMs, including commercial models and open-source models, prompted to simulate Big Five personality traits. We tested these models across three test collections (TREC DL 2019, TREC DL 2020, and LLMJudge), collecting two key outputs for each query-document pair: a relevance judgment and a self-reported confidence score. The findings show that personalities such as low agreeableness consistently align more closely with human labels than the unprompted condition. Additionally, low conscientiousness performs well in balancing the suppression of both overconfidence and underconfidence. We also observe that relevance scores and confidence distributions vary systematically across different personalities. Based on the above findings, we incorporate personality-conditioned scores and confidence as features in a random forest classifier. This approach achieves performance that surpasses the best single-personality condition on a new dataset (TREC DL 2021), even with limited training data. These findings highlight that personality-derived confidence offers a complementary predictive signal, paving the way for more reliable and human-aligned LLM evaluators."

In this paper, we investigate two types of cycles--the Carnot cycle and the rectangular cycle--based on the phase diagram derived from the equation of state, to study the heat engine characteristics of the FRW universe. Furthermore, we calculate the work done and assess the corresponding efficiencies, illustrating the efficiency diagram for the FRW universe's heat engine. We observe that the efficiency of the rectangular cycle consistently remains below unity and never exceeds the Carnot efficiency--the thermodynamic upper limit. This finding aligns with traditional thermodynamic principles governing heat engines."

In our scenario, both asymmetries are predominantly sourced by a dynamical $CP$ phase, namely the majoron. Its kinetic misalignment provides a sufficiently large, time-dependent effective $CP$ phase, allowing efficient asymmetry production even for low-scale right-handed neutrinos. In our framework, the sources of $CP$ violation responsible for the BAU and ADM are correlated with each other, leading to a predictive relation for the dark matter mass. In particular, when the dark matter asymmetry reaches its equilibrium value before freeze-out, the dark matter mass is typically predicted to lie in the range $\\mathcal{O}(0.1)~\\mathrm{GeV} \\lesssim m_χ \\lesssim \\mathcal{O}(100)~\\mathrm{GeV}$, which lies within the sensitivity of direct detection experiments. On the other hand, if the dark matter asymmetry does not reach its equilibrium value due to weak coupling, the allowed mass range extends over a broader interval, $\\mathcal{O}(0.1)~\\mathrm{GeV} \\lesssim m_χ \\lesssim \\mathcal{O}(10)~\\rm{TeV}$."

    "abstract": "In this paper, a deep learning approach for Mpox diagnosis named Customized Residual SwinTransformerV2 (RSwinV2) has been proposed, trying to enhance the capability of lesion classification by employing the RSwinV2 tool-assisted vision approach. In the RSwinV2 method, a hierarchical structure of the transformer has been customized based on the input dimensionality, embedding structure, and output targeted by the method. In this RSwinV2 approach, the input image has been split into non-overlapping patches and processed using shifted windows and attention in these patches. This process has helped the method link all the windows efficiently by avoiding the locality issues of non-overlapping regions in attention, while being computationally efficient. RSwinV2 has further developed based on SwinTransformer and has included patch and position embeddings to take advantage of the transformer global-linking capability by employing multi-head attention in these embeddings. Furthermore, RSwinV2 has developed and incorporated the Inverse Residual Block (IRB) into this method, which utilizes convolutional skip connections with these inclusive designs to address the vanishing gradient issues during processing. RSwinV2 inclusion of IRB has therefore facilitated this method to link global patterns as well as local patterns; hence, its integrity has helped improve lesion classification capability by minimizing variability of Mpox and increasing differences of Mpox, chickenpox, measles, and cowpox. In testing SwinV2, its accuracy of 96.21 and an F1score of 95.62 have been achieved on the Kaggle public dataset, which has outperformed standard CNN models and SwinTransformers; RSwinV2 vector has thus proved its valiance as a computer-assisted tool for Mpox lesion observation interpretation."

A Hierarchical Aspect Framework (HAF) is developed through multi-method topic modeling, along with a dual-mode tagging scheme for explicit and implicit aspects. For aspect identification, four distinct models are evaluated: a Rule-Based system, a Generative LLM (Gemini 2.0 Flash), and two Fine-Tuned Gemma-3 1B models trained on different datasets (Rule-Based vs. LLM-Annotated). Results indicate that the Generative LLM achieved the highest performance across all tasks (Macro F1 0.91), demonstrating superior capability in handling implicit aspects. In contrast, the fine-tuned models exhibited limited performance due to dataset imbalance and architectural capacity constraints.

Further, we investigate the phase transitions and critical phenomena in Kerr-Sen-AdS black holes at the critical points. Such black holes are characterized by its mass ($M$), the dilaton charge ($Q$), and the negative cosmological constant, $Λ(<0)$. We define a dimensionless parameter $ε=\\bar{J}/{\\bar{Q}^2}$ and express the mass, temperature, volume, and Gibbs free energy in terms of $ε$ and its polynomials. Moreover, we numerically fit the data for the critical points and find that in the appropriate limit, the expressions for critical points would correspond to the respective critical points of the Kerr-AdS black hole thermodynamics. Such a study involves a systematic analysis of temperature, Gibbs free energy, and volume in the extended phase space. We provide an analytical verification of the nature of the phase transitions at the critical points by introducing the Ehrenfest equations. We also check that all three quantities, e.g., the specific heat at constant pressure, $C_P$, the volume expansion coefficient, $α$, and the isothermal compressibility, $κ_T$, diverge at the critical points. We find the $Prigogine$-$Defay$ ratio using the expressions of $C_P$, $α$, and $κ_T$, and find that it identically equals unity. Hence, the phase transition behavior of the Kerr-Sen-AdS black holes at their critical points is of second order. In addition, we propose investigating the energy extraction process via the Penrose process. Later, we calculate the speed of sound and adiabatic compressibility for the rotating Kerr-Sen-AdS black holes. Finally, on a specific note, we calculate the thermodynamic quantities of the boundary conformal field theory (CFT) dual to the extended phase space."

These phenomena may exhibit environmental heterogeneity and complex interactions that are difficult to capture using traditional statistical process models such as Gaussian processes. This work proposes the use of Fourier neural operators (FNOs) for constructing statistical dynamical spatio-temporal models for forecasting. An FNO is a flexible mapping of functions that approximates the solution operator of possibly unknown linear or non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs) in a computationally efficient manner. It does so using samples of inputs and their respective outputs, and hence explicit knowledge of the underlying PDE is not required. Through simulations from a nonlinear PDE with known solution, we compare FNO forecasts to those from state-of-the-art statistical spatio-temporal-forecasting methods. Further, using sea surface temperature data over the Atlantic Ocean and precipitation data across Europe, we demonstrate the ability of FNO-based dynamic spatio-temporal (DST) statistical modeling to capture complex real-world spatio-temporal dependencies. Using collections of testing instances, we show that the FNO-DST forecasts are accurate with valid uncertainty quantification."

In compressible turbulence, however, several definitions of filtered energy exist, and for most of them the associated formulation in terms of correlation functions is unclear. We develop a general framework to determine the multi-point correlation functions corresponding to any specified filtered energy. As a demonstration, we show that the Favre filtered energy--defined as the ratio of the squared filtered momentum to the filtered density--and the terms in its budget can be written as an infinite series of multi-point correlation functions.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown considerable potential in autonomous driving (AD), yet its vulnerability to perturbations remains a critical barrier to real-world deployment. As a primary countermeasure, adversarial training improves policy robustness by training the AD agent in the presence of an adversary that deliberately introduces perturbations. Existing approaches typically model the interaction as a zero-sum game with continuous attacks. However, such designs overlook the inherent asymmetry between the agent and the adversary and then fail to reflect the sparsity of safety-critical risks, rendering the achieved robustness inadequate for practical AD scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce criticality-aware robust RL (CARRL), a novel adversarial training approach for handling sparse, safety-critical risks in autonomous driving. CARRL consists of two interacting components: a risk exposure adversary (REA) and a risk-targeted robust agent (RTRA). We model the interaction between the REA and RTRA as a general-sum game, allowing the REA to focus on exposing safety-critical failures (e.g., collisions) while the RTRA learns to balance safety with driving efficiency. The REA employs a decoupled optimization mechanism to better identify and exploit sparse safety-critical moments under a constrained budget. However, such focused attacks inevitably result in a scarcity of adversarial data. The RTRA copes with this scarcity by jointly leveraging benign and adversarial experiences via a dual replay buffer and enforces policy consistency under perturbations to stabilize behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach reduces the collision rate by at least 22.66\\% across all cases compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods."

    "abstract": "Lossy compression, widely used by scientists to reduce data from simulations, experiments, and observations, can distort features of interest even under bounded error. Such distortions may compromise downstream analyses and lead to incorrect scientific conclusions in applications such as combustion and cosmology. This paper presents a distributed and parallel algorithm for correcting topological features, specifically, piecewise linear Morse Smale segmentations (PLMSS), which decompose the domain into monotone regions labeled by their corresponding local minima and maxima. While a single GPU algorithm (MSz) exists for PLMSS correction after compression, no methodology has been developed that scales beyond a single GPU for extreme scale data. We identify the key bottleneck in scaling PLMSS correction as the parallel computation of integral paths, a communication-intensive computation that is notoriously difficult to scale. Instead of explicitly computing and correcting integral paths, our algorithm simplifies MSz by preserving steepest ascending and descending directions across all locations, thereby minimizing interprocess communication while introducing negligible additional storage overhead. With this simplified algorithm and relaxed synchronization, our method achieves over 90% parallel efficiency on 128 GPUs on the Perlmutter supercomputer for real world datasets."

    "abstract": "The 2023 U.S. banking crisis propagated not through direct financial linkages but through a high-frequency, information-based contagion channel. This paper moves beyond exploration analysis to test the \"too-similar-to-fail\" hypothesis, arguing that risk spillovers were driven by perceived similarities in bank business models under acute interest rate pressure. Employing a Time-Varying Parameter Vector Autoregression (TVP-VAR) model with 30-day rolling windows, a method uniquely suited for capturing the rapid network shifts inherent in a panic, we analyze daily stock returns for the four failed institutions and a systematically selected peer group of surviving banks vulnerable to the same risks from March 18, 2022, to March 15, 2023. Our results provide strong evidence for this contagion channel: total system connectedness surged dramatically during the crisis peak, and we identify SIVB, FRC, and WAL as primary net transmitters of risk while their perceived peers became significant net receivers, a key dynamic indicator of systemic vulnerability that cannot be captured by asset-by-asset analysis. We further demonstrate that these spillovers were significantly amplified by market sentiment (as measured by the VIX) and economic policy uncertainty (EPU). By providing a clear conceptual framework and robust empirical validation, our findings confirm the persistence of systemic risks within the banking network and highlight the importance of real-time monitoring in strengthening financial stability."

    "abstract": "How neural representations in the insular cortex support emotional processing remains poorly understood, and the extent to which the insula is specialized for disgust processing remains debated. We recorded stereoelectroencephalography data from the insula while human subjects with implanted electrode contacts performed a facial emotion recognition task involving disgusted, fearful, angry, sad, neutral, and happy expressions. Expression category specificity of insular activity was assessed via pairwise comparisons of within- and between-category pattern similarities, capturing both the shape and scale of event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs; theta to high-gamma frequency ranges). Insular activity successfully identified all investigated expressions, mediated by diverse ERP responses intermixed across the insula. In contrast to the marked heterogeneity of insula ERP responses, the fusiform face area exhibited convergent ERP responses across expressions and contacts, with ERSPs also contributing substantially to expression identification. These findings not only elucidate the insula's neural mechanisms underlying facial emotion perception, but also establish a potential single-contact-level neural substrate for how the insula leverages its heterogeneous response profiles to act as a key hub for versatile cognitive and emotional functions."

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have become a dominant paradigm for creating general purpose models whose capabilities can be transferred to downstream supervised learning tasks. However, most such methods rely on vast amounts of pretraining data. This work introduces Subimage Overlap Prediction, a novel self-supervised pretraining task to aid semantic segmentation in remote sensing imagery that uses significantly lesser pretraining imagery. Given an image, a sub-image is extracted and the model is trained to produce a semantic mask of the location of the extracted sub-image within the original image. We demonstrate that pretraining with this task results in significantly faster convergence, and equal or better performance (measured via mIoU) on downstream segmentation. This gap in convergence and performance widens when labeled training data is reduced. We show this across multiple architecture types, and with multiple downstream datasets. We also show that our method matches or exceeds performance while requiring significantly lesser pretraining data relative to other SSL methods.

    "abstract": "Indium iodides, which adopt layered or molecular-crystal-like arrangements depending on composition, are expected to exhibit low lattice thermal conductivity because of their heavy constituent atoms and weak In-I bonding. In this work, we employed first-principles anharmonic lattice dynamics calculations to systematically investigate phonon transport in indium iodides from particle- and wave-like perspectives. The calculated lattice thermal conductivities of both materials remained below 1 W/m-K over a broad temperature range. Notably, the influence of wave-like phonon transport differed by composition: in InI3, the wave-like contribution became comparable to the particle-like Peierls contribution, whereas it remained negligible in InI. We also investigated the thermal transport properties of the experimentally reported high-pressure phase of InI3. Motivated by experimental indications of stacking faults and partial disorder in indium site occupancy within the rhombohedral phase, we constructed several ordered structural models with different stacking sequences. These stacking sequences exhibited no significant energetic preference and had similar lattice thermal conductivities, suggesting that in-plane thermal transport is largely governed by the vibrational properties of the In2I6 layers themselves rather than by the specific stacking sequence. These findings provide insight into phonon transport in layered and molecular-crystal systems with structural complexity and contribute to a broader understanding of thermal transport mechanisms in layered and molecular-crystal-like materials."

This study aims to characterize the presence of scholarly and policy references in Overton-indexed policy documents and examine their distribution across key bibliographic dimensions, thereby assessing Overton's potential as a data source for policy metrics. We analyze a dataset of approximately 17.5 million policy documents from Overton, incorporating metadata such as publication year, policy source, country, language, subject area, and policy topic. Descriptive statistics are employed to assess the presence and distribution of reference data across these dimensions. Overton indexes a substantial volume of policy documents and identifies considerable reference data within them: 7.7% of documents contain scholarly references and 10.6% contain policy references. However, the presence of references varies significantly across publications years, source types, countries, languages, subject areas, and policy topics, indicating coverage biases that may affect interpretations of policy impact. The analysis is based on the Overton database as of June 2025. As Overton is regularly updated, the distribution patterns of indexed documents and references may evolve over time. The findings offer insights into the opportunities and constraints of using Overton for investigating evidence-based policymaking and for assessing the policy uptake of research outputs in the context of research evaluation. This is the first large-scale study to systematically examine the distribution of reference data in Overton. It contributes a foundational understanding of this emerging source for policy metrics, highlighting both its potential applications and limitations, and underlining the importance of addressing current coverage imbalances."

However, the extent to which exposure in generative search engine citations is shaped by external attention markets remains uncertain. In this study, we audit the exposure for 44 Web3 enterprises. First, we show that the creator community around each enterprise is persistent over time. Second, enterprise-specific queries reveal that more popular voices systematically receive greater citation exposure than others. Third, we find that larger follower bases and enterprises with more concentrated creator cores are associated with higher-ranked exposure. Together, these results show that generative search engine citations exhibit exposure bias toward already prominent voices, which risks entrenching incumbents and narrowing viewpoint diversity."

Achieving seamless conversational behavior, where speaking and listening states transition fluidly remains a key challenge. Existing 3D conversational avatar approaches rely on error-prone pseudo-3D labels that fail to capture fine-grained facial dynamics. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel two-stage framework MANGO, which leveraging pure image-level supervision by alternately training to mitigate the noise introduced by pseudo-3D labels, thereby achieving better alignment with real-world conversational behaviors. Specifically, in the first stage, a diffusion-based transformer with a dual-audio interaction module models natural 3D motion from multi-speaker audio. In the second stage, we use a fast 3D Gaussian Renderer to generate high-fidelity images and provide 2D-level photometric supervision for the 3D motions through alternate training. Additionally, we introduce MANGO-Dialog, a high-quality dataset with over 50 hours of aligned 2D-3D conversational data across 500+ identities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves exceptional accuracy and realism in modeling two-person 3D dialogue motion, significantly advancing the fidelity and controllability of audio-driven talking heads."

    "abstract": "Masked autoencoders (MAE) have become a dominant paradigm in 3D representation learning, setting new performance benchmarks across various downstream tasks. Existing methods with fixed mask ratio neglect multi-level representational correlations and intrinsic geometric structures, while relying on point-wise reconstruction assumptions that conflict with the diversity of point cloud. To address these issues, we propose a 3D representation learning method, termed Point-SRA, which aligns representations through self-distillation and probabilistic modeling. Specifically, we assign different masking ratios to the MAE to capture complementary geometric and semantic information, while the MeanFlow Transformer (MFT) leverages cross-modal conditional embeddings to enable diverse probabilistic reconstruction. Our analysis further reveals that representations at different time steps in MFT also exhibit complementarity. Therefore, a Dual Self-Representation Alignment mechanism is proposed at both the MAE and MFT levels. Finally, we design a Flow-Conditioned Fine-Tuning Architecture to fully exploit the point cloud distribution learned via MeanFlow. Point-SRA outperforms Point-MAE by 5.37% on ScanObjectNN. On intracranial aneurysm segmentation, it reaches 96.07% mean IoU for arteries and 86.87% for aneurysms. For 3D object detection, Point-SRA achieves 47.3% AP@50, surpassing MaskPoint by 5.12%."

Inspired by the Data-Driven Finite Element Method (DD-FEM) framework for modular data-driven solvers, we propose the Latent Space Element Method (LSEM), an element-based latent surrogate assembly approach in which a learned subdomain (\"element\") model can be tiled and coupled to form a larger computational domain. Each element is a LaSDI latent ODE surrogate trained from snapshots on a local patch, and neighboring elements are coupled through learned directional interaction terms in latent space, avoiding Schwarz iterations and interface residual evaluations. A smooth window-based blending reconstructs a global field from overlapping element predictions, yielding a scalable assembled latent dynamical system. Experiments on the 1D Burgers and Korteweg-de Vries equations show that LSEM maintains predictive accuracy while scaling to spatial domains larger than those seen in training. LSEM offers an interpretable and extensible route toward foundation-model surrogate solvers built from reusable local models."

During fertilization, deviations from the normal mechanical range can hinder sperm penetration, ultimately reducing fertilization efficiency and compromising embryo quality.

To address these limitations, we developed an AI-guided micronewton-scale mechanical measurement system for safe and automated oocyte quality assessment. The system integrates voice interaction with automated experimental workflows to control a magnetically actuated microgripper, which applies defined loading forces to induce micron-scale compressive deformation of the oocyte. Combined with AI-assisted object detection and image segmentation algorithms, the system captures cellular deformation in real time, enabling precise calculation of the oocyte's compressive modulus. This measurement system enables automated, quantitative, and non-destructive evaluation of oocyte mechanical properties, providing an effective approach for oocyte quality screening in in vitro fertilization (IVF) and other assisted reproductive technologies (ART)."

Generative recommendation (GR) models can improve quality by consuming long user-behavior sequences, but in production their online sequence length is tightly capped by the ranking-stage P99 budget. We observe that the majority of GR tokens encode user behaviors that are independent of the item candidates, suggesting an opportunity to pre-infer a user-behavior prefix once and reuse it during ranking rather than recomputing it on the critical path. Realizing this idea at industrial scale is non-trivial: the prefix cache must survive across multiple pipeline stages before the final ranking instance is determined, the user population implies cache footprints far beyond a single device, and indiscriminate pre-inference would overload shared resources under high QPS. We present RelayGR, a production system that enables in-HBM relay-race inference for GR. RelayGR selectively pre-infers long-term user prefixes, keeps their KV caches resident in HBM over the request lifecycle, and ensures the subsequent ranking can consume them without remote fetches. RelayGR combines three techniques: 1) a sequence-aware trigger that admits only at-risk requests under a bounded cache footprint and pre-inference load, 2) an affinity-aware router that co-locates cache production and consumption by routing both the auxiliary pre-infer signal and the ranking request to the same instance, and 3) a memory-aware expander that uses server-local DRAM to capture short-term cross-request reuse while avoiding redundant reloads. We implement RelayGR on Huawei Ascend NPUs and evaluate it with real queries. Under a fixed P99 SLO, RelayGR supports up to 1.5$\\times$ longer sequences and improves SLO-compliant throughput by up to 3.6$\\times$."

We further probe the origin of these results from the viewpoint of integrability, which is taken here to mean wider classes of recursions and differential equations, and give extensions. Prominent in our study are first order linear matrix differential equations. One application given is to the derivation of the third order scalar equation for the density. Another is to obtain the explicit rational function formula for the variance of the purity statistic in the $β$ generalised fixed trace Laguerre ensemble. In the original case ($β= 2$), the purity cumulants are expressed in terms of the large argument expansion of a particular $σ$-Painlevé IV transcendent. In a different but related direction, the exact computation of the two-point correlation for the fixed determinant circular unitary ensemble SU$(N)$ is given the Appendix."

This captures realistic scenarios such as road networks and telecommunication networks. Our approach consists of two rounds of communication. In the first round, each node publishes their incident weight information under local weight differential privacy while in the second round, the nodes locally count below-threshold triangles, for which we introduce a biased and unbiased variant. We further propose two different improvements. We present a pre-computation step that reduces the covariance and thereby lowers the expected error. Secondly, we develop an algorithm for computing the smooth-sensitivity, which significantly reduces the running time compared to a straightforward approach. Finally, we provide experimental results that demonstrate the differences between the biased and unbiased variants and the effectiveness of the proposed improvements."

We further develop a readout architecture combining spin-to-charge conversion with RF reflectometry on a proximal charge sensor, supported by a cryogenic RF chain optimized for operation at $1$-$4~\\mathrm{K}$. Finally, we outline the cryogenic measurement environment, tuning procedures, and a stepwise benchmarking program targeting single-qubit control, phonon-bandgap suppression of relaxation channels, and resolvable phonon-mediated two-qubit coupling. The resulting module provides a scalable template for medium-range coupling of Ge hole-spin qubits and connects materials and phonon engineering with circuit-level readout, enabling future experimental demonstrations of entangling gates, Bell-state generation, and phonon-enabled quantum sensing."

    "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is a flexible framework that combines multiple specialized submodels (``experts''), by assigning covariate-dependent weights (``gating functions'') to each expert, and have been commonly used for analyzing heterogeneous data. Existing statistical MoE formulations typically assume constant coefficients, for covariate effects within the expert or gating models, which can be inadequate for longitudinal, spatial, or other dynamic settings where covariate influences and latent subpopulation structure evolve across a known dimension. We propose a Varying-Coefficient Mixture of Experts (VCMoE) model that allows all coefficient effects in both the gating functions and expert models to vary along an indexing variable. We establish identifiability and consistency of the proposed model, and develop an estimation procedure, label-consistent EM algorithm, for both fully functional and hybrid specifications, along with the corresponding asymptotic distributions of the resulting estimators. For inference, simultaneous confidence bands are constructed using both asymptotic theory for the maximum discrepancy between the estimated functional coefficients and their true counterparts, and with bootstrap methods. In addition, a generalized likelihood ratio test is developed to examine whether a coefficient function is genuinely varying across the index variable. Simulation studies demonstrate good finite-sample performance, with acceptable bias and satisfactory coverage rates. We illustrate the proposed VCMoE model using a dataset of single nucleus gene expression in embryonic mice to characterize the temporal dynamics of the associations between the expression levels of genes Satb2 and Bcl11b across two latent cell subpopulations of neurons, yielding results that are consistent with prior findings."

In previous works, Multiply-Accumulate operation is typically used to measure computational load of a deep model.

This paper poses the question of what aspects are overlooked when expressed in terms of Multiply-Accumulate operations. In experiments, an image classification task is performed on an embedded system device using the CIFAR-100 dataset to compare and analyze the inference times of ten deep models with the theoretically calculated Multiply-Accumulate operations for each model. The results highlight the importance of considering additional computations between tensors when optimizing deep learning models for real-time performing in embedded systems."

Although deep learning models for lane detection categorized into segmentation-based, anchor-based, and curve-based methods there remains a scarcity of universally applicable optimization techniques tailored for low-power embedded environments. To overcome this, we propose an innovative Covariance Distribution Optimization (CDO) module specifically designed for efficient, real-time applications. The CDO module aligns lane feature distributions closely with ground-truth labels, significantly enhancing detection accuracy without increasing computational complexity. Evaluations were conducted on six diverse models across all three method categories, including two optimized for real-time applications and four state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, tested comprehensively on three major datasets: CULane, TuSimple, and LLAMAS. Experimental results demonstrate accuracy improvements ranging from 0.01% to 1.5%. The proposed CDO module is characterized by ease of integration into existing systems without structural modifications and utilizes existing model parameters to facilitate ongoing training, thus offering substantial benefits in performance, power efficiency, and operational flexibility in embedded systems."

For weak Kondo coupling, the spins fractionalize into Majorana fermions comprising a gapless Dirac mode and three gapped visons. Integrating out the visions to second order in the Kondo coupling yields effective electron-electron interactions, including a local Hubbard repulsion, a spin-spin interaction whose sign depends on the Kitaev exchange, and a vertex coupling electrons to Majorana fermions. We analyze the resulting low-energy field theory using a perturbative renormalization group (RG) scheme, accounting for additional density-density interactions generated under RG. At criticality, electrons decouple from Majorana fermions but all three electron interactions acquire positive values. An analysis of susceptibility exponents reveals that the fractionalized Fermi liquid becomes unstable towards antiferromagnetic order and that superconductivity is disfavored."

Agents are classified as anchors and followers, yielding a generic and scalable communication architecture in which each follower interacts with exactly three in-neighbors from the preceding layer, forming an enclosing triangular communication structure. The DNN training weights implicitly encode the spatial configuration of the agent team, thereby providing a geometric representation of the environmental target set. Within this architecture, we formulate a computationally efficient decentralized Markov decision process (MDP) whose components are time-invariant except for a time-varying cost function defined by the deviation from the centroid of the target set contained within each agent communication triangle. By introducing the concept of Anyway Output Controllability (AOC), we assume each agent is AOC and establish decentralized convergence to a desired configuration that optimally represents the environmental target."

However, to our knowledge, the domain of two-person interactions, particularly in the context of martial arts combat, remains uncharted. We identify a significant gap: existing models for single-person dancing generation prove insufficient for capturing the subtleties and complexities of two engaged fighters, resulting in challenges such as identity confusion, anomalous limbs, and action mismatches. To address this, we introduce a pioneering new task, Personalized Martial Arts Combat Video Generation. Our approach, MagicFight, is specifically crafted to overcome these hurdles. Given this pioneering task, we face a lack of appropriate datasets. Thus, we generate a bespoke dataset using the game physics engine Unity, meticulously crafting a multitude of 3D characters, martial arts moves, and scenes designed to represent the diversity of combat. MagicFight refines and adapts existing models and strategies to generate high-fidelity two-person combat videos that maintain individual identities and ensure seamless, coherent action sequences, thereby laying the groundwork for future innovations in the realm of interactive video content creation.

    "abstract": "We suggest a formation scenario of black holes with intermediate mass $\\sim 10^3 M_\\odot$, by post recombination Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion into ultra dense dark matter halos (UDMH) of $\\sim 10^5 M_\\odot$, which have formed around the recombination epoch. Such UDMH can result from rare curvature fluctuations on small scales whose amplitude is still well below the current Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectral distortion limits. Gas accreted by the UDMH is heated to virial temperatures above which atomic cooling is efficient, cools rapidly to about $\\sim 8000$ K and collapses on the free fall time of few $10^4$ yr to the halo core, until supported by rotation. Further fragmentation due to molecular cooling is prevented by the suppression of $H_2$ molecule formation by the CMB photons at redshifts $z> 200-400$. We find that the rotationally supported gas disk will be compact and massive enough to undergo self-gravitational instability in some cases, plausibly where accretion is into a nearly spherical UDMH which has formed from a rare peak in the density field. This results in a further, rapid transfer of mass inwards due to viscous forces and gravitational torques leading to the formation of a supermassive star and/or black hole of about $10^3 M_\\odot$ at redshifts of a few hundred, with abundances comparable to galaxies. Such intermediate mass black holes formed at high redshifts can seed the first super massive black holes and help explain the abundance of active galaxies detected now at increasingly larger redshifts by the James Webb Space Telescope."

    "abstract": "Recent 3D-aware head generative models based on 3D Gaussian Splatting achieve real-time, photorealistic and view-consistent head synthesis. However, a fundamental limitation persists: the deep entanglement of illumination and intrinsic appearance prevents controllable relighting. Existing disentanglement methods rely on strong assumptions to enable weakly supervised learning, which restricts their capacity for complex illumination. To address this challenge, we introduce HeadLighter, a novel supervised framework that learns a physically plausible decomposition of appearance and illumination in head generative models. Specifically, we design a dual-branch architecture that separately models lighting-invariant head attributes and physically grounded rendering components. A progressive disentanglement training is employed to gradually inject head appearance priors into the generative architecture, supervised by multi-view images captured under controlled light conditions with a light stage setup. We further introduce a distillation strategy to generate high-quality normals for realistic rendering. Experiments demonstrate that our method preserves high-quality generation and real-time rendering, while simultaneously supporting explicit lighting and viewpoint editing. We will publicly release our code and dataset."

    "abstract": "3D scene reconstruction is fundamental for spatial intelligence applications such as AR, robotics, and digital twins. Traditional multi-view stereo struggles with sparse viewpoints or low-texture regions, while neural rendering approaches, though capable of producing high-quality results, require per-scene optimization and lack real-time efficiency. Explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient rendering, but most feed-forward variants focus on visual quality rather than geometric consistency, limiting accurate surface reconstruction and overall reliability in spatial perception tasks. This paper presents a novel feed-forward 3DGS framework for 360 images, capable of generating geometrically consistent Gaussian primitives while maintaining high rendering quality. A Depth-Normal geometric regularization is introduced to couple rendered depth gradients with normal information, supervising Gaussian rotation, scale, and position to improve point cloud and surface accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed method maintains high rendering quality while significantly improving geometric consistency, providing an effective solution for 3D reconstruction in spatial perception tasks."

    "abstract": "Neural networks for time series forecasting have relied on error metrics and architecture-specific interpretability approaches for model selection that don't apply across models of different families. To interpret forecasting models agnostic to the types of layers across state-of-the-art model families, we introduce Horizon Activation Mapping (HAM), a visual interpretability technique inspired by grad-CAM that uses gradient norm averages to study the horizon's subseries where grad-CAM studies attention maps over image data. We introduce causal and anti-causal modes to calculate gradient update norm averages across subseries at every timestep and lines of proportionality signifying uniform distributions of the norm averages. Optimization landscape studies with respect to changes in batch sizes, early stopping, train-val-test splits, univariate forecasting and dropouts are studied with respect to performances and subseries in HAM. Interestingly, batch size based differences in activities seem to indicate potential for existence of an exponential approximation across them per epoch relative to each other. Multivariate forecasting models including MLP-based CycleNet, N-Linear, N-HITS, self attention-based FEDformer, Pyraformer, SSM-based SpaceTime and diffusion-based Multi-Resolution DDPM over different horizon sizes trained over the ETTm2 dataset are used for HAM plots in this study. NHITS' neural approximation theorem and SpaceTime's exponential autoregressive activities have been attributed to trends in HAM plots over their training, validation and test sets. In general, HAM can be used for granular model selection, validation set choices and comparisons across different neural network model families."

Res. 42(1):95--118 (2017)], which may require solving several subproblems for a one-step update, pDCA only requires solving a single subproblem. Therefore, the computational cost of pDCA for one-step update is comparable to the widely used difference-of-convex algorithm (DCA) introduced in [D. T. Pham and H. A. Le Thi, Acta Math. Vietnam. 22(1):289--355 (1997)] for computing a critical point. Importantly, under practical assumptions, we prove that every accumulation point of the sequence generated by pDCA is a d-stationary point almost surely.

Combining \\textit{Planck} CMB data with DESI DR2 BAO and DESY5 supernovae, we obtain stringent constraints on neutrino physics, including \\(\\sum m_ν< 0.11~\\mathrm{eV}\\) (95\\% CL) and \\(N_{\\rm eff} = 2.98^{+0.13}_{-0.14}\\), fully consistent with Standard Model expectations. Crucially, the data exhibit a statistically significant preference for a late-time dark-energy transition, characterized by a robust quintessence--phantom crossing that remains stable across all dataset combinations and neutrino-sector extensions, including the presence of a sterile neutrino. The combined effects of modified late-time expansion and additional relativistic degrees of freedom systematically raise the inferred Hubble constant, substantially alleviating the \\(H_0\\) tension without invoking early dark energy or introducing theoretical instabilities. Overall, the \\(w_{\\dagger}\\)VCDM scenario emerges as a compelling phenomenological framework that simultaneously accommodates current constraints on neutrino physics, provides an excellent fit to recent BAO and supernovae data, and offers a viable pathway toward resolving persistent tensions in the standard cosmological model."

We develop a theoretical model to optimize both the modulation frequency and the modulation amplitude of the coupling beam, thereby maximizing the atomic response. Once optimized, the sensitivity to detuned RF fields of this modulation transfer protocol is compared with that of the conventional protocol. This comparison shows that the new protocol outperforms the usual one as soon as the RF signal to be measured is detuned by more than a few MHz and offers a complementary approach to increase the detection bandwidth.

To address these, we propose DMPEAD, a Dynamic Model Pool and Ensembling framework for MTS Anomaly Detection. The framework first (i) constructs a diverse model pool via parameter transfer and diversity metric, then (ii) updates it with a meta-model and similarity-based strategy for adaptive pool expansion, subset selection, and pool merging, finally (iii) ensembles top-ranked models through proxy metric ranking and top-k aggregation in the selected subset, outputting the final anomaly detection result.

    "abstract": "The Internet of Agents is propelling edge computing toward agentic AI and edge general intelligence (EGI). However, deploying multi-agent service (MAS) on resource-constrained edge infrastructure presents severe challenges. MAS service workflows are driven by complex cross-node interactions, dynamic memory accumulation, and collaborative tool usage. Exhibiting chain-like topological dependencies and strict affinity constraints, these workflows demand real-time responsiveness that exceeds the capabilities of traditional VNE algorithms designed for static resources. To address this, we propose AgentVNE, a cloud-edge collaborative framework utilizing a dual-layer architecture. First, AgentVNE employs a large language model (LLM) to identify implicit semantic constraints and generate affinity-based resource augmentation to resolve physical dependency issues. Second, it constructs a resource similarity-aware neural network, utilizing a pre-training and PPO fine-tuning strategy to precisely capture topological similarities between dynamic workflows and heterogeneous networks. By coupling semantic perception with topological reasoning, this mechanism effectively bridges the gap between dynamic service requirements and physical infrastructure. Simulation results demonstrate that AgentVNE reduces workflow communication latency to less than 40% of baselines and improves the service acceptance rate by approximately 5%-10% under high-load scenarios. Ultimately, this work provides a foundational solution for the semantic-aware deployment of agentic AI."

We introduce a general, model-agnostic methodology for injecting privileged information-such as bounding box masks, saliency maps, and depth cues-into deep learning-based object detectors through a teacher-student architecture. Experiments are conducted across five state-of-the-art object detection models and multiple public benchmarks, including UAV-based litter detection datasets and Pascal VOC 2012, to assess the impact on accuracy, generalization, and computational efficiency. Our results demonstrate that LUPI-trained students consistently outperform their baseline counterparts, achieving significant boosts in detection accuracy with no increase in inference complexity or model size. Performance improvements are especially marked for medium and large objects, while ablation studies reveal that intermediate weighting of teacher guidance optimally balances learning from privileged and standard inputs. The findings affirm that the LUPI framework provides an effective and practical strategy for advancing object detection systems in both resource-constrained and real-world settings."

The comparable benchmarks are the archetype anti-\\ce{B18H22} denoted as (1) against hypothetical halogenated derivatives: 7-F-anti-\\ce{B18H21} (2), 4-F-anti-\\ce{B18H21} (3), and the recently synthesized 4-Br-anti-\\ce{B18H21} (4). The analysis includes an optimization of the ground and first singlet excited states, vibrational frequency analysis, and a comprehensive spectroscopic profile covering IR, Raman, UV-Vis absorption, and emission spectra. The IR spectra of the fluorinated compounds feature a characteristic B-F stretching peak, while the Raman spectra closely resemble the parent molecule. UV-Vis spectral analysis shows a redshift and oscillator strength enhancement for F at position B7, indicating altered electronic properties due to substitution with lighter halogen. Furthermore, solvent effects enhance the probability of electronic transitions. Halogene presence led to a decrease of the energy gap EG(LUMO-HOMO) due to the stabilization of LUMO, which implied a redshift in the emission/absorption wavelength spectra, with the largest EG change at around 14\\% occurring for the (4)$^{th}$ benchmark compound.. Notably, all compounds emit light within the visible spectrum, underscoring their potential for optoelectronic applications."

However, the computational mechanism underlying this ability remains poorly understood. Here, we present a dual-module neural network framework, the CATS Net, to bridge this gap. Our model consists of a concept-abstraction module that extracts low-dimensional conceptual representations, and a task-solving module that performs visual judgement tasks under the hierarchical gating control of the formed concepts. The system develops transferable semantic structure based on concept representations that enable cross-network knowledge transfer through conceptual communication. Model-brain fitting analyses reveal that these emergent concept spaces align with both neurocognitive semantic model and brain response structures in the human ventral occipitotemporal cortex, while the gating mechanisms mirror that in the semantic control brain network. This work establishes a unified computational framework that can offer mechanistic insights for understanding human conceptual cognition and engineering artificial systems with human-like conceptual intelligence."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in recommendation scenarios due to their strong natural language understanding and generation capabilities. However, they are trained on vast corpora whose contents are not publicly disclosed, raising concerns about data leakage. Recent work has shown that the MovieLens-1M dataset is memorized by both the LLaMA and OpenAI model families, but the extraction of such memorized data has so far relied exclusively on manual prompt engineering. In this paper, we pose three main questions: Is it possible to enhance manual prompting? Can LLM memorization be detected through methods beyond manual prompting? And can the detection of data leakage be automated? To address these questions, we evaluate three approaches: (i) jailbreak prompt engineering; (ii) unsupervised latent knowledge discovery, probing internal activations via Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) and Cluster-Norm; and (iii) Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE), which frames prompt discovery as a meta-learning process that iteratively refines candidate instructions. Experiments on MovieLens-1M using LLaMA models show that jailbreak prompting does not improve the retrieval of memorized items and remains inconsistent; CCS reliably distinguishes genuine from fabricated movie titles but fails on numerical user and rating data; and APE retrieves item-level information with moderate success yet struggles to recover numerical interactions. These findings suggest that automatically optimizing prompts is the most promising strategy for extracting memorized samples."

Given these successes, the Recommender Systems (RSs) community has begun investigating its applications within recommendation scenarios primarily focusing on accuracy.

Specifically, the capabilities of providing diverse and novel recommendations or exploring potential biases such as popularity bias have not been thoroughly examined. As the use of these models continues to expand, understanding these aspects is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and achieving long-term personalization. This study investigates the recommendations provided by ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 by assessing ChatGPT's capabilities in terms of diversity, novelty, and popularity bias. We evaluate these models on three distinct datasets and assess their performance in Top-N recommendation and cold-start scenarios. The findings reveal that ChatGPT-4 matches or surpasses traditional recommenders, demonstrating the ability to balance novelty and diversity in recommendations. Furthermore, in the cold-start scenario, ChatGPT models exhibit superior performance in both accuracy and novelty, suggesting they can be particularly beneficial for new users.

    "abstract": "Overload-induced cascading failures can cause extreme disruptions in a wide range of networked systems, such as power grids, transportation networks, or financial systems. Empirical studies across domains report that the size of such disruptions often follows a Pareto- or heavy-tailed distribution. While many models reproduce this scaling behavior, they are either tailored to specific domains or based on simplified mechanisms that overlook key aspects of overload cascading behavior. Hence, a general understanding of the mechanisms driving scale-free behavior in these settings remains incomplete. In this paper, we develop a universal and analytically tractable model of overload cascading failures on flow networks, offering a new perspective on how Pareto-tailed disruptions emerge across networks. Our framework shows, under mild assumptions, that heavy-tailed disruptions can arise naturally from Pareto-tailed external inputs, and it establishes a transformation law linking the input and output tail exponents. We further identify broad conditions under which the resulting cascade cost exhibits a heavy-tailed distribution and show that the mechanism is robust across several domains, including power transmission, traffic networks, and processing systems. Our results provide a unified explanation for the emergence of scale-free failures in overload-driven systems and connect previously disparate, application-specific models under a unified framework."

    "abstract": "Instruction tuning increasingly relies on LLM-based prompt refinement, where prompts in the training corpus are selectively rewritten by an external refiner to improve clarity and instruction alignment. This motivates an instance-level audit problem: for a fine-tuned model and a training prompt-response pair, can we infer whether the model was trained on the original prompt or its LLM-refined version within a mixed corpus? This matters for dataset governance and dispute resolution when training data are contested. However, it is non-trivial in practice: refined and raw instances are interleaved in the training corpus with unknown, source-dependent mixture ratios, making it harder to develop provenance methods that generalize across models and training setups. In this paper, we formalize this audit task as Refinement Provenance Inference (RPI) and show that prompt refinement yields stable, detectable shifts in teacher-forced token distributions, even when semantic differences are not obvious. Building on this phenomenon, we propose RePro, a logit-based provenance framework that fuses teacher-forced likelihood features with logit-ranking signals. During training, RePro learns a transferable representation via shadow fine-tuning, and uses a lightweight linear head to infer provenance on unseen victims without training-data access. Empirically, RePro consistently attains strong performance and transfers well across refiners, suggesting that it exploits refiner-agnostic distribution shifts rather than rewrite-style artifacts."

In this paper, we propose a novel framework - Forget Less by Learning Together (FL2T) - that enables concurrent and order-agnostic concept learning while addressing catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, we introduce a set-invariant inter-concept learning module where proxies guide feature selection across concepts, facilitating improved knowledge retention and transfer. By leveraging inter-concept guidance, our approach preserves old concepts while efficiently incorporating new ones. Extensive experiments, across three datasets, demonstrates that our method significantly improves concept retention and mitigates catastrophic forgetting, highlighting the effectiveness of inter-concept catalytic behavior in incremental concept learning of ten tasks with at least 2% gain on average CLIP Image Alignment scores."

This paper concentrates on relieving this requirement via developing a coarse-to-fine normal estimator. Concretely, our method first trains a neat model from a small dataset to produce coarse face normals that perform as guidance (called exemplars) for the following refinement. A self-attention mechanism is employed to capture long-range dependencies, thus remedying severe local artifacts left in estimated coarse facial normals. Then, a refinement network is customized for the sake of mapping input face images together with corresponding exemplars to fine-grained high-quality facial normals. Such a logical function split can significantly cut the requirement of massive paired data and computational resource. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of our design and reveal its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of both training expense as well as estimation quality.

Curated, provenance-tracked reaction corpora are assembled from heterogeneous public sources into a harmonized representation and packaged as versioned datasets for each task family, with explicit source metadata, licence tags, and machine-readable manifests that record checksums, and row counts. For every task, SynRXN provides transparent splitting functions that generate leakage-aware train, validation, and test partitions, together with standardized evaluation workflows and metric suites tailored to classification, regression, and structured prediction settings. For sensitive benchmarking, we combine public training and validation data with held-out gold-standard test sets, and contamination-prone tasks such as reaction rebalancing and atom-to-atom mapping are distributed only as evaluation sets and are explicitly not intended for model training. Scripted build recipes enable bitwise-reproducible regeneration of all corpora across machines and over time, and the entire resource is released under permissive open licences to support reuse and extension. By removing dataset heterogeneity and packaging transparent, reusable evaluation scaffolding, SynRXN enables fair longitudinal comparison of CASP methods, supports rigorous ablations and stress tests along the full reaction-informatics pipeline, and lowers the barrier for practitioners who seek robust and comparable performance estimates for real-world synthesis planning workloads."

As vector data scales rapidly, VS faces growing challenges in balancing search, latency, scalability, and cost. The evolution of VS has been closely driven by changes in storage architecture. Early VS methods rely on all-in-memory designs for low latency, but scalability is constrained by memory capacity and cost. To address this, recent research has adopted heterogeneous architectures that offload space-intensive vectors and index structures to SSDs, while exploiting block locality and I/O-efficient strategies to maintain high search performance at billion scale. Looking ahead, the increasing demand for trillion-scale vector retrieval and cloud-native elasticity is driving a further shift toward memory-SSD-object storage architectures, which enable cost-efficient data tiering and seamless scalability. In this tutorial, we review the evolution of VS techniques from a storage-architecture perspective. We first review memory-resident methods, covering classical IVF, hash, quantization, and graph-based designs. We then present a systematic overview of heterogeneous storage VS techniques, including their index designs, block-level layouts, query strategies, and update mechanisms. Finally, we examine emerging cloud-native systems and highlight open research opportunities for future large-scale vector retrieval systems."

The rising energy consumption of supercomputing facilities poses a significant environmental and financial challenge. In this work, we build upon a recently developed GPU implementation of pinocchio, a widely-used tool for the fast generation of dark matter (DM) halo catalogues, to investigate energy consumption. Using a different resource configuration, we confirmed the time-to-solution behavior observed in a companion study, and we use these runs to compare time-to-solution with energy-to-solution. By profiling the code on various HPC platforms with a newly developed implementation of the Power Measurement Toolkit (PMT), we demonstrate an 8x reduction in energy-to-solution and 8x speed-up in time-to-solution compared to the CPU-only version. Taken together, these gains translate into an overall efficiency improvement of up to 64x. Our results show that the GPU-accelerated pinocchio not only achieves substantial speed-up, making the generation of large-scale mock catalogues more tractable, but also significantly reduces the energy footprint of the simulations. This work represents an step towards ``green-aware\" scientific computing in cosmology, proving that performance and sustainability can be simultaneously achieved."

This evolutionary process adapts to the model's ability throughout training, optimising problems for learnability. We propose two LLM-driven mutation strategies in which the model itself mutates the training data, either by altering contextual details or by directly modifying problem structure. We find that the model can generate novel and meaningful problems, and that these LLM-driven mutations improve RL training. We analyse key aspects of DéjàQ, including the validity of generated problems and computational overhead.

To address this, we introduce a novel concept called quantile distortion, which enables non-uniform pessimism by adjusting the degree of conservatism based on the availability of supporting data. Our approach is grounded in theoretical analysis and empirically validated, demonstrating improved performance over uniform pessimism."

Uniform-in-time and uniform-in-$ε$ moment bounds of the scheme are established and the convergence in total variation distance of order $O(T\\cdot\\text{Poly}(ε^{-1})τ^γ),γ<\\tfrac12$ is established, between the law of the numerical scheme and that of the SPDE over $[0,T]$. In contrast to the exponential dependence due to standard arguments, the obtained error bound depends on $ε^{-1}$ and $T$ polynomially. By incorporating carefully chosen method parameters, we only require a mild and $ε$-independent restriction on the time step-size $τ$, getting rid of the severe restriction $τ=O(ε^σ),σ\\geq1$ in the literature. Also, a uniform-in-time error bound of order $O(τ^γ),γ<\\tfrac12$, is obtained for a fixed $ε=1$, which improves the existing ones in the literature and matches the classical weak convergence rate in the globally Lipschitz setting. The error analysis is highly nontrivial due to the low regularity of the considered problem, the super-linear growth of the drift, the non-smooth observables inherent in the total variation metric and the presence of the small interface parameter $ε\\to0$. These difficulties are addressed by introducing a new strategy of nonlinearity modification and establishing refined regularity estimates for the associated Kolmogorov equation to an auxiliary process with non-smooth test functions. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical convergence and the ability of interface-capturing for the proposed scheme."

We propose CausalNav, the first scene graph-based semantic navigation framework tailored for dynamic outdoor environments. We construct a multi-level semantic scene graph using LLMs, referred to as the Embodied Graph, that hierarchically integrates coarse-grained map data with fine-grained object entities. The constructed graph serves as a retrievable knowledge base for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), enabling semantic navigation and long-range planning under open-vocabulary queries. By fusing real-time perception with offline map data, the Embodied Graph supports robust navigation across varying spatial granularities in dynamic outdoor environments. Dynamic objects are explicitly handled in both the scene graph construction and hierarchical planning modules. The Embodied Graph is continuously updated within a temporal window to reflect environmental changes and support real-time semantic navigation. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate superior robustness and efficiency."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new theoretical framework for analyzing lead-lag relationships between point processes, with a special focus on applications to high-frequency financial data. In particular, we are interested in lead-lag relationships between two sequences of order arrival timestamps. The seminal work of Dobrev and Schaumburg proposed model-free measures of cross-market trading activity based on cross-counts of timestamps. While their method is known to yield reliable results, it faces limitations because its original formulation inherently relies on discrete-time observations, an issue we address in this study. Specifically, we formulate the problem of estimating lead-lag relationships in two point processes as that of estimating the shape of the cross-pair correlation function (CPCF) of a bivariate stationary point process, a quantity well-studied in the neuroscience and spatial statistics literature. Within this framework, the prevailing lead-lag time is defined as the location of the CPCF's sharpest peak. Under this interpretation, the peak location in Dobrev and Schaumburg's cross-market activity measure can be viewed as an estimator of the lead-lag time in the aforementioned sense. We further propose an alternative lead-lag time estimator based on kernel density estimation and show that it possesses desirable theoretical properties and delivers superior numerical performance. Empirical evidence from high-frequency financial data demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method."

By estimating parameters for a minimal set of virtual light sources, RRNet enables localized relighting through a depth-aware rendering module without requiring pixel-aligned training data. This object-aware formulation preserves facial identity and supports real-time, high-resolution performance using a streamlined encoder and lightweight prediction head. To facilitate training, we propose a generative AI-based dataset creation pipeline that synthesizes diverse lighting conditions at low cost. With its interpretable lighting control and efficient architecture, RRNet is well suited for practical applications such as video conferencing, AR-based portrait enhancement, and mobile photography. Experiments show that RRNet consistently outperforms prior methods in low-light enhancement, localized illumination adjustment, and glare removal."

    "abstract": "We present a new approach to forecasting North Pacific Sea Surface Temperatures (SST) by recognizing that interannual variability primarily reflects amplitude changes in four dominant seasonal cycles. Our multivariate linear model simultaneously captures these amplitude-modulated seasonal cycles along with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), which naturally emerges as an intrinsic feature of the system rather than a separate phenomenon. Using sixteen-dimensional regression based on four spatially distributed time series per variable, the model delivers unprecedented forecast accuracy for both interannual amplitude modulations and PDO evolution, maintaining skill beyond 36 months -- a substantial improvement over current operational and research forecasts, including machine learning methods. Predictions initialized in 2024 project that the PDO will remain in its negative phase through late 2026, implying reduced likelihood of severe marine heatwaves in the eastern North Pacific during this period. These findings have direct implications for regional climate impacts, including storm tracks, precipitation patterns, and marine ecosystem health. By treating seasonal and interannual variability as coupled rather than independent processes, this framework advances our understanding of North Pacific climate dynamics and provides a powerful tool for stakeholders managing climate-sensitive resources and planning adaptation strategies in regions strongly influenced by North Pacific conditions."

To examine whether mass inflation persists in this setting, we model the interaction of ingoing and outgoing perturbations by considering the collision of two spherical null shells inside the black hole. Using the Dray-'t\\,Hooft-Barrabes-Israel junction condition, we derive conditions under which the metric function and curvature invariants may experience significant amplification near the inner horizon. Our analysis shows that, unlike in classical Reissner--Nordström or Kerr geometries, significant mass inflation requires shell intersection at radii very close to the horizon, with radial separations from it of the order $r-r_* \\lesssim \\ell \\big(\\ell/r_g\\big)^{2n(D-3)}$, where $r_g$ is the gravitational radius of the black hole, $D$ is the number of spacetime dimensions and $n\\ge 1$ is a parameter depending on a concrete QTG model.

We test both the well-known Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu inequality and a related Bell inequality tailored for maximally entangled states in high-dimension. We observe violations that are large enough to also rule out any quantum model based on entanglement of lower dimension, thereby demonstrating genuinely high-dimensional nonlocality free of the binarisation loophole."

This approach avoids the need for gauge-including atomic orbitals (GIAOs), which are typically required to circumvent the unphysical dependence of the CD rotatory strengths on the arbitrary choice of coordinate origin for length gauge (LG) computations. Benchmark VCD spectra are presented for (P)-hydrogen peroxide, (S)-methyloxirane, (1R, 5R)-α-pinene, and (1R, 4R)-camphor using Hartree-Fock (HF) theory and density functional theory (DFT) methods across a range of basis sets and compared to those obtained from LG, velocity-gauge (VG), and GIAO computations. These analyses show that for VCD the LG(OI) approach does not converge to the basis-set limit as rapidly as the GIAO approach, but does yield similar quality spectra as GIAO for all major VCD peaks for quadruple-zeta-quality basis sets. The LG(OI) and VG VCD spectra are less reliable compared to GIAOs for smaller basis sets."

    "abstract": "Recent works propose extending 3DGS with semantic feature vectors for simultaneous semantic segmentation and image rendering. However, these methods often treat the semantic and rendering branches separately, relying solely on 2D supervision while ignoring the 3D Gaussian geometry. Moreover, current adaptive strategies adapt the Gaussian set depending solely on rendering gradients, which can be insufficient in subtle or textureless regions. In this work, we propose a joint enhancement framework for 3D semantic Gaussian modeling that synergizes both semantic and rendering branches. Firstly, unlike conventional point cloud shape encoding, we introduce an anisotropic 3D Gaussian Chebyshev descriptor using the Laplace-Beltrami operator to capture fine-grained 3D shape details, thereby distinguishing objects with similar appearances and reducing reliance on potentially noisy 2D guidance. In addition, without relying solely on rendering gradient, we adaptively adjust Gaussian allocation and spherical harmonics with local semantic and shape signals, enhancing rendering efficiency through selective resource allocation. Finally, we employ a cross-scene knowledge transfer module to continuously update learned shape patterns, enabling faster convergence and robust representations without relearning shape information from scratch for each new scene. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate improvements in segmentation accuracy and rendering quality while maintaining high rendering frame rates."

In this work, we conduct a systematic evaluation of persona-aware toxicity detection, showing that no single prompting method, including our proposed automated prompt optimization strategy, uniformly dominates across all model-persona pairs. To exploit complementary errors, we explore ensembling four prompting variants and propose a lightweight meta-ensemble: an SVM over the 4-bit vector of prompt predictions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed SVM ensemble consistently outperforms individual prompting methods and traditional majority-voting techniques, achieving the strongest overall performance across diverse personas. This work provides one of the first systematic comparisons of persona-conditioned prompting for toxicity detection and offers a robust method for pluralistic evaluation in subjective NLP tasks."

Currently at risk under climate change, the sea-ice microbiome holds mysteries about evolution of life on Earth and possibly elsewhere, which require methodological innovation to be unravelled. Gaining microscopic insight into the internal structure and biology of sea ice has traditionally been limited to destructive and extrusive ice core sampling methods. Here we present an in situ microscopic imaging system to observe undisturbed living microorganisms directly within sea the ice matrix. The complex and heterogeneous nature of sea ice, including its water crystal lattice, brine channels, air bubbles, and various impurities, presents engineering challenges for the development of this imaging system. Despite the fragile nature of the sea-ice matrix, we could successfully deploy, test and use the new in situ microscope during a recent expedition on the icepack in Arctic. We collected numerous images of live and intact single-celled and colony-forming diatoms, and documented for the first time at such a high resolution some microphysical features of sea ice. The hardware and software design of the endoscope is presented along with acquisition results of the microstructure and diatom images. These findings collectively demonstrate the potential for this new in situ microscopic imaging system to transform the way we study sea ice and to allow a deeper understanding of its complex microstructure and living microorganisms."

We use the Atmospheric Big Challenge (ABC) database, a publicly available dataset with over 100,000 simulated exoplanet spectra, to construct an anomaly detection scenario by defining CO2-rich atmospheres as anomalies and CO2-poor atmospheres as the normal class. We benchmarked four different anomaly detection strategies: Autoencoder Reconstruction Loss, One-Class Support Vector Machine (1 class-SVM), K-means Clustering, and Local Outlier Factor (LOF). Each method was evaluated in both the original spectral space and the autoencoder's latent space using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics. To test the performance of the different methods under realistic conditions, we introduced Gaussian noise levels ranging from 10 to 50 ppm. Our results indicate that anomaly detection is consistently more effective when performed within the latent space across all noise levels. Specifically, K-means clustering in the latent space emerged as a stable and high-performing method. We demonstrate that this anomaly detection approach is robust to noise levels up to 30 ppm (consistent with realistic space-based observations) and remains viable even at 50 ppm when leveraging latent space representations. On the other hand, the performance of the anomaly detection methods applied directly in the raw spectral space degrades significantly with increasing the level of noise. This suggests that autoencoder-driven dimensionality reduction offers a robust methodology for flagging chemically anomalous targets in large-scale surveys where exhaustive retrievals are computationally prohibitive."

    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) prediction is often approached by restricting models to causal or invariant covariates, avoiding non-causal spurious associations that may be unstable across environments. Despite its theoretical appeal, this strategy frequently underperforms empirical risk minimization (ERM) in practice. We investigate the source of this gap and show that such failures naturally arise when only a subset of the true causes of the outcome is observed. In these settings, non-causal spurious covariates can serve as informative proxies for unobserved causes and substantially improve prediction, except under distribution shifts that break these proxy relationships. Consequently, the optimal set of predictive covariates is neither universal nor necessarily exhibits invariant relationships with the outcome across all environments, but instead depends on the specific type of shift encountered. Crucially, we observe that different covariate shifts induce distinct, observable signatures in the covariate distribution itself. Moreover, these signatures can be extracted from unlabeled data in the target OOD environment and used to assess when proxy covariates remain reliable and when they fail. Building on this observation, we propose an environment-adaptive covariate selection (EACS) algorithm that maps environment-level covariate summaries to environment-specific covariate sets, while allowing the incorporation of prior causal knowledge as constraints. Across simulations and applied datasets, EACS consistently outperforms static causal, invariant, and ERM-based predictors under diverse distribution shifts."

Despite a large body of work focused on training frontier vision-language models (VLMs), approaches to their evaluation remain nascent. To guide their maturation, we propose three desiderata that evaluations should satisfy: (1) faithfulness to the modality and application, (2) discriminability between models of varying quality, and (3) efficiency in compute. Through this lens, we identify critical failure modes that violate faithfulness and discriminability, misrepresenting model capabilities: (i) multiple-choice formats reward guessing, poorly reflect downstream use cases, and saturate early as models improve; (ii) blindly solvable questions, which can be answered without images, constitute up to 70% of some evaluations; and (iii) mislabeled or ambiguous samples compromise up to 42% of examples in certain datasets. Regarding efficiency, the computational burden of evaluating frontier models has become prohibitive: by some accounts, nearly 20% of development compute is devoted to evaluation alone. Rather than discarding existing benchmarks, we curate them via transformation and filtering to maximize fidelity and discriminability. We find that converting multiple-choice questions to generative tasks reveals sharp capability drops of up to 35%. In addition, filtering blindly solvable and mislabeled samples improves discriminative power while simultaneously reducing computational cost. We release DatBench-Full, a cleaned evaluation suite of 33 datasets spanning nine VLM capabilities, and DatBench, a discriminative subset that achieves 13x average speedup (up to 50x) while closely matching the discriminative power of the original datasets. Our work outlines a path toward evaluation practices that are both rigorous and sustainable as VLMs continue to scale."

It has been shown that hidden representations learned by deep models can encode sensitive information from the input, making it possible for adversaries to recover the input data with considerable accuracy. This problem is exacerbated in transformer embeddings because they consist of multiple vectors, one per token. To mitigate this risk, we propose Nonparametric Variational Differential Privacy (NVDP), which ensures both useful data sharing and strong privacy protection. We take a differential privacy approach, integrating a Nonparametric Variational Information Bottleneck (NVIB) layer into the transformer architecture to inject noise into its multi-vector embeddings and thereby hide information, and measuring privacy protection with Rényi divergence and its corresponding Bayesian Differential Privacy (BDP) guarantee. Training the NVIB layer calibrates the noise level according to utility. We test NVDP on the GLUE benchmark and show that varying the noise level gives us a useful tradeoff between privacy and accuracy. With lower noise levels, our model maintains high accuracy while offering strong privacy guarantees, effectively balancing privacy and utility."

This multi-objective design jointly optimizes podcast outcomes such as streams, clicks, and follows for both ads and promotions using a shared representation over user, content, context, and creative features, effectively supporting diverse business goals while improving user experience. Online A/B tests show up to a 22% reduction in effective Cost-Per-Stream (eCPS), particularly for less-streamed podcasts, and an 18-24% increase in podcast stream rates.

    "abstract": "The increasing production of waste, driven by population growth, has created challenges in managing and recycling materials effectively. Manual waste sorting is a common practice; however, it remains inefficient for handling large-scale waste streams and presents health risks for workers. On the other hand, existing automated sorting approaches still struggle with the high variability, clutter, and visual complexity of real-world waste streams. The lack of real-world datasets for waste sorting is a major reason automated systems for this problem are underdeveloped. Accordingly, we introduce SortWaste, a densely annotated object detection dataset collected from a Material Recovery Facility. Additionally, we contribute to standardizing waste detection in sorting lines by proposing ClutterScore, an objective metric that gauges the scene's hardness level using a set of proxies that affect visual complexity (e.g., object count, class and size entropy, and spatial overlap). In addition to these contributions, we provide an extensive benchmark of state-of-the-art object detection models, detailing their results with respect to the hardness level assessed by the proposed metric. Despite achieving promising results (mAP of 59.7% in the plastic-only detection task), performance significantly decreases in highly cluttered scenes. This highlights the need for novel and more challenging datasets on the topic."

    "abstract": "We investigate the angle of repose $θ_r$ of dense suspensions of colloidal silica particles ($d = 2$ $μm$ to $7$ $μm$) in water-filled microfluidic rotating drums experiments, to probe the crossover between the thermal (colloidal) and athermal (granular) regimes. For the smallest particles, thermal agitation promotes slow creep flows, and piles always flatten completely regardless of their initial inclination angle, resulting in $θ_r = 0$. Above a critical particle size, piles of colloids stop flowing at a finite angle of repose, which increases with particle size but remains below the minimal value expected for athermal frictionless granular materials: $0 < θ_r < θ_{ath} \\approx 5.8°$. We quantify the arrest dynamics as a function of the gravitational Péclet number $Pe_g$, which characterizes the competition between particle weight and thermal agitation. Our measurements are consistent with a recent rheological model [Billon et al., Phys. Rev. Fluids 8, 034302, 2023], in which the arrested state stems from a crossover between glass-like and jamming-dominated regimes as the granular pressure in the pile increases relative to the thermal pressure."

Our system ingests high-resolution loop detector and signal state data, along with sparse probe trajectory data. It first performs descriptive analytics and detects potential interruptions. It then uses the SUMO microsimulator for prescriptive analytics, testing hundreds of what-if scenarios to optimize traffic performance. The modular design allows integration of different algorithms for data processing and outlier detection. Built using open-source software and libraries, the pipeline is cost-effective, scalable, and easy to deploy. We hope BigSUMO will be a valuable aid in developing smart city mobility solutions."

    "abstract": "Human mesh recovery from multi-view images faces a fundamental challenge: real-world datasets contain imperfect ground-truth annotations that bias the models' training, while synthetic data with precise supervision suffers from domain gap. In this paper, we propose DiffProxy, a novel framework that generates multi-view consistent human proxies for mesh recovery. Central to DiffProxy is leveraging the diffusion-based generative priors to bridge the synthetic training and real-world generalization. Its key innovations include: (1) a multi-conditional mechanism for generating multi-view consistent, pixel-aligned human proxies; (2) a hand refinement module that incorporates flexible visual prompts to enhance local details; and (3) an uncertainty-aware test-time scaling method that increases robustness to challenging cases during optimization. These designs ensure that the mesh recovery process effectively benefits from the precise synthetic ground truth and generative advantages of the diffusion-based pipeline. Trained entirely on synthetic data, DiffProxy achieves state-of-the-art performance across five real-world benchmarks, demonstrating strong zero-shot generalization particularly on challenging scenarios with occlusions and partial views.

    "abstract": "Polymer-based long-acting injectables (LAIs) have transformed the treatment of chronic diseases by enabling controlled drug delivery, thus reducing dosing frequency and extending therapeutic duration. Achieving controlled drug release from LAIs requires extensive optimization of the complex underlying physicochemical properties. Machine learning (ML) can accelerate LAI development by modeling the complex relationships between LAI properties and drug release. However, recent ML studies have provided limited information on key properties that modulate drug release, due to the lack of custom modeling and analysis tailored to LAI data. This paper presents a novel data transformation and explainable ML approach to synthesize actionable information from 321 LAI formulations by predicting early drug release at 24, 48, and 72 hours, classification of release profile types, and prediction of complete release profiles. These three experiments investigate the contribution and control of LAI material characteristics in early and complete drug release profiles. A strong correlation (>0.65) is observed between the true and predicted drug release in 72 hours, while a 0.87 F1-score is obtained in classifying release profile types. A time-independent ML framework predicts delayed biphasic and triphasic curves with better performance than current time-dependent approaches. Shapley additive explanations reveal the relative influence of material characteristics during early and for complete release which fill several gaps in previous in-vitro and ML-based studies. The novel approach and findings can provide a quantitative strategy and recommendations for scientists to optimize the drug-release dynamics of LAI. The source code for the model implementation is publicly available."

Earlier work (e.g., Jain et al., NeurIPS 2023 for counting distinct elements; Raskhodnikova & Steiner, PODS 2025 for triangle counting with edge updates) reduced the respective cardinality estimation problem to continual counting on the difference stream associated with the true function values on the input stream. In such reductions, a change in the original stream can cause many changes in the difference stream, this poses a challenge for applying private continual counting algorithms to obtain optimal error bounds. We improve the accuracy of several such reductions by studying the associated $\\ell_p$-sensitivity vectors of the resulting difference streams and isolating their properties. We demonstrate that our framework gives improved bounds for counting distinct elements, estimating degree histograms, and estimating triangle counts (under a slightly relaxed privacy model), thus offering a general approach to private continual cardinality estimation in streaming settings. Our improved accuracy stems from tight analysis of known factorization mechanisms for the counting matrix in this setting; the key technical challenge is arguing that one can use state-of-the-art factorizations for sensitivity vector sets with the properties we isolate. Empirically and analytically, we demonstrate that our improved error bounds offer a substantial improvement in accuracy for cardinality estimation problems over a large range of parameters."

SER programs are suitably restricted to make this problem decidable, while still allowing for an unbounded number of concurrent threads of execution, each potentially running for an unbounded number of steps. Building on prior theoretical results, we give the first automated end-to-end decision procedure that either proves serializability by producing a checkable certificate, or refutes it by producing a counterexample trace. We also present a network-system abstraction to which SER programs compile. Our decision procedure then reduces serializability in this setting to a Petri net reachability query. Furthermore, in order to scale, we curtail the search space via multiple optimizations, including Petri net slicing, semilinear-set compression, and Presburger-formula manipulation. We extensively evaluate our framework and show that, despite the theoretical hardness of the problem, it can successfully handle various models of real-world programs, including stateful firewalls, BGP routers, and more."

Inference on graph-structured data requires methods that are permutation-invariant, scalable across varying sizes and sparsities, and capable of capturing complex long-range dependencies, making posterior estimation on graph parameters particularly challenging. Amortized Bayesian Inference (ABI) is a simulation-based framework that employs generative neural networks to enable fast, likelihood-free posterior inference. We adapt ABI to graph data to address these challenges to perform inference on node-, edge-, and graph-level parameters. Our approach couples permutation-invariant graph encoders with flexible neural posterior estimators in a two-module pipeline: a summary network maps attributed graphs to fixed-length representations, and an inference network approximates the posterior over parameters. In this setting, several neural architectures can serve as the summary network. In this work we evaluate multiple architectures and assess their performance on controlled synthetic settings and two real-world domains - biology and logistics - in terms of recovery and calibration."

This study investigates how avatar-based social representation in Virtual Reality (VR) influences coordination in threshold collective action problems. Through a randomized controlled experiment with 188 participants organized in 94 pairs, we examine whether brief avatar exposure affects perceived co-presence and coordination outcomes in a two-player threshold public goods game implemented as a real-effort recycling task. We manipulate a single design feature: participants either briefly interact through avatars before the main task (Pre-Task Avatar treatment) or complete an equivalent activity individually without peer visibility (No Pre-Task Avatar treatment). Our findings reveal that minimal avatar exposure significantly increases perceived co-presence and improves strategic coordination, though not through increased contribution quantity. Participants exposed to peer avatars achieve higher social welfare by coordinating to avoid wasteful over-contribution beyond the threshold. Additionally, we identify VR presence-the sense of 'being there' in the virtual environment-as a stronger predictor of task performance than co-presence itself. This research contributes to Information Systems theory by establishing causal pathways from specific design features to presence to coordination outcomes, demonstrates VR as a rigorous experimental methodology for IS research, and provides actionable insights for designing collaborative platforms supporting sustainability initiatives and threshold collective action problems."

    "abstract": "Accurate detection of ultrasound nodules is essential for the early diagnosis and treatment of thyroid and breast cancers. However, this task remains challenging due to irregular nodule shapes, indistinct boundaries, substantial scale variations, and the presence of speckle noise that degrades structural visibility. To address these challenges, we propose a prior-guided DETR framework specifically designed for ultrasound nodule detection. Instead of relying on purely data-driven feature learning, the proposed framework progressively incorporates different prior knowledge at multiple stages of the network. First, a Spatially-adaptive Deformable FFN with Prior Regularization (SDFPR) is embedded into the CNN backbone to inject geometric priors into deformable sampling, stabilizing feature extraction for irregular and blurred nodules. Second, a Multi-scale Spatial-Frequency Feature Mixer (MSFFM) is designed to extract multi-scale structural priors, where spatial-domain processing emphasizes contour continuity and boundary cues, while frequency-domain modeling captures global morphology and suppresses speckle noise. Furthermore, a Dense Feature Interaction (DFI) mechanism propagates and exploits these prior-modulated features across all encoder layers, enabling the decoder to enhance query refinement under consistent geometric and structural guidance. Experiments conducted on two clinically collected thyroid ultrasound datasets (Thyroid I and Thyroid II) and two public benchmarks (TN3K and BUSI) for thyroid and breast nodules demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior accuracy compared with 18 detection methods, particularly in detecting morphologically complex nodules.The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/wjj1wjj/Ultrasound-DETR."

As robots increasingly act as interpersonal communication channels in care, education, and telepresence, they convey not only speech but also gesture, emotion, and contextual cues. We argue that extending digital surveillance laws to such embodied systems would entail continuous monitoring, embedding observation into the very design of everyday robots. This regulation blurs the line between protection and control, turning companions into potential informants. At the same time, monitoring mechanisms that undermine end-to-end encryption function as de facto backdoors, expanding the attack surface and allowing adversaries to exploit legally induced monitoring infrastructures. This creates a paradox of safety through insecurity: systems introduced to protect users may instead compromise their privacy, autonomy, and trust. This work does not aim to predict the future, but to raise awareness and help prevent certain futures from materialising."

We find a meaningful association between CodeHealth, a quality metric calibrated for human comprehension, and semantic preservation after AI refactoring. Our findings confirm that human-friendly code is also more compatible with AI tooling.

Here, we investigate this interplay by considering a synthetic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice with all-to-all nonlocal interactions. We find that the distinctive nonlinearity maintains an effective chiral symmetry and leads to a quantized nonlinear winding and Berry phase, as corroborated by the developed Bogoliubov nonlinear adiabatic theory. Increasing nonlinearity drives a sequence of topological transitions signaled by the appearance of characteristic swallowtail band structures at intermediate interaction strengths and band swapping in the strong nonlinear regime. The band swapping results in quantized fractional windings and double-period Bloch oscillations that are closely related to discrete time crystals. Remarkably, even starting from a topologically trivial linear system, nonlocal nonlinearity can induce an emergent topological phase with fractional windings. Experimentally, our model can be realized using photons in a degenerate optical cavity with Rydberg-mediated interactions. Our results establish a rigorous framework and pave the way for exploring nonlinear topological phenomena and their applications in synthetic quantum platforms."

However, experimental perturbations are microscopic while parameters in continuous models are macroscopic, thus making those models hard to falsify experimentally. Here we use numerical simulations, in which we can access both microscopic and macroscopic quantities, to show that active gel models can indeed be applied to describe contractile actin. We predict that contractile stress should scale linearly with actin density, which is confirmed by numerical simulations. Moreover, we can accurately predict how the contractile stress depends on motor properties such as unloaded speed and stall force."

We present Cycle 1 JWST/MIRI 11.4 μm coronagraphic observations of three exoKuiper belts that exhibit gaps in their radial structures: HD 92945, HD 107146, and HD 206893, to determine whether planets are responsible for carving these structures, as seen in our Solar System with the gas giants. We reduce the JWST/MIRI data using spaceKLIP, and introduce new routines to mitigate the Brighter-Fatter effect and persistence. We do not detect any planet candidates, and all detected objects in the field-of-view are consistent with background stars or galaxies. However, by combining JWST mass limits, archival observational constraints, and astrometric accelerations, we rule out a significant portion of planet parameter space, placing tight constraints on the planets possibly responsible for these gaps. To interpret these results, we explore multiple gap-carving scenarios in discs, either massless or with non-zero mass, including clearing by in-situ planet(s), as well as shaping by inner planets through mean-motion or secular apsidal resonances. Finally, we conclude that the planets causing the proper motion anomaly in these systems must reside within the inner 20 au."

    "abstract": "In this study, we investigate feature-based 2.5D controlled source marine electromagnetic (mCSEM) data inversion using generative priors. Two-and-half dimensional modeling using finite difference method (FDM) is adopted to compute the response of horizontal electric dipole (HED) excitation. Rather than using a neural network to approximate the entire inverse mapping in a black-box manner, we adopt a plug-andplay strategy in which a variational autoencoder (VAE) is used solely to learn prior information on conductivity distributions. During the inversion process, the conductivity model is iteratively updated using the Gauss Newton method, while the model space is constrained by projections onto the learned VAE decoder. This framework preserves explicit control over data misfit and enables flexible adaptation to different survey configurations. Numerical and field experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively incorporates prior information, improves reconstruction accuracy, and exhibits good generalization performance."

Assuming the constraint violation satisfies the PL condition near the feasible set, we derive sharper worst-case complexity bounds for obtaining approximate first-order KKT points. When the objective and constraints are twice continuously differentiable, we show that QPM equipped with a suitable first-order inner solver requires at most $O(\\varepsilon_{0}^{-1}\\varepsilon_{1}^{-2})$ first-order oracle calls to find an $(\\varepsilon_{0},\\varepsilon_{1})$-approximate KKT point -- that is, a point that is $\\varepsilon_{0}$-approximately feasible and $\\varepsilon_{1}$-approximately stationary. Furthermore, when the objective and constraints are three times continuously differentiable, we show that QPM with a suitable second-order inner solver requires at most $O\\left(\\varepsilon_{0}^{-1/2}\\varepsilon_{1}^{-3/2}\\right)$ second-order oracle calls to find an $(\\varepsilon_{0},\\varepsilon_{1})$-approximate KKT point. We also introduce an adaptive, feasibility-aware stopping criterion for the subproblems, which relaxes the stationarity tolerance when far from feasibility. This rule preserves all theoretical guarantees while substantially reducing computational effort in practice."

    "abstract": "Binaries of supermassive black holes (MBHBs) represent the primary sources of the gravitational wave background (GWB) detectable by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). The eccentricity with which binaries form in galactic mergers is the key parameter determining their evolutionary timescale from pairing to coalescence. However, accurately determining the binary eccentricity at formation is difficult in simulations due to stochastic effects. We present a numerical study of the formation and evolution of MBHBs that are potential PTA sources. We simulate mergers of equal-mass galaxies on different initial orbits and follow the dynamics of the MBHBs through the hardening phase. We find that low-resolution simulations are affected by stochasticity due to torques from the stellar distribution acting at pericentre passages. The dispersion in binary eccentricity decreases with increasing central resolution, as expected for a Poisson process. We provide a fitting formula for the resolution requirement of an N-body simulation of MBHB formation and evolution as a function of the initial eccentricity of the merger, e0, and the required accuracy in the binary eccentricity, eb. We find that binaries experience a torque at first pericentre that is approximately independent of initial eccentricity, producing a general trend in which the binary eccentricity decreases above sufficiently large initial orbital eccentricities. While this behaviour is generic, the precise cross-over eccentricity (e0~0.97 in our models) and the sharpness of the drop-off depend on the galaxy initial conditions. We provide a fitting formula for eb(e0) that can be used in semi-analytical models to determine the merger timescales of MBHBs as well as the amplitude and slope of the GWB."

    "abstract": "The global transition from traditional power plants to renewable energy sources introduces new challenges in grid stability, primarily because inverter-based technologies provide insufficient inertia. To address this, we introduce an artificial intelligence algorithm that autonomously stabilizes power grids by adaptively tuning admittance regulators in response to disturbances. This Adaptive Admittance Controller (AAC) algorithm not only stabilizes the system in real time but also identifies the best regulator locations, thereby unifying grid planning and real time control within a single framework. When tested on a real UK power grid, the AAC markedly reduces frequency deviations and rapidly restores nominal operation. In addition, the algorithm isolates a small number of key regulators and intervenes only on these, lowering both system complexity and cost. The AAC algorithm further reduces the nonlinearity effect, quickly stabilizing the frequency and power flow. This intelligent control scheme enables power grids to reliably return to stable operating conditions under a broad spectrum of fault scenarios. The proposed framework can also be used to mitigate cascading failures by adaptively controlling critical links in a variety of networked infrastructures, such as cascades of traffic congestion on road networks or fuse failures in energy-saving systems."

For $p\\in[1,2],q\\in[1,2)$ and $α\\in[0,1]$, we prove a Talagrand-type inequality of the form $$\\|A\\|_\\infty^{2-p}\\,\\bigl\\||\\nabla^αA|\\bigr\\|_{p}^{p}\\ \\gtrsim\\mathrm{Var}(A)\\cdot \\max\\left\\{1, \\mathcal{R}(A,q)^{p/2}\\right\\},$$ where $\\mathcal{R}(A,q)$ is a logarithmic ratio quantifying how small either $A-τ(A)$ or the gradient vector $(d_jA)_j$ is in $L^{q}$ compared to $\\mathrm{Var}(A)^{1/2}$. As consequences we derive a quantum Eldan--Gross inequality in terms of the squared $\\ell_2$-mass of geometric influences, a quantum Cordero-Erausquin--Eskenazis $L^{p}$-$L^{q}$ inequality, and Talagrand-type $L^{p}$-isoperimetric bounds. We further develop a high-order theory by introducing the local variance functional $$V_J(A)=\\int_0^\\infty 2\\mathrm{Inf}^{2}_{J}(P_tA) dt.$$ For $|J|=k$ we prove a local high-order Talagrand inequality relating $\\mathrm{Inf}^{p}_{J}[A]$ to $V_J(A)$, with a Talagrand-type logarithmic term when $\\mathrm{Inf}^{q}_{J}[A]$ is small. This yields $L^{p}$-$L^{q}$ influence inequalities and partial isoperimetric bounds for high-order influences.

Beyond limiting the development and evaluation of scientific ML, this gap also hinders research into essential tasks such as sim-to-real transfer. We introduce RealPDEBench, the first benchmark for scientific ML that integrates real-world measurements with paired numerical simulations. RealPDEBench consists of five datasets, three tasks, eight metrics, and ten baselines. We first present five real-world measured datasets with paired simulated datasets across different complex physical systems. We further define three tasks, which allow comparisons between real-world and simulated data, and facilitate the development of methods to bridge the two. Moreover, we design eight evaluation metrics, spanning data-oriented and physics-oriented metrics, and finally benchmark ten representative baselines, including state-of-the-art models, pretrained PDE foundation models, and a traditional method. Experiments reveal significant discrepancies between simulated and real-world data, while showing that pretraining with simulated data consistently improves both accuracy and convergence. In this work, we hope to provide insights from real-world data, advancing scientific ML toward bridging the sim-to-real gap and real-world deployment.

Although multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) is a widely used method for evaluating epistasis, exhaustive MDR-based searches become computationally infeasible as the number of loci or the interaction order increases. In this paper, we define the epistasis detection problem as a black-box optimization problem and solve it with a factorization machine with quadratic optimization annealing (FMQA). We propose an efficient epistasis detection method based on FMQA, in which the classification error rate (CER) computed by MDR is used as a black-box objective function. Experimental evaluations were conducted using simulated case-control datasets with predefined high-order epistasis. The results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully identified ground-truth epistasis across various interaction orders and the numbers of genetic loci within a limited number of iterations. These results indicate that the proposed method is effective and computationally efficient for high-order epistasis detection."

Experimental results show that the model achieves over 99\\% accuracy on in-distribution tests and maintains robust performance (exceeding 90\\% accuracy) under significant extrapolation, such as with deeper scrambling depths.

    "abstract": "Automated requirements assessment traditionally relies on universal patterns as proxies for defectiveness, implemented through rule-based heuristics or machine learning classifiers trained on large annotated datasets. However, what constitutes a \"defect\" is inherently context-dependent and varies across projects, domains, and stakeholder interpretations. In this paper, we propose a Human-LLM Collaboration (HLC) approach that treats defect prediction as an adaptive process rather than a static classification task. HLC leverages LLM Chain-of-Thought reasoning in a feedback loop: users validate predictions alongside their explanations, and these validated examples adaptively guide future predictions through few-shot learning. We evaluate this approach using the weak word smell on the QuRE benchmark of 1,266 annotated Mercedes-Benz requirements. Our results show that HLC effectively adapts to the provision of validated examples, with rapid performance gains from as few as 20 validated examples. Incorporating validated explanations, not just labels, enables HLC to substantially outperform both standard few-shot prompting and fine-tuned BERT models while maintaining high recall. These results highlight how the in-context and Chain-of-Thought learning capabilities of LLMs enable adaptive classification approaches that move beyond one-size-fits-all models, creating opportunities for tools that learn continuously from stakeholder feedback."

The numerical results confirm the predicted asymptotic behavior but also identify critical distances below which pairs evolve to different forms. We have found that bound pairs of dislocations - created by adding or removing 120 degree zig-zags of particles - have a dependence on their preparation history which is not accounted for in the usual starting point of the KTHNY theory. Furthermore, isolated dislocations, whose presence disrupts crystalline order, have energies of O(1) at some values of N, the number of particles in the system, and therefore will be thermally excited, raising questions about the applicability of standard KTHNY theory to the OCP, and supporting older suggestions that there are no phase transitions at all in the two-dimensional OCP."

Motivated by this question, we study the learnability and cryptographic applications of random open-system dynamics generated by Lindblad-Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan (GKSL) master equations. Working in the affine hull of the GKSL cone, we introduce physically motivated ensembles of random local Lindbladians via a linear parametrisation around a reference generator. On top of this geometric structure, we extend statistical query (SQ) and quantum-process statistical query (QPStat) frameworks to the open-system setting and prove exponential (in the parameter dimension $M$) lower bounds on the number of queries required to learn random Lindbladian dynamics. In particular, we establish average-case SQ-hardness for learning output distributions in total variation distance and average-case QPStat-hardness for learning Lindbladian channels in diamond norm. To support these results physically, we derive a linear-response expression for the ensemble-averaged total variation distance and verify the required nonvanishing scaling in a random local amplitude-damping chain. Finally, we design two Lindbladian physically unclonable function (Lindbladian-PUF) protocols based on random Lindbladian ensembles with distribution-level and tomography-based verification, thereby providing open-system examples where learning hardness can be translated into cryptographic security guarantees."

    "abstract": "Recent Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong multimodal reasoning capabilities, yet remain challenged by video understanding tasks that require consistent temporal ordering and causal coherence. Many parameter-efficient Video-LLMs rely on unconstrained bidirectional projectors to model inter-frame interactions, which can blur temporal ordering by allowing later frames to influence earlier representations, without explicit architectural mechanisms to respect the directional nature of video reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose V-CORE, a parameter-efficient framework that introduces explicit temporal ordering constraints for video understanding. V-CORE consists of two key components: (1) Learnable Spatial Aggregation (LSA), which adaptively selects salient spatial tokens to reduce redundancy, and (2) a Causality-Aware Temporal Projector (CATP), which enforces structured unidirectional information flow via block-causal attention and a terminal dynamic summary token acting as a causal sink. This design preserves intra-frame spatial interactions while ensuring that temporal information is aggregated in a strictly ordered manner. With 4-bit QLoRA and a frozen LLM backbone, V-CORE can be trained efficiently on a single consumer GPU. Experiments show that V-CORE achieves strong performance on the challenging NExT-QA benchmark, reaching 61.2% accuracy, and remains competitive across MSVD-QA, MSRVTT-QA, and TGIF-QA, with gains concentrated in temporal and causal reasoning subcategories (+3.5% and +5.2% respectively), directly validating the importance of explicit temporal ordering constraints."

Between these fields, the magnetization shows a step-like behavior, defining an intermediate field-induced phase (Phase~II).

Phase~II appears for all field directions, although its transport response shows moderate directional dependence.

In response, regulations such as European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) mandate the deletion of PII upon requests, underscoring the need for reliable and cost-effective data removal solutions. Machine unlearning has emerged as a promising direction for selectively forgetting data points. However, existing unlearning techniques typically apply a uniform forgetting strategy that neither accounts for the varying privacy risks posed by different PII attributes nor reflects associated business risks. In this work, we propose UnPII, the first PII-centric unlearning approach that prioritizes forgetting based on the risk of individual or combined PII attributes. To this end, we introduce the PII risk index (PRI), a composite metric that incorporates multiple dimensions of risk factors: identifiability, sensitivity, usability, linkability, permanency, exposability, and compliancy. The PRI enables a nuanced evaluation of privacy risks associated with PII exposures and can be tailored to align with organizational privacy policies. To support realistic assessment, we systematically construct a synthetic PII dataset (e.g., 1,700 PII instances) that simulates realistic exposure scenarios. UnPII seamlessly integrates with established unlearning algorithms, such as Gradient Ascent, Negative Preference Optimization, and Direct Preference Optimization, without modifying their underlying principles. Our experimental results demonstrate that UnPII achieves the improvements of accuracy up to 11.8%, utility up to 6.3%, and generalizability up to 12.4%, respectively, while incurring a modest fine-tuning overhead of 27.5% on average during unlearning."

In anticipation of upcoming space-based very long baseline Interferometry (SVLBI) missions, megamaser disk AGN offer a uniquely valuable probe of strong-gravity regimes through black hole shadow (BHS) imaging beyond Sgr~A* and M87*. In this work, we (1) map the predicted BHS diameters of twenty-one of the most precisely characterized megamaser disk AGN to submillimeter-millimeter (submm-mm) interferometric baseline requirements, (2) estimate their respective AGN-core flux densities at submm-mm wavelengths, accounting for thermal-dust contamination, extended-jet emission, and intrinsic variability, and (3) determine the astrometric precision required to detect spin-dependent positional offsets between the BHS and the megamaser disk dynamical center. NGC~4258 stands out as the only megamaser disk AGN detectable on Earth-L2 baselines in the submm-mm regime, while other megamaser disk AGN in the sample would require baselines approaching Earth-L4/L5 distances; moreover, only a handful exhibit flux densities above $\\sim$10~mJy. Our results further indicate a submillimeter excess in NGC~4258, suggesting that the accretion disk remains thin down to a transitional radius of $\\lesssim 100$~Schwarzschild radii, within which the flow becomes advection dominated. For a maximally spinning supermassive black hole in NGC~4258, we show that the astrometric precision of the BHS centroid necessary to detect the BHS-dynamical center offset could, in principle, be achieved with Earth-Moon baselines; however, it would also demand astrometric precision of the water maser dynamical center roughly fifty times better than what is currently attainable."

The field has shown advances by studying the outputs of 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional Turing machines to determine the complexity values of binary strings and 2-dimensional binary matrices respectively. Using these complexity values, an algorithm called the Block Decomposition Method developed by Zenil, et al. in 2018, has been created to approximate the complexity of adjacency matrices of graphs which has found relative success in grouping graphs based on their complexity values. We use this method along with another method called edge perturbation to exhaustively determine if an edge can be identified to connect two sub-graphs within a graph using the entire symmetric group of its vertices permutation and via unique permutations we call automorphic subsets, which is a special subset of the symmetric group. We also analyze if edges will be grouped closer to their respective sub-graphs in terms of the average algorithmic information contribution. This analysis has been done in order to ascertain if Algorithmic Information Theory can be a viable theory in understanding substructures within graphs and ultimately as a foundation to create frameworks of measuring and analyzing complexity."

    "abstract": "Quantum walk serves as a versatile tool for universal quantum computing and algorithmic research. However, the implementation of discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) with superconducting circuits is still constrained by some limitations such as operation precision, circuit depth and connectivity. With improved hardware efficiency by using superconducting qutrits (three-level systems), we experimentally demonstrate a scalable DTQW in a superconducting circuit, observing the ballistic spreading of quantum walk in a qutrit chain. The usage of qutrits in our implementation allows hardware efficiently encoding of the walker position and the coin degree of freedom. By exploiting the flexibility and intrinsic symmetries of qutrit-based DTQWs, we successfully prepare two topological phases in the chain. For the first time, particle-hole-symmetry-protected edge states, bounded at the interface between these two topological phases, are observed in the superconducting platform. Measured parameter dependencies further validate the properties of edge states. The scalability and gate-control compatibility of the demonstrated DTQWs enable a versatile tool for superconducting quantum computing and quantum simulation."

    "abstract": "Transformers excel on tasks that process well-formed inputs according to some grammar, such as natural language and code. However, it remains unclear how they can process grammatical syntax. In fact, under standard complexity conjectures, standard transformers cannot recognize context-free languages (CFLs), a canonical formalism to describe syntax, or even regular languages, a subclass of CFLs (Merrill et al., 2022). Merrill & Sabharwal (2024) show that $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$ looping layers (w.r.t. input length $n$) allows transformers to recognize regular languages, but the question of context-free recognition remained open. In this work, we show that looped transformers with $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$ looping layers and $\\mathcal{O}(n^6)$ padding tokens can recognize all CFLs. However, training and inference with $\\mathcal{O}(n^6)$ padding tokens is potentially impractical. Fortunately, we show that, for natural subclasses such as unambiguous CFLs, the recognition problem on transformers becomes more tractable, requiring $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ padding. We empirically validate our results and show that looping helps on a language that provably requires logarithmic depth. Overall, our results shed light on the intricacy of CFL recognition by transformers: While general recognition may require an intractable amount of padding, natural constraints such as unambiguity yield efficient recognition algorithms."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used as relevance assessors for Information Retrieval (IR) evaluation collection creation due to reduced cost and increased scalability as compared to human assessors. While previous research has looked at the reliability of LLMs as compared to human assessors, in this work, we aim to understand if LLMs make systematic mistakes when judging relevance, rather than just understanding how good they are on average. To this aim, we propose a novel representational method for queries and documents that allows us to analyze relevance label distributions and compare LLM and human labels to identify patterns of disagreement and localize systematic areas of disagreement. We introduce a clustering-based framework that embeds query-document (Q-D) pairs into a joint semantic space, treating relevance as a relational property. Experiments on TREC Deep Learning 2019 and 2020 show that systematic disagreement between humans and LLMs is concentrated in specific semantic clusters rather than distributed randomly. Query-level analyses reveal recurring failures, most often in definition-seeking, policy-related, or ambiguous contexts. Queries with large variation in agreement across their clusters emerge as disagreement hotspots, where LLMs tend to under-recall relevant content or over-include irrelevant material. This framework links global diagnostics with localized clustering to uncover hidden weaknesses in LLM judgments, enabling bias-aware and more reliable IR evaluation."

We organize prior work into a unified taxonomy spanning agent components (policy/LLM core, memory, world models, planners, tool routers, and critics), orchestration patterns (single-agent vs.\\ multi-agent; centralized vs.\\ decentralized coordination), and deployment settings (offline analysis vs.\\ online interactive assistance; safety-critical vs.\\ open-ended tasks). We discuss key design trade-offs -- latency vs.\\ accuracy, autonomy vs.\\ controllability, and capability vs.\\ reliability -- and highlight how evaluation is complicated by non-determinism, long-horizon credit assignment, tool and environment variability, and hidden costs such as retries and context growth. Finally, we summarize measurement and benchmarking practices (task suites, human preference and utility metrics, success under constraints, robustness and security) and identify open challenges including verification and guardrails for tool actions, scalable memory and context management, interpretability of agent decisions, and reproducible evaluation under realistic workloads."

The extension of the analysis to higher-order (third-, fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-order) schemes is not straightforward since explicitly constructing $G$ matrices (G-stability) is often tricky. In this article, we develop fully implicit as well as implicit--explicit backward difference formula (BDF) schemes of order up to six. The implicit--explicit variants are decoupled, thereby enhancing computational efficiency; their convergence analysis requires a weak coupling condition on the poroelastic parameters. In contrast, no coupling conditions are needed for the fully implicit, coupled schemes. We determine novel and suitable multipliers for the two proposed classes and establish error estimates via the energy technique. A prominent advantage of these higher-order schemes is that, with almost the computational cost of first-order schemes, they greatly improve the accuracy."

    "abstract": "This work presents a computational study of charge hopping dynamics along a one dimensional chain with Gaussian site energy disorder and linearly coupled quantum bath. Time dependent square displacements are calculated directly from numerical solutions of Pauli master equations, for five different rate kernels: exact Fermi golden rule (FGR) rate expression, stationary phase interpolation (SPI) approximation, semiclassical (SC) approximation, classical Marcus rate expression, and Miller-Abrahams expression. All results demonstrate diffusive behavior in the steady state limit. The results based on the FGR rate expression show that the charge transport in quantum bath can be much more sensitive to the disorder than the prediction from the classical Marcus expression. While the SPI approximation captures this general trend reasonably well, the SC approximation tends to be unreliable at both quantitative and qualitative levels, and becomes even worse than the classical Marcus expression under certain conditions. These results offer useful guidance in the choice of approximate rate kernels for larger scale simulations, and also demonstrate significant but fragile positive effects of quantum environments on the charge hopping dynamics."

Recent studies have explored Large Language Models (LLMs) for KT via autoregressive nature, but such approaches typically require fine-tuning and exhibit unstable or near-random performance. Moreover, prior KT systems primarily focus on prediction and rely on multi-stage pipelines for feedback and recommendation, resulting in increased system complexity and resources. To address this gap, we propose Thinking-KT, a training-free KT framework that incorporates Test-Time Scaling (TTS), enabling even small LLMs to achieve competitive KT performance. Moreover, in this framework, a small LLM can jointly perform KT prediction, personalized feedback generation, and learning recommendation in a unified output without degrading prediction accuracy. Beyond performance, we present the systematic analysis of reasoning traces in KT. Our results demonstrate that TTS is a critical yet underexplored factor in LLM-based KT, and that small LLMs can serve as unified ITS engines."

    "abstract": "Community search aims to identify a refined set of nodes that are most relevant to a given query, supporting tasks ranging from fraud detection to recommendation. Unlike homophilic graphs, many real-world networks are heterophilic, where edges predominantly connect dissimilar nodes. Therefore, structural signals that once reflected smooth, low-frequency similarity now appear as sharp, high-frequency contrasts. However, both classical algorithms (e.g., k-core, k-truss) and recent ML-based models struggle to achieve effective community search on heterophilic graphs, where edge signs or semantics are generally unknown. Algorithm-based methods often return communities with mixed class labels, while GNNs, built on homophily, smooth away meaningful signals and blur community boundaries. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Community Search (AdaptCS), a unified framework featuring three key designs: (i) an AdaptCS Encoder that disentangles multi-hop and multi-frequency signals, enabling the model to capture both smooth (homophilic) and contrastive (heterophilic) relations; (ii) a memory-efficient low-rank optimization that removes the main computational bottleneck and ensures model scalability; and (iii) an Adaptive Community Score (ACS) that guides online search by balancing embedding similarity and topological relations. Extensive experiments on both heterophilic and homophilic benchmarks demonstrate that AdaptCS outperforms the best-performing baseline by an average of 11% in F1-score, retains robustness across heterophily levels, and achieves up to 2 orders of magnitude speedup."

By comparing experimental effective masses with band masses, we determined the electron-phonon coupling for each orbit. The results showed a clear Fermi-surface-sheet dependence of the electron-phonon coupling strength, especially highlighting that the coupling for the band-28 sheet is very weak, almost absent for the orbit with $B \\parallel c$. This finding is consistent with previous observations of dHvA oscillations from this orbit in the mixed state down to very low fields. Amidst growing interest in high-temperature superconductivity driven by electron-phonon coupling in hydrides under high pressure, this study provides foundational data pivotal to precisely understanding electron-phonon coupling."

The fields are minimally coupled to gravity and uncoupled at the level of the potential, with the quintessence sector governed by an exponential potential and the phantom sector by an inverse power-law potential. By reformulating the background equations as a five-dimensional autonomous dynamical system, we identify and analyze the fixed points and their stability properties, revealing stable late-time attractors corresponding to phantom-dominated accelerated expansion. We confront the model with observations through a Bayesian parameter estimation performed using the \\textsc{Cobaya} framework, employing several combinations of recent cosmological data sets, including Pantheon+ supernovae, compressed cosmic microwave background distance priors, DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation measurements, and DES Year-5 supernova data. The observational constraints favor a dynamical dark energy sector moderately and are consistent with deviations from a cosmological constant at the present epoch. The regions of parameter space preferred by the data are compatible with the stable accelerating solutions identified in the dynamical analysis, establishing a direct connection between phase-space stability and observational viability. A notable feature of the model is that the effective dark energy equation of state undergoes phantom divide crossing in a gradual and asymptotic manner, rather than as a sharp transition."

We apply COMPASS to eight diverse industry scenarios, generating and validating 5,920 queries that test both routine compliance and adversarial robustness through strategically designed edge cases. Evaluating seven state-of-the-art models, we uncover a fundamental asymmetry: models reliably handle legitimate requests (>95% accuracy) but catastrophically fail at enforcing prohibitions, refusing only 13-40% of adversarial denylist violations. These results demonstrate that current LLMs lack the robustness required for policy-critical deployments, establishing COMPASS as an essential evaluation framework for organizational AI safety."

Results show that LMs yield significant moderate correlations with scores/labels of metaphor novelty. We further identify divergent scaling patterns: on corpus-based data, correlation strength decreases with model size (inverse scaling effect), whereas on synthetic data it increases (Quality-Power Hypothesis). We conclude that while surprisal can partially account for annotations of metaphor novelty, it remains a limited metric of linguistic creativity."

We then construct a forward utility via a system of recursively defined, indexed infinite-horizon backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with discounting, and establish the existence, uniqueness, and boundedness of their solutions. To verify the required (super)martingale property of the performance process, we develop a rigorous characterization of this property with respect to the general filtration in terms of a set of (in)equalities relative to the default-free filtration. We further extend the analysis to a stochastic factor model with ergodic dynamics. In this setting, we derive uniform bounds for the Markovian solutions of the infinite-horizon BSDEs, overcoming technical challenges arising from the special structure of the system of BSDEs in the defaultable setting. Passing to the ergodic limit, we identify the limiting BSDE and relate its constant to the risk-sensitive long-run growth rate of the optimal wealth process."

We introduce a heterogeneous distributed training framework where some participants host full replicas on high-bandwidth interconnects, while resource-limited participants are grouped to jointly instantiate a replica using pipeline parallelism with subspace-projected inter-stage communication. To make the recently introduced subspace pipeline compression compatible with SparseLoCo, we study a number of adaptations. Across large-scale language modeling experiments (178M-1B parameters) on standard pretraining corpora, we find that activation compression composes with SparseLoCo at modest cost, while selective (heterogeneous) compression consistently improves the loss-communication tradeoff relative to compressing all replicas-especially at aggressive compression ratios. These results suggest a practical path to incorporating low-bandwidth model parallelism and heterogeneous participants into LLM pre-training."

Spatially manipulating objects in a scene through natural language poses a challenge for multimodal generation systems. While existing text-based manipulation methods can adjust appearance or style, they struggle to perform object-level geometric transformations-such as translating, rotating, or resizing objects-due to scarce paired supervision and pixel-level optimization limits. Talk2Move employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to explore geometric actions through diverse rollouts generated from input images and lightweight textual variations, removing the need for costly paired data. A spatial reward guided model aligns geometric transformations with linguistic description, while off-policy step evaluation and active step sampling improve learning efficiency by focusing on informative transformation stages. Furthermore, we design object-centric spatial rewards that evaluate displacement, rotation, and scaling behaviors directly, enabling interpretable and coherent transformations. Experiments on curated benchmarks demonstrate that Talk2Move achieves precise, consistent, and semantically faithful object transformations, outperforming existing text-guided editing approaches in both spatial accuracy and scene coherence."

However, these definitions provide a textual description rather than a framework. The community has sought conceptual frameworks that identify all factors that must be controlled and described for credible computational reproducibility. The PRIMAD model was initially introduced to address inconsistencies in terminology surrounding computational reproducibility by outlining six key factors: P (Platforms), R (Research objective), I (Implementations), M (Methods), A (Actors), and D (Data). Subsequently various studies across different fields adopted the model and proposed extensions. However, these contributions remain fragmented and require systematic integration and cross-disciplinary validation. To bridge this gap and recognising that PRIMAD provides a broadly applicable framework for reproducibility in computational science, this work undertakes a focused investigation of the PRIMAD model. It combines the models previous extensions into a unified framework suitable for diverse research contexts. The result is PRIMAD-LID, a discipline-diagnostic reproducibility framework that retains the original six PRIMAD dimensions and enhances each with three overarching modifiers: Lifespan (temporal qualifier), Interpretation (contextual reasoning) and Depth (necessary granularity), thereby establishing a more cohesive and robust foundation for computational reproducibility practices."

We investigate the covering fraction, probability of co-observation, co-kinematic correspondence of these ions using two different analysis methods. We make both mock sightlines using two-dimensional projections of our simulations treating these cells as integrated lines of sight and we create one-dimensional ray objects and use the SALSA (Boyd et al. 2020) code to investigate individual gas structures that contribute most to the line of sight column densities, which we call mock absorbers. We explore the relative kinematics of these mock absorbers and find Mg II and O VI appear to have a co-kinematic relationship when looking at absorber pairs with the closest relative velocity like in Werk et al. (2016). However, this does not necessarily correspond with a close spatial separation meaning many O VI and Mg II absorber pairs only appear to be co-kinematic but are physically unrelated. Taking a more holistic look at Mg II and O VI absorber pairs reveals a much weaker correlation between these two ions."

Disks with a central deficit in dust emission, a \"cavity\", have long attracted interest as potential evidence for advanced disk clearing by protoplanets and/or winds. Before JWST, infrared spectra showed that these disks typically lack the strong molecular emission observed in full disks. In this work, we combine a sample of 12 disks with millimeter cavities of a range of sizes ($\\sim2$-70 au) and different levels of millimeter and infrared continuum deficits. We analyze their molecular spectra as observed with MIRI on JWST, homogeneously reduced with the new JDISCS pipeline. This analysis demonstrates a stark dichotomy in molecular emission where \"molecule-rich\" (MR) cavities follow global trends between water, CO, and OH luminosity and accretion luminosity as in full disks, while \"molecule-poor\" (MP) cavities are significantly sub-luminous in all molecules except sometimes OH. Disk cavities generally show sub-luminous organic emission, higher OH/H$_2$O ratios, and suggest a lower water column density. The sub-thermal excitation of CO and water vibrational lines suggests a decreased gas density in the emitting layer in all cavities, supporting model expectations for C$_2$H$_2$ photodissociation. We discover a bifurcation in infrared index (lower in MR cavities) suggesting that the molecular dichotomy is linked to residual $μ$m-size dust within millimeter disk cavities. Put together, these results suggest a feedback process between dust depletion, gas density decrease, and molecule dissociation. Disk cavities may have a common evolutionary sequence where MR switch into MP over time."

    "abstract": "We present BEDS (Bayesian Emergent Dissipative Structures), a theoretical framework that unifies concepts from non-equilibrium thermodynamics, Bayesian inference, information geometry, and machine learning. The central thesis proposes that learning, across physical, biological, and computational systems, fundamentally constitutes the conversion of flux into structure through entropy export. Building on Prigogine's theory of dissipative structures, we establish a formal isomorphism between thermodynamic processes and Bayesian updating, demonstrating that sustainable learning systems must follow dissipative patterns where crystallized posteriors become priors for subsequent levels of emergence. We derive fundamental mathematical constants (e, π, φ) as fixed points of Bayesian inference under minimal axioms, suggesting these constants emerge necessarily from any system capable of representing and updating uncertainty. Furthermore, we propose a conjecture linking Gödel's incompleteness theorems to thermodynamic constraints, hypothesizing that pathologies of formal systems (incompleteness, undecidability) are structurally analogous to dissipation deficits in physical systems. As practical validation, we present a peer-to-peer network architecture implementing BEDS principles, achieving six orders of magnitude improvement in energy efficiency compared to existing distributed consensus systems while enabling continuous learning. This work bridges fundamental physics, mathematical logic, and practical system design, offering both theoretical insights into the nature of learning and computation, and a concrete pathway toward sustainable artificial intelligence."

More challenging has been deriving relationships for properties that depend on subtle microstructural features and not average properties. One such example is the initiation of energetic materials under dynamical loading, dominated by energy localization on microstructural features such as pores, cracks, and interfaces. We propose a conditional convolutional neural network to predict the shock-induced temperature field as a function of shock strength, for a wide range of microstructures, and obtained via two different simulation methods. The proposed model, denoted MISTnet2, significantly extends prior work that was limited to a single shock strength, model, and type of microstructure. MISTnet2 can contribute to bridging atomistics with coarse-grain simulations and enable first principles predictions of detonation initiation and safety of this class of materials."

Alpha decay represents a significant challenge, with traditional models such as DeepLOB losing predictive power as the time horizon (k) increases. In this paper, using data from the FI-2010 dataset, we introduce Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (T-KAN) to replace the fixed, linear weights of standard LSTMs with learnable B-spline activation functions. This allows the model to learn the 'shape' of market signals as opposed to just their magnitude. This resulted in a 19.1% relative improvement in the F1-score at the k = 100 horizon. The efficacy of T-KAN networks cannot be understated, producing a 132.48% return compared to the -82.76% DeepLOB drawdown under 1.0 bps transaction costs. In addition to this, the T-KAN model proves quite interpretable, with the 'dead-zones' being clearly visible in the splines. The T-KAN architecture is also uniquely optimized for low-latency FPGA implementation via High level Synthesis (HLS).

    "abstract": "Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global public health problem, contributing to an estimated 4.95 million deaths in 2019 and projected to cause up to 10 million deaths annually and 100 trillion dollars in cumulative economic losses by 2050. Its emergence and spread result from complex biological, ecological, and socioeconomic interactions. Mathematical modelling is a key tool to study AMR dynamics, yet the literature remains fragmented and methodologically limited. This review synthesizes recent mathematical modelling studies to identify trends, biases, and research gaps. Methods: A scoping review following PRISMA-ScR guidelines was conducted. PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched for studies published between 2019 and 2024 that developed mathematical models of AMR. After screening and duplicate removal, 36 studies were included. Data were extracted using a structured framework covering model context, construction and parameters, and outputs and validation. Results: Most studies relied on deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE) models and focused on bacterial resistance in human hosts, with only one adopting a One Health perspective. Conjugation and mutation were the most commonly modelled resistance mechanisms, whereas transduction, transformation, host immunity, spatial heterogeneity, and environmental components were rarely included. Few studies incorporated economic impacts, and a strong geographic bias toward high-income countries was observed. Conclusion: Mathematical modelling of AMR is an active field but characterized by limited methodological diversity. While deterministic ODE models have advanced understanding of AMR dynamics, future work should integrate stochasticity, spatial structure, ecological interactions, and One Health perspectives, as well as economic and social variables, to inform global strategies to mitigate AMR."

This work introduces CycleVLA, a system that equips Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) with proactive self-correction, the capability to anticipate incipient failures and recover before they fully manifest during execution. CycleVLA achieves this by integrating a progress-aware VLA that flags critical subtask transition points where failures most frequently occur, a VLM-based failure predictor and planner that triggers subtask backtracking upon predicted failure, and a test-time scaling strategy based on Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding to improve retry success after backtracking. Extensive experiments show that CycleVLA improves performance for both well-trained and under-trained VLAs, and that MBR serves as an effective zero-shot test-time scaling strategy for VLAs.

    "abstract": "Effective data center cooling is crucial for reliable operation; however, cooling systems often exhibit inefficiencies that result in excessive energy consumption. This paper presents a three-stage, physics-guided machine learning framework for identifying and reducing cooling energy waste in high-performance computing facilities. Using one year of 10-minute resolution operational data from the Frontier exascale supercomputer, we first train a monotonicity-constrained gradient boosting surrogate that predicts facility accessory power from coolant flow rates, temperatures, and server power. The surrogate achieves a mean absolute error of 0.026 MW and predicts power usage effectiveness within 0.01 of measured values for 98.7% of test samples. In the second stage, the surrogate serves as a physics-consistent baseline to quantify excess cooling energy, revealing approximately 85 MWh of annual inefficiency concentrated in specific months, hours, and operating regimes. The third stage evaluates guardrail-constrained counterfactual adjustments to supply temperature and subloop flows, demonstrating that up to 96% of identified excess can be recovered through small, safe setpoint changes while respecting thermal limits and operational constraints. The framework yields interpretable recommendations, supports counterfactual analyses such as flow reduction during low-load periods and redistribution of thermal duty across cooling loops, and provides a practical pathway toward quantifiable reductions in accessory power. The developed framework is readily compatible with model predictive control and can be extended to other liquid-cooled data centers with different configurations and cooling requirements."

    "abstract": "The 10-tone equal temperament (10-TET) constitutes a distinct harmonic environment with step sizes exceeding the standard semitone, yet it has historically remained on the fringes of music theory. This paper proposes a radical shift in perspective, treating $\\mathbb{Z}_{10}$ not as an imperfect imitation of 12-TET, but as an independent harmonic universe with its own rigorous logic. We classify all possible harmonic systems in 10-TET using a single structural parameter $Δ$, representing the difference between the harmonic mediants (the major and minor ``thirds'') which sum to the generator (the ``fifth''). Our analysis reveals a rich landscape of possibilities. The system defined by $Δ=1$, which is naturally the first to consider, initially appears to suffer from a fundamental structural flaw: its harmonic space fractures into two disjoint universes. Conversely, the ``Wide'' system ($Δ=5$) emerges as a geometrically superior structure, isomorphic to the \\textbf{Desargues Configuration} $(10_3)_1$ and forming a fully connected, vertex-transitive graph. Between these extremes lies the ``Tritone'' system ($Δ=3$), which forms a connected Decagonal Prism. Our main result is the discovery of a topological isomorphism between the ``restored'' Acoustic system ($Δ=1$) and the Tritone system ($Δ=3$): despite disjoint intervallic definitions, both generate the Generalized Petersen graph $GP(10,1)$. These results suggest that in 10-TET, the path to harmonic symmetry lies in the geometry of the projective plane and prism graphs rather than pure acoustics."

    "abstract": "In fully developed homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, the Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions of motion, although formally equivalent, become statistically decoupled. In this work, by invoking Liouville theorem, we show that the joint probability density function (PDF) of the Eulerian and Lagrangian fields, evolving from arbitrary initial conditions, relaxes exponentially toward a factorized form given by the product of the corresponding marginal PDFs. This relaxation is governed by a genuine spectral gap of the Liouville operator, whose magnitude is primarily set by the bifurcation rate of the velocity gradient dynamics, whereas the contribution of Lyapunov exponents is shown to be significantly smaller. As a consequence, Eulerian Lagrangian correlations decay rapidly, and if the joint PDF is initially factorized, its factorized structure is preserved at all subsequent times, with each marginal evolving independently under the corresponding dynamics. We further show that the formal equivalence between the two descriptions implies the invariance of the relative kinetic energy between arbitrarily chosen points. When combined with the asymmetric statistics of instantaneous finite scale Lyapunov exponents in incompressible turbulence, this property provides a quantitative interpretation of particle pair separation and of the turbulent energy cascade. Finally, these results naturally lead to nondiffusive closure relations for the von Kármán Howarth and Corrsin equations, which coincide with those previously proposed by the author, thereby providing an independent theoretical validation of those closures."

    "abstract": "The increasing scope and breadth of gravitational wave detectors is providing the opportunity to explore new parameters in gravitational-wave astronomy. Eccentricity and spin-precession are two key observables to infer the origin of a gravitational wave (GW) source. The interpretation of GW source parameters can be plagued by degeneracy, such as the well-known degeneracy between mass and spin. As the field has explored new parameters, questions have been raised about possible degeneracies between eccentricity and spin-precession. Although some state-of-the-art models now include these effects individually, models that incorporate spin-precession and eccentricity are only in their infancy. Until models faithfully cover the complete parameter space of compact binary coalescence, our ability to correctly measure the source parameters and infer the formation of the binary is compromised. Here, we present a study of the distinguishability of these two key parameters. Our work finds that there is indeed a degeneracy between eccentricity and spin-precession; however, it is a highly localized effect. We find that the misidentified eccentricity estimates get worse as the signal gets shorter. Additionally, this misidentification is highly sensitive to the inclination angle of the source system. We provide quantifiable estimates of the potency of this degeneracy in addition to identifying some of the regions of parameter space where this degeneracy exists."

Unlike AR and diffusion, VARs operate on heterogeneous input structures across their generation steps, which creates severe asynchronous policy conflicts. This issue becomes particularly acute in reinforcement learning (RL) scenarios, leading to unstable training and suboptimal alignment. To resolve this, we propose a novel framework to enhance Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by explicitly managing these conflicts. Our method integrates three synergistic components: 1) a stabilizing intermediate reward to guide early-stage generation; 2) a dynamic time-step reweighting scheme for precise credit assignment; and 3) a novel mask propagation algorithm, derived from principles of Reward Feedback Learning (ReFL), designed to isolate optimization effects both spatially and temporally. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in sample quality and objective alignment over the vanilla GRPO baseline, enabling robust and effective optimization for VAR models."

    "abstract": "Quantum adiabatic algorithms are commonly analyzed through local spectral properties of an interpolating Hamiltonian, most notably the minimum energy gap. While this perspective captures an important constraint on adiabatic runtimes, it does not fully describe the global structure of spectral evolution in optimization problems with degenerate solution manifolds. In this work, we show that degeneracy alone imposes unavoidable global constraints on spectral flow, even in instances where adiabatic algorithms succeed with high probability. Focusing on digitized quantum adiabatic evolutions, we analyze the eigenphases of the cumulative unitary operator generated along the interpolation path. By explicitly tracking eigenphase trajectories, we demonstrate that multiple spectral bands are forced to interact, braid, and permute before coalescing into a degenerate manifold at the end of the evolution. This global reordering manifests as persistent spectral congestion and nontrivial band permutations that cannot be removed by increasing evolution time or refining the digitization. Using MaxCut instances with controlled degeneracy as a concrete setting, we extract quantitative diagnostics of spectral congestion and explicitly compute the induced band permutations. Our results show that successful adiabatic optimization can coexist with complex and constrained spectral flow, revealing a form of topological obstruction rooted in the global connectivity of eigenstates rather than in local gap closures. These findings highlight intrinsic limitations of gap-based analyses and motivate spectral-flow-based diagnostics for understanding adiabatic algorithms in degenerate optimization landscapes."

    "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of Deep Learning is increasingly constrained by its heavy reliance on high-performance hardware, particularly Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). These specialized accelerators are not only prohibitively expensive and energy-intensive but also suffer from significant supply scarcity, limiting the ubiquity of Artificial Intelligence (AI) deployment on edge devices. The core of this inefficiency stems from the standard artificial perceptron's dependence on intensive matrix multiplications. However, biological nervous systems achieve unparalleled efficiency without such arithmetic intensity; synaptic signal transmission is regulated by physical ion channel limits and chemical neurotransmitter levels rather than a process that can be analogous to arithmetic multiplication. Inspired by this biological mechanism, we propose Neuro-Channel Networks (NCN), a novel multiplication-free architecture designed to decouple AI from expensive hardware dependencies. In our model, weights are replaced with Channel Widths that physically limit the signal magnitude, while a secondary parameter acts as a Neurotransmitter to regulate Signal Transmission based on sign logic. The forward pass relies exclusively on addition, subtraction, and bitwise operations (minimum, sign), eliminating floating-point multiplication entirely. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate that NCNs can solve non-linearly separable problems like XOR and the Majority function with 100% accuracy using standard backpropagation, proving their capability to form complex decision boundaries without multiplicative weights. This architecture offers a highly efficient alternative for next-generation neuromorphic hardware, paving the way for running complex models on commodity CPUs or ultra-low-power chips without relying on costly GPU clusters."

Cloud-assisted IoT solutions offer storage, scalability, and computational resources, but introduce new security and privacy risks that conventional trust-based approaches fail to adequately mitigate. To address these challenges, this paper presents MOZAIK, a novel end-to-end privacy-preserving confidential data storage and distributed processing architecture tailored for IoT-to-cloud scenarios. MOZAIK ensures that data remains encrypted throughout its lifecycle, including during transmission, storage, and processing.

Two distinct COED techniques are explored, specifically secure multi-party computation (MPC) and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE).

The evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility of the MOZAIK system and indicate the cost of an end-to-end privacy-preserving system compared to regular plaintext alternatives.

Over the past year, the field has reached a new level, with dozens of open-source models released alongside highly capable commercial systems. However, only a limited number of open-source approaches currently achieve real-world quality. In addition, diffusion backbones, the dominant choice for these pipelines, are often large and computationally expensive for many deployments and research settings, with widely used variants typically containing 6B to 20B parameters. This paper presents a compact, high-throughput instruction-based image editing pipeline that uses a modern 2B-parameter Qwen3-VL model to guide the editing process and the 1.6B-parameter diffusion model Sana1.5 for image generation. Our design decisions across architecture, data processing, training configuration, and evaluation target low-cost inference and strict source consistency while maintaining high quality across the major edit categories feasible at this scale. Evaluated on the ImgEdit and GEdit benchmarks, the proposed method matches or exceeds the performance of substantially heavier baselines, including models with several times as many parameters and higher inference cost, and is particularly strong on edits that require preserving the input image, such as an attribute adjustment, object removal, background edits, and targeted replacement. The model fits within 24 GB of GPU memory and generates edited images at up to 2K resolution in approximately 4 seconds on an NVIDIA H100 in BF16, without additional inference optimizations or distillation."

In this study we investigates the potential of hybrid quantum-classical learning to enhance feature representations for intrusion detection and explore possible quantum advantages in cybersecurity analytics. Using the UNSW-NB15 dataset, network traffic is transformed into structured feature vectors through classical preprocessing and normalization. Classical models, including Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines with linear and RBF kernels, are evaluated on the full dataset to establish baseline performance under large-sample conditions. Simultaneously, a quantum-enhanced pipeline maps classical features into variational quantum circuits via angle encoding and entangling layers, executed on a CPU-based quantum simulator, with resulting quantum embeddings classified using a classical SVM. Experiments show that while classical models achieve higher overall accuracy with large datasets, quantum-enhanced representations demonstrate superior attack recall and improved class separability when data is scarce, suggesting that quantum feature spaces capture complex correlations inaccessible to shallow classical models. These results highlight the potential of quantum embeddings to improve generalization and representation quality in cybersecurity tasks and provide a reproducible framework for evaluating quantum advantages as quantum hardware and simulators continue to advance."

    "abstract": "Quantum computation is inherently hybrid, and fast classical manipulation of qubit operators is necessary to ensure scalability in quantum software. We introduce PauliEngine, a high-performance C++ framework that provides efficient primitives for Pauli string multiplication, commutators, symbolic phase tracking, and structural transformations. Built on a binary symplectic representation and optimized bit-wise operations, PauliEngine supports both numerical and symbolic coefficients and is accessible through a Python interface. Runtime benchmarks demonstrate substantial speedups over state-of-the-art implementations. PauliEngine provides a scalable backend for operator-based quantum software tools and simulations."

    "abstract": "For any fixed irrational frequency and trigonometric-polynomial potential, we show that every type I energy with positive Lyapunov exponent that satisfies the gap-labelling condition is a boundary of an open spectral gap. As a corollary, for the almost-Mathieu operator in the supercritical regime the \"all spectral gaps are open\" property is robust under a small trigonometric-polynomial perturbation at any irrational frequency. The proof introduces a geometric, all-frequency approach built from three ingredients: (i) the projective action on the Lagrangian Grassmannian and an associated fibred rotation number, (ii) monotonicity of one-parameter families of (Hermitian) symplectic cocycles, and (iii) a partially hyperbolic splitting with a two-dimensional center together with a global symplectification (holonomy-driven parallel transport). This provides a partial resolution to the stability of the Dry Ten Martini Problem in the supercritical regime, and answers a question by M. Shamis regarding the survival of periodic gaps."

We present our custom line-finding algorithm and visual inspection effort used to identify emission lines and derive the spectroscopic redshifts for line-emitting sources in PASSAGE. The line-finding algorithm identifies between ~200 and 950 line-emitting candidates per field, of which typically 47% were identified as true emission lines post visual inspection. We identify 2183 emission line sources at 0.08<z<4.7, 1896 of which have available COSMOS photometric redshifts. We find excellent redshift agreement between the COSMOS photometric redshifts and the PASSAGE spectroscopic redshifts for strong (S/N>5), multi-line emitting sources. This agreement weakens for PASSAGE single-line emitters with ambiguous identities. These single-line emitters are likely mis-identified around 18% of the time based on comparisons to photometric redshifts. We derive stellar masses using PASSAGE photometry and spectroscopic redshifts, in broad agreement with existing COSMOS-Web stellar masses, but with some discrepancy driven by redshift disagreements. We publicly release this spectroscopic redshift catalog, which will enable community-led science in prime extragalactic fields and serve as a crucial dataset for validating Euclid and Roman spectroscopy."

    "abstract": "Accurately understanding the propagation environment is a fundamental challenge in site-specific beamforming (SSBF). This paper proposes a novel generative SSBF (GenSSBF) solution, which represents a paradigm shift from conventional unstructured prediction to joint-structure modeling. First, considering the fundamental differences between beam generation and conventional image synthesis, a unified GenSSBF framework is proposed, which includes a site profile, a wireless prompting module, and a generator. Second, a beam-brainstorm (BBS) solution is proposed as an instantiation of this GenSSBF framework. Specifically, the site profile is configured by transforming channel data from spatial domain to a reversible latent space via discrete Fourier transform (DFT). To facilitate practical deployment, the wireless prompt is constructed from the reference signal received power (RSRP) measured using a small number of DFT-beams. Finally, the generator is developed using a customized conditional diffusion model. Rather than relying on a meticulously designed global codebook, BBS directly generates diverse and high-fidelity user-specific beams guided by the wireless prompts. Simulation results on accurate ray-tracing datasets demonstrate that BBS can achieve near-optimal beamforming gain while drastically reducing the beam sweeping overhead, even in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments."

This paper addresses the need for a tool that can accommodate MLIR's extensibility, a feature not provided by previous methods such as Csmith. Here we introduce MLIR-Smith, a novel random program generator specifically designed to test and evaluate MLIR-based compiler optimizations. We demonstrate the utility of MLIR-Smith by conducting differential testing on MLIR, LLVM, DaCe, and DCIR, which led to the discovery of multiple bugs in these compiler pipelines. The introduction of MLIR-Smith not only fills a void in the realm of compiler testing but also emphasizes the importance of comprehensive testing within these systems. By providing a tool that can generate random MLIR programs, this paper enhances our ability to evaluate and improve compilers and paves the way for future tools, potentially shaping the wider landscape of software testing and quality assurance."

Motivated by the distinct nature of modalities - where text is strictly sequential and images are inherently hierarchical - we retain next-token prediction for text but adopt next-scale prediction for visual generation. This departs from traditional raster-scan methods, enabling the generation of 1024x1024 images in just 5 seconds - orders of magnitude faster than comparable AR models. We address the instabilities of multi-scale generation through a robust training recipe. Furthermore, we introduce a prefix-tuning strategy for reinforcement learning.

    "abstract": "Turbulent flows have high requirements for very fine meshes near the boundary to ensure accuracy. In the context of topology optimization (TO), such fine meshes become unrealistic and common approaches are hampered by low accuracy and overestimation of boundary layer thickness. Wall-functions are a natural way to ease the computational requirements, but they are not naturally imposed in density-based TO due to the diffuse design parametrization. We propose an implicit wall-function formulation for the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS), standard k-epsilon model that extracts wall-normal information directly from the gradient of the design variable and enables a penalty-based formulation for imposing wall-functions to the RANS equations, without the need for body-fitted meshes. The method provides a reliable route to high Reynolds number turbulent topology optimization, delivering boundary layer accuracy comparable to explicit-wall body-fitted analyses, while retaining the flexibility of density-based TO. Furthermore, because wall effects are modeled using wall-functions, accurate solutions are obtained on substantially coarser meshes, leading to significant reductions in computational cost. The approach is validated on three canonical benchmarks over Reynolds numbers up to Re = 2e5: a pipe-bend; a U-bend; and a Tesla-valve. Across all cases, the proposed method accurately recovers near-wall velocity profiles, closely matching verification simulations on body-fitted meshes with explicit wall-functions. In contrast, a conventional turbulent TO formulation, without the proposed wall-function treatment, mispredicts boundary-layer development and yields sub-optimal results."

    "abstract": "The light deflection under a strong gravitational field, referred to as strong gravitational lensing, provides a powerful probe of spacetime geometry. Besides, laboratory analogue models are employed to study the effects of curved spacetime and explore the design of optical devices. Here, applying the framework of analogue gravity, we reveal the behavior of the optical echo from a pulsed point-like source near a black hole, which is strongly dependent on the interplay of the black hole's photon sphere and the source's duration. We model the Schwarzschild spacetime as a Flamm paraboloid and calculate the echo response, using analytical geodesic solutions and the Huygens-Fresnel principle. Particularly, when the spatial scale of pulse duration is comparable to the photon sphere, continuous ``echo tails\" appear along bright interference fringes in temporal response. Analysis in both the temporal and frequency domains reveals that these echo tails are a signature of resonance between the incoming pulse and the photon sphere. This work provides a wave-optics perspective on the interaction between dynamic sources and black holes, offering a table top window on strong gravitational lensing."

Intrinsic STC are rare but offer rich condensate properties and unique surface properties allowing insights into the nature of the spin-triplet order, and promising applications in quantum technologies. Owing to interactions, the order parameter in STCs can often be intertwined with other symmetry breaking orders like charge/spin density waves (CDW/SDW) or pair density waves (PDW) complicating their phase diagrams. UTe2 stands out as the only known odd-parity, STC that harbors such intertwined orders on the surface and possible topological surface states composed of Majorana fermions. While the (0-11) facet is the most heavily studied, the fermiology of this surface that gives rise to such exotic phenomena is still lacking and continues to be an area of active interest. Here, we employ low-temperature spectroscopic imaging to reveal the Fermi surface of UTe2 through quasiparticle interference. We find scattering originating from the uranium-derived bands that play a major role in the formation of the CDW and the PDW phases. Tunneling spectroscopy further reveals spectral signatures of the CDW gap, corroborating its onset temperature. Suppressing the CDW with a magnetic field, highlights the presence of small, circular Fermi pockets that disperse strongly near the Fermi energy. We discuss the nature of the interference patterns and the origin of the small Fermi pockets in the context of the calculated band structure and the unconventional CDW phase."

In contrast to the conventional linear Doppler effect governed by constant relative velocity, this mechanism enables dynamic phase-to-frequency transduction, generating high-order harmonics, magnonic frequency combs, and coherent chirped sidebands, without requiring nonlinear magnon-magnon coupling or multi-magnon scattering. Micromagnetic simulations on voltage-controlled anisotropy boundaries in ferroelectric/ferromagnetic (FE/FM) heterostructures demonstrate that the comb spacing and spectral topology are determined solely by boundary kinematics, confirming direct Doppler phase coupling between boundary motion and spin-wave propagation. These results establish moving magnetic-energy boundaries as a new class of on-chip spectral synthesizers and define a coherent and energy-efficient framework for flexible tuning of magnonic frequencies, fundamentally distinct from traditional passive scattering or nonlinear multi-magnon mechanisms."

    "abstract": "Astrophysical dynamos feature various spatial structures and dynamical regimes, ranging from hemispherical magnetic fields to the random reversals of the geodynamo. The recently observed Tayler-Spruit dynamo has been invoked to explain angular momentum transport in stellar radiative zones and magnetar formation in a proto-neutron star spun-up by fallback accretion. Whether this dynamo mechanism can lead to different dynamical regimes remains an open question. Using three-dimensional direct numerical simulations, we model the dynamics of a stably stratified spherical Couette flow, with the outer sphere rotating faster than the inner one. While the generation of strong stationary and hemispherical dynamos has been observed in our previous studies, we report for the first time the existence of reversals and complex temporal dynamics. We observe that the dynamics is strongly correlated with the equatorial symmetry breaking of the flow. Focusing on a fiducial dynamo simulation, we propose a simple interpretation of its dynamics, which consists in the coupling of two large-scale magnetic modes with two opposite equatorial symmetries by the flow symmetry breaking. While this interpretation captures the simplest observed dynamics, the nonlinear interaction between a higher number of magnetic modes is certainly required to describe some of the more complex regimes. The wide diversity of dynamical regimes generated by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo may have interesting implications for the geometry of the neutron star magnetic fields, and therefore neutron star emissions."

In this work, we present a comprehensive, multi-level investigation of the He-Bz interaction, establishing benchmark energies using high-level coupled-cluster singles-and-doubles with perturbative triples (CCSD(T)) methods extrapolated to the complete basis set limit and assessing higher-order (CCSDT(Q)) contributions. We use symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) to benchmark it against CCSD(T) and to decompose the interaction into its physical components-confirming it is dominated by a balance between dispersion and exchange-repulsion. A continuous, three-dimensional PES is constructed from discrete ab initio points using multifidelity Gaussian process regression that combines density functional theory results with sparse coupled-cluster energies. The result is a highly accurate PES with sub-cm-1 accuracy that obeys physical laws. This new PES is applied to path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations to study the solvation of 4He atoms on benzene at low temperatures. Our PIMC results reveal qualitatively different solvation behavior, particularly in the filling of adsorption layers, when compared to simulations using commonly employed empirical Lennard-Jones potentials.

In this paper, we develop the theory of the projective equivalence in the para-Kaehler context by studying para-Kaehler metrics sharing the same T-planar curves, where T is the para-complex structure: we call such metrics pc-projectively equivalent. After establishing some general results in arbitrary dimension, we focus on the 4-dimensional case.

We reported a noticeable shift in the dominant frequency band from $5$ to $3$ mHz, as both the angular and detector resolutions of the instruments were degraded. We argue that the observed behaviour is a result of the increased contamination of straylight from neighbouring quiet Sun regions, masking the true behaviour of umbral oscillations. These results suggest that the wave energy contributions reported in the literature and based on low-resolution instrumentation may be fundamentally underestimated. As we move into the era of high-resolution instrumentation such as DKIST and MUSE, this work will offer a critical baseline for interpreting new observations, especially in terms of distinguishing true dynamic behaviours from artefacts introduced by instrument-related limitations."

    "abstract": "Quantum machine learning (QML) is expected to offer new opportunities to process high-dimensional data efficiently by exploiting the exponentially large state space of quantum systems. In this work, we apply quantum extreme reservoir computing (QERC) to the classification of microstructure images of polymer alloys generated using self-consistent field theory (SCFT). While previous QML efforts have primarily focused on benchmark datasets such as MNIST, our work demonstrates the applicability of QERC to engineering data with direct materials relevance. Through numerical experiments, we examine the influence of key computational parameters-including the number of qubits, sampling cost (the number of measurement shots), and reservoir configuration-on classification performance. The resulting phase classifications are depicted as phase diagrams that illustrate the phase transitions in polymer morphology, establishing an understandable connection between quantum model outputs and material behavior. These results illustrate QERC performance on realistic materials datasets and suggest practical guidelines for quantum encoder design and model generalization. This work establishes a foundation for integrating quantum learning techniques into materials informatics."

    "abstract": "The recent asteroseismic observations constitute a great challenge for rotating stellar evolution models, which predict too fast internal rotation rates when only hydrodynamic processes are included. This suggests the absence of one or several unidentified angular momentum transport processes in these models. Transport by large-scale and strong magnetic fields in the radiative zone is a promising candidate to explain the observations. While these fields may have a fossil origin, a dynamo driven by the Tayler instability in a shear flow constitute a primary mechanism to form the necessary magnetic fields. Despite recent numerical studies, this mechanism remains poorly known. Motivated by this, we investigate the Tayler-Spruit dynamo through a new set of three-dimensional direct numerical simulations. We model the radiative zone as a Boussinesq stably stratified fluid whose differential rotation is maintained by a volumetric body force. We report for the first time the existence of two bistable dynamo branches, which mainly differ by the magnetic field location (near the equator and the polar axis). While the equatorial branch is driven by the magnetorotational instability, we mainly investigate the newly identified polar branch, which is driven by the Tayler instability. We show that this branch can still operate and transport angular momentum efficiently in a very strong stratification regime. We extract new scaling laws for the different magnetic field components, transports processes, and the minimum shear to trigger the Tayler instability-driven dynamo. Finally, we roughly constrain the signature of the generated magnetic fields on asteroseismic modes propagating in main-sequence and evolved stars. Thus, our results fosters new studies using stellar evolution models including our prescriptions and the search of asteroseismic signals impacted by large-scale azimuthal magnetic fields."

    "abstract": "Semantic change detection in remote sensing aims to identify land cover changes between bi-temporal image pairs. Progress in this area has been limited by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as pixel-level annotation is costly and time-consuming. To address this, recent methods leverage synthetic data or generate artificial change pairs, but out-of-domain generalization remains limited. In this work, we introduce a weak temporal supervision strategy that leverages additional temporal observations of existing single-temporal datasets, without requiring any new annotations. Specifically, we extend single-date remote sensing datasets with new observations acquired at different times and train a change detection model by assuming that real bi-temporal pairs mostly contain no change, while pairing images from different locations to generate change examples. To handle the inherent noise in these weak labels, we employ an object-aware change map generation and an iterative refinement process. We validate our approach on extended versions of the FLAIR and IAILD aerial datasets, achieving strong zero-shot and low-data regime performance across different benchmarks. Lastly, we showcase results over large areas in France, highlighting the scalability potential of our method."

Despite their widespread use, the asymptotic convergence of AdaGrad remains poorly understood in non-convex scenarios. In this work, we present the first rigorous asymptotic convergence analysis of AdaGrad-Norm for smooth non-convex optimization. Using a novel stopping-time partitioning technique, we establish a key stability result: the objective function values remain bounded in expectation, and the iterates are bounded almost surely under a mild coercivity assumption. Building on these stability results, we prove that AdaGrad-Norm achieves both almost sure and mean-square convergence. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to RMSProp and show that, with appropriate hyperparameter choices, it also enjoys stability and asymptotic convergence. The techniques developed herein may be of independent interest for analyzing other adaptive stochastic optimization algorithms."

While general-purpose AI has proliferated, it remains fundamentally unsuited for the high-stakes epidemiological domain due to chronic hallucinations and an inability to navigate specialized data silos. This paper introduces ARIES (Agentic Retrieval Intelligence for Epidemiological Surveillance), a specialized, autonomous multi-agent framework designed to move beyond static, disease-specific dashboards toward a dynamic intelligence ecosystem. Built on a hierarchical command structure, ARIES utilizes GPTs to orchestrate a scalable swarm of sub-agents capable of autonomously querying World Health Organization (WHO), Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and peer-reviewed research papers. By automating the extraction and logical synthesis of surveillance data, ARIES provides a specialized reasoning that identifies emergent threats and signal divergence in near real-time. This modular architecture proves that a task-specific agentic swarm can outperform generic models, offering a robust, extensible for next-generation outbreak response and global health intelligence."

    "abstract": "We investigate whether large language models can introspect on their internal states. It is difficult to answer this question through conversation alone, as genuine introspection cannot be distinguished from confabulations. Here, we address this challenge by injecting representations of known concepts into a model's activations, and measuring the influence of these manipulations on the model's self-reported states. We find that models can, in certain scenarios, notice the presence of injected concepts and accurately identify them. Models demonstrate some ability to recall prior internal representations and distinguish them from raw text inputs. Strikingly, we find that some models can use their ability to recall prior intentions in order to distinguish their own outputs from artificial prefills. In all these experiments, Claude Opus 4 and 4.1, the most capable models we tested, generally demonstrate the greatest introspective awareness; however, trends across models are complex and sensitive to post-training strategies. Finally, we explore whether models can explicitly control their internal representations, finding that models can modulate their activations when instructed or incentivized to \"think about\" a concept. Overall, our results indicate that current language models possess some functional introspective awareness of their own internal states. We stress that in today's models, this capacity is highly unreliable and context-dependent; however, it may continue to develop with further improvements to model capabilities."

We identify new sufficient geometric conditions under which the combined curvature map $g\\mapsto (R_g, H_g)$ is a local surjection. Consequently, we demonstrate that in contrast to manifolds without boundary, where staticity obstructs deformability, the scalar curvature map can be locally surjective at static metrics on manifolds with boundary."

    "abstract": "Since floorplan data is readily available, long-term persistent, and robust to changes in visual appearance, visual Floorplan Localization (FLoc) has garnered significant attention. Existing methods either ingeniously match geometric priors or utilize sparse semantics to reduce FLoc uncertainty. However, they still suffer from ambiguous FLoc caused by repetitive structures within minimalist floorplans. Moreover, expensive but limited semantic annotations restrict their applicability. To address these issues, we propose DisCo-FLoc, which utilizes dual-level visual-geometric Contrasts to Disambiguate depth-aware visual Floc, without requiring additional semantic labels. Our solution begins with a ray regression predictor tailored for ray-casting-based FLoc, predicting a series of FLoc candidates using depth estimation expertise. In addition, a novel contrastive learning method with position-level and orientation-level constraints is proposed to strictly match depth-aware visual features with the corresponding geometric structures in the floorplan. Such matches can effectively eliminate FLoc ambiguity and select the optimal imaging pose from FLoc candidates. Exhaustive comparative studies on two standard visual Floc benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art semantic-based method, achieving significant improvements in both robustness and accuracy."

    "abstract": "Optical magnetometers use the rotation of linearly polarized laser light induced by the Faraday effect for high precision magnetic field measurements. Here, we carry out an in-depth quantum information investigation, deploying two distinct models: The first, semiclassical model can violate the quantum Cramer-Rao bound by several orders of magnitude for weak dissipation and large atom numbers, invalidating the semiclassical approach in this parameter regime. The second model, describing the atoms as a collective spin, respects the Cramer-Rao bound for all parameters. Interestingly, the collective model also predicts Heisenberg scaling for the quantum Fisher information. The comparison of both models shows that Heisenberg scaling is a result of measurement-induced quantum correlation in an otherwise non-interacting quantum system. As the Heisenberg scaling appears in a stationary state of a macroscopic quantum system, it can be thus viewed as a new paradigm in quantum sensing. Intriguingly, the comparison of both models with experimental data can constitute a test for the foundations of quantum mechanics in a macroscopic ensemble of atoms."

    "abstract": "As the demand for analyzing egocentric videos grows, egocentric visual attention prediction, anticipating where a camera wearer will attend, has garnered increasing attention. However, it remains challenging due to the inherent complexity and ambiguity of dynamic egocentric scenes. Motivated by evidence that scene contextual information plays a crucial role in modulating human attention, in this paper, we present a language-guided scene context-aware learning framework for robust egocentric visual attention prediction. We first design a context perceiver which is guided to summarize the egocentric video based on a language-based scene description, generating context-aware video representations. We then introduce two training objectives that: 1) encourage the framework to focus on the target point-of-interest regions and 2) suppress distractions from irrelevant regions which are less likely to attract first-person attention. Extensive experiments on Ego4D and Aria Everyday Activities (AEA) datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance and enhanced robustness across diverse, dynamic egocentric scenarios."

    "abstract": "Bayesian dynamic borrowing has become an increasingly important tool for evaluating the consistency of regional treatment effects which is a key requirement for local regulatory approval of a new drug. It helps increase the precision of regional treatment effect estimate when regional and global data are similar, while guarding against potential bias when they differ. In practice, the two-component mixture prior, of which one mixture component utilizes the power prior to incorporate external data, is widely used. It allows convenient prior specification, analytical posterior computation, and fast evaluation of operating characteristics. Though the robust meta-analytical-predictive (MAP) prior is broadly used with multiple external data sources, it remains underutilized for regional treatment effect assessment (typically only one external data source is available) due to its inherit complexity in prior specification and posterior computation. In this article, we illustrate the applicability of the robust MAP prior in the regional treatment effect assessment by developing a closed-form approximation for its posterior distribution while leveraging its relationship with the power prior. The proposed methodology substantially reduces the computational burden of identifying prior parameters for desired operating characteristics. Moreover, we have demonstrated that the MAP prior is an attractive choice to construct the informative component of the mixture prior compared to the power prior. The advantage can be explained through a Bayesian hypothesis testing perspective. Using a real-world example, we illustrate how our proposed method enables efficient and transparent development of a Bayesian dynamic borrowing design to show regional consistency."

    "abstract": "We present Flo, a data-driven storm surge model, covering the North Sea, Norwegian Sea and Barents Sea. The model is built using the Anemoi framework for creating machine learning weather forecasting systems, developed by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and partners. The model is based on a graph neural network, and is capable of simulating water level due to storm surge at a horizontal resolution of 4 km and a temporal resolution of 1 hour with a quality comparable to the numerical model on which it was trained. The model was trained using a data set consisting of 43 years of atmospheric data from the 3-km Norwegian Reanalysis hindcast for mean sea level pressure and winds, and the NORA-Surge hindcast for storm surge. Evaluation was done by comparing results from hindcast runs of the Flo model against independent observations of more than 90 water level gauges along the European coast, and against the NORA-Surge hindcast. The evaluation shows that Flo produces hindcasts with accuracy similar to the NORA-Surge hindcast. Since no data assimilation was applied in the NORA-Surge hindcast used as training data, the Flo model is not expected to outperform the numerical model when compared to observations. The current work takes an important step transforming storm surge forecasting from being based purely on numerical physics-based models, to taking advantage of recent advancements in machine learning. This does not represent a large step forward with regards to improving the forecast skill, but forms a foundation for future training of a storm surge model that offers more flexibility for taking observations into account."

    "abstract": "Strawberry harvesting robots faced persistent challenges such as low integration of visual perception, fruit-gripper misalignment, empty grasping, and strawberry slippage from the gripper due to insufficient gripping force, all of which compromised harvesting stability and efficiency in orchard environments. To overcome these issues, this paper proposed a visual fault diagnosis and self-recovery framework that integrated multi-task perception with corrective control strategies. At the core of this framework was SRR-Net, an end-to-end multi-task perception model that simultaneously performed strawberry detection, segmentation, and ripeness estimation, thereby unifying visual perception with fault diagnosis. Based on this integrated perception, a relative error compensation method based on the simultaneous target-gripper detection was designed to address positional misalignment, correcting deviations when error exceeded the tolerance threshold. To mitigate empty grasping and fruit-slippage faults, an early abort strategy was implemented. A micro-optical camera embedded in the end-effector provided real-time visual feedback, enabling grasp detection during the deflating stage and strawberry slip prediction during snap-off through MobileNet V3-Small classifier and a time-series LSTM classifier. Experiments demonstrated that SRR-Net maintained high perception accuracy. For detection, it achieved a precision of 0.895 and recall of 0.813 on strawberries, and 0.972/0.958 on hands. In segmentation, it yielded a precision of 0.887 and recall of 0.747 for strawberries, and 0.974/0.947 for hands. For ripeness estimation, SRR-Net attained a mean absolute error of 0.035, while simultaneously supporting multi-task perception and sustaining a competitive inference speed of 163.35 FPS."

    "abstract": "Doubly-stochastic matrices (DSM) are increasingly utilized in structure-preserving deep architectures -- such as Optimal Transport layers and Sinkhorn-based attention -- to enforce numerical stability and probabilistic interpretability. In this work, we identify a critical spectral degradation phenomenon inherent to these constraints, termed the Homogeneity Trap. We demonstrate that the maximum-entropy bias, typical of Sinkhorn-based projections, drives the mixing operator towards the uniform barycenter, thereby suppressing the subdominant singular value σ_2 and filtering out high-frequency feature components. We derive a spectral bound linking σ_2 to the network's effective depth, showing that high-entropy constraints restrict feature transformation to a shallow effective receptive field. Furthermore, we formally demonstrate that Layer Normalization fails to mitigate this collapse in noise-dominated regimes; specifically, when spectral filtering degrades the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) below a critical threshold, geometric structure is irreversibly lost to noise-induced orthogonal collapse.

    "abstract": "Dynamic discrete choice (DDC) models have found widespread application in marketing. However, estimating these becomes challenging in \"big data\" settings with high-dimensional state-action spaces. To address this challenge, this paper develops a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based two-step (\"computationally light\") Conditional Choice Simulation (CCS) estimation approach that combines the scalability of machine learning with the transparency, explainability, and interpretability of structural models, which is particularly valuable for counterfactual policy analysis. The method is premised on three insights: (1) the CCS (\"forward simulation\") approach is a special case of RL algorithms, (2) starting from an initial state-action pair, CCS updates the corresponding value function only after each simulation path has terminated, whereas RL algorithms may update for all the state-action pairs visited along a simulated path, and (3) RL focuses on inferring an agent's optimal policy with known reward functions, whereas DDC models focus on estimating the reward functions presupposing optimal policies. The procedure's computational efficiency over CCS estimation is demonstrated using Monte Carlo simulations with a canonical machine replacement and a consumer food purchase model. Framing CCS estimation of DDC models as an RL problem increases their applicability and scalability to high-dimensional marketing problems while retaining both interpretability and tractability."

The low-temperature ($T$=4.2 K) magneto-transmission data for weakly doped InSb in the frequency range 3-15 THz and magnetic fields up to 25 T, shows that the AC conductivity is governed by the classical Drude response. Moreover, the resulting light-induced voltage in this system, consisting of thermoelectric and resistive contributions, both contain features that are related to cyclotron resonances. The frequency dependence of this resonance is in good agreement with $\\mathbf{k\\cdot p}$ perturbation theory and corresponds to transitions between the first and second Landau level with spin-up electrons. The obtained effective mass $m^{*}(B=0)=0.014m_{e}$, is in line with the value extracted from magneto-transmission experiments. Additionally, we can observe evidence of a fluence-dependent metal-insulator transition in the thermoelectric signal, which suggest that the electronic system becomes less sensitive to the light at higher frequencies."

We studied geometry optimizations, relative stability, atomization energies, Fermi energy, energy gap, electronic properties, electric dipole moment, polarizabilities, and thermodynamic analysis, along with IR and NMR spectra. Consistently, our findings revealed distinct properties and characteristics among different C36 fullerene isomers. The energetic order of C36 fullerene isomers was established as C36-D3h < C36-C1 < C36-Cs < C36-C2 < C36-D2, a trend unaffected by the encapsulation of oxygen. Notably, the D2 isomer displayed the smallest energy gap, indicating higher electrical conductivity compared to other isomers, while it exhibited the largest gap after encapsulation. Furthermore, we observed that the C1 (D2) isomer exhibited the largest (smallest) Electric dipole moment among the studied C36 isomers, whereas the C2 (D2) isomer demonstrated the largest Electric dipole moment among the O@C36 isomers studied. The encapsulation of oxygen in C36 isomers influenced their properties, including alterations in electronic properties, IR, and NMR chemical shifts. A detailed analysis of BSSE corrections showed the tininess of their impact on the analyzed observables, such that uncorrected and BSSE-corrected calculations led to nearly identical results, confirming the robustness and reliability of the B3LYP/6-31G* approach used in this work and, eventually, in other large and rigid fullerenes systems."

By applying the blocktrack algorithm to ERA5 reanalysis and a CMIP6 model ensemble, we identify and track blocking events over Greenland, and obtain their trajectories, intensities, durations and wave-breaking characteristics. Two types of Greenland Blocking (GB) are identified in ERA5 via the Wave Breaking Index, respectively characterized by anticyclonic and cyclonic wave breaking. These correspond to the previously identified upstream and retrograding GBs. Upstream blocks, which originate in Northern Canada, exhibit stronger moisture transport before and during the blocking onset and higher temperature anomalies than retrograding blocks, which follow a east-to-west trajectory and originate in the Northern Atlantic. Our analyses show how the recent observed increase in the frequency of GB, particularly in 2012, is primarily driven by upstream blocks. CMIP6 models generally fail to capture the increase seen in observations and underestimate GB variability. Future projections under the SSP370 scenario show a decline in retrograding blocks but a possible increase in upstream blocks, depending on the detection index used. We discuss possible drivers of these changes, which include jet stream position shifts, increased frequency of high moisture transport events from the equator to the high latitudes, surface temperature increases due to Atlantic Multidecadal Variability and Arctic Amplification. By analyzing block trajectories, this study demonstrates how Lagrangian diagnostics can provide novel insights into the dynamics of blocking events over Greenland."

Photoacoustic spectroscopy has proven to combine high sensitivity with appealing features like compactness, wavelength-independent and background-free detection. To date, photoacoustic sensing has mostly been focused on high-pressure applied trace-gas analysis, while accessing the low-pressure regime has been considered not compatible with efficient acoustic wave propagation. However, sensing gas samples at low pressure is the key to get access to high-resolution spectroscopy. Here, we demonstrate that sub-Doppler saturation spectroscopy can be performed on low-pressure trace gases in a cavity-enhanced photoacoustic sensor with mW-level mid-infrared radiation. Moreover, we show that the same setup can be operated at higher pressure, enabling trace-gas detection with 5 parts-per-billion sensitivity with a laser power as low as 35 microwatts. This allows to extend the unique advantages of the photoacoustic technique to metrology and fundamental physics and provides the mid-infrared with a cost-effective, flexible tool combining high sensitivity and resolution."

    "abstract": "An important step in using observations of gravitational waves from bounded sources is to relate the observed waveforms far away from a source to the local dynamics and environment of the source. To isolate and identify different features of the source, multipole expansion of radiation field as well as that of the source distribution is crucial. Unlike the waves on Minkowski background, those on de Sitter background do not have a convenient, close form relation among these multipoles of arbitrary order to draw general conclusions. This requires truncation to some multipole order to be employed and a consistency issue arises. This was flagged in \\cite{CHK} as emergence of disallowed $log(r)$ terms in certain asymptotic forms and a particular quadrupolar truncation was proposed which was consistent with the source conservation. In \\cite{NKD80}, it was noticed that a truncated solution while satisfying the wave equation, may fail to satisfy the gauge condition. Truncation in a fully gauge fixed form should not generate the unwanted $log(r)$ terms. In this work, we clarify the consistency issue and also correct a couple of erroneous statements in \\cite{NKD80}. The consistency is analyzed by explicitly integrating the gauge conditions and the source conservation equations over the conformal time. This gives a general procedure for a consistent truncation. The procedure is applied to truncations of completely gauge fixed solution illustrating its consistency."

    "abstract": "The foundational work by Bell led to an interest in understanding non-local correlations that arise from entangled states shared between distinct, spacelike-separated parties, which formed a foundation for the theory of quantum information processing. We investigate the question of maximal correlations analogous to the maximally entangled states defined in the entanglement theory of multipartite systems. To formalize this, we employ the sheaf-theoretic framework for contextuality, which generalizes non-locality. This provides a new metric for correlations called contextual fraction (CF), which ranges from 0 (non-contextual) to 1 (maximally contextual). Using this, we have defined the absolutely maximal contextual correlations (AMCC), which are maximally contextual and have maximal marginals, which captures the notion of absolutely maximal entangled (AME) states. The Popescu-Rohrlich (PR) box serves as the bipartite example, and we construct various extensions of such correlations in the tripartite case. An infinite family of various forms of AMCC is constructed using the parity check method and the constraint satisfiability problem (CSP) scheme. We also demonstrate the existence of maximally contextual correlations, which do not exhibit maximal marginals, and refer to them as non-AMCC. The results are further applied to secret sharing and randomness extraction using AMCC correlations."

    "abstract": "Real-world complex systems often evolve on different timescales and possess multiple coexisting stable states. Whether or not a system returns to a given stable state after being perturbed away from it depends on the shape and extent of its basin of attraction. In this Letter, we show that basins of attraction in multiscale systems can exhibit special geometric properties in the form of universal singular funnels. We use the term singular basins to refer to basins of attraction with singular funnels. We show that singular basins occur robustly in a range of dynamical systems: the normal form of a pitchfork bifurcation with a slowly changing parameter, an adaptive active rotator, and an adaptive network of phase rotators. Although singular funnels are narrow, they can extend to different parts of the phase space and, unexpectedly, impact the resilience of the system to disturbances. Crucially, the presence of a singular funnel may prevent the usual dimensionality reductions in the limit of large timescale separation, such as quasi-static approximation, adiabatic elimination or time-averaging of the fast variables"

Existing methods mainly address a single type of degradation (e.g., haze or low-light) at a time, ignoring the interplay of different degradation types and resulting in limited visibility improvement. We observe that the domain knowledge shared between low-light and haze priors can be reinforced mutually for better visibility. Based on this key insight, in this paper, we propose a novel framework that enhances visibility in nighttime hazy images by reinforcing the intrinsic consistency between haze and low-light priors mutually and progressively. In particular, our model utilizes image-, patch-, and pixel-level experts that operate across visual and frequency domains to recover global scene structure, regional patterns, and fine-grained details progressively. A frequency-aware router is further introduced to adaptively guide the contribution of each expert, ensuring robust image restoration. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our model on nighttime dehazing benchmarks both quantitatively and qualitatively. Moreover, we showcase the generalizability of our model in daytime dehazing and low-light enhancement tasks."

Such a state corresponds to a strategy adopted by the population such that a rare mutant strategy cannot invade the population. In parallel, the dynamical formulation of evolutionary game theory -- particularly through replicator dynamics embodying the tenet of survival of the fittest -- provides a framework for modelling frequency-dependent selection over time. While it is well known that an ESS corresponds to stable fixed point in replicator dynamics, the evolutionary game-theoretic characterization of limit cycles is unknown. Here we fill this lacuna by defining oscillatory ESS (OESS) which we prove to be a stable limit cycle. We also show when an OESS is unique and if there are multiple OESSes, then what their locations are in the phase space."

This apparent equilibrium is shown in this work to correspond to a fixed point solution of the Navier-Stokes equations expressed in the statistical state dynamics (SSD) framework. Moreover, this fixed point solution is found to be rank-three, consisting of one analytically identified roll-streak structure (RSS) constituting the first cumulant of the SSD, and two analytically determined eigenmodes supporting the second cumulant. This minimal representation captures both the structure and the dynamics of WCC turbulence, while the remaining spectral components contribute negligibly to the equilibrium dynamics. Turbulent Couette flows other than WCC can be understood to be limit cycle and chaotic extensions supported by the same underlying mechanism as the fixed point WCC turbulence except for the two eigenmodes supporting WCC turbulence being replaced by two Floquet modes and two Lyapunov vectors, respectively. These results provide an analytic solution for turbulence in Couette flow."

The 3 mm continuum, CS (2$-$1), and HCO$^+$ (1$-$0) emissions reveal continuous and diffuse structures with measured FWHM widths of 0.054, 0.029, and 0.030 pc, respectively. In contrast, the H$^{13}$CO$^+$ (1$-$0) emission appears more clumpy and localized. The non-thermal motion in the filament is predominantly subsonic to transonic. We detect 13 dense cores in NH$_2$D (1$_{11}-1_{01}$), three of which coincide with continuum peaks; virial analysis suggests most are gravitationally bound. Using a friend-of-friend algorithm, we identify 32, 34, and 22 velocity-coherent fibers from the CS, HCO$^+$, and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ data, respectively. Compared to fibers traced by CS and HCO$^+$, H$^{13}$CO$^+$ fibers are more frequently associated with NH$_2$D cold cores and exhibit higher average mass-per-unit-length values. Differences among CS, HCO$^+$, and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ emissions likely arise from variations in effective critical densities. These results are consistent with a hierarchical structure, in which the 3.6-pc DR21SF contains velocity-coherent fibers and gravitationally bound dense cores."

The family is indexed by the parameter $ζ\\in (0,1]$, which determines the range of the theory via the kinetic term constructed from the graph Laplacian raised to the power $ζ$. Specifically, $ζ=1$ is the short-range theory, while $0<ζ<1$ defines the long-range model. Due to the hyperbolic nature of Bethe lattices, the Laplacian lacks a zero mode and exhibits a spectral gap. We find that upon closing this spectral gap by a modification of the Laplacian, the scalar field theories exhibit novel critical behavior in the form of non-trivial fixed points with critical exponents governed by $ζ$ and the spectral dimension $d_s=3$. In particular, our analysis indicates the presence of a Wilson-Fisher fixed point for the short range $ζ=1$ theory. In contrast, the nearest-neighbor Ising model on the Bethe lattice is known to exhibit mean-field critical exponents. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first evidence that a scalar $φ^4$ theory and the discrete Ising model on the same underlying lattice may lie in distinct universality classes."

While crucial to the analysis and prediction of many materials properties, the identification of hydrogen positions can however be difficult and expensive, as it is challenging in X-ray scattering experiments and often requires dedicated neutron scattering measurements. As a consequence, inorganic crystallographic databases frequently report lattice structures where hydrogen atoms have been either omitted or inserted with heuristics or by chemical intuition. Here, we combine diffusion models from the field of materials science with techniques originally developed in computer vision for image inpainting. We present how this knowledge transfer across domains enables a much faster and more accurate completion of host structures, compared to unconditioned diffusion models or previous approaches solely based on DFT. Overall, our approach exceeds a success rate of 97% in terms of finding a structural match or predicting a more stable configuration than the initial reference, when starting both from structures that were already relaxed with DFT, or directly from the experimentally determined host structures."

    "abstract": "The nature of the central engine powering short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers remains a key open question in the era of multi-messenger astronomy. The ergostar hypothesis, that a rapidly rotating star with an ergoregion drives the relativistic jet, offers an alternative explanation to the black hole-accretion disk paradigm. However, previous studies based on conventional neutron star equations of state (EOSs) have shown that dynamically stable ergostars do not exist unless very extreme EOS or rotation are adopted, casting significant doubt on their astrophysical viability in reality. In this work, however, we examine this hypothesis using a phenomenological EOS of strangeon matter, i.e., condensed matter with nucleon-like units for three flavors of quarks. By constructing a large suite of uniformly rotating equilibrium models, we systematically investigate the parameter space of the stable ergostars and calculate their maximum extractable energy. In contrast to the case of conventional EOSs, we demonstrate that strangeon matter supports a vast and robust parameter space for dynamically stable ergostars, even without requiring differential rotation. We find that the extractable rotational energy from these configurations can be on the order of $0.01 M_\\odot$, a reservoir sufficient to power a typical sGRB. Our results revitalize the ergostar as a viable central engine for sGRB, suggesting that BNS merger remnants composed of exotic matter could play a crucial, previously underestimated role in high-energy astrophysics."

    "abstract": "Diffusion policies (DP) have recently shown great promise for generating actions in robotic manipulation. However, existing approaches often rely on global instructions to produce short-term control signals, which can result in misalignment in action generation. We conjecture that the primitive skills, referred to as fine-grained, short-horizon manipulations, such as ``move up'' and ``open the gripper'', provide a more intuitive and effective interface for robot learning. To bridge this gap, we propose SDP, a skill-conditioned DP that integrates interpretable skill learning with conditional action planning. SDP abstracts eight reusable primitive skills across tasks and employs a vision-language model to extract discrete representations from visual observations and language instructions. Based on them, a lightweight router network is designed to assign a desired primitive skill for each state, which helps construct a single-skill policy to generate skill-aligned actions. By decomposing complex tasks into a sequence of primitive skills and selecting a single-skill policy, SDP ensures skill-consistent behavior across diverse tasks. Extensive experiments on two challenging simulation benchmarks and real-world robot deployments demonstrate that SDP consistently outperforms SOTA methods, providing a new paradigm for skill-based robot learning with diffusion policies."

Unlike standard algorithms that treat dimensions uniformly, MCGI modulates its beam search budget based on in situ geometric analysis, eliminating dependency on static hyperparameters. Theoretical analysis confirms that MCGI enables improved approximation guarantees by preserving manifold-consistent topological connectivity. Empirically, MCGI achieves 5.8$\\times$ higher throughput at 95\\% recall on high-dimensional GIST1M compared to state-of-the-art DiskANN.

Despite extensive empirical observations, it remains unclear which features of degenerate ground states are preferentially sampled and why by QA. Here we analyze the final states using degenerate perturbation theory to characterize the preference among them. In this analysis, the adjacency matrix of the graph composed by the ground states naturally emerges, and we can predict the eigenvector centralities (one of the node centralities) are related to the probabilities of these states. We verify this prediction on toy models where degeneracy is lifted at first and second order, and we show that second-order weights encode local barrier information, relating sampling fairness to the flatness of the local energy landscape. Finally, this perspective suggests two practical routes toward fair sampling -- promoting connectivity of the graph and reducing heterogeneity of centralities -- and we illustrate consistency with higher-order drivers and minor-embedding transformations."

This study focuses on hidden information extraction under undetermined signal bits, revealing that most such QPQ protocols face severe security threats even without complex quantum resources. Specifically, direct observation attack causes incremental information leakage, while the minimum error discrimination attack efficiently steals additional database inforamtion. To address these critical flaws, the proposed multi-encryption defense scheme is compatible with existing QPQ protocols. The study demonstrates the necessity of the multi-encryption strategy for the security of databases in QPQ, providing key theoretical and technical support for constructing practical QPQ protocols resistant to real-world attacks."

In addition, three faint pulsars that were also missed by FFT-based searches were successfully detected using FFA. These discoveries demonstrate the critical role of FFA in uncovering faint, long-period, and sporadic pulsars, and highlight the significant potential of FAST archival data, especially when combined with longer integration times and complementary search techniques, to reveal rare and weak pulsar populations."

In this work, we formalize the notion of targeted feature-dependent noise and propose several variants like trajectory feature noise, trajectory similarity noise, uncertainty-aware noise, and Language Model noise. We evaluate feature-dependent noise, where noise is correlated with certain features in complex continuous control tasks from DMControl and Meta-world. Our experiments show that in some feature-dependent noise settings, the state-of-the-art noise-robust PbRL method's learning performance is significantly deteriorated, while PbRL method with no explicit denoising can surprisingly outperform noise-robust PbRL in majority settings. We also find language model's noise exhibits similar characteristics to feature-dependent noise, thereby simulating realistic humans and call for further study in learning with feature-dependent noise robustly."

However, noisy or irrelevant documents are often introduced during RAG, potentially degrading performance and even causing hallucinated outputs. While various methods have been proposed to filter out such noise, we argue that identifying irrelevant information from retrieved content is inherently difficult and limited number of transformer layers can hardly solve this. Consequently, retrievers fail to filter out irrelevant documents entirely. Therefore, LLMs must be robust against such noise, but we demonstrate that standard fine-tuning approaches are often ineffective in enabling the model to selectively utilize relevant information while ignoring irrelevant content due to the structural constraints of attention patterns. To address this, we propose a novel fine-tuning method designed to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information within retrieved documents. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our approach significantly improves the robustness and performance of LLMs."

A spin supersolid is characterized by the coexistence of longitudinal spin order that breaks lattice translational symmetry and transverse spin order associated with the spontaneous breaking of a spin U(1) symmetry. Extensive experimental investigations, together with advanced numerical studies, have now revealed a coherent and internally consistent picture of these phases, substantially deepening our understanding of supersolidity in quantum magnetic materials. Beyond their fundamental interest as exotic quantum states, potential applications in highly efficient demagnetization cooling have been supported by a giant magnetocaloric effect observed in candidate materials. Moreover, the possible dissipationless spin supercurrents could open promising perspectives for spin transport and spintronic applications. In this Review, we summarize recent progress on emergent spin supersolids in frustrated triangular-lattice quantum antiferromagnets. We survey experimental evidence from thermodynamic and spectroscopic measurements and compare these results with theoretical studies of minimal models addressing global phase diagrams, ground state properties, and collective excitations. In addition, we discuss characteristic spin-transport phenomena and outline future directions for exploring spin supersolids as functional quantum materials."

Prior work has attributed this evaluation-deployment gap to problems of measurement and validity. While these critiques are insightful, we argue that they overlook a more fundamental issue: many socio-cognitive evaluations proceed without an explicit theoretical specification of the target capability, leaving the assumptions linking task performance to competence implicit. Without this theoretical grounding, benchmarks that exercise only narrow subsets of a capability are routinely misinterpreted as evidence of broad competence: a gap that creates a systemic validity illusion by masking the failure to evaluate the capability's other essential dimensions. To address this gap, we make two contributions. First, we diagnose and formalize this theory gap as a foundational failure that undermines measurement and enables systematic overgeneralization of benchmark results. Second, we introduce the Theory Trace Card (TTC), a lightweight documentation artifact designed to accompany socio-cognitive evaluations, which explicitly outlines the theoretical basis of an evaluation, the components of the target capability it exercises, its operationalization, and its limitations. We argue that TTCs enhance the interpretability and reuse of socio-cognitive evaluations by making explicit the full validity chain, which links theory, task operationalization, scoring, and limitations, without modifying benchmarks or requiring agreement on a single theory."

In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon from a function-class perspective. We show that sufficiently expressive, unstructured variational ansatze enter a Haar-like universality class in which both observable expectation values and parameter gradients concentrate exponentially with system size. As a consequence, the hypothesis class induced by such circuits collapses with high probability to a narrow family of near-constant functions, a phenomenon we term simplicity bias, with barren plateaus arising as a consequence rather than the root cause. Using tools from random matrix theory and concentration of measure, we rigorously characterize this universality class and establish uniform hypothesis-class collapse over finite datasets. We further show that this collapse is not unavoidable: tensor-structured VQCs, including tensor-network-based and tensor-hypernetwork parameterizations, lie outside the Haar-like universality class. By restricting the accessible unitary ensemble through bounded tensor rank or bond dimension, these architectures prevent concentration of measure, preserve output variability for local observables, and retain non-degenerate gradient signals even in over-parameterized regimes. Together, our results unify barren plateaus, expressivity limits, and generalization collapse under a single structural mechanism rooted in random-matrix universality, highlighting the central role of architectural inductive bias in variational quantum algorithms."

    "abstract": "Existing text-driven infrared and visible image fusion approaches often rely on textual information at the sentence level, which can lead to semantic noise from redundant text and fail to fully exploit the deeper semantic value of textual information. To address these issues, we propose a novel fusion approach named Entity-Guided Multi-Task learning for infrared and visible image fusion (EGMT). Our approach includes three key innovative components: (i) A principled method is proposed to extract entity-level textual information from image captions generated by large vision-language models, eliminating semantic noise from raw text while preserving critical semantic information; (ii) A parallel multi-task learning architecture is constructed, which integrates image fusion with a multi-label classification task. By using entities as pseudo-labels, the multi-label classification task provides semantic supervision, enabling the model to achieve a deeper understanding of image content and significantly improving the quality and semantic density of the fused image; (iii) An entity-guided cross-modal interactive module is also developed to facilitate the fine-grained interaction between visual and entity-level textual features, which enhances feature representation by capturing cross-modal dependencies at both inter-visual and visual-entity levels. To promote the wide application of the entity-guided image fusion framework, we release the entity-annotated version of four public datasets (i.e., TNO, RoadScene, M3FD, and MSRS). Extensive experiments demonstrate that EGMT achieves superior performance in preserving salient targets, texture details, and semantic consistency, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "To develop a reliable AI for psychological assessment, we introduce \\texttt{PsychEval}, a multi-session, multi-therapy, and highly realistic benchmark designed to address three key challenges: \\textbf{1) Can we train a highly realistic AI counselor?} Realistic counseling is a longitudinal task requiring sustained memory and dynamic goal tracking. We propose a multi-session benchmark (spanning 6-10 sessions across three distinct stages) that demands critical capabilities such as memory continuity, adaptive reasoning, and longitudinal planning. The dataset is annotated with extensive professional skills, comprising over 677 meta-skills and 4577 atomic skills. \\textbf{2) How to train a multi-therapy AI counselor?} While existing models often focus on a single therapy, complex cases frequently require flexible strategies among various therapies. We construct a diverse dataset covering five therapeutic modalities (Psychodynamic, Behaviorism, CBT, Humanistic Existentialist, and Postmodernist) alongside an integrative therapy with a unified three-stage clinical framework across six core psychological topics. \\textbf{3) How to systematically evaluate an AI counselor?} We establish a holistic evaluation framework with 18 therapy-specific and therapy-shared metrics across Client-Level and Counselor-Level dimensions. To support this, we also construct over 2,000 diverse client profiles. Extensive experimental analysis fully validates the superior quality and clinical fidelity of our dataset. Crucially, \\texttt{PsychEval} transcends static benchmarking to serve as a high-fidelity reinforcement learning environment that enables the self-evolutionary training of clinically responsible and adaptive AI counselors."

However, miniaturization below deep-subwavelength scales (< 1/50 wavelength) remain challenging due to weak light-matter interaction, which degrades responsivity and polarization sensitivity. Here, we present a graphene plasmon polariton atomic cavity (PPAC) monolithic detector that overcomes this limitation by maintaining and even enhancing performance at a deep-subwavelength channel length of just 2 micrometers (1/60 wavelength). The device integrates graphene rectangle PPAC arrays with dissimilar metal contacts, where graphene functions as both absorber and conductor, simplifying the architecture. Exploiting plasmon polariton resonances and the photothermoelectric (PTE) effect, the detector achieves polarization-sensitive, frequency-selective, and fast THz detection spanning 0.53 to 4.24 THz with a polarization ratio of 93, featuring a responsivity (RV) of 1007 V/W, a noise-equivalent power (NEP) of 16 pW/Hz^0.5, a specific detectivity (D*) of 2.9 x 10^7 Jones, and a response time of 230 ps. We further demonstrate monolithic integration for polarization imaging and non-destructive semiconductor chip inspection, advancing room-temperature, compact, and polarization-sensitive THz technologies."

    "abstract": "Federated learning is a privacy-focused approach towards machine learning where models are trained on client devices with locally available data and aggregated at a central server. However, the dependence on a single central server is challenging in the case of a large number of clients and even poses the risk of a single point of failure. To address these critical limitations of scalability and fault-tolerance, we present a distributed approach to federated learning comprising multiple servers with inter-server communication capabilities. While providing a fully decentralized approach, the designed framework retains the core federated learning structure where each server is associated with a disjoint set of clients with server-client communication capabilities. We propose a novel DFL (Distributed Federated Learning) algorithm which uses alternating periods of local training on the client data followed by global training among servers. We show that the DFL algorithm, under a suitable choice of parameters, ensures that all the servers converge to a common model value within a small tolerance of the ideal model, thus exhibiting effective integration of local and global training models. Finally, we illustrate our theoretical claims through numerical simulations."

We demonstrate that this gradient can be efficiently computed using vector-Jacobian products (VJP) within standard automatic differentiation frameworks, enabling the optimization of complex networks under global resource constraints. Numerical experiments on both linear multipath DAGs and nonlinear channels validate the proposed framework; the results confirm that the estimator, utilizing score functions learned via denoising score matching, accurately reproduces ground-truth gradients and successfully maximizes end-to-end mutual information. Beyond maximization, we extend our score-based framework to a novel unsupervised paradigm: digital twin calibration via Fisher divergence minimization."

Recent advances in quantum computing, spanning quantum annealing, variational algorithms, and hybrid quantum classical optimization, have opened new opportunities to accelerate UC solution processes by exploiting quantum parallelism and entanglement. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of existing research on the applications of quantum computing for solving the UC problem. The reviewed works are categorized based on the employed quantum paradigms, including annealing-based, variational hybrid, quantum machine learning, and quantum-inspired methods.

The sum rate maximization problem is then formulated by jointly optimizing the active and passive beamforming matrices and sparsity of connected element array. For the special cases of a single user equipment (UE) and two UEs, the optimal sparsity designs are derived in closed-form. Then, for an arbitrary number of UEs, a weighted minimum mean-square error-based alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed to tackle the non-convex optimization problem.

Our result show that for the non-rotating case, the shadow remains perfectly circular, with its radius independent of the deformation parameter. For the rotating case, the size of the shadow decreases as the deformation parameter decreases, and the shape of the shadow gradually becomes more flattened. It is worth noting that while the shadow of a rotating black hole remains north-south symmetric for equatorial observers, this symmetry is broken once the observer moves away from the equatorial plane. For an observer in the northern hemisphere, the geometric center of the shadow shifts northward when $D_0<0$ and southward when $D_0>0$, while the opposite behavior occurs for observers in the southern hemisphere. These features in the black hole shadow originating from the scalar field could help us to understand the circular disformal Kerr black hole and generalized scalar-tensor framework of Horndeski gravity."

This finding has motivated the search for nearby neutron stars in the Solar neighborhood. In a recent study, a candidate for one of the closest neutron stars to Earth, LAMOST J235456.73+335625.9 (hereafter J2354), was reported. Based on dynamical mass measurements under different inclination angle assumptions, the inferred mass range for the unseen compact companion in the system is $1.4$--$1.6$ $M_{\\odot}$. Hence, the unseen companion in J2354 is either a massive cold white dwarf or a neutron star. Here we model the flux variations of J2354 as a combination of ellipsoidal modulation and surface spots. We test both cold spot and hot spot models, setting the number of spots to two in each case, and constrain the spot properties through light curve fitting. In the cold spot scenario, the spots are mostly visible at phases $0.5$--$0.75$, whereas in the hot spot scenario, the spots appear predominantly at phases $0.25$--$0.5$. The hot spot model shows better agreement with the observed H$α$ phase variation than the cold spot model. Furthermore, the thermal radiation of a massive but cold white dwarf cannot produce the level of localized heating required to explain the hot spot unless additional heating mechanisms are involved; in contrast, a neutron star can naturally provide such heating through energetic winds. Our results are consistent with the neutron star interpretation of the compact object in J2354."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without direct data sharing, yet it remains vulnerable to privacy attacks such as model inversion and membership inference. Existing differential privacy (DP) solutions for FL often inject noise uniformly across the entire model, degrading utility while providing suboptimal privacy-utility tradeoffs. To address this, we propose LaDP, a novel layer-wise adaptive noise injection mechanism for FL that optimizes privacy protection while preserving model accuracy. LaDP leverages two key insights: (1) neural network layers contribute unevenly to model utility, and (2) layer-wise privacy leakage can be quantified via KL divergence between local and global model distributions. LaDP dynamically injects noise into selected layers based on their privacy sensitivity and importance to model performance. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, proving that LaDP satisfies $(ε, δ)$-DP guarantees and converges under bounded noise. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100 datasets demonstrate that LaDP reduces noise injection by 46.14% on average compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while improving accuracy by 102.99%. Under the same privacy budget, LaDP outperforms SOTA solutions like Dynamic Privacy Allocation LDP and AdapLDP by 25.18% and 6.1% in accuracy, respectively. Additionally, LaDP robustly defends against reconstruction attacks, increasing the FID of the reconstructed private data by $>$12.84% compared to all baselines. Our work advances the practical deployment of privacy-preserving FL with minimal utility loss."

The method uses a magnetic-field-gradient--induced tilt of the trapping potential to accelerate cooling in the unitarity-limited regime. In evaporation based only on lowering the optical trap depth, the unitarity-limited scattering cross section can support runaway cooling; however, the cooling rate slows around $T/T_F \\simeq 0.5$, and the runaway behavior is no longer maintained. We improve on this approach by applying a magnetic-field gradient when the gas temperature reaches about half the Fermi temperature. The induced tilt opens an escape channel for energetic atoms while keeping the trap frequencies nearly unchanged. This modification increases the cooling speed and cools the gas below the superfluid transition temperature, reaching $T/T_F = 0.16$ on a timescale of $\\sim 25\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.

For merely integrable kernel functions, the scheme preserves the positivity, total mass, and entropy structure. The existence of a discrete solution and its convergence to a solution to the continuous problem, as the mesh size tends to zero, are shown. A key difficulty is the degeneracy of the generalized Bernoulli function in the Scharfetter-Gummel approximation. This issue is overcome by proving a uniform estimate for the discrete Fisher information, which requires both the Boltzmann and Rao entropy inequalities. Numerical simulations illustrate the features of the scheme in one and two space dimensions."

Different modes of oscillations are frequently observed in solar prominences/filaments, and prominence seismology helps estimate important physical parameters like the magnetic field strength. Although the simultaneous detection of longitudinal and transverse oscillations in the same filament is not common, such rare observations provide a unique opportunity to constrain the physical parameters of interest. Aims. In this study, we aim to estimate the physical parameters of prominences undergoing simultaneous longitudinal and transverse oscillations. Methods. We apply Bayesian seismology techniques to observations of longitudinal and transverse filament oscillations to infer the magnetic field strength, the length, and the number of twists in the flux tube holding the prominence plasma. We first use the observations of longitudinal oscillations and the pendulum model to infer the posterior probability density for the magnetic field strength. The obtained marginal posterior of the magnetic field, combined with the observations of the transverse oscillations, is then used to estimate the probable values of the length of the magnetic flux tube that supports the filament material using Bayesian inference. This estimated length is used to compute the number of twists in the flux tube. Results. For the prominences under study, we find that the length of the flux tubes supporting the quiescent prominences can be very large (from 100 to 1000 Mm) and the number of twists in the flux tube are not more than three. Conclusions. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian analysis offers valuable methods to perform parameter inference in the context of prominence seismology."

    "abstract": "Autonomous AI agents executing multi-step tool sequences face semantic attacks that manifest in behavioral traces rather than isolated prompts. A critical challenge is cross-attack generalization: can detectors trained on known attack families recognize novel, unseen attack types? We discover that standard conversational tokenization -- capturing linguistic patterns from agent interactions -- fails catastrophically on structural attacks like tool hijacking (AUC 0.39) and data exfiltration (AUC 0.46), while succeeding on linguistic attacks like social engineering (AUC 0.78). We introduce structural tokenization, encoding execution-flow patterns (tool calls, arguments, observations) rather than conversational content. This simple representational change dramatically improves cross-attack generalization: +46 AUC points on tool hijacking, +39 points on data exfiltration, and +71 points on unknown attacks, while simultaneously improving in-distribution performance (+6 points). For attacks requiring linguistic features, we propose gated multi-view fusion that adaptively combines both representations, achieving AUC 0.89 on social engineering without sacrificing structural attack detection. Our findings reveal that AI agent security is fundamentally a structural problem: attack semantics reside in execution patterns, not surface language. While our rule-based tokenizer serves as a baseline, the structural abstraction principle generalizes even with simple implementation."

    "abstract": "This paper studies a two-phase free boundary problem governed by the ElectroHydroDynamic equations, which describes a perfectly conducting, incompressible, irrotational fluid with gravity, surrounded by a dielectric gas. The interface separating fluid and gas is referred to as the free boundary. It is known that the free surface remains smooth away from the stagnation points, where the relative velocity of the incompressible fluid vanishes. In the presence of gravity, the Stokes conjecture, proved by Varvaruca and Weiss [Acta. Math. 206, 363-403, (2011)], implies that the corner type singularity will occur in the one-phase incompressible fluid. It is natural to ask whether this conjecture still holds in the two-phase flow problem. As a consequence, the primary objective of this work is to characterize the possible singular profiles of the free interface near the stagnation points in the presence of an electric field. Our main result is the discovery of a critical decay rate of the electric field near the stagnation points which indicates the classification of the singular profiles of the free surface. More precisely, we showed that when the decay rate of the electric field is faster than the critical decay rate, its negligible effect implies that the singular profile must be the well-known Stokes corner. When the electric field decays as the critical decay rate, the symmetry of the corner region may be broken, giving rise to either a Stokes corner or an asymmetric corner as the possible singular profile. If the decay rate is slower than the critical decay rate, the electric field dominates and completely destroys the corner structure, resulting in a cusp singularity. The analysis of these singularities relies on variational principles and geometric methods. Key technical tools include a Weiss-type monotonicity formula, a frequency formula, and a concentration-compactness argument."

    "abstract": "Language models (LMs) are trained on billions of tokens in an attempt to recover the true language distribution. Still, vanilla random sampling from LMs yields low quality generations. Decoding algorithms attempt to restrict the LM distribution to a set of high-probability continuations, but rely on greedy heuristics that introduce myopic distortions, yielding sentences that are homogeneous, repetitive and incoherent. In this paper, we introduce EPIC, a hyperparameter-free decoding approach that incorporates the entropy of future trajectories into LM decoding. EPIC explicitly regulates the amount of uncertainty expressed at every step of generation, aligning the sampling distribution's entropy to the aleatoric (data) uncertainty. Through Entropy-Aware Lazy Gumbel-Max sampling, EPIC manages to be exact, while also being efficient, requiring only a sublinear number of entropy evaluations per step. Unlike current baselines, EPIC yields sampling distributions that are empirically well-aligned with the entropy of the underlying data distribution. Across creative writing and summarization tasks, EPIC consistently improves LM-as-judge preference win-rates over widely used decoding strategies. These preference gains are complemented by automatic metrics, showing that EPIC produces more diverse generations and more faithful summaries. We also evaluate EPIC on mathematical reasoning, where it outperforms all baselines."

While both nickelates exhibit density-wave (DW) transitions accompanied by the opening of a quasiparticle relaxation bottleneck, their electronic responses display strikingly different symmetry properties. La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ maintains an isotropic optical response across the entire temperature range. In contrast, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ exhibits a pronounced twofold ($C_2$) anisotropy in its low-temperature electronic dynamics. This electronic nematicity, evident in both the relaxation dynamics and the effective gap scales, competes with a secondary isotropic order emerging below 115 K. The presence of macroscopic electronic anisotropy in the bilayer system, and its absence in the trilayer system, suggests an intimate relation between electronic nematic fluctuations and superconducting pairing in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ that worth for deeper explorations."

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection is increasingly becoming crucial for maintaining the safety, reliability, and efficiency of industrial systems. Recently, with the advent of digital twins and data-driven decision-making, several statistical and machine-learning methods have been proposed. However, these methods face several challenges, such as dependence on only real sensor datasets, limited labeled data, high false alarm rates, and privacy concerns. To address these problems, we propose a suite of digital twin-integrated federated learning (DTFL) methods that enhance global model performance while preserving data privacy and communication efficiency. Specifically, we present five novel approaches: Digital Twin-Based Meta-Learning (DTML), Federated Parameter Fusion (FPF), Layer-wise Parameter Exchange (LPE), Cyclic Weight Adaptation (CWA), and Digital Twin Knowledge Distillation (DTKD). Each method introduces a unique mechanism to combine synthetic and real-world knowledge, balancing generalization with communication overhead. We conduct an extensive experiment using a publicly available cyber-physical anomaly detection dataset. For a target accuracy of 80%, CWA reaches the target in 33 rounds, FPF in 41 rounds, LPE in 48 rounds, and DTML in 87 rounds, whereas the standard FedAvg baseline and DTKD do not reach the target within 100 rounds. These results highlight substantial communication-efficiency gains (up to 62% fewer rounds than DTML and 31% fewer than LPE) and demonstrate that integrating DT knowledge into FL accelerates convergence to operationally meaningful accuracy thresholds for IIoT anomaly detection."

Working in the geodesic approximation, we find analytic continuations that probe the interior of rotating and charged black holes. These generate contributions from timelike geodesics that thread the interior and emerge in a future universe. We implement these continuations on the momentum space two-point function and exemplify this in several black hole backgrounds. We also identify position space analytic continuations achieving the same task that incorporate different continued momentum space correlators. These correspond to non-perturbative corrections to the WKB approximation. We demonstrate this explicitly in the rotating BTZ black hole by showing that the interior geodesics contribute to the continued position space correlator and motivate a picture for how these contributions arise in higher dimensions. For AdS Schwarzschild, we identify the analytically continued solution that captures the bouncing geodesic. We discuss the possibility of using these continuations to probe the instability of inner horizons from the boundary."

    "abstract": "Companies regularly have to contend with multi-release systems, where several versions of the same software are in operation simultaneously. Question answering over documents from multi-release systems poses challenges because different releases have distinct yet overlapping documentation. Motivated by the observed inaccuracy of state-of-the-art question-answering techniques on multi-release system documents, we propose QAMR, a chatbot designed to answer questions across multi-release system documentation. QAMR enhances traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ensure accuracy in the face of highly similar yet distinct documentation for different releases. It achieves this through a novel combination of pre-processing, query rewriting, and context selection. In addition, QAMR employs a dual-chunking strategy to enable separately tuned chunk sizes for retrieval and answer generation, improving overall question-answering accuracy. We evaluate QAMR using a public software-engineering benchmark as well as a collection of real-world, multi-release system documents from our industry partner, Ciena. Our evaluation yields five main findings: (1) QAMR outperforms a baseline RAG-based chatbot, achieving an average answer correctness of 88.5% and an average retrieval accuracy of 90%, which correspond to improvements of 16.5% and 12%, respectively. (2) An ablation study shows that QAMR's mechanisms for handling multi-release documents directly improve answer accuracy. (3) Compared to its component-ablated variants, QAMR achieves a 19.6% average gain in answer correctness and a 14.0% average gain in retrieval accuracy over the best ablation. (4) QAMR reduces response time by 8% on average relative to the baseline. (5) The automatically computed accuracy metrics used in our evaluation strongly correlate with expert human assessments, validating the reliability of our methodology."

    "abstract": "With a view to identifying and understanding the linear receptivity and amplification mechanisms that underpin laminar-to-turbulent transition over blunt bodies in hypersonic flow, we use resolvent analysis to study the flow over a blunt cone with 7° half-angle at Mach number $M_{\\infty} = 6$, zero angle of attack, and nose-radius-based Reynolds number $Re_{R_n} = 90000$. Optimal forcing and responses are obtained for frequencies up to 330 kHz and azimuthal wavenumbers between 0 and 200. Wall-temperature effects are accounted for by considering both isothermal ($T_w =$ 300 K) and adiabatic wall conditions. The resolvent analysis shows that stationary streak modes are the most amplified in the isothermal case, followed by entropy-layer modes between 20 and 140 kHz. In the adiabatic case, the $1^{st}$ Mack mode is the most amplified. The entropy layer, caused by the nose-tip bluntness, has a profound influence on the receptivity structures. For the optimal streak mode, the most intense receptivity structures lie deep in the entropy layer, further away from the boundary-layer edge compared to the equivalent sharp-cone streak mode. This indicates that atmospheric disturbances may excite streak-like instability without fully penetrating the boundary layer. For the entropy-layer modes, the dominant receptivity and fluctuation signatures are located within the entropy layer. An energy-budget analysis reveals that these modes are most susceptible to kinetic disturbances and they sign the most on temperature fluctuations. These modes are found to leverage a temperature mixing mechanism that exploits the baseflow's wall-normal temperature gradient in the entropy layer to grow."

Here, we provide a systematic study of fabrication and measurement techniques to remove external artifacts in photoelectronic responses. This reveals a previously hidden photothermoelectric response in the transverse photoresistivity of symmetric thin films of simple metals.

However, contactless images often show degraded ridge clarity due to illumination variation, subcutaneous skin discoloration, and specular reflections. Flash captures preserve ridge detail but introduce noise, whereas non-flash captures reduce noise but lower ridge contrast. We propose Fusion2Print (F2P), the first framework to systematically capture and fuse paired flash-non-flash contactless fingerprints. We construct a custom paired dataset, FNF Database, and perform manual flash-non-flash subtraction to isolate ridge-preserving signals. A lightweight attention-based fusion network also integrates both modalities, emphasizing informative channels and suppressing noise, and then a U-Net enhancement module produces an optimally weighted grayscale image. Finally, a deep embedding model with cross-domain compatibility, generates discriminative and robust representations in a unified embedding space compatible with both contactless and contact-based fingerprints for verification. F2P enhances ridge clarity and achieves superior recognition performance (AUC=0.999, EER=1.12%) over single-capture baselines (Verifinger, DeepPrint)."

However, in case of flood mapping using Sen1Flood11 dataset as a downstream task, GFMs struggles to outperform the baseline U-Net, highlighting model's limitation in capturing critical local nuances. To address this, we present the Prithvi-Complementary Adaptive Fusion Encoder (CAFE), which integrate Prithvi GFM pretrained encoder with a parallel CNN residual branch enhanced by Convolutional Attention Modules (CAM). Prithvi-CAFE enables fast and efficient fine-tuning through adapters in Prithvi and performs multi-scale, multi-level fusion with CNN features, capturing critical local details while preserving long-range dependencies. We achieve state-of-the-art results on two comprehensive flood mapping datasets: Sen1Flood11 and FloodPlanet. On Sen1Flood11 test data, Prithvi-CAFE (IoU 83.41) outperforms the original Prithvi (IoU 82.50) and other major GFMs (TerraMind 82.90, DOFA 81.54, spectralGPT: 81.02). The improvement is even more pronounced on the hold-out test site, where Prithvi-CAFE achieves an IoU of 81.37 compared to the baseline U-Net (70.57) and original Prithvi (72.42). On FloodPlanet, Prithvi-CAFE also surpasses the baseline U-Net and other GFMs, achieving an IoU of 64.70 compared to U-Net (60.14), Terramind (62.33), DOFA (59.15) and Prithvi 2.0 (61.91). Our proposed simple yet effective Prithvi-CAFE demonstrates strong potential for improving segmentation tasks where multi-channel and multi-modal data provide complementary information and local details are critical.

While \\textit{Chain-of-Thought} (CoT) prompting allows agents to generate human-readable reasoning traces, it remains unclear whether these traces are \\textbf{faithful} generative drivers of the model's output or merely \\textbf{post-hoc rationalizations}. We introduce \\textbf{Project Ariadne}, a novel XAI framework that utilizes Structural Causal Models (SCMs) and counterfactual logic to audit the causal integrity of agentic reasoning. Unlike existing interpretability methods that rely on surface-level textual similarity, Project Ariadne performs \\textbf{hard interventions} ($do$-calculus) on intermediate reasoning nodes -- systematically inverting logic, negating premises, and reversing factual claims -- to measure the \\textbf{Causal Sensitivity} ($φ$) of the terminal answer. Our empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals a persistent \\textit{Faithfulness Gap}. We define and detect a widespread failure mode termed \\textbf{Causal Decoupling}, where agents exhibit a violation density ($ρ$) of up to $0.77$ in factual and scientific domains. In these instances, agents arrive at identical conclusions despite contradictory internal logic, proving that their reasoning traces function as \"Reasoning Theater\" while decision-making is governed by latent parametric priors. Our findings suggest that current agentic architectures are inherently prone to unfaithful explanation, and we propose the Ariadne Score as a new benchmark for aligning stated logic with model action."

    "abstract": "Coding theory plays a crucial role in enabling reliable communication, storage, and computation. Classical approaches assume a worst-case adversarial model and ensure error correction and data recovery only when the number of honest nodes exceeds the number of adversarial ones by some margin. However, in some emerging decentralized applications, particularly in decentralized machine learning (DeML), participating nodes are rewarded for accepted contributions. This incentive structure naturally gives rise to rational adversaries who act strategically rather than behaving in purely malicious ways. In this paper, we first motivate the need for coding in the presence of rational adversaries, particularly in the context of outsourced computation in decentralized systems. We contrast this need with existing approaches and highlight their limitations. We then introduce the game of coding, a novel game-theoretic framework that extends coding theory to trust-minimized settings where honest nodes are not in the majority. Focusing on repetition coding, we highlight two key features of this framework: (1) the ability to achieve a non-zero probability of data recovery even when adversarial nodes are in the majority, and (2) Sybil resistance, i.e., the equilibrium remains unchanged even as the number of adversarial nodes increases. Finally, we explore scenarios in which the adversary's strategy is unknown and outline several open problems for future research."

These features include a transition in electrical resistivity from high-temperature, thermally activated behavior with a narrow gap at the Fermi level ($Δρ \\sim$ 20 meV) to a distinctive low-temperature plateau, as well as a surface-to-volume dependence of electrical resistivity at low temperatures. The topological nature of PuB$_6$ is further supported by the theoretical calculations, which show that GGA+$U$ is capable of capturing electronic, topological, and lattice properties of PuB$_6$ with much lower computational cost than DMFT."

From placement alone, without implementation details, we derive memory consumption and communication volume. Our predictions match published results exactly: ZeRO-3 uses 8x less memory than data parallelism at 1.5x communication cost, as reported in the original paper. We prove two conditions (gradient integrity, state consistency) are necessary and sufficient for distributed training to match single-device results, and provide composition rules for combining strategies safely. The framework unifies ZeRO Stages 1-3, Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP), tensor parallelism, and pipeline parallelism as instances with different placement choices."

The systematics are most notable for the six months before and after 2022 January, when EXPRES experienced larger temperature variations, and we see a systematic trough-to-peak amplitude of 2.8 m/s in the radial velocities. This is large enough to mimic or obscure planetary signatures. To isolate and correct these effects, we develop a suite of diagnostics that track two-dimensional échellogram shifts, scalings, and rotation, as well as line bisector spans (LBS) derived from laser frequency comb (LFC) lines. By combining these empirical tracers with instrument telemetry in a multi-dimensional regression, we reduce the EXPRES instrument trend traced with solar RVs from an RMS of 1.32 m/s to 0.43 m/s, a 67% improvement, and the aggregate of twelve chromospherically quiet stars show a 26% reduction in velocity scatter. Our injection-recovery simulations further demonstrate a doubling in sensitivity to low-amplitude planetary signals after correction. When applied to the stellar time series of $ρ$ Coronae Borealis ($ρ$CrB), the correction removes a spurious planet d signal, restoring the integrity of the data. These results highlight the need for long-term monitoring and multi-dimensional calibration diagnostics on the path toward true centimeter-per-second precision in next-generation EPRV instruments."

Otherwise, both higher-order triples $T_3$--(T) and connected quadruples (Q) are important in systems with strong static correlation. Reoptimization of the reference geometry for core-valence correlation increases the calculated TAE across the board, most pronouncedly so for second-row compounds with neighboring second-row atoms. %just slightly increases the calculated TAE for all species, but more pronouncedly so if strong static correlation is present, as well as for second-row compounds, again especially with neighboring second-row atoms. We present a first proposal for a `W5 theory' protocol and compare computed TAEs for the W4-08 benchmark with prior reference values. For some key second-row species, the new values represent nontrivial revisions.

Then, we undertake a systematic study of unital, Hermiticity-preserving maps that are equivariant under natural unitary group actions. Schwarz maps satisfy Kadison's inequality $Φ(X^\\ast X) \\geq Φ(X)^\\ast Φ(X)$ and form an intermediate class between positive and completely positive maps.

    "abstract": "The grand vision of enabling persistent, large-scale 3D visual geometry understanding is shackled by the irreconcilable demands of scalability and long-term stability. While offline models like VGGT achieve inspiring geometry capability, their batch-based nature renders them irrelevant for live systems. Streaming architectures, though the intended solution for live operation, have proven inadequate. Existing methods either fail to support truly infinite-horizon inputs or suffer from catastrophic drift over long sequences. We shatter this long-standing dilemma with InfiniteVGGT, a causal visual geometry transformer that operationalizes the concept of a rolling memory through a bounded yet adaptive and perpetually expressive KV cache. Capitalizing on this, we devise a training-free, attention-agnostic pruning strategy that intelligently discards obsolete information, effectively ``rolling'' the memory forward with each new frame. Fully compatible with FlashAttention, InfiniteVGGT finally alleviates the compromise, enabling infinite-horizon streaming while outperforming existing streaming methods in long-term stability. The ultimate test for such a system is its performance over a truly infinite horizon, a capability that has been impossible to rigorously validate due to the lack of extremely long-term, continuous benchmarks. To address this critical gap, we introduce the Long3D benchmark, which, for the first time, enables a rigorous evaluation of continuous 3D geometry estimation on sequences about 10,000 frames. This provides the definitive evaluation platform for future research in long-term 3D geometry understanding. Code is available at: https://github.com/AutoLab-SAI-SJTU/InfiniteVGGT"

    "abstract": "Stellar winds are a major source of uncertainty in understanding the life and deaths of massive stars. Across studies in the field, prescriptions for stellar winds differ substantially in both their physical assumptions and implementation, making them a dominant contributor to model-to-model variation. In this work, we present a systematic analysis of the physical assumptions underlying commonly adopted wind prescriptions for optically thin and optically thick winds of hot stars, as well as the winds of cool supergiants. Our analysis reveals substantial discrepancies across all regimes: predicted mass-loss rates for optically thin winds differ by more than an order of magnitude, while rates for cool supergiants vary by several orders of magnitude, with even wider uncertainties arising in extrapolation regimes beyond the Humphreys-Davidson limit. These disparities introduce significant ambiguity into the predicted formation of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, a problem further compounded by the inconsistent application of transition criteria. A central issue is the \"cool Wolf-Rayet problem\", a temperature regime where the classical electron-scattering Eddington factor ($Γ_{\\rm e}$) loses physical consistency. Because this factor is widely used to determine WR mass-loss rates, its failure forces models to rely on uncertain extrapolations and ad-hoc corrections. We conclude that the dominant stellar wind uncertainties arise from a mismatch between the physical assumptions in stellar wind models and the structure of the stars to which they are applied. Our framework clarifies the origins of current theoretical discrepancies and identifies the key physical bottlenecks that must be addressed to improve mass-loss modeling for massive stars."

    "abstract": "We propose a disorder-free one-dimensional single-particle Hamiltonian hosting an exact mobility edge (ME), placing the system outside the assumptions of no-go theorems regarding unbounded potentials. By applying a linear Stark potential selectively to one sublattice of a dimerized chain, we generate an effective Hamiltonian with unbounded, staggered hopping amplitudes. The unbounded nature of the hopping places the model outside the scope of the Simon-Spencer theorem, while the staggered scaling allows it to evade broader constraints on Jacobi matrices. We analytically derive the bulk spectrum in reciprocal space, identifying a sharp ME where the energy magnitude equals the inter-cell hopping strength. This edge separates a continuum of extended states from two distinct localized branches: a standard unbounded Wannier-Stark ladder and an anomalous bounded branch accumulating at the ME. The existence of extended states is supported by finite-size scaling of the inverse participation ratio up to system sizes $L \\sim 10^9$. Furthermore, we propose an experimental realization using photonic frequency synthetic dimensions. Our numerical results indicate that the ME is robust against potential experimental imperfections, including frequency detuning errors and photon loss, establishing a practical path for observing MEs in disorder-free systems."

This decomposition is further applied to derive results on local hyperbolicity, on inertness and non-inertness, on the gaps between rational inertness and local or integral inertness, and on the homotopy theory of smooth manifolds with transversally embedded spheres. In particular, in every dimension greater than three, there exist infinitely many finite $CW$-complexes, pairwise non-homotopy-equivalent, whose loop spaces retract off the loops of their lower skeletons rationally but not locally, and whose top cell attachments produce infinitely many new torsion homotopy groups with exponentially growing ranks."

In practice, practitioners often choose among (i) training a compact custom CNN from scratch, (ii) using a large pre-trained CNN as a fixed feature extractor, and (iii) performing transfer learning via partial or full fine-tuning of a pre-trained backbone. This report presents a controlled comparison of these three paradigms across five real-world image classification datasets spanning road-surface defect recognition, agricultural variety identification, fruit/leaf disease recognition, pedestrian walkway encroachment recognition, and unauthorized vehicle recognition. Models are evaluated using accuracy and macro F1-score, complemented by efficiency metrics including training time per epoch and parameter counts. The results show that transfer learning consistently yields the strongest predictive performance, while the custom CNN provides an attractive efficiency--accuracy trade-off, especially when compute and memory budgets are constrained."

When code coverage of software for embedded systems needs to be measured, conventional approaches quickly meet their limits. A commonly used approach involves instrumenting the source files with added code that collects and dumps coverage information during runtime. This inserted code usually relies on the existence of an operating and a file system to dump the collected data. These features are not available for bare-metal programs that are executed on embedded systems. To overcome this issue, we present NQC2, a plugin for QEMU.NQC2 extracts coverage information from QEMU during runtime and stores them into a file on the host machine. This approach is even compatible with modified QEMU versions and does not require target-software instrumentation. NQC2 outperforms a comparable approach from Xilinx by up to 8.5 x."

The crucial idea is that the use of the lower and the upper part of the cuts, respectively, leads to two different additions which are known in the literature as inf-addition and sup-addition. Moreover, the two resulting structures are conlinear spaces which at the same time are complete lattices with respect to the natural order. This admits the definition of pseudo-differences on the extended reals which also provide formulas for expressions like $(+\\infty) - (+\\infty)$, $(-\\infty) - (-\\infty)$. There are two major motivations: one is that proper and improper extended real-valued functions can be treated in a unified manner, the other that set-valued functions can often be represented by families of scalar functions which may include improper ones."

The IDA is focusing on data on first-time kidney-only transplantations in adult recipients from deceased donors between 2006 and 2016 and refers to data from 14,954 recipients and 9,964 donors across 25 tables. Investigated aspects include missing data patterns and structure, data consistency, and availability of event time data. Results show that missing data proportions vary widely, with some tables nearly complete while others have over 50% missing values. Missing data patterns are identified using a decision tree approach. An influx and outflux analysis demonstrates that some variables have high potential for imputing missing data, while others were less suitable for imputation. We identified 168 multi-sourced variables that are reported by multiple data providers in parallel leading to discrepancies for some variables but also providing opportunities for missing data imputation. Our findings on event time data demonstrate the importance of carefully selecting the variables used for event time analyses as results will strongly depend on this selection. In summary, our findings highlight the challenges when utilizing the TxReg data for research and provide recommendations for data preprocessing and analysis in future analyses."

We present a systematic factorial study investigating how Forecasting model choice, XAI method, LLM selection, and prompting strategy affect NLE quality. Our design spans four models (XGBoost (XGB), Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and SARIMAX - comparing black-box Machine-Learning (ML) against classical time-series approaches), three XAI conditions (SHAP, LIME, and a no-XAI baseline), three LLMs (GPT-4o, Llama-3-8B, DeepSeek-R1), and eight prompting strategies. Using G-Eval, an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation method, with dual LLM judges and four evaluation criteria, we evaluate 660 explanations for time-series forecasting. Our results suggest that: (1) XAI provides only small improvements over no-XAI baselines, and only for expert audiences; (2) LLM choice dominates all other factors, with DeepSeek-R1 outperforming GPT-4o and Llama-3; (3) we observe an interpretability paradox: in our setting, SARIMAX yielded lower NLE quality than ML models despite higher prediction accuracy; (4) zero-shot prompting is competitive with self-consistency at 7-times lower cost; and (5) chain-of-thought hurts rather than helps."

We present ARCADE (Arabic Radio Corpus for Audio Dialect Evaluation), the first Arabic speech dataset designed explicitly with city-level dialect granularity. The corpus comprises Arabic radio speech collected from streaming services across the Arab world. Our data pipeline captures 30-second segments from verified radio streams, encompassing both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and diverse dialectal speech. To ensure reliability, each clip was annotated by one to three native Arabic reviewers who assigned rich metadata, including emotion, speech type, dialect category, and a validity flag for dialect identification tasks. The resulting corpus comprises 6,907 annotations and 3,790 unique audio segments spanning 58 cities across 19 countries. These fine-grained annotations enable robust multi-task learning, serving as a benchmark for city-level dialect tagging.

However, practical deployment is severely hampered by the domain shift problem, where models trained in one environment fail to generalise to another. To overcome this, we propose a novel two-stage framework centred on a CSI-ResNet-A architecture. This model is pre-trained via self-supervised contrastive learning to learn domain-invariant representations and leverages lightweight Adapter modules for highly efficient fine-tuning. The resulting event sequence is then processed by a stateful counting machine to produce a final, stable occupancy estimate. We validate our framework extensively. On our WiFlow dataset, our unsupervised approach excels in a 10-shot learning scenario, achieving a final Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of just 0.44--a task where supervised baselines fail. To formally quantify robustness, we introduce the Generalisation Index (GI), on which our model scores near-perfectly, confirming its ability to generalise. Furthermore, our framework sets a new state-of-the-art public WiAR benchmark with 98.8\\% accuracy. Our ablation studies reveal the core strength of our design: adapter-based fine-tuning achieves performance within 1\\% of a full fine-tune (98.84\\% vs. 99.67\\%) while training 97.2\\% fewer parameters.

However, mainstream training paradigms face key challenges: Behavior Cloning is simple and effective through imitation but suffers from low behavioral diversity, while Reinforcement Learning is capable of discovering novel strategies through exploration but heavily relies on manually designed reward functions. To address the conflict between these two methods, we present CORE, a Code-based Inverse Self-Training Framework with Graph Expansion that bridges imitation and exploration, offering a novel training framework that promotes behavioral diversity while eliminating the reliance on manually reward design. Specifically, we introduce Semantic Code Abstraction to automatically infers reward functions from expert demonstrations without manual design. The inferred reward function, referred to as the Label Function, is executable code that verifies one key step within a task. Building on this, we propose Strategy Graph Expansion to enhance in-domain behavioral diversity, which constructs a multi-path graph called Strategy Graph that captures diverse valid solutions beyond expert demonstrations. Furthermore, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Extrapolation, which enriches out-of-domain behavioral diversity by utilizing both successful and failed trajectories to expand the task space. Experiments on Web and Android platforms demonstrate that CORE significantly improves both overall performance and generalization, highlighting its potential as a robust and generalizable training paradigm for building powerful virtual agents."

    "abstract": "Chromospheric heating is an important ingredient in the energy budget of the solar atmosphere, which is challenging to quantify from observations. By using 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the solar atmosphere combined with non-LTE spectral synthesis, we estimated chromospheric heating from synthetic spectra and studied the spectral and temporal signatures of heating events. We performed k-means clustering on the Mg II h, Ca II H, and Ca II 8542 Å lines to identify representative profiles associated with elevated chromospheric heating and studied their atmospheric stratification. We find that locations with the strongest chromospheric heating show spectral signatures with strong emission. Profiles with strong emission in the blue wing of the lines (blue grains) are created by upward-propagating shock waves and have an order of magnitude higher heating in the chromosphere than the ambient heating. Profiles with strong emission in the red wing (red grains) also display heating that is an order of magnitude stronger than the baseline, but these spectra do not show a characteristic atmospheric stratification. Spectra classified as blue grains have a consistent temporal evolution, which is an oscillating sawtooth pattern in the line core and emission in the blue wing. However, spectra classified as red grains did not show a consistent temporal signature: Red wing emission from the simulations can appear spontaneously or be associated with an oscillation. While red and blue grain profiles account for around 3% of our synthetic spectra, they account for more than 12% of the total chromospheric heating in these simulations. By comparing two quiet Sun simulations, we find that the prevalence of bright grains is influenced by the magnetic field configuration, with a unipolar configuration showing fewer bright grains and consequently a lower share of heating from such events."

The development of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the landscape of medicine and holds promise for improving health care quality and expanding access to medical information globally. However, existing LLMs are primarily trained on high-resource languages, limiting their applicability in global medical scenarios. To address this gap, we constructed GlobMed, a large multilingual medical dataset, containing over 500,000 entries spanning 12 languages, including four low-resource languages. Building on this, we established GlobMed-Bench, which systematically assesses 56 state-of-the-art proprietary and open-weight LLMs across multiple multilingual medical tasks, revealing significant performance disparities across languages, particularly for low-resource languages. Additionally, we introduced GlobMed-LLMs, a suite of multilingual medical LLMs trained on GlobMed, with parameters ranging from 1.7B to 8B. GlobMed-LLMs achieved an average performance improvement of over 40% relative to baseline models, with a more than threefold increase in performance on low-resource languages. Together, these resources provide an important foundation for advancing the equitable development and application of LLMs globally, enabling broader language communities to benefit from technological advances."

These systems are expected to handle large-scale deployments and high-density networks with diverse functionalities. As a result, there is an increasing demand for efficient and intelligent algorithms that can operate under uncertainty from both propagation environments and networking systems. Traditional optimization methods often depend on accurate theoretical models of data transmission, but in real-world NG scenarios, they suffer from high computational complexity in large-scale settings. Stochastic Optimization (SO) algorithms, designed to accommodate extremely high density and extensive network scalability, have emerged as a powerful solution for optimizing wireless networks. This includes various categories that range from model-based approaches to learning-based approaches. These techniques are capable of converging within a feasible time frame while addressing complex, large-scale optimization problems. However, there is currently limited research on SO applied for NG networks, especially the upcoming Sixth-Generation (6G). In this survey, we emphasize the relationship between NG systems and SO by eight open questions involving the background, key features, and lesson learned. Overall, our study starts by providing a detailed overview of both areas, covering fundamental and widely used SO techniques, spanning from single to multi-objective signal processing. Next, we explore how different algorithms can solve NG challenges, such as load balancing, optimizing energy efficiency, improving spectral efficiency, or handling multiple performance trade-offs. Lastly, we highlight the challenges in the current research and propose new directions for future studies."

    "abstract": "Although FFT-based methods are renowned for their numerical efficiency and stability, traditional discretizations fail to capture material interfaces that are not aligned with the grid, resulting in suboptimal accuracy. To address this issue, the work at hand introduces a novel FFT-based solver that achieves interface-conforming accuracy for three-dimensional mechanical problems. More precisely, we integrate the extended finite element (X-FEM) discretization into the FFT-based framework, leveraging its ability to resolve discontinuities via additional shape functions. We employ the modified abs(olute) enrichment and develop a preconditioner based on the concept of strongly stable GFEM, which mitigates the conditioning issues observed in traditional X-FEM implementations. Our computational studies demonstrate that the developed X-FFT solver achieves interface-conforming accuracy, numerical efficiency, and stability when solving three-dimensional linear elastic homogenization problems with smooth material interfaces."

Accordingly, we treat step-level hallucination judgments as local observations and introduce a cumulative prefix-level hallucination signal that tracks the global evolution of the reasoning state over the entire trajectory. Overall, our approach enables streaming hallucination detection in long CoT reasoning, providing real-time, interpretable evidence."

    "abstract": "Accurate identification of protein binding sites is crucial for understanding biomolecular interaction mechanisms and for the rational design of drug targets. Traditional predictive methods often struggle to balance prediction accuracy with computational efficiency when capturing complex spatial conformations. To address this challenge, we propose an Edge-aware Graph Attention Network (Edge-aware GAT) model for the fine-grained prediction of binding sites across various biomolecules, including proteins, DNA/RNA, ions, ligands, and lipids. Our method constructs atom-level graphs and integrates multidimensional structural features, including geometric descriptors, DSSP-derived secondary structure, and relative solvent accessibility (RSA), to generate spatially aware embedding vectors. By incorporating interatomic distances and directional vectors as edge features within the attention mechanism, the model significantly enhances its representation capacity. On benchmark datasets, our model achieves an ROC-AUC of 0.93 for protein-protein binding site prediction, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods. The use of directional tensor propagation and residue-level attention pooling further improves both binding site localization and the capture of local structural details. Visualizations using PyMOL confirm the model's practical utility and interpretability. To facilitate community access and application, we have deployed a publicly accessible web server at http://119.45.201.89:5000/. In summary, our approach offers a novel and efficient solution that balances prediction accuracy, generalization, and interpretability for identifying functional sites in proteins."

Up to details, the paper exploits known expressions and methods to solve the two intimately connected aspects of the description of the wave-particle interaction underlying ion cyclotron resonance heating. Two cases are presented: the case where the guiding centre motion is limited to just following magnetic field lines, and the extended case accounting for drifts away from magnetic surfaces but assuming axisymmetry. A limited set of analytical results is included. As combining wave and Fokker-Planck solving is the focus, the computation of the dielectric response for arbitrary distribution functions is illustrated as well."

We first leverage portrait video generation models embedded with extensive human priors to synthesize vivid singing avatars, providing reliable expression and emotion guidance. Subsequently, these facial features are transferred to the robot via semantic-oriented mapping functions that span a wide expression space. Furthermore, to quantitatively evaluate the emotional richness of robotic singing, we propose the Emotion Dynamic Range metric to measure the emotional breadth within the Valence-Arousal space, revealing that a broad emotional spectrum is crucial for appealing performances. Comprehensive experiments prove that our method achieves rich emotional expressions while maintaining lip-audio synchronization, significantly outperforming existing approaches."

It accounts for in-plane elastic wave propagation, while its associated instantaneous radiative term accounts for radiative losses in the surrounding medium. These objects are well-known for isotropic elasticity, with their space-time representations involving generalized functions. For anisotropic elasticity they were unknown. The paper presents a derivation using the Stroh formalism. Their Fourier representation rests exclusively on the so-called prelogarithmic Lagrangian factor $L(v)$, while their space-time form involves its derivative $p(v)=L'(v)$, the prelogarithmic impulsion function. A straightforward consequence is the reformulation of the stress in the Weertman model of steadily-moving dislocations in terms of $L(v)$. Special care being paid to the causality constraint, the theory covers indifferently subsonic, intersonic and supersonic regimes of motion. The theory proposed is suitable to phase-field-type Fourier-based numerical codes for planar systems of defects in anisotropic elastodynamics."

Artificial neuron devices and circuits have multiple operating modes and produce region-dependent nonlinear dynamics that are not captured by system analysis methods for linear systems, such as transfer functions, Fourier/Laplace transform, Bode diagram, etc. Thus, new tools are needed to evaluate the nonlinear behavior of neurons and to guide the design and optimization of artificial neuron implementations. Here we present a generalized bifurcation analysis framework based on nonlinear dynamical systems theory. A CMOS axon-hillock neuron, memristor neuron, and the FitzHugh-Nagumo biological neuron model are selected for demonstration. We evaluate Hopf bifurcation conditions to define the rest and firing domains in parameter space of the system, and predict the near-onset firing rate. The results are further compared with numerical simulations. The framework standardizes the analysis for various neuron models and physical realizations. It yields practical design and optimization guidelines for artificial neurons for neuromorphic computing systems, including parameter combinations to make a neuron fire/rest and to control the corresponding firing properties, e.g., firing rate and amplitude."

Linearization is achieved by a McCormick relaxation (that is, replacing the bilinear PDE term by a linear one and adding inequality constraints), combined with local averaging to reduce the number of inequalities. Optimization-based bound tightening allows us to tighten the relaxation and thus reduce the induced error. Combining this with a quantification of the discretization error and the propagated noise, we prove that the resulting discretization regularizes the inverse problem, thus leading to an overall convergent scheme. Numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical findings."

The aim of this article is to restore critical ideal-theoretic properties via the subtractive property. We first prove a subtractive analogue of Krull's existence theorem, guaranteeing the existence of $k$-prime ideals disjoint from multiplicative sets. We show that in arithmetic semirings, the distinction between $k$-irreducible and $k$-strongly irreducible ideals vanishes, a coherence that we show is preserved under localisation. We investigate the structural properties and coincidence phenomena among associated subclasses of $k$-ideals in Laskerian semirings, von Neumann regular semirings, unique factorisation semidomains, principal ideal semidomains, and weakly Noetherian semirings. Finally, within the framework of additively idempotent semirings, we tether subtractive ideal-theoretic structures to underlying order-theoretic constraints, thereby obtaining new characterizations of $k$-prime and $k$-semiprime ideals. In that process, we also establish that every absolutely $k$-prime ideal is $k$-prime and every $k$-maximal ideal is absolutely $k$-prime."

We prove that this implements Gradient Awakening: auxiliary gradients are exactly zero at initialization, then phase in naturally as weights grow -- providing an implicit warmup without hyperparameters. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with DenseNet-DS and ResNet-DS architectures demonstrate: (1) DenseNet-DS: +8.3% faster convergence on CIFAR-10 with comparable accuracy, (2) Hybrid approach: Combining LSUV with LION-DG achieves best accuracy (81.92% on CIFAR-10), (3) ResNet-DS: Positive speedup on CIFAR-100 (+11.3%) with side-tap auxiliary design.

Although this ballot format has desirable characteristics, there is a question of whether it is expressive enough for the agents. Kahng, Latifian, and Shah address this issue by adding intensities to the rankings. They introduce the ranking with intensities ballot format, where agents can use both $\\succ\\!\\!\\succ$ and $\\succ$ in their rankings to express intensive and normal preferences between consecutive alternatives in their rankings. While they focus on analyzing this ballot format in the utilitarian distortion framework, in this work, we look at the potential of using this ballot format from the metric distortion viewpoint. We design a class of voting rules coined Positional Scoring Matching rules, which can be used for different problems in the metric setting, and show that by solving a zero-sum game, we can find the optimal member of this class for our problem. This rule takes intensities into account and achieves a distortion lower than $3$. In addition, by proving a bound on the price of ignoring intensities, we show that we might lose a great deal in terms of distortion by not taking the intensities into account."

In this paper we analyze the stability and bifurcations of twisted solutions in the CL for the KM subjected to feedback control. In particular, it is shown that the twisted solutions exist and can be stabilized not only for nearest neighbor graphs but also for complete simple graphs. Moreover, the CL is shown to suffer bifurcations at which the twisted solutions becomes unstable and a stable one-parameter family of modulated or oscillating twisted solutions is born, depending on whether the phase-lag is zero or not.

Molecular dynamics simulations of aqueous NaCl solutions using the TIP4P/2005 water model and the Madrid-2019 ion parameters reveal a systematic increase in the liquid-vapor critical temperature and pressure with salt concentration, consistent with experimental trends. In contrast, confinement between parallel hydrophobic plates leads to a depression of the critical point. The critical temperature was determined from the Binder cumulant crossing in the NVT ensemble, using a recently developed method originally applied to an active Brownian particle system. The reliability of this approach was verified through complementary NPT simulations. We further demonstrate the pronounced sensitivity of the estimated critical point to the van der Waals cutoff distance, underscoring the importance of properly accounting for long-range interactions.

    "abstract": "Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a strong alternative to autoregressive models by enabling parallel text generation. To improve inference efficiency and KV-cache compatibility, prior work commonly adopts block-based diffusion, decoding tokens block by block. However, this paradigm suffers from a structural limitation that we term Boundary-Induced Context Truncation (BICT): undecoded tokens near block boundaries are forced to commit without access to nearby future context, even when such context could substantially reduce uncertainty. This limitation degrades decoding confidence and generation quality, especially for tasks requiring precise reasoning, such as mathematical problem solving and code generation. We propose Deferred Commitment Decoding (DCD), a novel, training-free decoding strategy that mitigates this issue. DCD maintains a confidence-aware sliding window over masked tokens, resolving low-uncertainty tokens early while deferring high-uncertainty tokens until sufficient contextual evidence becomes available. This design enables effective bidirectional information flow within the decoding window without sacrificing efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple diffusion language models, benchmarks, and caching configurations show that DCD improves generation accuracy by 1.39% with comparable time on average compared to fixed block-based diffusion methods, with the most significant improvement reaching 9.0%. These results demonstrate that deferring token commitment based on uncertainty is a simple yet effective principle for improving both the quality and efficiency of diffusion language model decoding."

Building upon our prior MDAgent, we present MDAgent2, the first end-to-end framework capable of performing both knowledge Q&A and code generation within the MD domain. We construct a domain-specific data-construction pipeline that yields three high-quality datasets spanning MD knowledge, question answering, and code generation. Based on these datasets, we adopt a three stage post-training strategy--continued pre-training (CPT), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning (RL)--to train two domain-adapted models, MD-Instruct and MD-Code. Furthermore, we introduce MD-GRPO, a closed-loop RL method that leverages simulation outcomes as reward signals and recycles low-reward trajectories for continual refinement. We further build MDAgent2-RUNTIME, a deployable multi-agent system that integrates code generation, execution, evaluation, and self-correction. Together with MD-EvalBench proposed in this work, the first benchmark for LAMMPS code generation and question answering, our models and system achieve performance surpassing several strong baselines.This work systematically demonstrates the adaptability and generalization capability of large language models in industrial simulation tasks, laying a methodological foundation for automatic code generation in AI for Science and industrial-scale simulations.

We compute zero-phonon-line (ZPL) energies, radiative lifetimes, Huang-Rhys (HR) factors, and photoluminescence lineshapes to screen optical performance. All defects are thermodynamically stable with negative formation energies, and five candidates exhibit moderate electron-phonon coupling (HR < 5), indicating narrow emission linewidths. These emitters span a broad spectral range from the visible to the telecom regime, including near-infrared C-based centers and, most notably, the Si2BVN defect, which is identified as the first point defect in monolayer h-BN predicted to support single-photon emission in the telecom C band (1554 nm). Vacancy-containing complexes possess spin-1/2 ground states, enabling spin-photon interfaces compatible with integrated photonic and cavity-based platforms.

Our comprehensive evaluation across four continuous control environments demonstrates that third-order derivative penalties (jerk minimization) consistently achieve superior smoothness while maintaining competitive performance. We extend these findings to HVAC control systems where smooth policies reduce equipment switching by 60%, translating to significant operational benefits. Our work establishes higher-order action regularization as an effective bridge between RL optimization and operational constraints in energy-critical applications."

    "abstract": "We investigate the long-distance behavior of dyonic loop operators in 4d $SU(N)$ gauge theories on $\\mathbb{R}^3 \\times S^1$ using the 3d monopole semiclassics. If we employ the naive definition of the 't Hooft loop in the Abelianized regime, the dyonic loop operators do not admit the well-defined computations within the effective field theory. Moreover, if one forcibly proceeds with the computations of their expectation values, all the dyonic loops turn out to show the area law, which contradicts the prediction of the Wilson-'t Hooft classification. In this paper, we resolve this puzzle by employing the notion of screening for line operators, and we argue that the dyonic loops are screened by a defect known as the twist vortex, which is non-dynamical in the infrared effective theory but is dynamical in the original ultraviolet theory. The dyonic loops properly dressed by twist vortices admit the well-defined computations within the effective field theory, and we reproduce the kinematic prediction of the Wilson-'t~Hooft classification using the $3$d monopole semiclassics. Furthermore, we apply our framework to the thermal deconfined phase to evaluate the dual string tension, elucidating the topological nature of $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ domain walls. We confirm that the domain-wall state has the phase transition at $θ=π$ in the thermal deconfined phase despite the fact that the bulk state is smooth there."

    "abstract": "For a long time, WOH G64 was known as the most extreme red supergiant outside our Galaxy. However, in a matter of years it has faded, its pulsations have become suppressed and the spectrum has become dominated by emission lines from ionised gas, a far cry from the Mira-like pulsation and late M-type spectrum it used to display. Around the same time, a hot dust cloud was discovered using the VLT interferometer. WOH G64 has been claimed to have turned into a yellow hypergiant, which could signal a pre-supernova post-red supergiant evolution. Here we present spectra of WOH G64 obtained with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) between November 2024 and December 2025. Molecular absorption bands from TiO are seen at all times. This implies that WOH G64 is currently a red supergiant, and may never have ceased to be. However, the shallow, resolved bands and possible detection of VO hint at a highly extended atmosphere. The continuum appears to be varying, while the line emission shows a different behaviour, suggesting two separate components in the system. Meanwhile, atomic absorption lines are deepening. This places important constraints on scenarios for the dramatic events that are unfolding."

Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved forecasting skill, but the opacity of these models hampers scientific trust and operational deployment. Here, we introduce a mathematically grounded interpretability framework based on bounded variation function. By rescuing the \"dead\" neurons from the saturation zone of the activation function, we enhance the model's expressive capacity. Our analysis reveals that ENSO predictability emerges dominantly from the tropical Pacific, with contributions from the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, consistent with physical understanding. Controlled experiments affirm the robustness of our method and its alignment with established predictors. Notably, we probe the persistent Spring Predictability Barrier (SPB), finding that despite expanded sensitivity during spring, predictive performance declines-likely due to suboptimal variable selection. These results suggest that incorporating additional ocean-atmosphere variables may help transcend SPB limitations and advance long-range ENSO prediction."

    "abstract": "Selective exposure to online news occurs when users favor information that confirms their beliefs, creating filter bubbles and limiting diverse perspectives. Interactive systems can counter this by recommending different perspectives, but to achieve this, they need a real-time metric for selective exposure. We present an experiment where we evaluate Electroencephalography (EEG) and eye tracking as indicators for selective exposure by using eye tracking to recognize which textual parts participants read and using EEG to quantify the magnitude of selective exposure. Participants read online news while we collected EEG and eye movements with their agreement towards the news. We show that the agreement with news correlates positively with the theta band power in the parietal area. Our results indicate that future interactive systems can sense selective exposure using EEG and eye tracking to propose a more balanced information diet. This work presents an integrated experimental setup that identifies selective exposure using gaze and EEG-based metrics."

    "abstract": "Reasoning has long been understood as a pathway between stages of understanding. Proper reasoning leads to understanding of a given subject. This reasoning was conceptualized as a process of understanding in a particular way, i.e., \"symbolic reasoning\". Foundational Models (FM) demonstrate that this is not a necessary condition for many reasoning tasks: they can \"reason\" by way of imitating the process of \"thinking out loud\", testing the produced pathways, and iterating on these pathways on their own. This leads to some form of reasoning that can solve problems on its own or with few-shot learning, but appears fundamentally different from human reasoning due to its lack of grounding and common sense, leading to brittleness of the reasoning process. These insights promise to substantially alter our assessment of reasoning and its necessary conditions, but also inform the approaches to safety and robust defences against this brittleness of FMs. This paper offers and discusses several philosophical interpretations of this phenomenon, argues that the previously apt metaphor of the \"stochastic parrot\" has lost its relevance and thus should be abandoned, and reflects on different normative elements in the safety- and appropriateness-considerations emerging from these reasoning models and their growing capacity."

    "abstract": "Models of reaction diffusion processes usually employ discrete lattice models with particles interacting at the same site, resulting in localized reactions in the continuum limit. Here, various non-local interactions are considered, and two features reported. Firstly, it is shown that sufficiently non-local interactions will regulate ultra-violet divergences that perturbative methods with local interactions produce. However, in asymptotic regimes, infra-red divergences persist and ultra-violet divergences can reappear. Renormalisation methods are shown to report the same universal behaviour as local interactions at critical points. Secondly, the renormalisation group can be interpreted as a space-time-field rescaling that preserves action structure. This can be used to extract solutions to Callan-Symanzik equations directly without having to solve (or construct) the equation. These observations are exemplified for two paradigm models; annihilation $A_p+A_q\\rightarrow φ$, and this process paired with branching, birth and death."

Studies of accretion-disc outflows across all mass scales, including accreting white dwarfs, X-ray binaries, and active galactic nuclei, have shown that winds play a key role in regulating both the accretion flow and the surrounding environment. Disc winds therefore provide a common thread linking a broad range of scientific topics, from the microphysics of accretion to galaxy-scale feedback and evolution, as well as binary evolution and the predicted rates of energetic (multi-messenger) transient phenomena. Yet we still lack a comprehensive picture of the accretion-feedback process. Optical spectroscopy has revealed striking similarities across mass scales, hinting at common production mechanisms, and has shown that winds can evolve on timescales of only minutes. Progress, however, has been limited by their transient nature, sparse time coverage, and the lack of simultaneous, high-resolution spectroscopy. Time-domain facilities with high temporal and spectral resolution will allow us to track these events in high accretion-rate systems, constrain their launching mechanisms, and measure the mass, energy, and angular momentum they carry. This will provide crucial input for binary evolution models, wind feedback, and a unified view of accreting systems across mass scales."

    "abstract": "Arrhythmia is an abnormality of the heart's rhythm, caused by problems in the conductive system and resulting in irregular heartbeats. There is increasing evidence that undertaking frequent endurance sports training elevates one's risk of arrhythmia. Arrhythmia is diagnosed using an electrocardiogram (ECG) but this is not typically available to athletes while exercising. Previous research by Crickles investigates the usefulness of commonly available heart rate data in detecting signs of arrhythmia. It is hypothesised that a feature termed 'gappiness', defined by jumps in the heart rate while the athlete is under exertion, may be a characteristic of arrhythmia. A correlation was found between the proportion of 'gappy' activities and survey responses about heart rhythm problems. We develop on this measure by exploring various methods to detect spikes in heart rate data, allowing us to describe the extent of irregularity in an activity via the rate of spikes. We first compare the performance of these methods on simulated data, where we find that smoothing using a moving average and setting a constant threshold on the residuals is most effective. This method was then implemented on real data provided by Crickles from 168 athletes, where no significant correlation was found between the spike rates and survey responses. However, when considering only those spikes that occur above a heart rate of 160 beats per minute (bpm) a significant correlation was found. This supports the hypothesis that jumps at only high heart rates are informative of arrhythmia and indicates the need for further research into better measures to characterise features of heart rate data."

    "abstract": "The Euclid mission seeks to understand the Universe expansion history and the nature of dark energy, which requires a very accurate estimate of redshift distribution. Achieving this accuracy relies on reference samples with spectroscopic redshifts, together with a procedure to match them to survey sources for which only photometric redshifts are available. One important source of systematic uncertainty is the mismatch in photometric properties between galaxies in the Euclid survey and the reference objects. We develop a method to degrade the photometry of objects with deep photometry to match the properties of any shallower survey in the multi-band photometric space, preserving all the correlations between the fluxes and their uncertainties. We compare our transfer method with more demanding image-based methods, such as Balrog from the Dark Energy Survey Collaboration. According to metrics, our method outperforms Balrog. We implement it in the redshift distribution reconstruction, based on the self-organising map approach of arXiv:1509.03318, and test it using a realistic sample from the Euclid Flagship Simulation. We find that the key ingredient is to ensure that the reference objects are distributed in the colour space the same way as the wide-survey objects, which can be efficiently achieved with our transfer method. In our best implementation, the mean redshift biases are consistently reduced across the tomographic bins, bringing a significant fraction of them within the Euclid accuracy requirements in all tomographic bins. Equally importantly, the tests allow us to pinpoint which step in the calibration pipeline has the strongest impact on achieving the required accuracy. Our approach also reproduces the overall redshift distributions, which are crucial for applications such as angular clustering."

    "abstract": "Accurate and efficient implementation of parallel quantum gates is crucial for scalable quantum information processing. However, the unavoidable crosstalk between qubits in current noisy processors impedes the achievement of high gate fidelities and renders full Hilbert-space control optimization prohibitively difficult. Here, we overcome this challenge by reducing the full-system optimization to crosstalk-robust control over constant-sized subsystems, which dramatically reduces the computational cost. Our method effectively eliminates the leading-order gate operation deviations induced by crosstalk, thereby suppressing error rates. Within this framework, we construct analytical pulse solutions for parallel single-qubit gates and numerical pulses for parallel multi-qubit operations. We validate the proposed approach numerically across multiple platforms, including coupled nitrogen-vacancy centers, a nuclear-spin processor, and superconducting-qubit arrays with up to 200 qubits. As a result, the noise scaling is reduced from exponential to linear for parallel single-qubit gates, and an order-of-magnitude reduction is achieved for parallel multi-qubit gates. Moreover, our method does not require precise knowledge of crosstalk strengths and makes no assumption about the underlying qubit connectivity or lattice geometry, thereby establishing a scalable framework for parallel quantum control in large-scale quantum architectures."

We experimentally validate the proposed scheme on a nuclear magnetic resonance platform, achieving near-optimal precision scaling under amplitude damping in both parallel and sequential settings. Numerical simulations further demonstrate the scalability of the approach and its compatibility with other control techniques for suppressing more general types of noise.

Our simplified framework allows us to perform explicit computations, and to highlight the intricate links between rotation, stratification and bathymetry. In fact, we are able to construct approximate solutions at any order for our system, and to justify their validity. Each term in the asymptotic expansion is the sum of an interior part and of two boundary layer parts: a ``Munk'' type boundary layer, which is quasi-geostrophic, and an ``Ekman part'', which is not. Even though the Munk part of the approximation bears some similarity with previously studied 2D models, the analysis of the Ekman part is completely new, and several of its properties differ strongly from the ones of classical Ekman layers. Our theoretical analysis is supplemented with numerical illustrations, which exhibit the desired separation behavior."

    "abstract": "Domain alignment refers broadly to learning correspondences between data distributions from distinct domains. In this work, we focus on a setting where domains share underlying structural patterns despite differences in their specific realizations. The task is particularly challenging in the absence of paired observations, which removes direct supervision across domains. We introduce a generative framework, called SerpentFlow (SharEd-structuRe decomPosition for gEnerative domaiN adapTation), for unpaired domain alignment. SerpentFlow decomposes data within a latent space into a shared component common to both domains and a domain-specific one. By isolating the shared structure and replacing the domain-specific component with stochastic noise, we construct synthetic training pairs between shared representations and target-domain samples, thereby enabling the use of conditional generative models that are traditionally restricted to paired settings. We apply this approach to super-resolution tasks, where the shared component naturally corresponds to low-frequency content while high-frequency details capture domain-specific variability. The cutoff frequency separating low- and high-frequency components is determined automatically using a classifier-based criterion, ensuring a data-driven and domain-adaptive decomposition. By generating pseudo-pairs that preserve low-frequency structures while injecting stochastic high-frequency realizations, we learn the conditional distribution of the target domain given the shared representation. We implement SerpentFlow using Flow Matching as the generative pipeline, although the framework is compatible with other conditional generative approaches. Experiments on synthetic images, physical process simulations, and a climate downscaling task demonstrate that the method effectively reconstructs high-frequency structures consistent with underlying low-frequency patterns, supporting shared-structure decomposition as an effective strategy for unpaired domain alignment."

Our benchmark RoBench25 allows evaluating a model's information retrieval capabilities when subject to HiSPAs, and confirms the vulnerability of SSMs against such attacks. Even a recent 52B hybrid SSM-Transformer model from the Jamba family collapses on RoBench25 under optimized HiSPA triggers, whereas pure Transformers do not. We also observe that HiSPA triggers significantly weaken the Jamba model on the popular Open-Prompt-Injections benchmark, unlike pure Transformers. Finally, our interpretability study reveals patterns in Mamba's hidden layers during HiSPAs that could be used to build a HiSPA mitigation system.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates a coordinated multi-cell integrated sensing, communication, and powering (ISCAP) system operating in the electromagnetic near field, where each base station (BS) employs an extremely large-scale antenna array (ELAA) to simultaneously support downlink communication, wireless power transfer (WPT), and environmental sensing. Three categories of communication users (CUs) with different interference cancellation capabilities are considered, and sensing is enabled through a distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar architecture. To address the resulting design challenges, a robust optimization framework is proposed by optimizing the beamforming strategy to maximize the worst-case detection probability over a prescribed sensing region, subject to per-user signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints and energy harvesting requirements at energy receivers (ERs), while explicitly capturing the uncertainty in ER locations. By leveraging semidefinite relaxation (SDR), the original non-convex problem is reformulated as a convex semidefinite program with a provably tight relaxation. Furthermore, a low-complexity maximum ratio transmission (MRT)-based suboptimal scheme is developed, yielding a closed-form solution in the asymptotic regime as the number of antenna elements approaches infinity. Extensive numerical results reveal the fundamental trade-offs among sensing accuracy, communication reliability, and WPT efficiency."

The equations of motion are decoupled using a generalized harmonic gauge, which avoids the use of a scalar-vector-tensor decomposition. We point out that sources cannot generically be defined in a compact domain due to fluctuations of the cosmic perfect fluid. For power law cosmologies, we obtain the exact Green's function necessary to solve for all metric perturbations in terms of a hypergeometric function, which matches with a Green's function derived earlier by Chu. This allows us to derive the closed form expression of the linearized metric perturbation generated by sources up to quadrupolar order in the multipolar expansion."

Here we reveal the physical meaning of these mathematical achievements for the quantum mechanical transition probability. We show that this transition probability features a maximum degree of homogeneity in all simple Euclidean Jordan algebras, which includes common finite-dimensional Hilbert space quantum theory. The atomic parts of these algebras or, equivalently, the extreme boundaries of their state spaces can be characterized by purely topological means. This is an important difference to many other recent approaches that aim to distinguish the entire state spaces among the convex compact sets. An interesting case with non-homogeneous transition probability arises, when the $E_6$-symmetric bioctonionic projective plane is used as quantum logic."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of several aspects of the sinh-Gordon equation within a periodic setting. Our investigation proceeds in three main stages. First we establish the existence of periodic solutions for a fixed wave speed and varying periods by applying the mountain pass theorem. Subsequently, for a fixed period, we construct a family of periodic solutions that depend smoothly on the wave speed; this is achieved via the implicit function theorem. The spectral stability of these waves is then rigorously addressed. We perform a detailed spectral analysis of the linearized operator around the wave of fixed period. A key element in this analysis is the monotonicity of the period map, which, when combined with Morse index theory, enables us to fully characterize the non-positive spectrum of the projected operator in the space of zero-mean periodic functions. Finally, by employing the Hamiltonian-Krein index analysis, we determine the spectral stability and instability of the constructed waves. We additionally discuss qualitative aspects of the Cauchy problem associated with the sinh-Gordon equation, including local well-posedness and blow-up phenomena. The former supports a new linearization of the problem, while the latter predicts the spectral instability of the wave."

While ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality for detecting thyroid nodules, its diagnostic accuracy is often limited by challenges such as low image contrast and blurred nodule boundaries. To address these issues, we propose Nodule-DETR, a novel detection transformer (DETR) architecture designed for robust thyroid nodule detection in ultrasound images. Nodule-DETR introduces three key innovations: a Multi-Spectral Frequency-domain Channel Attention (MSFCA) module that leverages frequency analysis to enhance features of low-contrast nodules; a Hierarchical Feature Fusion (HFF) module for efficient multi-scale integration; and Multi-Scale Deformable Attention (MSDA) to flexibly capture small and irregularly shaped nodules. We conducted extensive experiments on a clinical dataset of real-world thyroid ultrasound images. The results demonstrate that Nodule-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baseline model by a significant margin of 0.149 in mAP@0.5:0.95. The superior accuracy of Nodule-DETR highlights its significant potential for clinical application as an effective tool in computer-aided thyroid diagnosis.

We propose FedBiCross, a personalized OSFL framework with three stages: (1) clustering clients by model output similarity to form coherent sub-ensembles, (2) bi-level cross-cluster optimization that learns adaptive weights to selectively leverage beneficial cross-cluster knowledge while suppressing negative transfer, and (3) personalized distillation for client-specific adaptation.

    "abstract": "We propose a new unstructured numerical subgrid method for solving the shallow water equations using a finite volume method with enhanced bathymetry resolution. The method employs an unstructured triangular mesh with support for triangulation of elements to form finer subgrids locally. The bathymetry is represented on the fine mesh, allowing the incorporation of small-scale features, while velocities are defined on the coarse mesh. The governing equations are solved numerically on the coarse mesh, making the method computationally cheaper compared to a traditional fine mesh computation. To accurately represent the velocities, we employ a second-order accurate WENO method and for temporal integration an explicit second-order accurate Runge-Kutta method. Furthermore, we present a novel subgrid face value reconstruction that accounts for partially wet cells, where only some of the subgrid cells are wet. Together with a newly developed gravity source term discretization, we demonstrate that the scheme is well-balanced on the subgrid level. Finally, the subgrid method is validated on several test cases to show: i) that the scheme is well-balanced, ii) confirm the order of the accuracy of the scheme, and iii) demonstrate the capability of handling moving flood and dry boundaries. We also highlight when it is beneficial to increase the number of subgrid cells to improve the results of the finite volume method."

    "abstract": "Exceptional points (EPs), ubiquitous non-Hermitian degeneracies, are central features in band structures where non-Hermitian Fermi arcs connect EPs and eigenvalue knots encircle them. Under open boundary conditions (OBCs), non-Hermitian skin effects enforce complex momenta and yield non-Bloch band structures, introducing EPs unique to OBCs whose origins depend on boundary-driven mechanisms. Here, we reveal both theoretically and experimentally that geometry itself can induce such non-Bloch EPs in a reciprocal non-Hermitian Lieb lattice supporting geometry-dependent skin effects. By analyzing non-Bloch band structures, we find that geometry-induced EPs correspond to saddle points rather than branch points. Branch points, even while carrying OBC eigenenergies, do not yield EPs but manifest as Whitney cusps, a characteristic type of geometric singularity, and Fermi arcs connecting them remain crucial in determining eigenvalue knots. Our measurements of these knots confirm that geometry-induced EPs are detached from the branch points of Fermi arcs, contrasting with their unified counterparts in Bloch systems. Our results establish geometry as an additional degree of freedom for engineering EP-based devices and reveal its fundamental role in shaping non-Bloch band structures."

Currently, this parameter remains unknown for many materials, and experimental means available for its measurement are considerably lacking. Meanwhile, it remains an unclear issue whether the mean free path of the photogenerated high-energy hot carriers is significantly different from that of the localequilibrium-state carriers near the Fermi surface or around the band edge. Based on the concept of transient grating Fourier transform and utilizing a virtual lock-in amplification technique, we proposed and demonstrated an efficient experimental technique for measuring the mean free path of photocarriers. This method has facilitated direct observation of the photocarrier transport behavior across the transition between diffusive and ballistic motion, from which we surprisingly find that the mean free path of photogenerated hot carriers in Silicon membrane and GaAs quantum well can reach micron scale, more than an order of magnitude larger compared to the electrically-measured one. This work provides new ideas for characterization of photoelectronic devices under operating status and is expected to greatly enhance the understanding of the photocarrier transport process in opto-electronic or photonic materials."

In contrast, away from non-transversal points, we prove that $L^p$ bounds for the maximal operator imply that the Fourier transform of the surface measure decays at rate $1/q$ for $q>p$. Combining these two regimes, we demonstrate that the conjecture of Stein and Iosevich-Sawyer on maximal functions could be re-formulated, in the analytic setting, by restricting attention to transversal points. Moreover, our result completely settles the refined form of the conjecture for certain cases."

We modeled the orientation of LC molecules under an applied bias and incorporated this into electromagnetic simulations to assess the optical response. We observed lasing at an emission wavelength of 870 nm for the single-mode PNL, with discrete voltage-dependent deflections of the far-field emission of up to $\\pm67$\\textdegree, while maintaining a beam divergence of less than 1\\textdegree. The steering characteristics were significantly influenced by the electro-optic properties of the LC layer, with an optimized thickness of 3 $μ$m. The structural periodicity governed the achievable angular separation and emission stability. Furthermore, we extended the concept to a dual-mode nanolaser based on a merged nanohole array (NHA), which supports two lasing wavelengths at 873 nm and 880 nm. Both lasing modes exhibited simultaneous voltage-dependent angular tuning without altering the cavity geometry. These results highlight the potential of LC-integrated PNLs as voltage-controlled, reconfigurable light sources for applications in optical interconnects, beam routing, adaptive imaging, and multiplexed communication."

    "abstract": "Recent Sun-as-a-star studies have shown that postflare loops can manifest as a secondary peak in the H$α$ light curve, suggesting that stellar postflare loops are detectable. To understand what determines the timing of such a secondary peak in the H$α$ light curve associated with postflare loops, we must quantitatively identify the key physical processes controlling the appearance of H$α$ postflare loops. Previous case studies have indicated that the appearance timing of H$α$ postflare loops is likely governed by radiative cooling. However, the statistical characteristics of the timing of H$α$ postflare loops appearance remain insufficiently investigated. In this study, we statistically investigated the appearance timing of H$α$ postflare loops to quantify their cooling processes. As a result, we found a negative correlation between the time difference between the soft X-ray peak and the appearance of the H$α$ postflare loops ($Δt$) and the soft X-ray peak flux ($F_\\mathrm{X}$). This relationship is consistent with the theoretical scaling between radiative cooling timescale ($τ_{\\mathrm{rad}}$) and $F_\\mathrm{X}$, where $τ_{\\mathrm{rad}} \\propto~F_\\mathrm{X}^{-1/2}$. This statistical result indicates that the appearance timing of H$α$ postflare loops relative to the soft X-ray peak is primarily controlled by radiative cooling. Furthermore, we examined the dependence of the scaling law on flare spatial scales ($L$). Consequently, we demonstrated that spatial scale of unresolved stellar flares can be estimated using the following scaling law: $L\\propto F_\\mathrm{X}^{1/3}Δt^{2/3}$. Our results are useful for interpreting secondary peaks in the H$α$ data of stellar flares and provide new method to estimate spatial scale of unresolved stellar flares."

Ensuring robustness against even minor input perturbations is therefore critical for maintaining reliable performance in real-time environments. While prior work has mainly examined accuracy degradation under adversarial attacks, robustness with respect to efficiency remains largely unexplored. This narrow focus provides only a partial understanding of ASR model vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive study of ASR robustness under multiple attack scenarios. We introduce MORE, a multi-objective repetitive doubling encouragement attack, which jointly degrades recognition accuracy and inference efficiency through a hierarchical staged repulsion-anchoring mechanism. Specifically, we reformulate multi-objective adversarial optimization into a hierarchical framework that sequentially achieves the dual objectives. To further amplify effectiveness, we propose a novel repetitive encouragement doubling objective (REDO) that induces duplicative text generation by maintaining accuracy degradation and periodically doubling the predicted sequence length. Overall, MORE compels ASR models to produce incorrect transcriptions at a substantially higher computational cost, triggered by a single adversarial input. Experiments show that MORE consistently yields significantly longer transcriptions while maintaining high word error rates compared to existing baselines, underscoring its effectiveness in multi-objective adversarial attack."

The recently discovered heavy-fermion spin-triplet superconductor candidate UTe$_2$ has sparked great interest for its ultrahigh upper critical field and reentrant SC phases in the proximity to a field-polarized magnetic state. Despite extensive studies on the phase diagrams and competing orders induced by pressure and magnetic field, limited has been known about its SC order parameters and their evolution with these control parameters, largely due to the lack of appropriate symmetry-sensitive detections. Here, we report comprehensive point-contact spectroscopy measurements of pressurized UTe$_2$ on the (0~0~1) surface. The observation of Andreev bound state strongly suggests the presence of a $p_z$ component in the SC order parameters. Quantitative analysis based on an extended Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model unveils $B_{2u}$ or $B_{3u}$ as the most likely representation for both ambient and pressurized UTe$_2$, and remarkably, the multiple SC phases can be distinguished by a single parameter $\\langle Δ_{z}\\rangle/\\langleΔ_{x(y)}\\rangle$, the relative weight between the $p_z$-wave and $p_{x(y)}$-wave pairings. These findings not only impose stringent constraints on the superconducting order parameter in UTe$_2$, but also provide key spectroscopic evidence for the existence of multiple SC phases tuned through pressure."

Dictionary definitions are an essential resource for learning word senses, but manually creating them is costly, which motivates us to automate the process. Specifically, we address learner's dictionary definition generation (LDDG), where definitions should consist of simple words. First, we introduce a reliable evaluation approach for DDG, based on our new evaluation criteria and powered by an LLM-as-a-judge. To provide reference definitions for the evaluation, we also construct a Japanese dataset in collaboration with a professional lexicographer. Validation results demonstrate that our evaluation approach agrees reasonably well with human annotators. Second, we propose an LDDG approach via iterative simplification with an LLM. Experimental results indicate that definitions generated by our approach achieve high scores on our criteria while maintaining lexical simplicity."

    "abstract": "Federated learning has drawn widespread interest from researchers, yet the data heterogeneity across edge clients remains a key challenge, often degrading model performance. Existing methods enhance model compatibility with data heterogeneity by splitting models and knowledge distillation. However, they neglect the insufficient communication bandwidth and computing power on the client, failing to strike an effective balance between addressing data heterogeneity and accommodating limited client resources. To tackle this limitation, we propose a personalized federated learning method based on cosine sparsification parameter packing and dual-weighted aggregation (FedCSPACK), which effectively leverages the limited client resources and reduces the impact of data heterogeneity on model performance. In FedCSPACK, the client packages model parameters and selects the most contributing parameter packages for sharing based on cosine similarity, effectively reducing bandwidth requirements. The client then generates a mask matrix anchored to the shared parameter package to improve the alignment and aggregation efficiency of sparse updates on the server. Furthermore, directional and distribution distance weights are embedded in the mask to implement a weighted-guided aggregation mechanism, enhancing the robustness and generalization performance of the global model. Extensive experiments across four datasets using ten state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that FedCSPACK effectively improves communication and computational efficiency while maintaining high model accuracy."

This study creates and tests a Machine Learning Canvas, a practical framework that combines business strategy, software engineering, and data science in order to determine the factors that lead to the success of ML projects. We surveyed 150 data scientists and analyzed their responses using statistical modeling. We identified four key success factors: Strategy (clear goals and planning), Process (how work gets done), Ecosystem (tools and infrastructure), and Support (organizational backing and resources). Our results show that these factors are interconnected - each one affects the next. For instance, strong organizational support results in a clearer strategy (β= 0.432, p < 0.001), which improves work processes (β= 0.428, p < 0.001) and builds better infrastructure (β= 0.547, p < 0.001). Together, these elements determine whether a project succeeds. The surprising finding? Although AI assistants make coding faster, they don't guarantee project success. AI assists with the \"how\" of coding but cannot replace the \"why\" and \"what\" of strategic thinking."

While prior studies have shown that lossless and reciprocal MiLAC can achieve the same capacity as digital beamforming in a single-user MIMO network, its performance in multi-user scenarios remains unknown. To answer this question, in this work, we establish a downlink multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) network with a MiLAC-aided transmitter, and investigate its sum-rate performance. Based on the microwave network theory, we first prove that lossless and reciprocal MiLAC cannot achieve the same performance as digital beamforming in a general MU-MISO network. Then, we formulate a sum-rate maximization problem and develop an efficient optimization framework to jointly optimize the power allocation and the scattering matrix for MiLAC. Numerical results validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate that MiLAC is a promising architecture for future extremely large-scale MIMO systems."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a shared model without exposing local data. However, backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to FL. These attacks aim to implant a stealthy trigger into the global model, causing it to mislead on inputs that possess a specific trigger while functioning normally on benign data. Although pre-aggregation detection is a main defense direction, existing state-of-the-art defenses often rely on fixed defense parameters. This reliance makes them vulnerable to single-point-of-failure risks, rendering them less effective against sophisticated attackers. To address these limitations, we propose FAROS, an enhanced FL framework that incorporates Adaptive Differential Scaling (ADS) and Robust Core-set Computing (RCC). The ADS mechanism adjusts the defense's sensitivity dynamically, based on the dispersion of uploaded gradients by clients in each round. This allows it to counter attackers who strategically shift between stealthiness and effectiveness. Furthermore, the RCC effectively mitigates the risk of single-point failure by computing the centroid of a core set comprising clients with the highest confidence. We conducted extensive experiments across various datasets, models, and attack scenarios. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms current defenses in both attack success rate and main task accuracy."

    "abstract": "This work investigates photon blockade control in a hybrid quantum system containing a Kerr-nonlinear cavity coupled to an optical parametric amplifier (OPA). The dynamics are governed by a master equation derived from an effective Hamiltonian that includes cavity decay.To obtain analytical solutions, the system's quantum state is expanded in the Fock basis up to the two-photon level. Solving the steady-state Schrodinger equation yields probability amplitudes and the analytical conditions for optimal photon blockade. Results confirm that photon blockade is achievable with suitable parameters. Excellent agreement is found between the analytical solutions and numerical simulations for the steady-state, equal-time second-order correlation function, validating both the analytical method and the blockade effect.Numerically, the average intracavity photon number increases significantly under resonance, providing a theoretical pathway for enhancing single-photon source brightness. Furthermore, the driving phase is shown to regulate the optimal blockade region: it shifts the parabolic region within the two-dimensional parameter space of driving strength and OPA nonlinearity and can even reverse its opening direction.The influence of Kerr nonlinearity is also examined. Photon blockade remains robust across a wide range of Kerr strengths. Physical analysis attributes the effect to destructive quantum interference between two distinct excitation pathways that suppress two-photon states. While Kerr nonlinearity shifts the system's energy levels, it does not disrupt this interference mechanism, explaining the effect's stability over a broad parameter range."

We present MAP-AI (Monte Carlo Alignment for Policy) as a canonical system architecture for operationalizing admissibility alignment, formalizing alignment as a probabilistic, decision-theoretic property rather than a static or binary condition. MAP-AI, a new control-plane system architecture for aligned decision-making under uncertainty, enforces alignment through Monte Carlo estimation of outcome distributions and admissibility-controlled policy selection rather than static model-level constraints. The framework evaluates decision policies across ensembles of plausible futures, explicitly modeling uncertainty, intervention effects, value ambiguity, and governance constraints. Alignment is assessed through distributional properties including expected utility, variance, tail risk, and probability of misalignment rather than accuracy or ranking performance. This approach distinguishes probabilistic prediction from decision reasoning under uncertainty and provides an executable methodology for evaluating trust and alignment in enterprise and institutional AI systems. The result is a practical foundation for governing AI systems whose impact is determined not by individual forecasts, but by policy behavior across distributions and tail events. Finally, we show how distributional alignment evaluation can be integrated into decision-making itself, yielding an admissibility-controlled action selection mechanism that alters policy behavior under uncertainty without retraining or modifying underlying models."

    "abstract": "Regarding intelligent transportation systems, low-bitrate transmission via lossy point cloud compression is vital for facilitating real-time collaborative perception among connected agents, such as vehicles and infrastructures, under restricted bandwidth. In existing compression transmission systems, the sender lossily compresses point coordinates and reflectance to generate a transmission code stream, which faces transmission burdens from reflectance encoding and limited detection robustness due to information loss. To address these issues, this paper proposes a 3D object detection framework with reflectance prediction-based knowledge distillation (RPKD). We compress point coordinates while discarding reflectance during low-bitrate transmission, and feed the decoded non-reflectance compressed point clouds into a student detector. The discarded reflectance is then reconstructed by a geometry-based reflectance prediction (RP) module within the student detector for precise detection. A teacher detector with the same structure as the student detector is designed for performing reflectance knowledge distillation (RKD) and detection knowledge distillation (DKD) from raw to compressed point clouds. Our cross-source distillation training strategy (CDTS) equips the student detector with robustness to low-quality compressed data while preserving the accuracy benefits of raw data through transferred distillation knowledge. Experimental results on the KITTI and DAIR-V2X-V datasets demonstrate that our method can boost detection accuracy for compressed point clouds across multiple code rates. We will release the code publicly at https://github.com/HaoJing-SX/RPKD."

We demonstrate that the robust design of energy-constrained waveforms can be transformed into a semidefinite programming problem, for which a globally optimal solution can be obtained, e.g., via interior point methods. We also develop iterative algorithms, which are based on coordinate descent, to tackle the robust waveform design problem under the constant-modulus constraint. Numerical examples demonstrate that, in the presence of array errors, the waveforms synthesized by the proposed algorithms achieve a lower matching error."

In recent years, with the continuous development of large language models, some models have been trained to reconstruct indoor environment structures. However, a major limitation of these models is their capability to address only small-scale, room-level scenes, making it challenging to cope with large-scale scenes at the floor level. To address this challenge, we introduce a hierarchical spatial segmentation method based on door frame recognition. By identifying door frames, large-scale floor scenes are divided into multiple small and regular rooms. Subsequently, semantic inference is applied to each subspace using a large language model, thereby achieving an accurate floorplan reconstruction. This approach overcomes the limitation of current large language models, which are restricted to handling small, room-level scenarios. We conducted an experiment on door frame recognition within a complex, large-scale environment containing nine door frames. The method successfully detected all the door frames, which allowed the precise division of the entire space into nine distinct rooms. Additionally, our floorplan reconstruction method is tested on both public and self-collected datasets, showing a 56.3% improvement over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods."

Despite significant progress, designing an accurate and efficient end-to-end text spotter for arbitrary-shaped text remains challenging. We identify the primary bottleneck as the lack of a reliable and efficient text detection method. To address this, we propose a novel parameterized text shape representation based on low-rank approximation for precise detection and a triple assignment detection head for fast inference. Specifically, unlike current data-irrelevant shape representation methods, we exploit shape correlations among labeled text boundaries to construct a robust low-rank subspace. By minimizing an <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\ell _{1}$</tex-math></inline-formula>-norm objective, we extract orthogonal vectors that capture the intrinsic text shape from noisy annotations, enabling precise reconstruction via the linear combination of only a few basis vectors. Next, the triple assignment scheme decouples training complexity from inference speed. It utilizes a deep sparse branch to guide an ultra-lightweight inference branch, while a dense branch provides rich parallel supervision. Building upon these advancements, we integrate the enhanced detection module with a lightweight recognition branch to form an end-to-end text spotting framework, termed LRANet++, capable of accurately and efficiently spotting arbitrary-shaped text. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of LRANet++ compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Our key insight is that both lossless compression and lossy reconstruction fundamentally rely on accurate probability estimation of geometric symbols, though targeting different metrics. Lossless compression minimizes bitrate via precise symbol distribution prediction, while lossy reconstruction enhances reconstruction fidelity through probability-guided geometry refinement. Recognizing that point clouds become sparser with increasing bit depth, NBP introduces two key technical innovations. For more significant bits, where the point density is higher, we develop a multi-stage Occupancy Probability Estimation (OPE) mechanism to estimate the probability distribution of occupancy status across multiple iteration stages, with each stage supporting either lossless or lossy mode. For less significant bits that focus on point placement, a Disentangled Probability Estimation (DPE) module is proposed to handle density information and binary residuals, simultaneously enabling lossless compression and facilitating probability-driven coordinate refinement for high-quality lossy reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of NBP, including low complexity, progressive coding, and superior coding efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art results both quantitatively and qualitatively."

The design supports four basic module types, i.e., AC- or DC-coupling and AC- or DC-output topological arrangements, adequately accommodating diverse DER integration scenarios, e.g., AC, DC, AC/DC hybrid microgrids, hybrid energy storage systems, or hybrid renewable power plants. The grid-forming control design is systematically developed by aggregating DER dynamics and disaggregating control objectives for the four basic modules, then extended to modular configurations through a top-down approach.

A multi-material function expansion method is developed for representing device structures, and the full-vectorial finite element method is employed to evaluate device properties with arbitrary structures. To accurately treat the device structures expressed by multi-material function expansion method, we also develop finite element discretization scheme for them.

    "abstract": "Modern React-based web applications face significant performance challenges as application complexity increases, resulting in prolonged component loading times and degraded user experience. Search engines emphasis on Core Web Vitals metrics further necessitates performance optimization for maintaining web visibility. This paper presents ReactSmart, a machine learning framework that implements adaptive resource management for React component loading through predictive user behavior analysis. ReactSmart employs real-time decision making algorithms that analyze four contextual dimensions: user interaction patterns, application state, network conditions, and device capabilities. The system utilizes these inputs to proactively load components based on predicted user navigation paths, thereby reducing wait times and improving application responsiveness. Our experimental evaluation compares ReactSmart against React Suspense and Guess.js using 10,000 simulated user sessions across multiple application archetypes. Results demonstrate that ReactSmart achieves a 47.3% reduction in initial loading times, 52.1% improvement in Time-to-Interactive (TTI) metrics, and maintains 89.7% prediction accuracy for component usage forecasting within 30-second intervals. The machine learning model incorporates supervised learning techniques trained on user interaction datasets to optimize component prefetching decisions. This research contributes to bridging the gap between theoretical machine learning approaches and practical web performance engineering by providing an open-source framework that enables developers to implement intelligent component loading strategies without requiring deep machine learning expertise. The ReactSmart software and evaluation framework are freely available as open source at https://github.com/sameermankotia/ReactSmart-performance-analysis/tree/master."

    "abstract": "Recent graph neural network-based collaborative filtering models are capable of representing complex user-item interaction information, which is crucial when datasets exhibit high sparsity. Many heterogeneous GNN architectures have been introduced to capture higher-order user-item interaction information, such as neighborhood information among items and item-item interaction sequential information. However, recent GNN-based CF models overlook the relationship between item sequence information and the semantic similarity between items. Hence, in this study, we propose a GNN framework for collaborative filtering that fuses item-item interaction signals derived using item-item interaction sequential graph which in turn derived from the order of all user-item interactions, with semantic similarity, utilizing two graphs: the first is a user-item bipartite graph, and the second is used for propagating item-item semantic relationship information. This helps the recommender system model to effectively represent users’ preferences towards items by using item feature information. We conducted experiments on three benchmark datasets—ML-1M, Amazon Books, and Yelp — using standard ranking-based measures. The results show significant improvements in the recommendation quality over the related state-of-the-art baselines."

The method allows for ganged tracking, mechanical rotation constraints, uneven row spacing, and arbitrary maximum allowable shaded fractions (to enable “fractional backtracking”). As with previous 2-D approaches, the method is suitable for terrain that varies in the transverse direction with respect to the rotation axis of the trackers. The novelty of the method lies in formulating the problem of shade avoidance as a linear problem, which is achieved by using the row interception width as the optimization variable instead of rotation angles. Formulating backtracking as a linear problem enables the use of extremely efficient linear programming algorithms, making the method highly scalable, requiring less than 1 min to compute optimal rotation schedules for hundreds of trackers. It also produces more effective backtracking rotations, reducing the frequency of shading by 4× and improving system energy output by 1%–2%."

SAGE integrates AraBERTv2 contextual embeddings with a hierarchical GAT design that processes information at both entity and type levels. The framework’s key innovation lies in its dynamic vector update mechanism that propagates semantic changes through the knowledge graph. Evaluation on Arabic news articles demonstrates that SAGE outperforms static representation methods by $28 \\%$ absolute improvement in linking accuracy, with particularly significant improvements for person entities and ambiguous mentions."

    "abstract": "This study provides a comprehensive examination of AtomBombing, a stealthy fileless code injection technique that leverages the Windows Global Atom Table for covert payload storage and execution. Unlike traditional injection strategies that rely on memory manipulation or file-based artifacts, AtomBombing avoids direct memory writes and operates entirely through legitimate Windows APIs, making it exceptionally evasive against modern endpoint detection and response tools. Through our proof-of-concept (PoCs) implementations, we demonstrate how adversaries could exploit atom-based payload fragmentation, double layer encoding, and time-based triggers to execute malicious tasks while minimizing forensic visibility. Building on those PoCs, we introduce ABOMB-FOD, a $\\mathbf{1. 2 ~ M B}$ multistage loader that survives reboots, bypasses user account controls, and still fits comfortably within the Atom Table capacity limits ($\\leq$ 65,535 entries $+\\mathbf{2 5 5} \\mathbf{B} \\approx \\mathbf{1 6} \\mathbf{~ M B}$). The AtomBombing Process Orchestrator illustrates the ability to securely store encrypted payloads and orchestrate parallel execution using PowerShell, while the Atom Table Backdoor showcases persistent command-and-control behavior activated under specific system conditions. Our findings underscore the inadequacy of current security solutions in monitoring Atom Table interactions, i.e., critical API functions remain largely overlooked in behavioral analysis, despite their potential for stealthy data injection. Consistent with this blind spot, our evaluation confirms that standard defenses, including Windows Defender with cloud protection enabled, fail to detect or flag AtomBombing activity, even when ABOMBFOD or other payloads are executing and network interactions are in progress. We note that a straightforward heuristic, such as flagging any process that issues more than a certain number of GlobalAddAtomW invocations (e.g., 500) within a short time window (e.g., one minute) and stores high-entropy data, can be effective in identifying candidates for further investigation."

Prompts are dynamically adapted based on imaging modality, clinical indication, and prior reports, supported by a fuzzy logic-driven rule base and a temporal summarizer to ensure clinical nuance and continuity. Our system is evaluated through realistic case scenarios across multiple imaging types and externally validated on 250 cases from the MIMIC-CXR dataset. Results demonstrate significant gains in BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore over baseline prompting, with expert review confirming improved structure, diagnostic alignment, and reduced hallucinations.

    "abstract": "As Internet of Things (IoT) devices become increasingly interconnected, they are exposed to cybersecurity risks. A particularly critical threat is posed by poisoning attacks, where adversaries deliberately inject harmful gradients into the training process, thereby compromising the reliability and accuracy of the learned model. Existing detection methods attempt to mitigate this threat, but they often struggle to process the vast and heterogeneous data generated by IoT systems. While deep learning solutions have shown promise, they typically rely on centralized datasets, limiting scalability and effectiveness. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a compelling alternative, enabling decentralized model training without raw data sharing. However, FL remains highly vulnerable to distributed data poisoning, which can severely compromise the global model. In this work, we propose the Adaptive Federated Learning Approach for Detecting Poisoned Data(AFA-DPD). Our method introduces a proactive filtering layer that leverages the Isolation Forest algorithm to identify and exclude suspicious clients before training phase. Experimental results demonstrate that AFA-DPD enhances the robustness of recent state-of-the-art FL systems when combined."

    "abstract": "Compilers must check the legality of code transformations to guarantee the correctness of applying a sequence of code transformations to a given code. While such a legality check needs to be precisely computed in general, we can use an approximate legality prediction model in certain cases, such as training a reinforcement learning (RL) agent for schedule prediction. In this paper, we propose an approximate method for legality checks. We propose a novel DL model for predicting the legality of transformations. The model takes the code representation and a list of transformations as input and predicts whether applying those transformations to the code is legal. We implement and evaluate the proposed model, demonstrating its effectiveness. Our evaluation shows an F1 score of 0.91 on a test set of randomly generated programs. To further evaluate the model in a practical scenario, we used the model to replace the legality check used during the training of an RL agent designed for automatic code optimization. We demonstrate that such a replacement enables the agent to train on twice as many steps, resulting in faster training and reducing resource usage by approximately $80 \\%$ for CPU and 35% for RAM. The agent trained using this approach maintains comparable performance, with only a $4 \\%$ reduction on benchmarks from the Polybench suite compared to the traditional method."

    "abstract": "Code smells are indicators of potential design issues in source code that can affect the overall software quality. Detecting these smells has been the focus of extensive research efforts using both traditional metric-based techniques and, more recently, deep learning models. Among these, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools due to their strong capabilities in code understanding and classification tasks. LLMs such as CodeT5 and CodeBERT were employed to detect various smells with promising results. However the integration of these models into software engineering workflows remains challenging as current approaches often lack traceability, modularity, and reusability, making it difficult to track results, compare configurations, or systematically explore model variations. To address these limitations, we introduce in this paper DetectorsForge, a Software Product Line (SPL) that enables the systematic configuration, customization, and execution of LLM-based code smell detectors. DetectorsForge unifies models, datasets, transfer learning techniques, and evaluation methods to adapt pre-trained models to new downstream tasks. These components are integrated within a reusable architecture that supports the automated derivation of code smell detection variants. Experimental results demonstrate the applicability of our approach for generating various code smell detectors."

    "abstract": "Error correction plays a central role in Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) because the raw keys produced by Alice and Bob rarely match exactly. Channel noise, detector fluctuations, and basis mismatches routinely introduce discrepancies that must be resolved before a usable secret key can be formed. Methods such as Cascade and LDPC generally perform well under moderate noise conditions; however, they depend on repeated message exchanges or computationally intensive decoding, which limits their effectiveness when several bits flip together within short time windows. These issues become particularly evident in high-noise environments where correlated errors appear in bursts. To address these challenges, this work presents a syndrome-based multi-bit error-correction technique combined with a chaotic masking approach for securely transmitting the necessary check-sequence data. The technique forms a decimal-summation matrix from each key block and extracts a compact syndrome vector capable of identifying one-, two-, or three-bit errors in a single step. To prevent classical-channel leakage, the required check-sequence is masked using a Tent-map sequence initialized from the entropy associated with the unmatched quantum indices. Simulation results demonstrate a 50–70% reduction in post-correction bit-error rate compared with Cascade, LDPC, and Polar codes across key lengths of 128 to 1024 bits and error probabilities up to 0.5. Overall, the proposed model offers a noise-tolerant and computationally lightweight reconciliation approach and forms the error-correction component of the patented Q-RAPTOR framework (Indian Patent Application No. 202541093982)."

    "abstract": "To reduce pollution emissions of sailing ships, solar energy is widely used in the ship integrated energy systems (SIES). Considering the variabilities of solar energy and load demand under complex sea conditions, a multi-disturbance-resilient distributed energy management (MDRD-EM) strategy is proposed to solve the energy management problem, to fulfill the safe navigation tasks under the relatively accurate optimal energy management decisions. Firstly, considering the random illumination, the uncertain effect of the photovoltaic panel (PV) output power cost is characterized by white noise. Moreover, the uncertain load demand is caused by multiple disturbances from the marine environment and mechanical operation, whose the spectral density are not constant. So the general noise is introduced to describe uncertain load demand. Then, the stochastic energy management model for the SIES is established, by the penalty-based method and variable substitution. Meanwhile, the MDRD-EM strategy is proposed to solve the energy management problem (EMP) for the SIES based on the incremental gradient descent method. Furthermore, the noise-to-state (NOS) stability of the proposed strategy is proven, which means that multiple noises can be tolerated to obtain the optimal energy management decision with the mean-square error <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O</i>(η). It can guarantee the stable navigation of the ship under the complex sea conditions. Finally, the simulation case verifies the effectiveness of the proposed strategy."

    "abstract": "To enhance the recognition performance of flexible tactile sensing systems in human-computer interaction (HCI), this letter proposes a tactile signal recognition method for polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) sensor arrays based on time-series imaging. In this study, a 4×4 PVDF sensor array was constructed for signal acquisition. The key innovation is the conversion of preprocessed voltage time series into two distinct image representations—Gramian Angular Field (GAF) and Markov Transition Field (MTF) images—to fully exploit the dynamic features of the signals. These images are then fed into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for end-to-end classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves outstanding performance in contact state recognition, with both the GAF+CNN and MTF+CNN models exceeding 95% in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The MTF+CNN model shows a slight advantage in recall and F1-score. In terms of deployment, the system achieves millisecond-level single-sample inference latency on a general-purpose computing platform (MacBook Pro 2022, M2 chip), proving its potential for real-time practical applications. This work provides an effective solution for developing high-precision, low-latency tactile sensing systems."

    "abstract": "In this paper, an improved multi-step model predictive control (MPC) algorithm is investigated for nonlinear networked control systems (NCSs) subject to stealthy denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and actuator saturation. First, the impact of stealthy DoS attacks on data transmission is quantitatively characterized through a Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) metric, while the packet dropouts of the corresponding channel are described by a Bernoulli random process. Actuator saturation is presented via a convex hull representation and explicitly addressed by incorporating saturation constraints into the MPC optimization problem. An interval type-2 Takagi-Sugeno (IT2 T-S) fuzzy model is integrated to robustly handle system nonlinearities and model uncertainties. Second, the improved multi-step strategy employs intersecting multiple ellipses to construct the initial feasible set for multi-step control laws, simultaneously enlarging the initial feasible set, improving the control performance, and reducing conservatism. Under the framework of the improved multi-step strategy, a model predictive controller is constructed via designing a sequence of feedback control laws before the fixed control law, driving the state from the initial feasible set to the neighborhood of zero. The recursive feasibility and closed-loop stability are demonstrated. Finally, simulation results prove the effectiveness of the algorithm under stealthy DoS attacks and actuator saturation."

    "abstract": "Mamba, with its advantages of global perception and linear complexity, has been widely applied to identify changes of the target regions within the remote sensing (RS) images captured under complex scenarios and varied conditions. However, existing remote sensing change detection (RSCD) approaches based on Mamba frequently struggle to effectively perceive the inherent locality of change regions as they direct flatten and scan RS images (i.e., the features of the same region of changes are not distributed continuously within the sequence but are mixed with features from other regions throughout the sequence). In this paper, we propose a novel locally adaptive SSM-based approach, termed CD-Lamba, which effectively enhances the locality of change detection while maintaining global perception. Specifically, our CD-Lamba includes a Locally Adaptive State-Space Scan (LASS) strategy for locality enhancement, a Cross-Temporal State-Space Scan (CTSS) strategy for bi temporal feature fusion, and a Window Shifting and Perception (WSP) mechanism to enhance interactions across segmented windows. These strategies are integrated into a multi-scale Cross-Temporal Locally Adaptive State-Space Scan (CT-LASS) module to effectively highlight changes and refine changes' representations feature generation. CD-Lamba significantly enhances local-global spatio-temporal interactions in bi-temporal images, offering improved performance in RSCD tasks. Extensive experimental results show that CD-Lamba achieves state-of-the art performance on four benchmark datasets with a satisfactory efficiency-accuracy trade-off.

    "abstract": "In Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) applications, the continuous emergence of new target classes poses a significant challenge to Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) systems. Adapting to the distribution of new data can induce drastic alterations in the feature space of deep models, resulting in a decline in their ability to recognize old data, termed catastrophic forgetting. To address this challenge, we propose a novel class-incremental SAR ATR method based on Physical Attributes Embedded Prototypical Network (PAEPN). PAEPN embeds physical attributes derived from electromagnetic scattering and geometric priors into the deep model to achieve stable representations. These physical attributes, determined by the target's shape, structure, and material composition, remain invariant throughout the incremental learning process, thereby enhancing the stability and interpretability of deep models. Specifically, PAEPN first extracts and integrates physical attribute priors to establish feature anchors, guiding the deep model in extracting physically consistent features and preventing drastic changes in the feature space. Second, a spatial attention enhancement strategy is introduced to enable the deep model to reliably focus on the key regions of SAR targets. Finally, feature relations that represent semantic similarity are distilled to further mitigate catastrophic forgetting. During testing, PAEPN employs the cosine distance between the sample feature and class prototypes for recognition. Comprehensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that PAEPN outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Deltas are particularly susceptible to extensive land subsidence and consequently face heightened flood risks. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques allow for multi-decadal detection of land surface displacements with high accuracy, demonstrating their power in revealing dynamics of land subsidence in delta areas. However, achieving a comprehensive understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns of the measured land displacements in these areas and assessing their potential impacts remain a challenge due to the superposition of various drivers of land movement and the high compressibility of the deposits forming these landforms. In this study, taking the Po Delta (Italy) as a case study, we analyze the spatiotemporal trend, seasonality, and abrupt changes in InSAR time series from the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS), derived from Sentinel-1 images spanning 2018-2023. Particular attention has been given to the displacements affecting the extensive levee system that shields the territory from flooding. Temporally, a regression model is applied to the InSAR time series to track their trend and seasonality, while the Bayesian estimator of abrupt change, seasonality, and trend (BEAST) algorithm is used to detect their abrupt changes. Spatially, we propose a robust estimation method for modeling spatial distribution of land subsidence associated with Holocene sediment ages. Four models, i.e., power, logarithmic, hyperbolic, and exponential functions, have been tested. The results reveal that, in the temporal domain, the behavior of the time series can be classified into trend dominated, seasonal dominated, and irregular patterns. Seasonality mainly characterizes the deformation of bridges and transmission towers and shows either a positive or negative correlation with the land surface temperature. Abrupt changes in the time series can be effectively detected, thereby enhancing alerts of levee failures. In the spatial domain, anomalous subsidence, which typically results from recent anthropogenic activities, can be identified by comparing the observed and modeled subsidence. The proposed framework shows its potential in improving the organization and interpretation of InSAR time series and thus provides comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis and direct detection of anomalies, helping identify critical areas and plan appropriate mitigation measures."

    "abstract": "As severe convective weather exerts growing influence on public safety, enhancing forecast accuracy has become critically important. However, the predictive capability remains limited due to insufficient observational coverage in certain regions or variables, as well as the inadequate representation of the fine-scale physical processes responsible for local convective development. In response to these challenges, this study proposes a physically embedded neural network based on heterogeneous meteorological data, which utilizes satellite multispectral images and atmospheric temperature and humidity profile synergistically retrieved from space-based and ground-based infrared spectral observations, to forecast local Convective Initiation (CI) within a 6-hour lead time. The core innovation of this study lies in the development of a physically consistent model that explicitly embeds the Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) equation into the network architecture. By embedding physical information, the model enables the atmospheric thermodynamic feature extraction module to generate physically consistent feature tensors, thereby enhancing the representation of key convective processes. We trained the network using the pre-training and fine-tuning approach, then validated its effectiveness with reanalysis and actual observational data. The results demonstrate that incorporating the retrieved atmospheric profile data leads to a 40% improvement in the 6-hour average Critical Success Index (CSI), increasing from 0.44 to 0.62 relative to forecasts without atmospheric profile input. Furthermore, in validation experiments using reanalysis data and radar observations, the proposed atmospheric profile feature extraction module consistently improves the model's average forecast CSI by more than 29% compared to models utilizing purely data-driven profile extraction modules."

    "abstract": "The urban heat island (UHI) has become a significant environmental concern due to the rapid pace of urbanization and climate change. Urban thermal landscapes (UTLs), which reflect the thermodynamic manifestation of urban landscapes, are usually identified by reclassifying Land Surface Temperature (LST) images. Different UTL identification methods can lead to inconsistent results and hinder cross-study comparability. This study compares four widely used UTL identification methods using a Landsat 9 LST image acquired in the summer of 2022 in Zhengzhou, China. The UTLs were classified into five levels, and the influence of spatial extent was examined by applying different multiples of the built-up area. Landscape metrics and land cover composition were then used to evaluate the outcomes. Results reveal that when the spatial extent expands from 1 to 4 times the built-up area, the segmentation thresholds for UTLs generally decrease across all methods. As a result, within the built-up area, the Percentage of Landscape (PLAND) of the high-temperature landscape (HL) increases by 24.19%, 21.45%, 27.76%, and 36.75% for the mean-standard deviation (MSD) method, natural breaks (Jenks) method, Hot-spot analysis method, and Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI) method, respectively. In contrast, the PLAND of the low-temperature landscape (LL) decreases by 11.83%, 11.70%, 14.44%, and 33.60%, respectively. The MSD and Hot-spot methods produce similar results and effectively identify UHI core areas. However, the Hot-spot method is more computationally intensive. The Jenks method excels in illustrating thermal gradient transitions. Nevertheless, with larger study areas, the segmentation threshold for LL is sensitive to spatial extent, leading to small patches being identified as LL. The UTFVI method yields overly aggregated classification results, thereby limiting its ability to represent mixed-function areas accurately. Overall, the MSD and Jenks methods are recommended. Moreover, a spatial extent approximately twice the size of the built-up area, rather than the administrative boundary, is suggested as the study area in UTL identification."

However, relying solely on exploration may be insufficient, as early victim localization can enhance path planning and prioritize victim access over the exploration of empty areas. In this work, we integrate Radio Frequency (RF)-based victim localization into State-of-Art multi-robot exploration approaches to guide decision-making and prioritize areas with higher likelihood of victim presence. Specifically, we perform probabilistic victim localization using Angle of Arrival (AoA) triangulation of RF signals, enhanced by Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) filtering. This information is then used to dynamically update exploration priorities and replan robot paths toward potential victim locations. We evaluate the proposed method using the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Extensive simulations confirm that the proposed approach significantly increases SAR efficiency, allowing up to ~34% of victims to be reached earlier in typical indoor environments and reducing the total mission time by up to 50%."

The Duval Triangle 1 method is commonly used to interpret DGA results due to its wide acceptance, however, it still does not address the severity level of discharge and thermal (DT) incipient fault. The paper focusses on understanding the relative concentration of different gases during DT and assign a severity level with fault-space refinement by combining trusted graphical and synthetic data generation (SDG) techniques. DTs occur sparsely and require an SDG approach due to lack of real-world data related to different severity levels of DT faults. Integration of SDG techniques and analysis of key gas concentrations, such as methane and ethylene, critical fault thresholds are identified, with methane concentrations exceeding 43% indicating severe faults like T3 and D2, while ethylene concentrations below 29% suggest low-to-medium thermal faults. 1113, 2166873, 13989, 396593, and 1899995 data instances were identified for fault categories D1, D2, T1, T2, and T3 faults respectively. Based upon rigorous analysis and training, the DT fault regions are segregated into different severity levels.

    "abstract": "Accurate muscle anisotropy assessment is crucial for understanding muscle mechanics and diagnosing pathologies. Shear wave (SW) elastography struggles with the varying fiber orientations in pennate muscles. Rotating the ultrasound probe offers a solution but is cumbersome in clinical practice. This study presents a tilted supersonic push (TSP) method with elliptical analytical inversion to overcome this limitation. TSP method can generate multi-angle (0°–15°) SWs within a single scan plane, creating an elliptical shear wave velocity (SWV) distribution that enables calculation of fiber-aligned and perpendicular SWVs without probe rotation. The TSP method's accuracy was validated through ex vivo experiments on porcine muscles, and in vivo studies on human gastrocnemius muscles. Results consistently demonstrated accurate SWV measurements, even in the presence of significant pennate angles. For instance, in ex vivo porcine muscles with a 25° pennate angle, TSP corrected longitudinal and transverse SWVs of 3.33 m/s and 2.15 m/s, respectively, consistent with reference values without pennate angle obtained via the traditional rotation method. Similarly, in vivo measurements on human gastrocnemius muscle showed longitudinal and transverse SWVs of 2.55 m/s and 1.21 m/s in a relaxed state, increasing to 4.07 m/s and 1.70 m/s during stretching. These findings highlight the method's ability to capture dynamic changes in muscle stiffness. The TSP method provides a clinically viable and robust approach for comprehensive muscle anisotropy assessment, especially in complex pennate muscles. This technique simplifies the measurement process and offers potential for improved diagnosis and management of musculoskeletal disorders."

    "abstract": "Non-stationary parametric bandits have attracted much attention recently. There are three principled ways to deal with non-stationarity, including sliding-window, weighted, and restart strategies. As many non-stationary environments exhibit gradual drifting patterns, the weighted strategy is commonly adopted in real-world applications. However, previous theoretical studies show that its analysis is more involved and the algorithms are either computationally less efficient or statistically suboptimal. This paper revisits the weighted strategy for non-stationary parametric bandits. In linear bandits (LB), we discover that this undesirable feature is due to an inadequate regret analysis, which results in an overly complex algorithm design.

    "abstract": "To address the heating, vibration, and torque ripple issues in high-speed permanent magnet synchronous motor (HSPMSM) caused by stator current harmonics, an LC filter is commonly implemented between the inverter and the motor to effectively suppress high-order harmonics. However, low-order harmonics may persist due to inverter nonlinearity, nonsinusoidal flux linkage, and three-phase asymmetry. Selecting suitable locations for current sensors can also pose challenges. To harness the advantages of both inverter current and stator current feedback in mitigating low-order harmonics for the LCfiltered HSPMSM system, this paper proposes a novel approach that integrates an adaptive extended state observer (AESO) with fractional-order repetitive control (FORC). This method only samples the inverter currents, utilizing AESO to accurately estimate the stator current and employing FORC for harmonic suppression, resulting in superior performance compared to traditional integer-order repetitive control (IORC). Experimental results on an HSPMSM platform validate the effectiveness of this approach, demonstrating significant reductions in low-order current harmonics."

    "abstract": "Achieving high-accuracy remote sensing change detection (RSCD) algorithms requires high-quality semantic feature extraction from remote sensing images (RSIs). Due to its powerful general-purpose feature extraction capability, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has found wide application across diverse fields. However, SAM may not be optimally suited for RSIs. To address this limitation, we propose a Frequency-domain Interactive LoRA Fine-tuning Architecture (FILFArch) to enhance the performance of SAM in RSCD tasks. Based on FILFArch, we then develop two task-specific algorithms, the FILFBCD for Binary Change Detection (BCD), and the FILFSCD for Semantic Change Detection (SCD). To enhance the capability of SAM in capturing bi-temporal RSIs feature relationship, the Bi-temporal Feature Interactive LoRA (BIF-LoRA) is designed with Siamese architecture. Within BIF-LoRA, Frequency-Domain Feature Interaction (FDFI) utilizes Fast Fourier Transform Block (FFTB) to fuse bi-temporal frequency-domain features. This enables cross-temporal frequency-domain interaction, effectively discriminating spatio-temporal feature differences. Additionally, we use a shared BCD Decoder to serves as the binary change detector for both FILFBCD and FILFSCD. The BCD Decoder first applies a Coarse Difference Feature Extraction (CDFE) to coarsely fuse deep semantic features, yielding a coarse-grained change feature map. Subsequently, a Frequency-Domain Feature Enhancement (FDFE) refines these abstract features to generate a fine-grained change map. In FILFSCD, FDFE is further utilized to recover semantic change information of each temporal RSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that FILFBCD achieves the highest F1 scores of 83.53%, 66.75%, and 83.79% on BCD datasets MLCD, S2Looking, and SYSU-CD, respectively. Meanwhile, FILFSCD achieves the highest F1 scores of 64.05% and 87.02% on SCD datasets SECOND, and DSCD, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed FILFArch for RSCD tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/juncyan/filora."

This letter proposes a meta-metric learning framework for few-shot Novel Jamming Pattern Class Discovery (NJPCD). A Disentangled Meta-Allocator is introduced to construct view-consistent episodic tasks and impose metric constraints, improving class separability and representation stability in jamming pattern recognition. To address the scarcity of novel jamming samples, a prototype-based meta-learning network enables effective cross-task adaptation and reliable novel-class discovery under minimal supervision. By integrating metric regularization into few-shot meta-training, the proposed framework enhances intra-class compactness and inter-class separability of learned embeddings. Simulation results demonstrate superior accuracy and stable performance across known, unknown, and mixed jamming scenarios."

However, trustworthiness of the resulting architectures is jeopardized by AI biases in the models used, the data they were trained on, or the way they are deployed. This problem needs to be addressed by systematic approaches of managing the AI bias-related risks. We propose AIBDB, an infrastructure inspired by the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system that serves as a knowledge base about known AI biases and supports software architects in automatically identifying architectural risks of AI bias. With the first proof-of-concept implementation of this web-based AI bias management infrastructure, we conducted a qualitative user study yielding feedback from 7 participants through thematic analysis of their 112 responses on the usability, usefulness and suggestions for improvement. We contribute to the development of future fair and unbiased AI-driven solutions in the web in the context of the ongoing research on Trustworthy and Human-centric AI and the increasing importance for organizations to address AI bias through recent regulations."

This paper proposes an optimized power control and bandwidth allocation strategy for joint sensing and communication in a multi-UAV system to minimize sensing and transmission delays under power and bandwidth constraints. The system comprises n UAVs, each monitoring a specific target area, and a flying communication hub that aggregates data from the UAVs and relays it to a data relief center. By dynamically managing power and bandwidth of each UAV, using convex optimization and Lagrangian duality, the system ensures efficient operation, reducing both sensing and communication delays by up to $47.2 \\%$ compared to traditional fixed-resource allocation methods. The proposed approach minimizes total system delay, represented as the sum of sensing delay and communication transmission delay, improving data flow and reliability. This adaptive framework addresses critical limitations in UAV-based systems, offering a scalable and robust solution for applications requiring efficient resource utilization in dynamic and time-sensitive scenarios."

First movers like Microsoft Spectrum Observatory and Electrosense, though with support from leading industry, research, and government, still suffer from sustainability challenges. In this paper, we present Fiesta, a sustainable framework for spectrum crowdsensing. On the technology side, we use federated learning and blockchain to decentralize the data analysis computations. For individual participants, minimal invasion of privacy suppresses concerns regarding large-scale adoption. From organizations’ perspectives, using blockchain avoids single point of failure and enhances the robustness of the entire system against malicious attacks. On the policy side, we propose a reward quantification mechanism to motivate engagement. Potential funding sources to ensure ongoing sustainability are also discussed. We have demonstrated Fiesta through simulation testbeds and real-world deployments with two demo tasks. Results show that Fiesta, as a decentralized framework, can preserve user privacy, enhance system robustness, maintain data fidelity compared with traditional methods, and fairly reward participants. We believe Fiesta is a stepping stone for the future spectrum crowdsensing paradigm."

    "abstract": "Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications are a key enabler of next-generation wireless networks, thanks to their abundant spectrum resources. Cluster-based models offer a compact and physically interpretable abstraction by grouping multipath components (MPCs) with similar properties, but their accuracy and adaptability are often limited by insufficient environmental information. To address this limitations, we propose a predictive channel modeling framework that jointly estimates MPCs clusters and associated parameters by leveraging multimodal environmental data, including light detection and ranging (LiDAR), images, and locations. The framework extracts modality-specific features and employs a hierarchical attention-based fusion architecture to integrate complementary information. Furthermore, a transfer learning strategy is introduced to support efficient model adaptation across different indoor regions. Experimental results demonstrate that multimodal fusion significantly outperforms single-modality baselines, which reduces a relative root mean squared error (RMSE) of RMS delay spread (DS) prediction by over 50% and improves cluster classification accuracy by around 6%. Meanwhile, the multi-task learning brings an additional about 5% gain in cluster prediction. Moreover, in inter-region transfer scenarios, the model achieves over 87% accuracy using only 20% data, highlighting strong data efficiency and adaptability."

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer a safe and economical alternative to manual patrols of overhead transmission lines, yet reliable localisation of missing cotter pins remains difficult because the targets are pixel–scale and often masked by cluttered towers. This work presents SADL–YOLOv11, a lightweight single-stage detector embedded in an end-to-end UAV workflow. A visibility-aware waypoint optimiser first plans 3-D trajectories that maximise pin exposure while satisfying safety envelopes reconstructed from LiDAR point clouds. The captured images are analysed on board by the proposed network, which extends a YOLOv11 baseline with a slim-neck (GSConv, VoVGSCSP, DySample), a micro-scale P2 head, an Adaptive Fine-Grained Channel Attention module, a Normalized-Wasserstein Distance loss for sub-pixel box regression, and a detail-enhanced weight-shared head. Group-Taylor pruning and feature–logit distillation further compress the model for edge deployment. On the Pin_Defect_Dataset, SADL–YOLOv11 attains 99.5% mAP@0.5 and 87.8% mAP@0.5:0.95. Under adverse imaging on the Pin_Low_Quality_Dataset (low light, blur/over-exposure, and very small targets), it achieves 97.0% mAP@0.5 and 73.3% mAP@0.5:0.95. Cross-domain transfer to PKU-Market-PCB confirms generalisation: mAP@0.5 matches YOLOv11 (78.5%) and mAP@0.5:0.95 improves by +3.2 points. The detector sustains 66.8 FPS on an RTX 3090 and 18–28 FPS on an RK3568 edge SoC, delivering a practical, high-precision, IoT-ready solution for large-scale power-grid inspection.

    "abstract": "Image steganography conceals secret data within a digital image while preserving its innocent appearance. The advent of artificial intelligence generative models has given rise to a new paradigm known as generative image steganography, which hides secret data directly into the image generation process. However, existing generative image steganographic methods are typically only applicable to unquantized stego images, severely limiting their practicality in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a generative image steganography with minimum-distance guidance based on a diffusion model, called MDStega. During the hiding phase, MDStega designs a secret data-driven residual image sampling mechanism, which establishes a dynamic mapping relationship between discrete secret data and continuous probability distributions, strictly preserving the distribution consistency between stego images and normally generated images. During the extraction phase, the minimum-distance guidance rule effectively suppresses the interference caused by stego image quantization on the extraction accuracy of secret data. Furthermore, MDStega does not require fine-tuning pre-trained models or training additional models, which significantly reduces computational overhead and training time. Experimental results demonstrate that MDStega is superior to state-of-the-art methods by not only ensuring secure concealment at 3 bits per pixel (bpp) in PNG format but also achieving a recovery accuracy of up to 99%, demonstrating strong practical potential."

Closed-form expressions for outage probability (OP) and intercept probability (IP) are derived for both near and far users, capturing the effects of ARIS configuration, power allocation, and channel fading. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations confirm the accuracy of the analytical results and reveal that increasing the number of ARIS elements, optimizing amplification factors, and carefully allocating power can significantly enhance both reliability and secrecy performance.

    "abstract": "Radar pulse stream data exhibit characteristics that include multidimensionality, diverse modulations, discrete, and uneven distributions, which pose significant challenges for feature representation and pattern recognition using deep learning technologies. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a joint multimodal representation and deep fusion framework. For this purpose, we first formulate the dynamic pulse stream using a graph model and construct a set of pulse states based on graph connectivity. After that, the multimodal representation of the radar pulse stream is achieved through two main components. The first component employs the vector embedding strategy to represent the distribution probabilities of pulse states as a one-dimensional (1D) feature vector. The second component introduces the Markov transition field to represent the transition probabilities among the pulse states as a two-dimensional (2D) feature map, thus achieving a unified representation of radar pulse stream data from a probabilistic perspective. Finally, we construct a deep fusion network that simultaneously employs 1D and 2D convolution branches to process different modal features, and further integrate them as a whole for recognition purpose within a multimodal interaction framework. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve a recognition accuracy level of 95% even under the condition of 70% pulse missing ratio (nearly 3.0% accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art results)."

    "abstract": "Wireless communication is evolving with the adoption of dynamic and self-organizing networks. They are expected to play a crucial role in shaping sixth-generation (6G) systems and the ongoing standardization process. The concept of non-public networks (NPNs) introduced in fifth-generation (5G) will be enhanced by nomadic non-public networks (NNPNs), extending mobility and adaptability beyond fixed locations. These networks help overcome the limitations of traditional static infrastructures, making them applicable to areas such as emergency response, transportation, agriculture, and others. This paper examines the transition from NPNs to NNPNs, highlighting key technical aspects such as network architecture, dynamic resource allocation, and wireless backhauling. Several use cases illustrate how NNPNs improve connectivity in environments where traditional networks are limited. Additionally, the study defines Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to evaluate NNPN applications and establishes a framework for categorizing them based on mobility and operational requirements. Despite their advantages, NNPNs introduce architectural, regulatory, and security challenges such as new approaches for handovers, spectrum policies or cross-border functionality, and trust mechanisms to maintain reliable operations. By identifying use cases, defining evaluation criteria, and addressing technical and regulatory challenges, this paper provides insights into integrating NNPNs into future 6G networks. These findings contribute to ongoing standardization efforts and emphasize the need for adaptable policies and network architectures to maximize the benefits of NNPNs in next-generation communication systems."

However, prior methods often suffer from inadequate image depth information and fixed-weight fusion strategies, limiting semantic extraction and adaptability. PVF-DectNet++ builds on our prior work by employing a perspective voxel projection technique to align both feature types. It introduces an adaptive image semantic feature extraction approach that interpolates image and point cloud intensity into a dense RGB-I multi-channel representation, facilitating the extraction of global, multi-level image features. Furthermore, during the fusion process, a learnable fusion module is designed to address the challenge of individual channels being unable to adapt to varying appearances, colors, and environmental conditions. Experiments on KITTI, nuScenes, and Waymo comprehensively validate PVF-DectNet++. On KITTI, it achieves detection accuracies of 66.3% for pedestrians, 78.8% for cyclists, and 86.8% for vehicles, yielding a 3.56% mAP improvement over PVF-DectNet. Additional tests show further gains, with mAP and NDS increases of 3.8% and 2.6% on nuScenes, and notable boosts in pedestrian and cyclist AP on Waymo. Compared with existing networks, PVF-DectNet++ consistently delivers superior performance, particularly for pedestrian and cyclist detection across diverse benchmarks.

Surface charges ranging from 7.5 to 50 μC generated surface charge densities from 0.20 to 1.25 mC/m², corresponding to internal electric fields between 16.3 and 40.7 MV/m. Attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR) revealed anisotropic attenuation of the C–F stretching modes at 1146 cm⁻¹ and 1209 cm⁻¹, indicating field-induced dipole alignment. Contact angle measurements showed a monotonic increase in the polar component of the surface energy from 2.8 to 12.1 mN/m, while the dispersive component remained nearly constant at ~20.4 mN/m. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) indicated a fivefold increase in root-mean-square roughness (from 5.6 to 27.3 nm), consistent with localized electrostriction and nanodomain formation. A logistic model (R² = 0.998) described the correlation between surface polarity and charge retention. Electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) further confirmed capacitive coupling between adjacent cylindrical domains, enhancing local electric-field gradients near the surface. Overall, these findings provide a robust framework for the tailored design of fluoropolymer electrets for high-performance acoustic sensors and dielectric systems."

    "abstract": "Rule discovery is a fundamental task in data analysis, with broad applications in data cleaning, knowledge extraction, and decision making. However, existing methods often generate a large number of functionally redundant rules, with a high time cost. To address this, a recent line of work, the first to introduce diversified top-<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$</tex-math></inline-formula> rule discovery, aims to identify a set of top-ranked rules that are both relevant and diverse. Despite this advancement, it still suffers from high user interaction overhead, computational inefficiency, and the inability to handle a common scenario of selecting a diverse subset from an existing rule set. In this paper, we propose a user-friendly and efficient framework for diversified top-<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$</tex-math></inline-formula> rule discovery. As a testbed, we consider Entity Enhancing Rules (REEs), which subsume common association rules and data quality rules as special cases. Our method allows users to specify lightweight preference templates, which are used to train a correlation model that captures user preferences and generates subjective embeddings for predicates and rules. Based on these embeddings, we define an objective function to jointly measure the relevance and diversity of rules in a unified vector space; moreover, we formulate and study two key problems: (i) selecting diversified top-<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$</tex-math></inline-formula> rules from an existing redundant rule set, and (ii) discovering diversified top-<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$</tex-math></inline-formula> rules directly from raw data. We prove that both problems are intractable and propose effective algorithms; in particular, the second problem is more challenging and thus we further optimize its solution with carefully designed pruning strategies and parallel optimization. Extensive evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates that our algorithms consistently identify top-ranked relevant and diverse rules, achieving an average 14.4 × speedup (up to 35.57 ×) over the state-of-the-art method."

Contrary to volume-based methods, recent advances in non-Euclidean spaces have led to the development of various surface-based networks for cortical surface analysis. While graph convolutional networks applied to the surface mesh offer the most straightforward approach, recent spherical convolutional networks have shown promising results across various analysis tasks. In this paper, we model the cortical surface as a higher-order structure: a simplicial complex. First, we introduce a simple yet effective method to construct higher-order descriptors on the icosahedral mesh representation of the cortical surface. Then, we propose a hierarchical architecture that consists of novel message-passing layers and a pooling layer. Lastly, our carefully designed Cortical Simplex Neural Network is evaluated through in-depth experiments on a large-scale dataset. It showcases competitive results in multiple tasks: Alzheimer’s disease classification, brain age regression, and subject-sex classification. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of our new approach and highlight the potential value of leveraging simplicial complex neural networks for cortical surface analysis."

    "abstract": "The simplified coherent system combining Alamouti coding and single balanced photodetector reception has emerged as a promising solution for short reach scenarios. However, Alamouti coding is one kind of space-time coding that has a higher requirement on orthogonality, which results in greater sensitivity to IQ skew. In this paper, we propose a polarization time interleaving twin subcarriers estimation (PTI-TSE) method to estimate the transmitter IQ skew for Alamouti coding-based simplified coherent systems. The training sequences of PTI-TSE are designed to be conjugate or negative-conjugate on symmetric subcarriers and time-interleaved on X- and Y-polarization to mitigate the frequency aliasing and polarization interference. Then, the Tx IQ skew is extracted from the phase offset of the difference between twin subcarriers. We verify the effectiveness of the PTI-TSE method by simulation and experiment of a 40 GBaud PM-QPSK DSCM transmission. Simulation and experimental results show that the PTI-TSE is tolerant to 500 MHz residual frequency offset and its estimation accuracy is within ±0.2 ps. Besides, it is also robust to imperfections such as Tx IQ imbalance, linewidth variations, and state-of-polarization (SOP)."

A standard GA is first implemented to assess its effectiveness using various objective functions. We then introduce a parallel IMGA framework, featuring multiple subpopulations evolving independently with periodic migration in a ring topology. Migration parameters are calibrated, revealing optimal settings for preserving diversity and improving convergence. Experimental results indicate that IMGA achieves up to a 50% improvement in reconstruction quality compared to the standard GA, with minimal additional computational cost. Moreover, our approach significantly outperforms the current state of the art for this problem, which relies on a hybrid method combining genetic algorithms and machine learning. These findings highlight the effectiveness and scalability of island models in addressing complex, high-dimensional optimization problems such as image reconstruction."

We benchmark traditional baselines, contextual encoders (BERT, DistilBERT, DeBERTa, Sentence-BERT), and LLMs (GPT4o, Mistral, o3mini) under both zero-shot and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. In addition, we fine-tune open-weight LLMs (LLaMA 2 and Mistral 7B) on our dataset. Fine-tuned transformer encoders achieved the highest accuracy, with $R^{2}$ values close to 0.99. DistilBERT yielded the lowest MAE (6.81 years) and BERT the lowest RMSE (11.46 years). Prompted LLMs performed moderately, with GPT-4o improving under CoT prompting ($R^{2}=0.668$), but still underperforming compared to fine-tuned encoders. Fine-tuned LLMs, such as Mistral 7B ($R^{2}=0.969$, MAE $=9.84$ years), substantially improved over zero-shot prompting but did not surpass the fine-tuned encoders. Our findings show that while general-purpose LLMs possess latent historical knowledge, accurate year-level dating requires targeted fine-tuning and strong contextual encoding. This study underscores the role of domain adaptation and model architecture in capturing subtle diachronic linguistic shifts."

These components collectively enable more stealthy and effective real time adjustments to the perturbations by tailoring updates based on the model’s response, further optimizing the attack’s impact. We evaluate DSAAP on two Android malware datasets: CICMalDroid2020 (multi-class) and Kronodroid (binary), using a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as the target model. Experimental results show that DSAAP achieves greater model degradation compared to standard PGD, as measured by attack success rate (ASR), accuracy drop, precision, recall, F1 score and confusion matrix analysis. The findings demonstrate the need for adaptive strategies in offensive machine learning to better understand and mitigate adversarial threats within deep learning systems."

To address this, we propose a deep learning model that effectively removes flares from single images while preserving critical visual content. Our method first estimates and refines a depth map of the input image using a Dense Vision Transformer (DPT). The refined depth map is combined with the original RGB image to form a 4 -channel input, which is processed by a U-shaped network. This network uses encoderdecoder blocks to progressively suppress flares, with a novel Hybrid Transformer Enhancement Block (HTEB) at its core to model global relationships and local details. Experiments on the Flare7K++ benchmark and real-world images demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in flare removal accuracy and detail preservation, proving its robustness for practical use.

By combining real-time data ingestion with contextual retrieval and advanced natural language understanding, the system efficiently interprets alert data and categorizes threats to support incident response and decision-making. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed approach achieves a classification accuracy of 94%, demonstrating strong promise for realworld deployment in security operations centers. These results highlight the potential of integrating RAG-LLM based frameworks to significantly enhance the scalability and effectiveness of cybersecurity defenses."

    "abstract": "Privacy policies play a vital role in informing users about how mobile apps collect, use, and share their data, but their length and complexity often obscure transparency. This is especially concerning for Android apps, which frequently request sensitive permissions, e.g., location, contacts, and storage. To tackle this issue, we developed an NLP-based system that classifies privacy policy segments according to the permissions they describe. Using a dataset of over 5,000 Android apps from AndroZoo, we scraped privacy policies and extracted permissions to form a diverse dataset. The extracted permissions include those from the vanilla Android OS, as well as a small subset from third-party tools and custom Android distributions, ensuring a comprehensive analysis. After data cleaning and preprocessing, we employed both keyword-based and manual labeling, assisted by ChatGPT, to categorize policy segments. We trained NLP models like BERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT, comparing their performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Our results showed that an ensemble learning approach, combining predictions from multiple models, outperformed individual models. This study advances efforts to enhance privacy policy transparency, improve user awareness, and strengthen privacy protection within diverse Android systems."

Here, we present the first application of FPM for the quantitative analysis of human brain organoid slices, providing a powerful, cost-effective, and label-free enhancement to the current gold-standard fluorescence microscopy. Brain organoids, prepared as thin (5 μm) slices, were imaged with a custom-built FPM system consisting of a standard light microscope (4x, 0.2 NA objective) and a 7×7 LED array. This configuration achieved a synthetic numerical aperture of 0.54 and a spatial resolution of approximately 488 nm across an area of 2.077 × 3.65 mm. Fluorescence microscopy was used in parallel for neurons, astrocytes, and nuclei labeling, providing rich fluorescence imaging. Moreover, we designed an automated method to merge classical resolution fluorescence images to visualize the whole brain organoid and align it with the numerically increased space-bandwidth product FPM image. The provided alignment method enables rich phase-fluorescence correlative imaging. Based on the segmentation performed on the stitched fluorescence images, we devised a quantitative phase analysis revealing a higher mean optical thickness of the nuclei versus astrocytes and neurons. Notably, nuclei located in neurogenic regions consistently exhibited significantly higher phase values (optical path difference) compared to nuclei elsewhere, suggesting cell-type-specific biophysical signatures. The label-free, quantitative, and high-throughput capabilities of the FPM approach demonstrated here make it a powerful and accessible tool for future structural and functional studies of whole-section brain organoid development and disease modeling studies."

Unlike existing methods which primarily rely on a large amount of human annotations for training neural networks, we proposes GrowSP++, an unsupervised method to successfully identify complex semantic classes for every point in 3D scenes, without needing any type of human labels. Our method is composed of three major components: 1) a feature extractor incorporating 2D-3D feature distillation, 2) a superpoint constructor featuring progressively growing superpoints, and 3) a semantic primitive constructor with an additional growing strategy. The key to our method is the superpoint constructor together with the progressive growing strategy on both super points and semantic primitives, driving the feature extractor to progressively learn similar features for 3D points belonging to the same semantic class. We extensively evaluate our method on five challenging indoor and outdoor datasets, demonstrating state of-the-art performance over all unsupervised baselines. We hope our work could inspire more advanced methods for unsupervised 3D semantic learning."

Existing methods predominantly utilize convolutional layers and attention mechanisms to explore task-level interactions. In this work, we introduce a novel decoder-based framework, parameter-aware Mamba model (PAMM), specifically designed for dense prediction in multitask learning (MTL) setting. Distinct from approaches that employ Transformers to model holistic task relationships, PAMM leverages the rich, scalable parameters of state-space models (SSMs) to enhance task interconnectivity. It features dual state-space parameter experts (PEs) that integrate and set task-specific parameter priors (PPs), capturing the intrinsic properties of each task. This approach not only facilitates precise multitask interactions but also allows for the global integration of task priors through the structured state-space sequence (S4) model. Furthermore, we employ the multidirectional Hilbert scanning (MDHS) method to construct multiangle feature sequences, thereby enhancing the sequence model’s perceptual capabilities for 2-D data. Extensive experiments on the NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

However, Wasm’s linear memory model lacks internal protection mechanisms, making it vulnerable to a wide range of memory safety violations. To address this, prior work has proposed techniques for protecting memory within the linear memory space. While effective to some extent, these approaches either suffer from limited detection coverage or are unsuitable for resource-constrained embedded systems. In this paper, we present WARD, a redzone-based memory protection technique tailored for Wasm in tiny embedded systems. At its core, WARD employs a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">randomized linear-to-physical address translation mechanism</i>, which enables effective detection of memory violations without requiring specific hardware extensions.

    "abstract": "To address the limitations of standalone inference, which relies exclusively on either an edge device or a server, we propose a novel cooperative inference method for mobile edge computing (MEC) systems. Our approach uses dual confidence thresholds on the edge device, equipped with a small neural network (NN) model, to filter ambiguous input images. These images are subsequently transmitted to the edge server with a large NN model and reevaluated for a final decision. We analyze the proposed method in terms of inference accuracy, delay, and energy consumption, considering the distribution of confidence scores from both positive and negative images that may trigger false alarms. Subsequently, we formulate a joint optimization problem to determine the optimal confidence thresholds at both the device and server, as well as the device's transmit power and duty cycle for transmission and reception, aiming to minimize the weighted sum of delay and energy consumption while maintaining the required accuracy level. To solve this problem, we propose a low-complexity algorithm that integrates an optimization method for finding the transmit power and duty cycle, along with a greedy search algorithm to determine effective confidence thresholds. Experimental results reveal a trade-off between inference accuracy and energy-delay cost depending on the confidence thresholds. Moreover, the joint optimization of confidence thresholds and radio resources significantly reduces delay and energy consumption while satisfying the required accuracy. Consequently, the proposed cooperative inference achieves higher accuracy than device-only inference and incurs much lower costs than server-only inference in various MEC environments."

The wideband performance of the proposed antenna is achieved through the Γ-shaped feeding structure, which comprises a transmission line and a coupling strip, and is facilitated by its orthogonal placement, thereby contributing to polarization diversity. The complete antenna structure is made with copper, which realizes high gain without any dielectric loss. A rectangular, box-shaped reflector has been incorporated in the proposed design to enhance directivity and maintain stable radiation. The proposed antenna obtains the overall impedance bandwidth and gain of 91.9% (2–5.4 GHz) and 10.6 dB; this frequency range covers 4G and 5G (N76/N77/N78) bands. Finally, the antenna has been transformed into a 2 × 2 array to enhance the overall performance, in terms of gain of about 16.5 dB."

We demonstrate that IBCB is a unified framework for both deterministic and randomized bandit policies. The experimental results indicate that IBCB outperforms several existing imitation learning algorithms on synthetic and real-world data and significantly reduces running time. Additionally, empirical analyses reveal that IBCB exhibits better imitation ability for fairness-aware experts, out-of-distribution generalization and is highly effective in learning the bandit policy from the interaction history of novice experts.

The radial energy deposition and charge transport characteristics of energetic carriers are studied in the picosecond regime from 10 eV above the band edge to full thermalization. The motion of the system of energetic carriers is well described by diffusion within hundreds of femtoseconds while rapid energy loss processes and secondary carrier generation are still ongoing. When using typical track parameters used in single-event upset (SEU) simulation, drift-diffusion based TCAD simulations do not reproduce experimental SEU cross sections at the 14-/16 nm node. However, traditional drift-diffusion device simulation tools are shown to produce accurate results for both 14-/16 nm bulk and SOI FinFETs if physically informed initial charge track parameters extracted from the full-band Monte Carlo simulations are used. SOI device simulations exhibit greater sensitivity to variations in track radius compared to bulk devices, which experience delayed, diffusive charge collection from the sub-fin region, which is less closely coupled to the hot carrier transient. These findings indicate that drift-diffusion modeling tools provide accurate results for SEU analysis in scaled FinFET technologies with switching times on the order of 1 ps when incorporating physically informed heavy-ion track parameters."

The results demonstrate that different PD modes exhibit distinct spectral characteristics. For needle, crack, and metal contamination defects, the detection limits using a full-band silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) are determined to be 64.37 pC, 78.12 pC, and 159 pC, respectively, with corresponding response coefficients of 450 mV/pC, 300 mV/pC, and 160 mV/pC. The SiPM response coefficient is found to vary with detection wavebands and PD modes. Multispectral analysis shows that although the 300-400 nm band accounts for the highest proportion across all discharge modes, the distribution characteristics of each wavelength band differ.

Mainstream solutions integrate CLIP for category identification but often bias the model to misclassify novel categories as common ones (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e</i>., interference terms) due to inherent category imbalances within CLIP and exclusive reliance on known-class images for training. To address this issue, we introduce a novel approach named EXcluding the Interference Semantic SegmenTation Network (EXIST-Net), an extension of ELSE-Net, first presented at AAAI 2025. EXIST-Net transforms conventional single-step recognition into a nuanced two-stage process: initially filtering out interference terms to narrow the selection range, followed by enabling more precise identification of the sample’s specific category. In implementation, EXIST-Net consists of four blocks: (1) Mask Proposal Network (MPN) generates class-agnostic masks. (2) Mask Forward Classifier (MFC) assesses the inclusion probability (the likelihood that a mask belongs to a category). (3) Mask Reverse Classifier (MRC) is the cornerstone to implement the “Excluding the Interference” concept. It calculates high-quality exclusion probabilities (the likelihood that a mask does not belong to a specific category). (4) Probability Corrector (PCor) leverages exclusion probabilities to adjust inclusion probabilities, thereby improving the accuracy of semantic segmentation. Moreover, the MRC block is model-agnostic and entails low consumption, making it compatible with a wide range of mainstream approaches. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of EXIST-Net and demonstrate the model-agnostic functionality and low resource usage of the MRC block."

However, their performance is highly sensitive to specific scenarios and often necessitates expert customization. To overcome this, automated design methods like genetic programming (GP) and gene expression programming (GEP) have been proposed. Despite their success, these methods face challenges, such as high randomness in the search process. Recently, the combination of large language models (LLMs) with evolutionary algorithms has opened new possibilities for prompt engineering and automated algorithm design. To improve the ability of LLMs in automatic HDR design, this paper introduces a novel population self-evolutionary (SeEvo) framework, which draws inspiration from the self-reflective design strategies employed by human experts. Notably, this framework employs a novel teacher-student learning mechanism, allowing the LLM (student) to generate robust HDRs. Guided by a teacher model with complete knowledge of actual processing times, the student learns to infer fuzzy uncertainties from historical deviations, enabling it to effectively anticipate and adapt to fuzzy impacts. Experimental results demonstrate that SeEvo significantly outperforms GP, GEP, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods, and more than ten commonly used HDRs from the literature, particularly in previously unseen and dynamic scenarios."

This approach significantly outperforms existing techniques across five TCGA cancer datasets. Notably, in breast cancer, it successfully identifies five distinct subtypes with pronounced survival differences, revealing a nonlinear relationship between methylation levels (hypermethylation correlating with better prognosis, hypomethylation with poorer outcomes) and survival outcomes, while aligning closely with established clinical subtypes. As an automated, tuning-free tool for precision oncology, SIMKF not only uncovers prognostic biological mechanisms but also translates directly into clinically applicable subtyping models."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have enabled their widespread deployment in critical applications such as emergency management. Existing approaches still face challenges in energy efficiency, real-time adaptability, and service latency. To address these limitations, a perception enhanced multimodal multitask semantic communication (PE-MMSC) framework is first proposed, and a task-oriented resource optimization model is established on this foundation to maximize comprehensive quality of experience (QoE) in this paper. Specifically, PE-MMSC leverages a perception-enhanced attention mechanism to achieve semantic enhancement of critical features and more effective multimodal fusion guided by preliminary coarse classification results. For the resource optimization model, reinforcement learning is employed to address two subproblems: trajectory planning and resource management, and a semantic importance (SI) feedback mechanism is proposed to develop SI SI-guided double deep Q-network(SI-DDQN), which can make adaptive resource allocation decisions for important data with semantic awareness. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PE-MMSC system achieves 5%–10% higher target classification accuracy compared to conventional systems while maintaining comparable data reconstruction quality with acceptable computational overheads, and the SI-DDQN achieves nearly two to three times greater QoE improvement than traditional algorithms."

The generated adversarial examples not only expand the training set to tackle the data scarcity issue, but also act as a bridge to connect the data distribution of old and new topics. To overcome training instability in adversarial example generation, LADES introduces a gradient-free Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling method. This method ensures adversarial examples are readable and contextually coherent by harnessing LLMs, while promoting effective attacks through entropy-based sampling that targets model uncertainty. To mitigate the impact of potential mislabeling in synthetic data, LADES implements a meta-mixed-learning mechanism. This mechanism dynamically adjusts the weights of synthetic adversarial examples, guided by limited labeled data from emerging topics, thereby alleviating the data noise."

    "abstract": "Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) rely on complex, interconnected communication systems, making them vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. Digital forensics offers vital tools for investigating cyberattacks, yet investigators encounter substantial obstacles. A key challenge is the hesitation of manufacturers and component suppliers to provide critical logs, restricting access to essential data. Moreover, analyzing incidents is complicated by the need to gather and process heterogeneous data from sources like Electronic Control Units (ECUs), sensors, user interactions, and contextual knowledge. Investigators also face challenges due to the heterogeneity of forensic data, the need for real-time reasoning, and the limited interpretability of black-box AI models. To tackle these issues, we introduce ForenSys, a semantic rule-based reasoning system tailored for cyberattack investigations in CAVs. ForenSys integrates varied data sources through an Information Management Module and employs a semantic reasoning engine aligned with MITRE ATT&CK techniques for automated analysis. Powered by AI, it supports dynamic, real-time forensic operations, revealing hidden data connections to reconstruct events despite limited access. ForenSys also correlates cyberattacks with tactics, techniques, timing, and location, delivering transparent and explainable analysis. Its efficacy is validated through implementation and testing in vehicle cyberattack scenarios."

Our model enhances 3D scene generation by aligning 3D Gaussians with pixel data, refining 3D structures, and applying realistic surface properties while ensuring view-to-view consistency and accommodating complex scenes.

In this study, we propose a scalable synthetic data augmentation strategy to expand the training corpus to 100,000 records. Using advanced generative AI systems-ChatGPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro-we generated 80,000 contextually relevant and medically coherent synthetic question-answer pairs grounded in the structure of the original dataset. These synthetic samples were semantically filtered, manually validated, and integrated into the training pipeline. We fine-tuned five LLMs, including Mistral-7B and AraGPT2, and evaluated their performance using BERTScore metrics and expert-driven qualitative assessments. To further analyze the effectiveness of synthetic sources, we conducted an ablation study comparing ChatGPT-4o and Gemini-generated data independently. The results showed that ChatGPT-4o data consistently led to higher F1-scores and fewer hallucinations across all models. Overall, our findings demonstrate the viability of synthetic augmentation as a practical solution for enhancing domain-specific language models in low-resource medical NLP, paving the way for more inclusive, scalable, and accurate Arabic healthcare chatbot systems."

    "abstract": "Autonomous systems across diverse domains have underscored the need for drift-resilient state estimation. Although satellite-based positioning and cameras are widely used, they often suffer from limited availability in many environments. As a result, positioning must rely solely on inertial sensors, leading to rapid accuracy degradation over time due to sensor biases and noise. To counteract this, alternative update sources—referred to as information aiding—serve as anchors of certainty. Among these, the zero-velocity update (ZUPT) is particularly effective in providing accurate corrections during stationary intervals, though it is restricted to surface-bound platforms. This work introduces a controlled ZUPT (C-ZUPT) approach for aerial navigation and control, independent of surface contact. By defining an uncertainty threshold, C-ZUPT identifies quasi-static equilibria to deliver precise velocity updates to the estimation filter. Extensive validation confirms that these opportunistic, high-quality updates significantly reduce inertial drift and control effort. As a result, C-ZUPT mitigates filter divergence and enhances navigation stability, enabling more energy-efficient hovering and substantially extending sustained flight—key advantages for resource-constrained aerial systems."

However, recent studies have revealed a significant decline in algorithm performance when applied to elderly subjects, posing a major challenge to the practical deployment of MI-BCIs in this demographic. To address this limitation, we propose a novel cross-population transfer learning-based decoding scheme. Specifically, we leverage sensory and motor multi-modal hybrid data to fine-tune a pre-trained model, originally trained on MI data from young adults. To further mitigate inter-subject variability in EEG signals, we introduce a cross-task Euclidean alignment strategy, where MI data is aligned using covariance computed from sensory data, enabling MI decoding for elderly subjects without requiring any MI data from the target population. Our proposed approach has demonstrated promising results, achieving a 14% improvement in decoding performance compared to within-subject decoding and a 6.64% enhancement over cross-subject decoding for elderly participants. Additionally, our method reduces the BCI-system-deficiency rate by 47.37% compared to within-subject decoding methods, and by 15.79% compared to the strongest cross-subject baseline, significantly enhancing system robustness and reliability. By eliminating the need for subject-specific MI data, our approach provides a plug-and-play solution for clinical applications, particularly in stroke rehabilitation and elderly neurorehabilitation, paving the way for more inclusive, accessible, and adaptable BCI technologies."

These systems can be transformed into real-time monitoring tools and support mental health care systems such as online education, interviews, and medical treatments. This research proposed video-based emotion classification with a novel optimized hybrid deep learning model. From the video, facial expression features such as eye movements and lip movements are captured for emotion analysis. Videos are converted into frames and are trained and tested using various baseline deep learning models such as convolutional neural network (CNN), CNN for long short-term memory (LSTM), 3D convolutional neural network (3D CNN), and CNN-LSTM model. We proposed a novel optimizer-based hybrid deep learning model for improving the accuracy of emotion detection—the CNN-LSTM-GWO and CNN-LSTM-PSO. In the final task output, we employ a multitask learning mechanism, setting discrete emotion recognition as the primary task and emotion valence recognition, emotion arousal recognition, and previous information extraction as auxiliary tasks to facilitate practical information sharing across different tasks. Experimental results on the established driver emotion dataset demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves driver emotion recognition performance, achieving an accuracy of 86.98% and an F1 score of 85.83% in the primary task.

This work investigates the use of lightweight, computationally efficient machine learning (ML) models that operate on a sample-by-sample basis using simple digital operators. The proposed models are applied to ANC under nonlinear conditions, including distortions in the primary path, the secondary path, and the reference signal. The approach enhances noise attenuation while preserving low computational complexity, thereby enabling real-time implementation on embedded systems. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the method across a variety of nonlinear scenarios, demonstrating superior noise reduction and control accuracy compared to conventional linear ANC schemes, and achieving this at a significantly lower cost than alternative nonlinear approaches."

Unlike conventional approaches that rely on auxiliary controllers to monitor the output and apply compensation, the proposed latch incorporates a coupling capacitor and internal feedback path, which autonomously mitigate offset voltages induced by transistor mismatch. This inherent self-compensation not only simplifies the overall architecture but also improves robustness against PVT variations. A TRNG prototype is realized by integrating four self-compensating StrongARM latches with a lightweight XOR-based post-processing stage, thereby ensuring high-quality randomness with minimal design complexity. The statistical properties of the generated bitstreams are verified through NIST SP 800-22 and NIST SP 800-90B test suites, confirming compliance with standard randomness and robustness requirements. Post-layout simulations in a 65-nm low-power CMOS process demonstrate that the proposed TRNG achieves a throughput of 2 Gbps while consuming only 0.107 pJ/bit, highlighting its suitability for energy-constrained security applications."

    "abstract": "The scarcity of flexibility and effectiveness in skeleton models, combined with the characteristic of limited information in skeleton data, has resulted in fine-grained modeling insufficiently explored in recent skeleton-based action recognition. Confronting these challenges, we propose Dynamic prompting Spatial Temporal Actor transFormer (DSTAFormer), a powerful framework which neatly unifies vision and language. Specifically, we introduce a decoupled vision transformer, which consists of three components: Spatial transFormer (SF), Temporal transFormer (TF), and Actor transFormer (AF), to account for numerous visual aspects of the human body, namely spatial, temporal, and interactive relations. Compared to the vanilla transformer, we reformulate self-attention using Statistically-inspired Attention Reconstruction (SAR) module and Local-specific constraints, thereby enabling a more explicit and interpretable exploration of the action’s fine-grained compositions. The skeleton sequences are processed by this decoupled structure to generate the visual embeddings. To encode environmental interactions that skeletal coordinates inherently lack, we utilize Dynamic Prompting (Dp) strategy to generate visual-based textual prompts. These prompts are transformed into discriminative textual embeddings via a pre-trained large language model (LLM). We also design a Semantic Adapter (SA) to bridge the modality gap. The cross-modality embeddings are projected into a unified feature space for contrastive co-training. This infusion of knowledge into the skeleton data enhances its semantic richness, pushing the boundaries of fine-grained understanding. We evaluate our framework on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and Toyota Smarthome datasets. DSTAFormer achieves comparable performance against state-of-the-arts."

    "abstract": "Fluoroscopic imaging plays a critical role in numerous medical procedures, particularly in interventional radiology and orthopedic surgery. This study presents a novel framework for optimizing fluoroscopic imaging by selecting stable vertebral projections and performing path tracking using Model Predictive Control (MPC). An O-Arm system model was developed, and its kinematic and dynamic properties were analyzed to enable accurate tracking of the desired surgical trajectory. MPC was employed to minimize tracking errors which can account for hardware and software constraints that may arise during intraoperative operation. To improve imaging quality, the desired surgical path was evaluated offline by incorporating the patient’s respiration pattern, which introduces vertebral displacement and can degrade fluoroscopic visualization. By automating O-Arm motion to compensate for these respiratory-induced variations, the proposed method aims to enhance imaging stability and improve surgical outcomes. Prior to surgery, virtual radiographic images were generated using Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs (DRRs) derived from the patient’s 3D CT data and ventilator-driven respiratory motion. Each frame was analyzed to identify the views exhibiting minimal variation, enabling the determination of an optimal end-effector trajectory for the O-Arm. The results show that, despite certain approximations in the methodology, the mean pixel displacement of the region of interest improved substantially from 37.59 pixels in the fixed-view scenario to 0.54 pixels using the proposed dynamic approach."

    "abstract": "In the green order financing (GOF), suppliers must first obtain “green certification” from core enterprises before they can secure bank financing to fulfill eco-friendly orders. In practice, core enterprises often face challenges in establishing green certification standards, particularly in setting a reasonable entry threshold for suppliers to access GOF. This paper examines the setting of entry threshold for GOF and proposes incentives to coordinate the GOF system. Specifically, we study a GOF system consisting of a bank, a large retailer, and a capital-constrained supplier. The retailer, acting on behalf of the bank, sets the greenness entry threshold for the supplier to access more preferential GOF, leveraging its informational advantages regarding the supplier's environmental performance. We find that the supplier will opt for GOF only when the entry threshold set by the retailer is below a critical value; otherwise, it will continue using traditional order financing (TOF). In a Stackelberg game with the retailer as the leader, a unique equilibrium emerges between the two sides of the supply chain, under which GOF is implemented, leading to Pareto improvements and enhanced greenness. As another participant in the system, the bank also benefits from providing GOF, provided that it sets a reasonable interest rate—no lower than a certain threshold. If the bank's GOF interest rate falls below this threshold, external government incentives will be necessary. We demonstrate that the government will only refrain from subsidizing the bank if the supplier's cost coefficient of green investment is extremely high while the bank's GOF interest rate is exceedingly low. Otherwise, the government will be willing to provide subsidies (transfer payments) to the bank, resulting in Pareto improvements for all three GOF members and achieving greater social welfare than with TOF. Finally, we conduct numerical studies to validate the findings and extend the analysis to include a new formulation of consumer surplus, a new game sequence, a new subsidy category, and the retailer's pricing decisions, further confirming the robustness of the results."

For practical reasons, stress factors are applied sequentially, and measurements are conducted on the machine at room temperature. This procedure is simple but has two major limitations. The first is that testing will not activate synergies between stresses. The other one is that partial discharge inception voltage measurements under impulsive voltages sometimes provide overly optimistic results. This paper suggests an alternative procedure to conduct the qualification of inverter-fed machine insulation. The proposed procedure combines electrical and thermal stress, thus accounting for their synergies. As the applied electrical stress is like that experienced in service, partial discharges can be initiated during aging. This might lead to failure without the need for testing partial discharge."

    "abstract": "In surveillance systems, near-infrared (NIR) images of faces are more suitable for nighttime use than RGB images. However, the NIR images of Computer-Generated (CG) characters cannot be obtained directly through photography. One possible solution is to estimate NIR images from corresponding RGB images using image-to-image (I2I) translation. The development of algorithms also requires the support of sufficient datasets. While large-scale datasets from the visible spectrum are available, the lack of NIR counterparts has posed a significant obstacle to related research. To address the issues mentioned above, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based I2I translation model that generates NIR human faces from RGB inputs. The U-shaped generator can recover semantic and texture information with customized feature extraction and skip connection modules. The generator’s parameters are 10.54M, nearly one-fifth of the strong baseline FRAGAN. It outperforms the strong baseline under five representative image quality evaluation criteria: SSIM, PSNR, NRMSE, LPIPS, and FID by 0.009, 0.791, 0.008, 0.040, and 7.967 on the small-scale dataset. In terms of visualization, the facial details show apparent NIR features, proving that the generated images are of high visual quality. Finally, the trained generator can produce possible NIR photographs of the CG characters under the same image acquisition conditions as the training dataset."

    "abstract": "Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an essential instrument for Earth observation but is vulnerable to intentional electromagnetic jamming during imaging. Two-dimensional (2D) deceptive jamming can introduce highly realistic false targets into SAR images, severely impairing scene interpretation and undermining the reliability of remote sensing missions. Multichannel/static SAR systems exploit additional spatial degrees of freedom to locate the jammer and suppress its signals through spatial filtering, thereby achieving anti-deceptive jamming and ensuring the robustness of remote sensing operations. However, existing multichannel/static methods require excessive system channels and are effective only against limited types of jamming, such as range deception. This paper proposes a bistatic SAR-based method for anti-2D deceptive jamming. The method requires only two channels and a single-pass imaging acquisition while effectively suppressing all types of deceptive jamming, including range, azimuth, and 2D. Compared with existing methods, it achieves broader deceptive jamming type adaptability while reducing both channel and acquisition requirements. First, a method is developed to extract deceptive jamming discrepancy from the two channels of bistatic SAR, which simultaneously enables false target detection. Then, a unified mathematical relationship is established between the extracted jamming discrepancy and the jammer's 2D position, allowing accurate localization. Finally, the 2D minimum variance distortionless response digital beamforming technique is applied to spatially filter the jammer signals and suppress the deception. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "More than one fifth of American adults lives with chronic pain. As pain chronifies, the underlying neuronal circuitry undergoes maladaptive spatial and temporal changes. We previously developed and used an advanced CMOS sensor to record video of ventral tegmental area (VTA) activity in response to acute pain and pain chronification. Here we use both discriminative and generative AI approaches to spatiotemporally characterize the VTA's complex response to pain and quantify changes in its circuit dynamics murine chronic pain models. We trained a time-attention convolutional neural network (TA-CNN) and used its gradient-weighted class activation maps (Grad CAMs) to spatially isolate activity which differentiates pre- and post-surgical responses to stimulation. Next, we implemented an unsupervised vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to learn a dense, discrete representation of the VTA's response in terms of a codebook of spatiotemporal motifs. The TA-CNN's (test set accuracy 0.787) CAMs help isolate post-surgery activity differences to the inferior segments of the VTA for partial sciatic nerve ligation (PNL) subjects but not sham subjects. The VQ-VAE (validation mean squared error 0.00732) identifies distinct spatiotemporal motifs which spatially correspond to observed VTA sub-regions. Furthermore, these motifs show changes in both spatial organization and time-response to pain after PNL but not after sham operation. These motifs also exhibit intensified spatiotemporal responses to varying intensities of mechanical stimulation in post-PNL recordings. The use of AI to fit complex space-time dynamics to an ordered latent representation or code paves the way for nuanced analysis of previously difficult-to-approach problems."

    "abstract": "Recently, multi-view learning has witnessed a considerable interest on the research of trusted decision-making. Previous methods are mainly inspired from an important paper published by Han et al. in 2021, which formulates a Trusted Multi-view Classification (TMC) framework that aggregates evidence from different views based on Dempster's combination rule. All these methods only consider inter-view aggregation, yet lacking exploitation of intra-view information. In this paper, we propose a generalized trusted multi-view classification framework with hierarchical opinion aggregation. This hierarchical framework includes a two-phase aggregation process: the intra-view and inter-view aggregation hierarchies. In the intra aggregation, we assume that each view is comprised of common information shared with other views, as well as its specific information. We then aggregate both the common and specific information. This aggregation phase is useful to eliminate the feature noise inherent to view itself, thereby improving the view quality. In the inter-view aggregation, we design an attention mechanism at the evidence level to facilitate opinion aggregation from different views. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the pioneering efforts to formulate a hierarchical aggregation framework in the trusted multi-view learning domain. Extensive experiments show that our model outperforms some state-of-art trust-related baselines.

Open datasets rarely pair wearable-derived waveforms with simultaneous ground-truth invasive blood pressure measurements during motion and hemodynamic stress. The ErgoBP dataset comprises recordings from 25 healthy adults who performed moderate- to high-intensity exercise on a cycle ergometer in two body positions. For each participant, approximately one hour of data was collected, spanning rest, graded exercise, and recovery in each posture, encompassing diverse cardiovascular mechanics. Measurements include invasive radial artery blood pressure, photoplethysmography, electrocardiography, wrist accelerometry, and radial tonometry. The dataset includes segmented waveforms, summary measures, quality indices, and auxiliary scripts to aid preprocessing and analysis. The inclusion of invasive blood pressure during exercise in multiple body positions distinguishes ErgoBP from other openly available datasets."

We develop a comprehensive system that detects potholes and multiple crack types (e.g., alligator, transverse, longitudinal), estimates their size/severity, and is architected to transmit evidence and metadata to a cloud service to support timely action by authorities. Central to our approach is the Frame Span Interval (FSI), which imposes a temporal window (with spatial tolerance) so that consecutive detections of the same physical anomaly at a specific location are consolidated into a single event-preventing duplicate counts, enabling accurate real-time tallying, and stabilizing downstream tracking metrics. The prototype, built with a Raspberry Pi, camera module, and CNN-based model with a laptop host, demonstrates on-device inference and local logging; backend integration and notifications are future work. This integrated approach targets the mitigation of accident risk arising from roadway damage and supports safer road conditions for the broader community."

The system detects and classifies four distinct types of hand: myleft, myright, yourleft, and yourright, enabling perspective-aware interaction. To boost computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy, Ghost Convolution (GhostConv) layers were used in place of standard convolutional (Conv) layers in layers 3 and 7, reducing redundancy and improving inference speed. The proposed model was trained and tested on the EgoHands dataset, which includes complex hand-object interactions across varied conditions. Experimental results show the framework achieves $98 \\%$ precision, $97 \\%$ recall, $\\mathbf{9 7 \\% ~ F 1}$-score, and $\\mathbf{9 9 \\% ~ m A P} \\text{@} \\mathbf{5 0}$, while running at 204 frames per second with a latency of just 4.9 milliseconds. Relative to the standard YOLOv11, enhanced YOLOv11 achieves a $12.21 \\%$ increase in inference speed with a $10.91 \\%$ decrease in latency on the EgoHands dataset. Compared to prior works, our proposed YOLOv11 model establishes a new benchmark in efficiency and effectiveness."

These representations capture detailed visual descriptions of the disease, the major causes, and the major symptoms related to chest X-rays. These representations are paired with medical images to pre-train BiomedCLIP using contrastive learning, effectively aligning vision and language modalities without the need for large-scale manual annotations. We then fine-tune the vision encoder for chest X-ray disease classification. Our results show that this approach achieves competitive performance, even with limited supervision. This work highlights the potential of structured generative supervision to scale vision-language learning in data-constrained medical domains."

    "abstract": "Multi-pinhole SPECT of the brain is capable of producing high-resolution images. However, pinhole imaging of high-energy photons remains challenging due to the trade-off of greatly sacrificing sensitivity to limit penetration through the edges of the pinholes and system shielding. The impact of photon penetration on spatial resolution, image contrast, and lesion signal-to-noise was assessed through simulation for the brain-dedicated multi-pinhole system AdaptiSPECT-C. In addition, minor changes to the system design to reduce penetration were considered; these were updating the materials of the pinhole aperture edges and shutters to a higher-density tungsten alloy and including platinum in the shielding around the pinhole apertures. A significant degradation in spatial resolution, image contrast, and signal-to-noise above approximately 200 keV was found with the current system design. It was shown that adapting the pinhole and shutter material to a higher-density tungsten alloy would greatly reduce this degradation and permit multi-pinhole imaging with 177Lu and 111In in the human brain. Incorporating a small amount of platinum around each aperture further improved the system point-spread function. However, results indicate high-resolution imaging of 131I would require a larger modification to the system design."

The Python programming language has recently become the language of choice for introductory programming courses thanks to its simple syntax and broad applicability. However, even with a beginner-friendly programming language such as Python, learners benefit most when instruction is thoughtfully organized and flexible enough to meet their diverse needs. This paper presents EduPythontology, an educational ontology specifically developed to support the teaching and learning of Python through a semantically structured knowledge representation. The ontology formalizes programming concepts and their instructional relationships by capturing both logical dependencies and pedagogically motivated sequences based on established educational theories and research findings. This, in turn, enables the design of adaptive learning paths. In addition, EduPythontology combines instructional design components related to learning goals, cognitive complexity, learner preferences and resource types to facilitate the personalization of learning paths. During the development of the ontology, we followed the METHONTOLOGY framework as our main methodological reference, though some phases were slightly adapted to better match the goals of this work. The ontology was developed through iterative cycles of concept definition, relation refinement and validation. Logical consistency was verified using automated reasoning, and competency questions confirmed that the model met its purpose. Expert review led to minor revisions that improved clarity. The final version proved to be clear and consistent. It offers a dependable base for further work on intelligent tutoring tools in Python education."

    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a powerful tool that has been extensively applied to many different applications. However, recent developments at CNN have revealed its vulnerability against adversarial example attacks. By introducing visually undetectable noise to the input image, an adversarial example attack can cause the CNN classifier to make false predictions. Multiple approaches have been proposed to defend against adversarial samples, one of which focuses on injecting noise into CNN during training. However, the existing method cannot generate noise efficiently and introduces extra time and energy overhead. In this paper, we propose an Importance-Aware undervolting training framework to improve CNN robustness. The undervolting technique is employed during training for noise generation at negligible overhead. Meanwhile, we observe that the neuron importance and bit importance in hardware can be leveraged during undervolting CNN training for controllable and flexible noise injection, which improves robustness. We design a position-aware bit mapping method in the memory unit by allocating data bits based on significance. And an importanceaware processing element (PE) mapping is also proposed at the computation unit for noise restriction. Our approach regularizes the noise injected into CNN and serves as an efficient method to defend against adversarial example attacks with significant energy savings. The proposed framework is evaluated through both FPGA implementation and software simulation. The experiment results show that our importance-aware undervolting CNN training achieves 47.8% adversarial accuracy at PGD-10 attack and 47.0% training energy savings."

    "abstract": "An efficient approximation of the latent soft information (SI) is a key enabler for tracking multiple targets in time-varying non-line-of-sight (NLoS) environments. Such information can be approximated by associating numerous NLoS observations with the targets' movement, a novel paradigm that transitions from the traditional “tracking after localization” approaches to a more comprehensive “tracking with localization” method. In particular, we establish the extended states (ETs) for targets to associate with their possible measurements in multipath scenarios. The joint distribution of ETs is regarded as an approximation of the latent SI at the sensor level. The information carried by ETs is then transferred to the target level for tracking using a variational message passing approach, and subsequently fed back to the sensor level to estimate the SI for future steps. We establish a factor graph depicting the propagation of information from multi-sensor measurements to multi-target states and vice versa. Numerical results including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) validate the superior performance of our proposed algorithm compared to alternative approaches."

Our approach integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for short-term prediction, Graph Neural Networks for mobility-aware placement, and Transformer networks for long-term forecasting utilizing supervised learning models with empirically validated convergence. Through comprehensive evaluation using ITU-R compliant 6G scenarios, ProactiveCPN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art reactive methods in average latency, deadline satisfaction, energy efficiency, and system throughput while maintaining robust performance across diverse mobility patterns and system loads. The framework provides a foundation for autonomous network resource management, enabling next-generation applications requiring ultra-low latency and extreme reliability."

    "abstract": "Geiger-mode avalanche photodiode LiDAR suffers from inaccurate range reconstruction under low signal-to-background ratios (SBRs) and sparse echoes. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework integrating three key innovations. First, we construct a global histogram that exploits spatial correlations in echoes to enhance photon collection efficiency. Secondly, we establish a binary hypothesis testing model based on the Neyman–Pearson criterion to develop an echo-signal detection framework that adaptively determines target intervals using likelihood ratios for accurate gating-range selection and noise removal. Finally, matched filtering enables high-fidelity Range image reconstruction. Based on simulations, under extreme conditions (SBR = 0.05 and 0.3013 photons per pixel), our method achieves a target restoration degree exceeding 0.97 enhancing the restoration degree by 10.55% relative to the other comparison methods and improving reconstruction accuracy in photon-limited scenarios. This work provides theoretical insights into photon-counting statistics and a practical solution for high-accuracy 3D reconstruction in photon-starved scenarios, with applications in autonomous sensing and remote imaging."

A special case recovers random additive codes and random binary linear codes, where each permutation corresponds to an additive shift over a finite field. We show that when these permutations are drawn from a suitably “mixing” distribution, the resulting code is almost surely list-recoverable with list size proportional to the inverse of the gap to capacity. Compared to any linear code, our construction achieves exponentially smaller list sizes at the same rate. Previously, only fully random codes were known to attain such parameters, requiring exponentially many random bits and offering no structure. In contrast, AP codes are structured and require only polynomially many random bits—providing the first such construction to match the list-recovery guarantees of random codes."

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of mobile devices and applications, a prodigious number of spatio-temporal data are generated constantly. To process these data for applications like traffic forecasting, existing spatio-temporal systems rely on the move-data-to-computation paradigm. However, this approach incurs significant data movement overhead between hosts and storage devices, particularly when a spatio-temporal query is executed on a non-preferred data layout or when the query has a small result size due to its inherent nature. To address this issue, this work introduces Groundhog, an efficient in-storage computing technique designed specifically for spatio-temporal queries, aimed at reducing unnecessary data movement and computations. Groundhog introduces three key designs for efficient in-storage computing: (i) a self-contained and segment-based storage model, which is lightweight for in-storage computing and enables fine-grained pruning for spatio-temporal queries; (ii) a set of fine-grained techniques to optimize query processing inside storage devices for spatio-temporal queries; and (iii) an in-storage-computing-aware query planner, which offloads spatio-temporal queries in a fine-grained manner using a cost-based approach. We implemented Groundhog on real hardware and demonstrated how to apply fine-grained techniques to accelerate various spatio-temporal queries.

    "abstract": "High-speed on/off valves (HSVs) are recognized for their rapid response and high reliability, and are widely employed as pilot elements in proportional valves. However, their inherent switching behavior intensifies the nonlinear characteristics of the control system, thereby limiting fluid delivery precision. In addition, the main spool of the proportional valve is subjected to significantly time-varying load forces. To address these challenges, a nonlinear flow model of the HSV is established, and the dynamics of pressure pulsation propagation are systematically analyzed. Meanwhile, a dynamic model of the proportional valve main spool is developed, explicitly incorporating the effects of time-varying load forces. Based on these models, a load-adaptive sliding mode control (LASMC) strategy is proposed to improve the motion control performance of a high-speed on/off valve–piloted proportional valve (HSVPPV). Motion control experiments conducted on the HSVPPV and its valve-controlled system validated the proposed approach. Compared to conventional PI control, LASMC reduced the main spool’s maximum displacement error from 0.696 mm to 0.312 mm (a 55.2% reduction) and standard deviation from 0.213 mm to 0.127 mm (a 40.4% reduction). At the actuator level, the cylinder’s maximum error decreased from 14.996 mm to 11.527 mm (a 23.1% reduction) and standard deviation from 11.347 mm to 10.323 mm (a 9.0% reduction). These results demonstrate that the proposed controller significantly enhances both valve positioning accuracy and overall system tracking stability."

The framework comprises three key components: (i) Floating Service, where selected user nodes temporarily act as local servers and adapt in real time to node mobility to sustain seamless service provisioning; (ii) Cooperative Caching, which supports dynamic, proximity-based content exchange among neighboring devices; and (iii) a mobility-aware service-migration predictor that forecasts user movement to guide timely service handover and cache preloading. A radio duty-cycle energy model records transmit, receive, and idle activity to estimate device-side power expenditure. Extensive simulations show that the proposed system reduces end-to-end latency by up to 87.5% for more than 90% of service requests, while the cooperative caching component lowers retrieval delay by up to 58.1% for 28% of communications. Crucially, the floating mechanism increases the average device radio duty cycle by only 1–3 percentage points, corresponding to an incremental power cost of just 3.6–24.6 mW per node. These results underscore the practicality of energy-aware, peer-assisted edge collaboration for next-generation mobile IoT deployments."

    "abstract": "The superconducting motor has prospects of a wide range of applications in aviation electric propulsion thanks to its advantages such as small size, high power density and high efficiency. However, the support structure design of superconducting motors is difficult to balance the structural strength and low heat leakage at high rotational speeds. In addition, by adopting the topological form of a spoke-type superconducting synchronous motor, the number of pole pairs in compact superconducting motors can be significantly increased and the power density of the motor can be improved. In this context, this paper proposes a spoke-type rotor support structure design for high-temperature superconducting (HTS) motors with consideration of electromagnetic properties, mechanical strength and cooling architecture. Based on the analysis of the electromagnetic topology, this paper demonstrates a modular assembly method for the rotor. In addition, the rotor core is connected to the ambient temperature shaft through a glass fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP) bracket in order to ensure good strength, controlled deformation, and low heat leakage. To verify the feasibility of this structure, the rotor stresses are analyzed by three-dimensional (3D) finite element analysis (FEA). The results show that this structure has good mechanical strength, which is conducive to maintaining the electromagnetic, mechanical environment of the motor and protecting the HTS magnets."

    "abstract": "Emerging power-electronic-based systems expose high-voltage equipment to frequent impulse stresses, posing challenges to the reliability of solid–solid insulation interfaces in components such as cable accessories. Although the breakdown characteristics of the interfaces have been widely studied, long-term degradation under such conditions remains insufficiently understood. This work investigates the performance evolution of the crosslinked polyethylene (XLPE)–ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) interface under repetitive impulse discharges. An interfacial discharge platform under impulse voltage was constructed, and the corresponding discharge signals were recorded. The surface morphologies and chemical modifications of the post-discharge specimens were characterized. Results indicate that the discharge inception voltage (DIV) first increases and then decreases with the number of impulses. The rising stage is associated with the formation of a discharge-induced surface reformation zone (DSRZ), where localized asperities on the XLPE surface are oxidized and decomposed due to particle bombardment and thermal effects, leading to reduced surface roughness and improved interfacial contact. As the discharge progresses, carbonized byproducts begin to appear and gradually accumulate, counteracting the beneficial effects of the DSRZ and resulting in the turning point of the DIV. Eventually, the effect of carbonized byproducts dominates, causing a continuous decline in the DIV and a progressive deterioration of the interfacial condition. In addition to revealing the degradation mechanism, the stage-wise evolution of electrical signals provides valuable references for the monitoring and diagnosis of insulation conditions in high-voltage systems."

This paper presents a novel strategy for optimizing UAV placement via spatial threat exclusion to achieve secure and energy-efficient links without relying on threat channel state information or complex signal processing techniques like beamforming or artificial noise. Our approach is motivated by the inherent alignment between covertness and interference mitigation; it is therefore equally applicable to interference scenarios, enhancing security by lowering detection risk and improving energy efficiency by reducing the communication distance between the UAV and the base station (BS). To ensure robustness, the model is developed for a conservative coverage-edge scenario, which represents the worst-case condition for both signal quality and secrecy, thereby serving as a lower-bound performance benchmark. The proposed method combines closed-form solutions for initial placement with iterative refinements, enabling real-time adaptation to dynamic threat mobility without extra hardware or computational burden. Two algorithms are developed: first for a single-threat, single-user scenario and then extended to multi-threat, multi-user settings. Algorithm 1 is a computationally efficient, quadratic difference-based method for rapid deployment, while Algorithm 2 is an inverse quadratic penalty-based technique for threat avoidance in dynamic environments. Simulation results for both scenarios confirm that the proposed algorithms consistently achieve positive secrecy rates across diverse propagation environments while yielding significant energy and time savings compared to an optimal-placement baseline. A comparative evaluation with a particle swarm optimization (PSO) baseline further demonstrates that our algorithms match optimal performance with substantially lower computational overhead."

The uniform histogram distribution and randomised pixel relations within encrypted images confirm the resilience against statistical attacks.

Text is the most common format for generated persona attributes, followed by numbers. Text and numbers are often generated together, and demographic attributes are included in nearly all generated personas. Researchers use up to 12 prompts in a single study, though most research uses a small number of prompts. Comparison and testing multiple LLMs is rare. More than half of the prompts require the persona output in structured format, such as JSON, and $74 \\%$ of the prompts insert data or dynamical variables.

Given the significance of this act of worship, considerable effort was devoted to teaching how to perform prayers correctly. Despite the availability of numerous educational resources online and on social media, many new Muslims still encounter difficulties in understanding and effectively applying these instructions. In this research, we developed “Yaqeen,” a real-time mobile system for recognizing Islamic prayer postures aimed at supporting new Muslims in learning prayers independently. The system leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a labeled dataset of prayer images. The VGG16 model was selected for deployment due to its superior accuracy and stability, achieving 93% classification accuracy. The trained model was converted into TensorFlow Lite format and integrated into a Flutter-based mobile application, enabling low-latency, on-device inference without requiring an internet connection.

    "abstract": "The rise of connected and autonomous vehicles introduces significant cybersecurity challenges for embedded systems. One of the most vulnerable components is the Controller Area Network (CAN), which manages communication between a vehicle’s electronic units. Originally designed without built-in security mechanisms, the CAN bus is particularly susceptible to message injection attacks. This paper presents a hybrid anomaly detection framework that combines traditional models like Support Vector Machines (SVM) with recurrent neural networks such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). We also evaluate additional algorithms, including Random Forest, Isolation Forest, and Autoencoders. The proposed architecture leverages the LSTM to extract temporal features from CAN traffic and uses the SVM for precise classification, balancing dynamic detection capabilities with real-time efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid model outperforms individual approaches in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, and Area Under the Curve (AUC), while also reducing false positive rates and increasing robustness. This makes the proposed framework a promising solution for enhancing the cybersecurity of modern in-vehicle networks."

    "abstract": "Neuromorphic computing is rapidly expanding in the field of robotics due to the remarkable efficiency of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) which offers high precision yet low memory and compute complexity inference when implemented in neuromorphic hardware. This study investigates the use of SNNs for autonomous robot navigation and obstacle avoidance based on LIDAR data and kinematic state data collected from a custombuilt platform. A key contribution of this paper is the analysis of the neuron membrane leakage constant in Leaky Integrate-andFire (LIF) neurons model which shows that proper tuning significantly improves model performance. With an optimal leakage constant, the SNN achieves statistically comparable performance to a CNN as well as being less computationally expensive."

    "abstract": "The classification of software requirements into functional and non-functional is a primordial task in requirements engineering. However, this task remains largely manual, subjective, and error-prone. This paper presents a fine-tuned BERT-based classification model to automate this task across five benchmark datasets: PROMISE_Exp, PROMISE+, IEEE Dataport, Software Requirements, and PURE Annotate. A unified preprocessing and an evaluation pipeline are applied to ensure rigorous dataset benchmarking of BERT’s effectiveness in multiclass requirements classification. The model is evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score per class, along with macro- and weighted averages to account for class imbalance. The results show that BERT achieves good performance in frequent and lexically distinct requirement types but struggles with rare or semantically overlapping classes. Confusion matrix analysis across all datasets highlights consistent misclassifications in low-support categories such as Fault Tolerance and Portability. The findings validate the utility of transformer-based architectures in requirements engineering and underscore the need for refined sampling and augmentation strategies to improve performance in rare classes."

However, they remain difficult to design, implement, verify, adapt, and reuse. To address these challenges, this paper introduces DNN-SL, a Domain-Specific Modeling Language (DSML) designed specifically for modeling and verifying DNN architectures. Our approach combines Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) with formal methods to define a multi-layer framework consisting of a DSML definition layer, an MDE implementation layer, and a Maude-based formal semantics layer. This architecture enables DNN models to automatically be translated into formal Maude specifications, thus facilitating the verification of properties including robustness and interpretability. By combining intuitive modeling with formal rigor, our solution simplifies the development of reliable and accessible DL, even for non-experts."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a quantitative non-invasive diagnostic framework for assessing early-stage degradation of 35 kV ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) T-branch cable joint insulation using dynamic infrared thermography under controlled pulse-heating (50% load equivalent). Unlike conventional steady-state methods, a reproducible 660 seconds heating pulse followed by natural cooling isolates geometric thermal delays from aging-induced impedance changes. Experiments on new and one-year field-aged specimens reveal a geometry-dominated thermal response, with thick insulation regions exhibiting a 14-minute delay in peak temperature attainment compared to thin layers. However, service aging introduces a distinct temporal signature: aged specimens demonstrate a quantifiable hysteresis in cooling dynamics and a reduced heat dissipation rate compared to new samples. Accelerated aging tests at 125-150°C confirm that oxidative crosslinking increases tensile strength (TS) by ~28.6% while reducing elongation at break (EAB) by up to 60.5%, directly correlating mechanical embrittlement with the observed increase in thermal resistance. These quantifiable dynamic metrics enable early detection of insulation degradation before electrical failure, offering a practical tool for reliability enhancement in offshore wind and industrial networks."

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows gene expression to be measured at single-cell resolution, offering new opportunities to investigate Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs), which represent the regulatory interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and their target genes. Given their relational structure, GRNs are formulated as graphs, enabling gene interaction inference to be framed as a link prediction task among graph nodes (i.e., genes). Prior work adopts Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to this end, employing their unique ability to model inter-node relationships. However, since GNNs are inherently limited to pair-wise node interactions, they struggle to capture the higher-order dependencies characteristic of GRNs. Gene expression is regulated through multi-way feedback loops involving multiple TFs and targets, and disregarding these higher-order dependencies can lower accuracy in gene interaction inference. To overcome this limitation, we introduce scHyperLink, a hypergraph-based framework for GRN reconstruction. scHyperLink models gene interactions using Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs), where hyperedges allow the simultaneous representation of multi-gene regulatory relationships. scHyperLink integrates experimentally derived interaction graphs with dynamically learned hyperedges to better reflect the underlying regulatory structure. We demonstrate that scHyperLink achieves higher accuracy than state-of-the-art on cell-type-specific benchmark datasets, particularly in sparse regimes with few known interactions. Moreover, we validate the biological relevance of scHyperLink via interpretability analyses on inferred hypergraphs and showcase its scalability to tissue-level analyses. We share the analyzed datasets and source codes for reproducibility."

    "abstract": "Satellite-based retrievals of Arctic sea ice thickness and its thermodynamic modeling typically assume a constant sea ice bulk density (IBD), disregarding its intricate seasonal variations influenced by factors such as ice age, temperature, brine content, and air intrusion. This study investigates the seasonal variability of IBD during the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition, spanning from late October 2019 to April 2020. To achieve this, we integrated sea ice thickness and snow depth observations from 15 ice mass balance buoys, snow bulk density measurements from snow pits, along with high-resolution total freeboard data from airborne laser scanning (ALS) and the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) within the MOSAiC Distributed Network (DN; 50 km radius). Assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, the regionally integrated IBD was calculated for the buoy-deployed level ice floes, covering 11 sites on second-year ice (SYI) and 4 sites on first-year ice (FYI). These buoy-based IBD estimates were then compared with direct measurements obtained at the MOSAiC Main Coring Sites (MCS). Our findings provide preliminary evidence of IBD seasonality during the Arctic freezing season: (1) From late October to early December 2019 (transition phase), the IBDs derived from both MCS-FYI and regional integration increased from ~880 to 910 kg m<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−3</sub>, possibly due to a reduced air volume fraction in the ice; (2) From late December 2019 to late April 2020 (quasi-stable phase), all IBDs largely persisted within 900−920 kg m<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−3</sub>, with modal values near 910 kg m<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−3</sub>, consistent with historical observations for the same period. However, the IBD at MCS-SYI remained relatively stable throughout the study period due to the low porosity of the sampled SYI cores. For cross-validation, the regional-scale IBD retrievals were further upscaled to characterize mean level ice conditions across the MOSAiC DN, yielding IBD seasonal patterns consistent with those observed at the buoy and coring sites. To better represent IBD in the contemporary Arctic Ocean, we propose a time-varying proxy model and explore multiple parameterizations based on the MOSAiC synergistic observations. Furthermore, the uncertainties associated with IBD retrievals and developed parameterization schemes are also assessed."

    "abstract": "With recent advancements in deepfake technology, it is now possible to generate convincing deepfakes in real-time. Unfortunately, malicious actors have started to use this new technology to perform real-time phishing attacks during video meetings. The nature of a video call allows access to what the deepfake is “seeing,” that is, the screen displayed to the malicious actor. Using this with the estimated gaze from the malicious actors streamed video enables us to estimate where the deepfake is looking on screen, the point of gaze. Because the point of gaze during conversations is not random and is instead used as a subtle nonverbal communicator, it can be used to detect deepfakes, which are not capable of mimicking this subtle nonverbal communication. This paper proposes a real-time deepfake detection method adapted to this genre of attack, utilizing previously unavailable biometric information. We built our model based on explainable features selected after careful review of research on gaze patterns during dyadic conversations. We then test our model on a novel dataset of our creation, achieving an accuracy of 82%. This is the first reported method to utilize point-of-gaze tracking for deepfake detection."

Unlike leveraging the tangent space Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) and local curvature of the low-rank embedding manifold in some very recent works, our proof provides extra upper bounds that act as analogies of the random graph lemma under EDMC setting. The APGD works surprisingly well and numerical experiments demonstrate exact linear convergence behavior in rich-sample regions yet deteriorates rapidly when compared with the performance obtained by optimizing the s-stress function, i.e., the standard but unexplained non-convex approach for EDMC, if the sample size is limited. While virtually matching our theoretical prediction, this unusual phenomenon might indicate that: (i) the power of implicit regularization is weakened when specified in the APGD case; (ii) the stabilization of such new gradient direction requires substantially more samples than the information-theoretic limit would suggest."

To characterize the attitude-orbit coupled motion in this mission under an unified parameter framework, a coupled attitude-orbit kinematics and dynamics model incorporating parametric uncertainties and external disturbances is established by employing the screw theory. Based on this mathematical model, a flexible prescribed performance control is designed, whose performance envelope dynamically adapts based on the degree of input saturation, thereby resolving the contradiction between output and input constraints. Then, a logarithmic sliding-mode manifold and the corresponding controller were established based on the equivalent error and its derivatives. To compensate for lumped uncertainty, a high-low frequency cascade observation framework is employed, integrating a classical tracking differentiator with a proposed observer. The rapid convergence of the attitude and position tracking errors is proven in presence of Lyapunov theory. Ultimately, numerical experiments are performed to validate the efficacy of the developed control strategy."

The UTSCC scheme attempts to maximize the total amount of successfully delivered target data considering realistic characteristics of the camera, UAV trajectory, transmission schedule, and selected targets. The developed framework makes decisions of the target acquisition and transmission scheduling using the exact penalty method (EPM) and applies non-convex optimization of the camera tilt angle and UAV trajectory using successive convex approximation (SCA) considering deadlines for UE delivery. The UTSCC scheme is designed to be practical for real-world UAV surveillance operations, where the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing schemes in terms of delivery performance and overall system efficiency."

These optimality conditions facilitate a practical approach for solving the proposed model. Accordingly, we develop an effective alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm. The convergence of this algorithm is demonstrated under specific conditions in both theory and practice.

    "abstract": "Industrial time series analysis is the core foundation of equipment status monitoring and industrial intelligence. However, the long-tailed distribution characteristics of time series caused by low-frequency and low-probability events seriously restrict the performance of analysis models. In key scenarios such as industrial process prediction and anomaly detection, data analysis models face obvious performance bottlenecks due to insufficient representation of tail events. Existing data augmentation methods have dual limitations in capturing tail patterns and modeling long-distance time series dependencies. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an industrial long-tailed time series generator (DLTTS) model based on a diffusion model. Firstly, a hybrid architecture generation model is constructed to deeply integrate the encoder-decoder informer structure with the traditional diffusion process to maintain long-distance time patterns and achieve long-distance time series output; Secondly, we propose Fourier-based batch-Monte Carlo (FBMC) loss to enhance the model's ability to capture low-frequency events, thereby improve the quality of tail time series generation. Experiments show that DLTTS maintains the authenticity and diversity of tail time series generation in industrial-grade long-tail time series generation tasks. It also exhibits robust performance in imputation and forecasting tasks, verifying the multiple performance advantages of this method for cross-task application."

We propose an Arabic dataset featuring diverse tasks with different prompts directly applied to acoustic features. The proposed dataset is synthesized from popular Arabic speech datasets covering various tasks such as gender identification, audio environment identification, and audio-text alignment. Moreover, we apply instruction fine-tuning to Whisper on the synthesized dataset, and our results demonstrate that Whisper can acquire new capabilities with minimal or no significant increase in word error rate (WER) and character error rate (CER). Specifically, the large Whisper model achieves an F1-score of 0.98 for gender identification, 0.76 for audio environment identification, and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.86 for audio-text alignment.

In addition to traditional ways of raising awareness such as written materials and awareness campaigns, advanced technologies also address this issue in engaging and interactive ways.

Serious games can have a significant role in educating children, motivating them to learn, and developing their critical thinking, reasoning, and problem-solving skills. This paper presents a serious game designed to promote awareness about diabetes. Specifically, awareness refers to individuals’ understanding of diabetes risk factors, symptoms, and disease management. We reviewed the literature and studied existing diabetes-related applications and their features and services. Then, we applied a user-centered design approach to design and develop of the iBeta - a serious mobile game for diabetic children- that consists of a serious game, educational lessons, and tests to confirm children’s understanding. The main goal of the application is to assist children with diabetes in managing their disease and accepting treatment. Moreover, we conducted a pilot study with a group of children, and the results showed the children developed a better understanding of diabetes and actively engaged with the content. This study demonstrates the potential of serious games as an educational tool for diabetic children and the impact of $\\mathbf{m}$-health solutions in health education."

    "abstract": "This work proposes the Named Entities Semantic Relatedness (NESR) method to compute the semantic relatedness between named entities in DBpedia. Semantic relatedness is applied in many contexts, such as entity linking and word sense disambiguation, and DBpedia is one of the largest publicly available knowledge graphs. Furthermore, named entities, which are resources that represent real-world objects, in general, in DBpedia, have richer descriptions than conceptual entities. Given two named entities, the method computes their degree of semantic relatedness considering weighted reciprocal references of adjacent resources in the paths connecting them. NESR was experimented with five datasets and compared with ten methods to compute semantic relatedness in an RDF knowledge graph. The results show that, concerning Spearman’s correlation, on average, NESR outperforms each method by at least $8 \\%$, and outperforms the method that performs best by $11 \\%$ on average."

We introduce a multi-OCR pipeline that leverages four distinct OCR engines and four fine-tuned lightweight LLMs in a two-tier majority voting framework. Through automated fine-tuning after every 500 processed records, our system demonstrates that lightweight (7B parameter) models can achieve performance comparable to much larger (27B parameter) alternatives. Experimental results show field accuracy improvements from $85.6 \\%$ to $94.5 \\%$ after three fine-tuning cycles, with processing speeds twice as fast as larger models. The continuous improvement loop enabled by our LLM-Ops framework ensures the system evolves with minimal human intervention, making advanced document intelligence more accessible and deployable for real-world applications."

    "abstract": "Automated navigation control of microrobots in complex environments is essential for applications such as targeted drug delivery and micromanipulation. Recently, machine learning (ML) has shown great potential for automated microrobot control but still lacks accuracy and smoothness. In this work, we propose a novel Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD)-based control and navigation framework to achieve precise and smooth motion control of microrobots. This work represents an early attempt to directly utilize expert-provided data for designing a learning-based microrobot controller. The framework begins by collecting a small dataset of expert demonstrations (several thousand episodes) , from which the controller learns compensatory behaviors and task-specific adaptability, eliminating the need for extensive exploration or parameter retuning. Based on this data, a time-series neural network is then developed to process the microrobot’s historical states and control actions, allowing the system to capture sequential dependencies and transitions for smooth and accurate path tracking. For demonstration, we take the magnetic microswarm as an illustrative example. Systematic simulations and comparative experiments validate the proposed framework, demonstrating its superior performance in tracking accuracy and smoothness, validating the efficacy of ML for low-level microrobot control."

    "abstract": "The power consumption flexibility of distributed energy resources (DERs) must be aggregated to enable effective interaction with power systems. However, model heterogeneity, geographical dispersion, and the large number pose significant challenges to aggregation. This paper first models DER flexibility by explicitly incorporating heterogeneity in both state variables and available time periods, represented through polytopes of heterogeneous dimensions. The aggregation of DERs is then formulated as a standard projection maximal inner approximation (MIA) problem. To efficiently and accurately solve this problem, a novel linear programming (LP)-based algorithm is developed. Furthermore, a hierarchical framework is introduced to enable large-scale aggregation, within which a Minkowski-closed family is proven, allowing accurate and efficient secondary aggregation through vector addition. In addition, generalized operating envelopes (OEs) are proposed for distribution system operators (DSOs) to establish and communicate network constraints, enabling integration into the aggregation process without disclosing sensitive network information. Numerical experiments validate the proposed formulations and demonstrate superior accuracy and scalability of the proposed method while maintaining high computational efficiency."

This study examines the deployment of BEBs by the Utah Transit Authority (UTA), utilizing real BEB charging data and analyzing simultaneous charging sessions across key stations in Salt Lake City and Ogden in Utah, US. A heuristic-based optimization framework is developed to integrate day-ahead simulation with real-time adjustments, ensuring efficient power allocation while minimizing costs and grid stress. The approach utilizes real-time energy prices and load data, along with synthetic day-ahead forecasted load data, to optimize charging schedules and improve the load factor. Additionally, power flow analysis using OpenDSS evaluates the impact of large-scale BEB integration on grid performance and is used to generate the operating envelope (OE) for the allowable charging power drawn from the grid. Results indicate that optimized charging reduces energy costs by up to 21% and 33% in Ogden and Salt Lake City, respectively, while improving load factor and minimizing peak demand. Furthermore, a 100 kWh Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) is introduced at on-route high demand charging stations to mitigate demand surges. Thus, this study highlights the importance of integrating real-time constraints with preemptive scheduling strategies and provides a scalable framework for managing BEB charging infrastructure under uncertainty."

    "abstract": "In the dynamic landscape of wireless communication systems, high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) technology heralds a new era of connectivity solutions. The HAPS ensures uninterrupted operation even under challenging conditions where connectivity via terrestrial networks is unavailable. This approach effectively supports real-time applications by dynamically optimizing resource allocation and communication modes. Considering that, this research addresses the strategic integration of HAPS into vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks. Specifically, multiple autonomous platoons using V2X technology distribute cooperative awareness messages (CAMs) to their followers, attempting to ensure the timely delivery of safety-critical messages not only to the roadside unit (RSU) but also to the HAPS, introducing link-level redundancy to the wireless network. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to minimize the age of information (AoI) and power consumption while maximizing the probability of CAM delivery rate. We utilize a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) based resource allocation framework, where each platoon leader (PL) acts as an agent and interacts with the environment to learn its optimal policy. In this framework, based on a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, in addition to a local critic trained to predict the individual reward of each PL, a global critic is also trained to predict the global expected reward and motivate PLs to cooperative behavior. The presented simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of HAPS integration in the considered V2X scenario and the superiority of the proposed algorithm over benchmark algorithms in terms of AoI and power consumption performance."

The reconstructed CSI is used by a DRL agent based on the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm to pair users across all subcarriers.

However, conventional UHF antennas suffer from limitations like excessive physical size and narrow bandwidth. This study proposes a novel Hilbert fractal curve-modified spiral antenna design to expand bandwidth without increasing the antenna’s physical dimensions. Furthermore, a symmetric open double-ring metamaterial structure is introduced to further improve the antenna’s performance. Fabricated as an 8×8 array and placed 10 mm above the Hilbert spiral antenna, this metamaterial structure significantly enhances the antenna’s gain, detection bandwidth, and directionality. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the Hilbert spiral antenna integrated with the metamaterial achieves a voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) < 2 over two wide frequency bands: 0.78–2.02 GHz and 2.22–3 GHz. This configuration delivers a 24.4% increase in operational bandwidth, a 4.61 dBi improvement in average gain, and enhanced directivity and radiation performance. This study used a partial discharge simulation platform to validate the antenna’s performance. Experimental results indicate that, at distances of 2-8 m, the metamaterial-integrated antenna exhibits 125% higher detection sensitivity than the antenna without metamaterials. Moreover, the detection range of antenna with metamaterials is expanded to 10 m."

To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel lightweight SHSR network, i.e., LKCA-Net, that incorporates channel attention to calibrate multi-scale channel features of hyperspectral images. Furthermore, we demonstrate, for the first time, that the low-rank property of the learnable upsampling layer is a key bottleneck in lightweight SHSR methods. To address this, we employ the low-rank approximation strategy to optimize the parameter redundancy of the learnable upsampling layer. Additionally, we introduce a knowledge distillation-based feature alignment technique to ensure the low-rank approximated network retains the same feature representation capacity as the original. We conducted extensive experiments on the Chikusei, Houston 2018, and Pavia Center datasets compared to some SOTAs. The results demonstrate that our method is competitive in performance while achieving speedups of several dozen to even hundreds of times compared to other well-performing SHSR methods.

    "abstract": "The proliferation of hate speech on social media platforms presents a significant challenge for content moderation, requiring sophisticated detection methods that can understand both explicit and implicit forms of harmful content. Traditional approaches struggle with contextual nuances and evolving patterns of online hate speech. We propose a novel architecture BERT-OTA (Ontology Transformer with Attention) that integrates ontological knowledge with transformer attention mechanisms to address these limitations. Our approach employs a dual-stream architecture: processing text through BERT with scaled dot-product attention while simultaneously learning ontological features through a two-layer Graph Convolutional Network. This design enables the model to leverage both contextual understanding and structured domain knowledge about hate speech categories and their relationships. Through experiments on a combined dataset of 48,049 samples from three established collections (Davidson, Impermium, and Waseem & Hovy), we evaluate BERT-OTA against seven distinct architectures, including BERT-based hybrid models and graph neural networks (GNN). Our results demonstrate that BERT-OTA achieves state-of-the-art performance with 91.30% accuracy and 91.32% F1-score, outperforming all other models. The performance improvements of our ontology-guided approach highlight the potential of structured knowledge integration in hate speech detection, offering valuable insights for developing robust online content moderation systems."

    "abstract": "We review the development of photolithography for semiconductor manufacturing from early 1960s to the present. From the 1960s to early 1970s, contact and proximity printing were the only methods used in manufacturing, achieving a minimum critical dimension of about 4 μm. Projection lithography was adopted in manufacturing with the advent of Perkin-Elmer’s unit-magnification wafer scanners in the 1970s, and was advanced with the arrival of wafer steppers from GCA, Canon, Nikon, ASML, and others, employing mercury (Hg) arc lamps as the light source. These Hg g-line (436 nm in wavelength) machines provided about 0.8-μm practical resolution in the fab. Wafer steppers using the Hg i-line (365 nm in wavelength) came to wide use starting about 1990. Combined with off-axis illumination, i-line lithography was able to reach below 0.35 μm in resolution. Deep ultraviolet lithography using the KrF excimer laser (248 nm in wavelength) came next, entering into production at about 1997 for the 0.25-μm logic node (with a minimum half-pitch of 0.25 μm), followed by the adoption of ArF-excimer-laser lithography (193 nm in wavelength), whose initial use in manufacturing, for the 0.13-?m node of logic integrated circuits, took place in 2001. Massive transition to 193-nm lithography happened in the 90-nm node. 193-nm lithography employing water immersion entered production at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) in 2007 at the 40-nm node and enabled continued geometrical scaling for more than a decade with multiple-patterning techniques. Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography entered into manufacturing in 2019 and printed dense lines of 20-nm half-pitch that year. With the arrival of the 0.55 NA EUV scanner in 2024, dense lines of less than 10-nm half-pitch can now be printed. In the course of sixty-five years, photolithography achieved a greater than 400X reduction in linear dimension and enabled a 2×105 increase in areal density."

    "abstract": "Efficient task execution is critical in mission-driven Edge-Computing (EC)-based IoT applications such as UAV-assisted weather nowcasting. Although UAV fleets improve the resolution and responsiveness of short-term forecasts, their limited on-board computation and battery life demand a cooperative task offloading strategy. Volunteer vehicular edge networks, leveraging idle onboard units of nearby vehicles, offer scalable, low-cost resources. To incentivize task offloading from UAVs to self-interested vehicles, in this work, we introduce a distributed Dutch auction with second-price payments. The proposed scheme is suited for efficient and time-sensitive allocations. Furthermore, to overcome the challenge of non-trivial task valuation, we embed lightweight Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents that dynamically learn valuation policies. Conducted experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves up to $-93 \\%$ in information revelation compared to sealed-bid auctions, up to $-50 \\%$ the communication overhead of the best baseline, and linear computation complexity, while preserving high social welfare, which is further improved by the integration of RL."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel framework to accelerate route prediction in Drone-as-a-Service operations through weather-aware deep learning models. While classical pathplanning algorithms, such as $\\mathrm{A}^{*}$ and Dijkstra, provide optimal solutions, their computational complexity limits real-time applicability in dynamic environments. We address this limitation by training machine learning and deep learning models on synthetic datasets generated from classical algorithm simulations. Our approach incorporates transformer-based and attention-based architectures that utilize weather heuristics to predict optimal nextnode selections while accounting for meteorological conditions affecting drone operations. The attention mechanisms dynamically weight environmental factors including wind patterns, wind bearing, and temperature to enhance routing decisions under adverse weather conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our weather-aware models achieve significant computational speedup over traditional algorithms while maintaining route optimization performance, with transformer-based architectures showing superior adaptation to dynamic environmental constraints. The proposed framework enables real-time, weatherresponsive route optimization for large-scale DaaS operations, representing a substantial advancement in the efficiency and safety of autonomous drone systems."

    "abstract": "Information extraction and analysis in healthcare have benefited significantly from advances in the AI and NLP community in recent years, often directly impacting human lives or at least their well-being. However, processing and analyzing mostly unstructured and semi-structured health and biomedical information presents substantial challenges to researchers. The inherent complexity of the domain, limited data availability, data ambiguity, and the high cost of involving medical experts make supporting healthcare difficult. With the recent revolution in AI, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs), the quality of analyses of these data has increased significantly - though it has not yet reached the level required by medical practitioners. In this work, we address the challenge of information reasoning and question answering, with a particular focus on healthcare. We conduct a detailed analysis of PubMedQA, one of the most challenging and prominent benchmarks. We design, implement, and evaluate Med-RCQ (Medical Reasoning by Concluding and Questioning), a novel LLM-based method to analyze health and biomedical information with the objective of supporting informed decisions. Our PubMedQA benchmark results show that MedRCQ outperforms most competing open approaches in terms of result quality and even provides similar results compared to large commercial models, while outperforming all other benchmark results in an ‘accuracy per number of model parameters’ metric."

We derive their marginal and joint distributions, establish concentration inequalities that depend on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and analyze their covariance structures. Based on these results, we derive an upper bound on the probability of incorrectly identifying the time-scale ridge of the clean signal, explore the regularity of scalogram contours, and study the relationship between AWT magnitude and phase. Our findings lay the groundwork for developing rigorous AWT-based algorithms in noisy environments."

    "abstract": "Nonlinear microscopy enables label-free imaging by deriving contrast from the intrinsic spectroscopic responses of specimens, thereby offering a valuable tool for biomedical applications. Often, clinical imaging systems implement either multiphoton or vibrational contrast, not both. Consequently, most clinically deployed label-free nonlinear microscopes lack a robust, complementary contrast palette suitable for investigating the morphofunctional features of heterogeneous specimens. This deficiency limits not only the analytical capabilities of the nonlinear microscope but also its diagnostic utility. A main reason for this disregard is that the various imaging modalities impose distinct and stringent requirements on the excitation source and the detection chain. In this contribution, we propose a strategy that targets both multiphoton and vibrational contrasts to achieve a robust, complementary contrast palette. The approach emerges from a systematic investigation of readout schemes and provides engineering criteria to tailor the detection chain and thus maximize quantitative performance. In concert with this detection strategy, we present a compact laser source that drives vibrational coherences while simultaneously exciting multiphoton signals. We validate the resulting imaging platform using two rodent case studies: one involving a naturally occurring metastatic cancer in a mouse and another relying on an allogeneic mammary cancer model in a rat. Owing to its dimensions, cost, and versatility, we anticipate that this biophotonics tool will readily find its way into clinical applications."

However, the quadratic non-convexity of the steady-state Weymouth equation poses significant challenges to the optimality. To address this issue, an eigenvalue-based hidden convexity (EBHC) algorithm is proposed in this paper. By exploiting the hidden convexity of the OHF, the original non-convex formulation is decomposed into an upper-level second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem and multiple lower-level non-convex quadratically programming with one quadratic constraint (QP1QC) subproblems. Each QP1QC subproblem is further reformulated into a tractable generalized eigenvalue problem (GEP), which can be solved in parallel. An ADMM-inspired iterative scheme is then employed, where lower-level variables are used to successively refine the upper-level SOCP solution until convergence is achieved. Numerical results on various systems demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm."

However, current IDS models face challenges such as class imbalance, redundant features, and a lack of interpretability. To address the above issues, this research proposes an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) driven IDS that integrates deep learning and optimization methods to improve the classification of DoS attacks. A reweighted auxiliary classifier generative adversarial network with gradient penalty is employed for data augmentation. An EfficientNet-B0 with hybrid attention modules enhances the feature extraction process, identifying critical patterns. A multiplicative Luong attention deep residual multiscale convolutional neural network is utilized to enhance the robustness and accuracy of network traffic sample categorization by extracting context features. The enhanced starfish optimization algorithm is employed to tune the hyperparameters of the proposed method, minimizing computational complexity while maximizing classification accuracy. To enhance the transparency and trust in model decisions, shapely additive explanations and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations are implemented, offering insight into feature importance, thereby improving both the transparency and reliability of the IDS. The proposed method is executed on five datasets: NSL-KDD, CSE-CIC-IDS2018, CCIDS2019, KDD-Cup99, and UNSW-NB15, attaining classification accuracies of 99.99%, 99.96%, 99.97%, 99.96% and 99.95%, respectively, and it performs better than the current techniques."

    "abstract": "Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices often rely on public communication channels for authentication, which makes them particularly susceptible to a variety of security threats. Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) provides a lightweight cryptographic method to address authentication challenges in resource-constrained devices. However, some PUF-based authentication frameworks store challenge-response pairs (CRPs) centrally on a server, posing risks of single point failure and performance bottlenecks in the authentication process. Although blockchain (BC) can mitigate this through decentralized storage, they still suffer from high computational overhead, large CRPs storage requirements, limited authentication efficiency, and ledger synchronization latency challenges. Therefore, we propose a novel direct mutual authentication framework for IIoT devices and peer nodes in consortium BCs, called PUF-D2PB. It enables peer nodes and IIoT devices to authenticate each other without involving BC-clients, and simultaneously supports CRP updates without requiring extra operations. In addition, we introduce a competition-based mechanism and a distributed encryption method to enhance CRP synchronization and prevent CRP leakage. Security analysis and a prototype implementation using a real PUF circuit demonstrate that our framework provides strong security guarantees and efficient authentication. Compared with existing BC-assisted PUF schemes, PUF-D2PB effectively reduces authentication latency and resource overhead while preventing CRP leakage."

This work analyses the effect of degradation due to oxidative aging and the influence of contaminants (copper and cellulose) on natural ester density, viscosity, absorbance and dissolved decay products, as well as dielectric properties (real part of relative permittivity, dissipation factor and conductivity). Four aging periods (0, 164, 332 and 500 hours) and four contaminant conditions (without contaminants, with copper, with cellulose kraft paper and with copper and cellulose kraft paper combination) are considered. The results show that the combination of copper and cellulose exhibits a synergistic effect, causing the most pronounced degradation of all measured properties, causing the gelation of the 500-hour sample."

To address this, a computational model for moisture diffusion and exchange in oil-paper insulation is developed. Through experimental measurements of spatiotemporal moisture distribution in oil-impregnated pressboard and oil moisture content evolution, temperature-dependent relationships for the diffusion coefficient <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">D</i> and interfacial moisture exchange coefficient α are established. Subsequent temperature-varying experiments reveal interfacial exchange hysteresis relative to temperature changes, with hysteresis loop areas expanding with increasing temperature variation rates, temperature ranges, and initial moisture content. Integrated model-experimental analysis demonstrates that interfacial moisture exchange exhibits higher activation energy than the diffusion process, establishing it as the rate-limiting step. Furthermore, moisture accumulation fundamentally stems from coupled interfacial kinetic hysteresis induced by high activation and abrupt solubility changes, where sluggish interfacial exchange during cooling fails to match rapidly escalating oil supersaturation levels. These findings provide theoretical foundations for dynamic moisture prediction in transformer insulation systems and operational load management strategies."

    "abstract": "Guidance poses a significant issue in aerospace vehicle development. Simultaneous impacts and higher lethality necessitate constraints on impact time and angles, posing a substantial obstacle to effective guidance law design. Similarly, the flexibility and maneuverability of aerospace vehicles, which require a designable acceleration profile, are equally essential issues in guidance law design. Therefore, to overcome the limited selectable constraint ranges and the challenges of shaping acceleration profiles in existing guidance laws, without sacrificing their penetration and cooperation capabilities, a three-stage catenary-based guidance law is proposed that considers constrained impact and robustness to external disturbances. To begin with, the desired launch angle and initial velocity direction of the catenary are enforced during the first stage, which uses a circular arc. Subsequently, the impact time constraint is met in the second catenary-based stage, and the final stage employs an additional circular arc to enforce the desired impact angle. Using the proposed analytical geometric rules, trajectory parameters are determined explicitly. Meanwhile, a robust guidance law is developed, with all constraints met. The proposed guidance law requires no numerical calculations, nonlinear model linearization, or reliance on time-to-go error estimation, making it convenient to implement. Furthermore, the proposed guidance law extends the range of available time constraints from the minimum to infinity and the range of angle constraints from 0 degrees to 360 degrees, thereby addressing the issue of a wide range of spatiotemporal multi-constraints. The adaptability issue arising from an extensive range of impact time constraints and arbitrary angle constraints is addressed by a shapeable acceleration profile, enabling the maximum acceleration value or peak time to be adjusted to meet mission requirements. Various disturbed-engagement scenarios are simulated, and numerous analyses are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed sliding mode control guidance law."

    "abstract": "Traditional skin-contact physical sensors typically detect changes of blood volume to predict the periodicity of heartbeat by analyzing the absorption spectra of hemoglobin. However, the contact on human skin may cause uncomfortable feeling and induce difficulty for long-term monitoring. Recently, video-based remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) estimation approaches analyze the periodic facial color changes for matching cardiac cycle in a contactless manner. Nevertheless, the inherent relationship between the changes of facial color and blood volume is not fully exploited. Besides the influence of blood volume (i.e., hemoglobin), there are also other factors such as lighting and reflection that cause the change on facial color. We exploit the physical principles that cause skin color variations to separate the hemoglobin factor driven by blood volume. Based on the physical prior of the reflection of human skin, we introduce an rPPG estimation network assisted by decoupled hemoglobin sequence, named HemNet, which first explicitly leverages hemoglobin to assist rPPG signal estimation. To obtain meaningful hemoglobin from facial video, we design a human skin color disentangler that decouples the facial color variations into four significant features, i.e., hemoglobin, melanin, shading, and specular. We then present a multi-modality rPPG estimator that utilizes cross-covariance attention to extract fused feature from hemoglobin and RGB video inputs. Finally, an adaptive negative Pearson loss is proposed to effectively address phase misalignment between the blood volume in the finger and facial region during the training phase. We evaluate our HemNet on four widely used public benchmark datasets. The superiority of our method is demonstrated in both intra-dataset and cross-dataset test settings. The code is available at https://github.com/jingang-cv/hemnet."

Despite their success in tasks focused solely on RGB images, the potential of VFMs in RGB-depth driving scene parsing remains largely under-explored. In this article, we take one step toward this emerging research area by investigating a feasible technique to fully exploit VFMs for generalizable RGB-depth driving scene parsing. Specifically, we explore the inherent characteristics of RGB and depth data, thereby presenting a Heterogeneous Feature Integration Transformer (HFIT). This network enables the efficient extraction and integration of comprehensive heterogeneous features without re-training ViTs. Relative depth prediction results from VFMs, used as inputs to the HFIT side adapter, overcome the limitations of the dependence on depth maps. Our proposed HFIT demonstrates superior performance compared to all other traditional single-modal and data-fusion scene parsing networks, pre-trained VFMs, and ViT adapters on the Cityscapes and KITTI Semantics datasets. We believe this novel strategy paves the way for future innovations in VFM-based data-fusion techniques for driving scene parsing.

    "abstract": "Predicting the risk of subsequent miscarriage during the first trimester is crucial for optimizing ultrasound surveillance and alleviating psychological distress for pregnant women. This study aims to develop a multi-input convolutional neural network (CNN) that integrates early gestational ultrasound images with clinical measurements to assess miscarriage risk, while providing interpretable visual explanations to support clinical decision-making. Utilizing a retrospective dataset of singleton pregnancies at 6–8 weeks of gestation, we extracted gestational sac regions through three distinct segmentation strategies and trained a CNN-based classifier to differentiate between normal and miscarriage outcomes. The predictive performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The results indicated that the multi-input CNN outperformed single-input models. Additionally, an edge-expanded segmentation strategy demonstrated superior performance compared to both precise segmentation and rectangular cropping. By incorporating Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), we identified subchorionic regions as significant biomarkers and clarified the differences in attention to features among different models, thereby enhancing the interpretability and clinical applicability of the model for early pregnancy risk assessment."

    "abstract": "Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are at the forefront of scientific machine learning, making possible the creation of machine intelligence that is cognizant of physical laws and able to accurately simulate them. However, today’s PINNs are often trained for a single physics task and require computationally expensive re-training for each new task, even for tasks from similar physics domains. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a pioneering approach to advance the generalizability of PINNs through the framework of Baldwinian evolution. Drawing inspiration from the neurodevelopment of precocial species that have evolved to learn, predict and react quickly to their environment, we envision PINNs that are pre-wired with connection strengths inducing strong biases towards efficient learning of physics. A novel two-stage stochastic programming formulation coupling evolutionary selection pressure (based on proficiency over a distribution of physics tasks) with lifetime learning (to specialize on a sampled subset of those tasks) is proposed to instantiate the Baldwin effect. The evolved Baldwinian-PINNs demonstrate fast and physics-compliant prediction capabilities across a range of empirically challenging problem instances with more than an order of magnitude improvement in prediction accuracy at a fraction of the computation cost compared to state-of-the-art gradient-based meta-learning methods. For example, when solving the diffusion-reaction equation, a 70x improvement in accuracy was obtained while taking 700x less computational time. This paper thus marks a leap forward in the evolutionary meta-learning of PINNs as generalizable physics solvers. Sample codes are available at."

    "abstract": "Accurate line and transformer parameters are essential for all application functions in the energy management system. Assessment and decision results will be distorted if parameter errors exist. This paper proposes a novel robust method for simultaneous identification and correction of multiple parameter errors in power networks using a relaxation-regularization technique. The parameter error identification problem is first formulated as a regularized multi-snapshot weighted least squares problem with adjustable constraints on parameter ranges. Erroneous parameters are identified by solving the regularized problem multiple times with increasing regularization parameters. Analytical justification is provided that, by penalizing the parameter ranges through the regularization term, the ranges of correct parameters will rapidly shrink while the shrinkage of erroneous parameters' ranges is much slower. The model is then converted into a robust Huber M-estimation formulation with inequality constraints, which rejects bad measurements automatically. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified using a large number of erroneous parameter combinations under different measurement noise levels, measurement redundancies and scenarios containing bad measurements with promising results."

Sentiment semantic analysis and scoring were initially performed using GPT-4, customized with domain-specific prompts to capture nuanced terminology, representing a novel application to small, domain-specific news datasets. Based on these scores, data were labeled as positive, negative, or neutral. For semantic classification, a TF-IDF-SVM-OvR model with a linear kernel was developed, incorporating feature engineering tailored to low-resource, small-domain datasets and imbalance-aware OvR classification. Its performance was compared against six traditional machine learning models (Random Forest, GBM, KNN, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM-OvR with RBF kernel) and five deep learning models (TextCNN, LSTM-CNN, MobileNet, TinyBERT, OfficialSimpleTransformer) across four datasets (Sports, Science, Agriculture, and Mixed). The linear SVM-OvR consistently achieved the highest test accuracies (81.8 – 87.1%) and F1 scores (81.2 – 85.5%), significantly outperforming baselines (p < 0.05), while maintaining moderate training times (6.9–75.6 s) and low model sizes (0.47–1.44 MB). Additionally, the Qwen2-Birch combination was employed for thematic clustering, effectively capturing nuanced sentiment and topics. These results highlight the practical value of this integrated approach for small, domain-specific datasets, emphasizing robustness, efficiency, and reproducibility."

Training large-scale deep models on radiological imaging data remains challenging due to data scarcity, heterogeneity, and strict privacy constraints that limit data sharing across institutions. FL addresses these challenges by employing collaborative model training that does not expose raw patient data, while generative models synthesize realistic medical images to alleviate scarcity and imbalance. The convergence of these two fields has given rise to federated generative models (FGMs), which extend Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAE), and Diffusion models into distributed and privacy-preserving environments. FGMs have demonstrated significant potential in various medical imaging tasks, including data augmentation, image reconstruction, cross-modality conversion, and enhancing classification and segmentation models. Despite promising progress, the field remains in its early stages, facing open challenges in communication efficiency, scalability, data heterogeneity, and clinical reliability. This survey provides a comprehensive review of FGMs in medical imaging, analyzing their architectures, applications, and benchmark datasets, while highlighting key challenges and outlining future research directions to advance privacy-preserving generative modeling in healthcare."

    "abstract": "Conventional multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) wireless caching networks (WCNs) usually operate in a distributed and non-collaborative manner, where each UAV serves users independently without coordination or relay support. When UAVs move beyond the communication range of ground base stations (BSs), backhaul disruption occurs, leading to high user latency and limited system scalability. To address these issues, we propose a multi-layer UAV-assisted NOMA WCN architecture, where a primary UAV (PUAV) communicates with the BS and cooperates with multiple secondary UAVs (SUAVs). The PUAV not only acts as a control and coordination hub but also serves as a relay for content transmission to SUAVs when necessary. To minimize user transmission latency, we propose a joint iterative algorithm that integrates user clustering, user pairing, power allocation, and UAV deployment. First, we develop an Advanced Balanced K-Means++ (ABKM) algorithm to ensure that each cluster contains a balanced number of users and to reduce the distance between users and their serving SUAVs. Next, we derive the NOMA power allocation factor that minimizes user transmission latency, ensuring efficient resource distribution among all paired users. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of PUAV and SUAV placement on user latency and propose a two-stage particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based algorithm to iteratively optimize the deployment of all UAVs. Finally, the user pairs and power allocation are jointly optimized based on the updated deployment of all UAVs to further reduce user latency. Simulation results show that, compared with a single-layer UAV architecture and benchmark schemes, the proposed multi-layer design with joint optimization achieves lower user latency. Additionally, comparisons with the optimal power allocation search method confirm the validity of the derived NOMA power allocation factor."

We present a data-driven approach to generating personas representing differing religious views of Ramadan, based on a large-scale survey conducted in four Muslim-majority countries: Egypt, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia. Our approach furthers the representation of underrepresented groups by embedding religious and cultural factors in persona development, aligning with the principles of value-sensitive design. Via correlation analysis, we identified seven distinct groups that reflect diverse practices and values during the Islamic holy month. These findings informed persona creation, capturing variations in spiritual engagement, digital media consumption, and the planning of Ramadan. The resulting personas provide actionable insights for developers designing inclusive applications such as charitable platforms and ecommerce systems aligned with Muslim values. We discuss the implications of employing personas for culturally aware system design and demonstrate how AI-generated personas can support inclusive design in religiously diverse settings. Ultimately, this work contributes to the growing research on human-centered technologies for value-aligned and context-aware systems."

    "abstract": "In recent years, Compressed Sensing (CS) has attracted significant interest in acquiring high-resolution sensory signals while minimizing the amount of signal samples to be measured (so-called sub-Nyquist sampling). At the same time, autonomous robot navigation, such as rovers and drones, is increasingly used for remote data acquisition and environmental data sampling (e.g., temperature, humidity, air quality indicators, etc.). In this context, this paper presents a novel method of preparing the robot data acquisition path that takes advantage of the structure of the measurement matrices used in CS in order to derive robot navigation paths. In particular, we propose a novel Monte-Carlo optimization approach for generating wellsuited measurement matrices that jointly lead to short robot path lengths while minimizing the signal recovery error during the CS procedure. Crucially, our method uses Dictionary Learning (DL) to generate a well-suited CS sparsifying transform matrix, enabling high-precision signal recovery while minimizing the number of samples the robot needs to sense. Our proposed method is applied to recover $N O_{2}$ pollutant maps from the Gulf region. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method reduces the length of the robot data acquisition paths to less than 10% of the total path length normally required for total area coverage, while leading to high-precision signal recovery, achieving more than $\\times 5$ lower signal recovery errors compared to the use of standard DCT- and Polynomial-based CS procedures."

Our investigation reveals that hallucination rates vary significantly across readability levels and part-of-speech categories, with adjectives showing particularly high susceptibility to factual errors. We propose a novel ensemble detection framework that combines lightweight linguistic feature classifiers, Arabic-specific self-consistency heuristics based on hedging patterns, and fine-tuned multilingual transformer verification.

Our results show clear trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, providing guidance for selecting imputation strategies in aggregation-based analytical pipelines."

    "abstract": "Modern life is generally stressful, so many people choose to keep pets as a source of emotional support. Dogs are one of the most popular choices for pets. However, dogs cannot speak and cannot express their emotions and state of mind. Therefore, being able to effectively interpret a dog’s emotions can help establish and improve the relationship between humans and pets. This paper proposes a system based on deep learning for automatic recognition of dog expressions. The system aims to quickly identify the emotions of pets, thereby predicting the current emotional state of their dogs at any time, and strengthening the connection between owners and their pets. The study uses a dataset of Border Collies containing five emotions for training. The prediction process first uses the YOLOv8 object detection model to detect parts of the face such as ears, eyes, mouth, and nose in single-frame images containing dog faces, and automatically classifies the emotions of these parts. The confidence-weighted method is then used to calculate the highest-scoring emotion in the single-frame image as the decision result for each target. The experiment combines data augmentation and transfer learning to further improve accuracy and obtain better emotion recognition results. Through the proposed method, the study achieves an accuracy of 90%, which is a 32% improvement compared to other related studies abroad."

In addition, data privacy breach risks in power systems have become increasingly pronounced. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Tensor Decomposition Personalized Federated Learning (TDPFed)-based Dynamic-Static Integrated State Estimation (DSISE) method for the coordinated transmission-distribution (T&D) networks. A DSISE model is constructed where the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)-based dynamic state estimation is for the transmission network, and the Generalized Maximum Likelihood approach based on Projection Statistics (GM-PS) for static state estimation is for the multi-area three-phase unbalanced distribution network. To reduce model communication costs and improve convergence speed, TDPFed designed a two-layer loss function to realize the decoupling between the personalized model and the tensor local model by controlling the distance. In addition, this paper also designs an efficient distributed learning strategy and model aggregation methods for TDPFed. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, it has been proven that the TDPFed-DSISE framework not only reduces communication costs but also significantly improves estimation accuracy compared to traditional federated learning algorithms."

    "abstract": "The integration of Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites with hypersonic aircraft presents a critical frontier for next-generation non-terrestrial networks (NTN). However, the ultra-high dynamics inherent in these scenarios introduce severe Doppler frequency shifts and time-varying delays, significantly degrading link reliability. To address these challenges, this article proposes a robust Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) communication framework tailored for hypersonic-LEO links. First, we establish a three-dimensional (3D) kinematic model based on the Earth-Centered Inertial (ECI) coordinate system. This model accurately characterizes the dynamic delay-Doppler (DD) channel features across the aircraft’s ascent, cruise, and descent phases. Guided by these channel insights, we develop a phase-adaptive dynamic pilot design scheme that jointly optimizes pilot position, pilot power, pilot quantity, and guard intervals to maximize spectral efficiency and estimation accuracy. Furthermore, leveraging the temporal correlation of the OTFS channel in the DD domain, we propose a Multi-Frame Joint Cross-Correlation Matching (MF-JCM) channel estimation algorithm. This algorithm aggregates multi-frame channel responses to suppress noise and enhance detection probability. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves a Bit Error Rate (BER) of 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−4</sup> at an signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 7.5 dB in the ascent phase and 11 dB in the descent phase.

Thereafter, to ensure recursive feasibility and bounded tracking errors under fuzzy approximation errors and bounded disturbances, a Lyapunov-based dynamically updated tracking error constraint is introduced. Furthermore, by converting the original ellipsoidal constraints into relaxed box constraints, computational complexity is further reduced without violating the Lyapunov-based guarantees, which is ensured by an auxiliary one-step optimizer incorporated in the online part of the proposed framework. Compared with existing results, the proposed approach maintains bounded tracking errors with relatively high computational efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed MPC framework is then demonstrated through simulation results."

    "abstract": "With the advancement of radio frequency integrated circuit (RFIC) technology, neural network-based behavioral modeling of RFICs has become an emerging research focus. However, most existing studies focus on optimizing neural network architectures but rely on training and testing datasets with specific and similar characteristics, which constrains the generalization capability of the resulting models. Moreover, simulation-generated data are widely used, further limiting the models’ ability to capture real-world RFIC behavior. To address this issue, this paper introduces an information-rich, band-limited Gaussian signal as the excitation signal for RFIC feature extraction. The datasets are obtained from real-world measurements rather than simulations, enhancing the generalization performance of the trained models. Considering the limited dynamic range of oscilloscopes in practical measurements, we further propose a novel “Weighted Band-Selective Gaussian” (WBS-Gauss) signal, which effectively expands the dynamic range of the collected datasets. Additionally, we develop a causal regression behavioral modeling framework that is compatible with various neural network architectures. Modeling experiments are conducted on RF amplifiers with high nonlinearity and filters with wide dynamic range. The results demonstrate that the proposed excitation signal and modeling methodology enable the construction of behavioral RFIC models with excellent generalization capabilities."

    "abstract": "Weakly supervised group activity recognition (WSGAR) aims to identify the joint activity of a group of people without relying on hand-annotated human bounding boxes. Existing WSGAR methods typically acquire coarse human-level features by pooling from detected bounding boxes or applying human queries with cross attentions. These approaches focus on learning human relations from the acquired features. However, discriminative person-specific clues might be confused with irrelevant backgrounds, hindering the effectiveness of downstream human relation learning. To address this limitation, we propose a Human Feature Refinement framework that enhances human-level information with graph convolutional networks and self-attention. We define in-box regions as tokens and learn their spatial correspondence through GCN and self-attention. By explicitly extracting in-box details and suppressing irrelevant regions, our method acquires more discriminative human-level features for relation learning and group activity prediction. We further propose a Graph-based Token Merging algorithm to reduce the computation cost of Human Feature Refinement, while minimizing information loss and overfitting risk. Experiments show that our method outperforms previous WSGAR methods on Volleyball, NBA and JRDB-PAR benchmarks, with reduced computation cost."

    "abstract": "A novel dipole-type integrated compensation coil (ICC) structure is proposed for double-sided LCC topology in electric vehicle (EV) wireless charging systems to achieve high power density and high efficiency. Unlike conventional double-D (DD) loop-type ICCs, the proposed dipole-type ICC is orthogonally integrated with the main Tx and Rx coils, fundamentally eliminating unwanted magnetic cross-coupling between the compensation and main coils. This approach ensures precise fulfillment of the LCC resonant conditions, prevents circulating currents between the ICC and main coils, and optimizes the utilization of the magnetic core without reaching magnetic saturation. Compared to conventional LCC topologies with separate filter inductors, the proposed integration substantially reduces the system’s overall form factor while maintaining excellent resonant performance. A comprehensive analysis based on gyrator modeling is conducted to accurately characterize the double-sided LCC system with the integrated dipole-type ICC. The feasibility of the proposed structure is experimentally validated through an 11-kW EV WPT system compliant with the SAE J2954 WPT3 standard. Experimental results demonstrate that the unwanted cross-coupling is suppressed to less than 5% relative to the main coupling, and misalignment tolerance remains comparable to conventional designs despite the additional integrated coils. Consequently, the proposed system achieves a high dc–dc efficiency of 93.6% at 11 kW with a 150 mm air gap, confirming the effectiveness and practicality of the dipole-type ICC for next-generation EV wireless charging applications."

    "abstract": "For clean energy goals, energy independence, resilience, and efficient use of distributed energy resources, renewable energy sources are often connected to microgrids. Grid-Forming Inverters (GFIs) are one of the major transformative solutions for amplifying the stability and resilience of power systems, particularly in decentralized and islanded microgrids. Unlike conventional grid-following inverters, GFIs can independently regulate voltage and frequency, thus forming the grid in the absence of a central utility. This capability makes them essential for integrating Renewable Energy Sources (RES) like solar and wind, especially in areas where traditional synchronous generation is minimal or absent. The development of advanced power electronic converters—such as Voltage Source Inverters (VSIs), Current Source Inverters (CSIs), and multilevel topologies—has been instrumental in supporting grid-forming functionalities with improved dynamic performance, efficiency, and fault tolerance. As the complexity of distributed generation networks increases, hybrid architectures combining grid-forming and grid-following inverters are gaining attention. These architectures ensure both power-sharing flexibility and system stability by leveraging the strengths of each inverter type. Additionally, advancements in wide-bandgap semiconductor technologies (SiC, GaN) have enabled faster switching speeds, higher power densities, and reduced losses, which are crucial for high-performance hybrid systems. That makes the world evolve into a new era of small-scale distribution from the static grid entity. Power converters are the main components in the microgrid. To meet evolving grid codes and ensure compatibility with existing infrastructure, control strategies are becoming more intelligent and adaptive. Integration of communication-assisted control, decentralized decision-making, and artificial intelligence (AI) enables predictive, real-time optimization of hybrid inverter networks. Moreover, hierarchical control frameworks—comprising primary, secondary, and tertiary levels—are being refined to manage both fast transient dynamics and long-term system objectives. These advancements collectively mark a significant shift from conventional passive grid support to active, resilient, and autonomous energy systems led by next-generation converter technologies. This paper aims to outline basic converter topologies and their advancements. The advancement of the converter reveals the idea of proper converter installation in the microgrid applications. The benefits of each of the proposed converters are explained. The main factors described about each are efficiency, system volume, and output voltage ripple. Also highlighted are the main power quality issues, power converter parameter requirements, and the importance of power converters in the grid system. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of hierarchical control architectures in microgrid systems encompassing primary, secondary, and tertiary control levels. Key control strategies are discussed along with the system configuration."

    "abstract": "Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) image reconstruction frequently encounters significant artifacts due to the inherent high nonlinearity and ill-posed nature of the inverse problem. In this study, we propose an Efficient Multi-Scale Attention Convolutional Neural Network-Transformer (ECNN-Transformer) method specifically designed for EIT lung imaging. Building upon the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) model, we adjust both the depth of the network and the step size of the pooling layer. Additionally, we incorporate an Efficient Multi-Scale Attention Mechanism Module (EMA) along with a Transformer neural network. These enhancements contribute to creating lightweight network models that improve reconstruction accuracy and robustness while effectively mitigating artifacts. The proposed network was trained using 28000 EIT simulation models generated from chest CT images of patients. During model generation, various conditions such as lung tumors, lung hyperexpansion, and lung collapse were randomly simulated. The efficacy of our method was evaluated through a series of simulation data and static experiments. To quantitatively assess reconstruction quality, we calculated metrics including root mean square error (RMSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and the structural similarity index (SSIM). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves an average RMSE of 0.024, a PSNR value of 21.16, and an SSIM exceeding 0.893. This approach facilitates high-resolution reconstruction in EIT lung imaging while accurately restoring conductivity characteristics associated with pathological tissues—particularly in scenarios involving measurement noise. We anticipate that this methodology will yield reliable interference-free images suitable for potential clinical applications such as imaging human lung tumors."

An EEM problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the precoding matrix and STAR-RIS phase shifts, subject to STAR-RIS phase shift, base station power budget, and devices' data rate constraints. This results in a complex mixed- integer programming problem, which is challenging to solve. To tackle this, an alternative optimization approach is proposed that decomposes the EEM problem into phase shift and beamforming subproblems, solved iteratively using a bisection search and the inner approximation method with novel tractable transformations. Numerical results show that the proposed RSMA-based algorithm achieves 15% higher EE than non-orthogonal multiple access and 35% higher than a conventional beamforming system without RSMA for efficient 6 G deployments."

This survey is the first to systematically summarize the potential techniques for incorporating lifelong learning into LLM-based agents. We categorize the core components of these agents into three modules: the perception module for multimodal input integration, the memory module for storing and retrieving evolving knowledge, and the action module for grounded interactions with the dynamic environment. We highlight how these pillars collectively enable continuous adaptation, mitigate catastrophic forgetting, and improve long-term performance. This survey provides a roadmap for researchers and practitioners working to develop lifelong learning capabilities in LLM agents, offering insights into emerging trends, evaluation metrics, and application scenarios.

The proposed scheme eliminates the need for conventional outer tree codes by employing a dynamic preamble sequence, which serves as a temporary user identifier and facilitates the stitching of data segments across sub-slots. Furthermore, a dynamic approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm is utilized to jointly recover multiple data substreams transmitted concurrently by each user within a given sub-slot. In addition, the RaptorQ-based outer code, functioning as an erasure code, is capable of simultaneously correcting both missed detection and false alarm errors in the decoded sub-segments. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves improved energy efficiency when operating under moderate and large load conditions. Moreover, it exhibits a significant performance gain over existing URA schemes in additive white Gaussian noise channels."

    "abstract": "In the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) environment, data among vehicles exhibits Non-Independent Identical Distribution (Non-IID) characteristics due to the diversity of vehicle types, on-board hardware, and user preferences. In addition, when users request location-based services (LBS), they face the risk of privacy leakage and have higher Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Therefore, personalized location privacy protection has become an urgent issue. Most existing research focuses on protecting overall privacy but lacks personalized strategies to address varying user needs and struggles with handling Non-IID data. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a personalized hierarchical federated learning framework (PHFedDA) based on heterogeneous data aggregation. First, we apply a personalized location privacy budget allocation scheme (PLPB) to vehicle trajectories, and a quality assessment model is proposed for evaluating the accuracy of vehicle trajectory aggregation, through which an effective balance between aggregation accuracy and privacy protection is achieved. Then, we design a personalized hierarchical federated learning algorithm to effectively deal with the Non-IID data problem caused by the differences in vehicle end-user preferences. Finally, through simulation experiments, our PHFedDA framework achieves an 8.74% improvement in aggregation accuracy over the best-performing baseline scheme DSLP. Additionally, the model accuracy improves by 7.52% compared to the top-performing baseline scheme SCAFFOLD. Compared to other baseline schemes mentioned in this paper, PHFedDA demonstrates significant advantages in security and handling data heterogeneity."

    "abstract": "The malicious misuse and widespread dissemination of AI-generated images pose a significant threat to the authenticity of online information. Current detection methods often struggle to generalize to unseen generative models, and the rapid evolution of generative techniques continuously exacerbates this challenge. Without adaptability, detection models risk becoming ineffective in real-world applications. To address this critical issue, we propose a novel three-stage domain continual learning framework designed for continuous adaptation to evolving generative models. In the first stage, we employ a strategic parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach to develop a transferable offline detection model with strong generalization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, the second stage integrates unseen data streams into a continual learning process. To efficiently learn from limited samples of novel generated models and mitigate overfitting, we design a data augmentation chain with progressively increasing complexity. Furthermore, we leverage the Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) method to approximate the Hessian and alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Finally, the third stage utilizes a linear interpolation strategy based on Linear Mode Connectivity, effectively capturing commonalities across diverse generative models and further enhancing overall performance. We establish a comprehensive benchmark of 27 generative models, including GANs, deepfakes, and diffusion models, chronologically structured up to August 2024 to simulate real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our initial offline detectors surpass the leading baseline by +5.51% in terms of mean average precision. Our continual learning strategy achieves an average accuracy of 92.20%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods."

The development and application of new insulating gases have attracted significant attention. To avoid insulation failure caused by liquefaction, new insulating gases need to be diluted with buffer gases in the application. However, the synergistic ability of new insulating gases and buffer gases to suppress electron avalanche development is weak, leading to a relatively low dielectric strength of the new mixed insulating gases, which are only suitable for medium and low voltage electrical equipment. To enhance the dielectric strength of new mixed insulating gases, this study, based on density functional theory, investigates the interaction mechanisms between gas molecules. The configuration of the composite molecules formed by the interaction of mixed gas molecules is determined, and the stability of the composite configurations is analyzed. The changes in the electron density before and after the molecular binding are compared, and the correlation between the microscopic parameters of the gas molecule composites and the synergism of the mixed insulating gases is explored. The research results indicate that gas molecules can combine to form interaction configurations under intermolecular interactions. During the process of molecular binding to form interaction configurations, the electron density is redistributed, leading to differences in the microscopic parameters of the interaction configuration compared to the individual molecules. The interaction configuration has a stronger ability to suppress electron avalanche development than individual gas molecules, which results in an enhancement of the dielectric strength of the mixed gas beyond the linear sum of the dielectric strengths of the individual molecules. This gives rise to a significant synergistic effect in the mixed gas. Additionally, the ability of different interaction configurations to suppress electron avalanche development varies, causing the degree of dielectric strength enhancement in the mixed gas to differ, and consequently, the synergy among the mixed gases also varies."

Although recent fuzzy logistic regression approaches have demonstrated promising results, challenges remain in managing multicollinearity and performing effective feature selection for mixed-type predictors. This study proposes a Fuzzy LASSO Logistic Regression (FLLR) framework that integrates triangular fuzzy membership functions with LASSO regularization to address these issues. The proposed approach fuzzifies continuous, ordinal, and categorical features, performs variable selection via LASSO logistic regression, and mitigates multicollinearity through Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) screening. The model was trained using 10-fold cross-validation, and its performance was evaluated using four key metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrated that FLLR achieves strong predictive performance while preserving model interpretability. Comparative analyses with existing fuzzy logistic regression models and a standard artificial neural network further confirmed the robustness and practical utility of the proposed framework for uncertainty-aware decision-making using mixed-type data."

However, their deployment in resourceconstrained environments is limited by their high computational demands. Hence, Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged to address such challenges by enabling the transfer of knowledge from a large, pre-trained model (teacher) to a smaller, more efficient model (student). Yet, some bottlenecks exist in the effectiveness of this technique, such as the “capacity gap” between the teachers’ learning abilities and that of the student models, which may negatively impact the distilled model. We address this limitation by introducing a Tutor-Enhanced Iterative Distillation (TEID) to fill the capacity gap, by adding an intermediate-sized tutor model and selective learning strategy to the traditional distillation setup. To achieve further compression, the TEID is repeated iteratively on the tutor and the previously resultant student, with a new smaller student model. Empirical results on the GLUE benchmark show results in mitigating the model capacity gap, while showcasing the need to improve the efficiency and scalability of the distilled models."

In this context, we focus on fully automatic code optimization techniques that automate the process of selecting and applying code transformations for better performance without manual intervention. Understanding how these transformations behave and interact is key to designing more effective optimization strategies. Compiler developers must make numerous design choices when constructing these heuristics. For instance, they may decide whether to allow transformations to be explored in any arbitrary order or to enforce a fixed sequence. While the former may theoretically offer the best performance gains, it significantly increases the search space. This raises an important question: Can a predefined, fixed order of applying transformations speed up the search without severely compromising optimization potential? In this paper, we address this and other related questions that arise in the design of automatic code optimization algorithms. Using a data-driven approach, we generate a large dataset of random programs, apply random optimization sequences, and record their execution times. Through statistical analysis, we provide insights that guide the development of more efficient automatic code optimization algorithms."

We present a unified, mutation-level database of clinical M. tuberculosis isolates linking whole-genome variation to drug resistance phenotypes across a broad spectrum of first- and second-line antibiotics. The resource integrates: (i) curated repositories (including CRyPTIC and a Nature study) encompassing approximately 12,000 genomes with phenotypes [1]; (ii) an automated large language model (LLM) text-mining pipeline that scanned over 20,000 articles to extract SRAlinked resistance/susceptibility statements (approximately $\\mathbf{2, 0 0 0}$ additional entries) [2], [3]; and (iii) the PATRIC compendium mapped to SRA identifiers, adding thousands of strains with annotated drug responses [4]. After reconciling strain names with NCBI SRA accessions, we standardize drug nomenclature, deduplicate records, and produce a genome-wide, binary mutation matrix (over 150,000 features per isolate) paired with resistance/susceptibility labels. This database consolidates established and newly reported mutations, expands coverage for recently introduced or repurposed antibiotics, and is immediately ML-ready. Preliminary models (XGBoost) achieve strong performance and reproduce known drivers (e.g., rpoB, katG, gyrA) while surfacing potential multimutation interactions [5], [6]. As a standardized, richly annotated training set, this resource enables robust AI development and benchmarking for resistance prediction, supports genomic surveillance, and accelerates diagnostic and therapeutic design in TB."

    "abstract": "The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has created unprecedented cybersecurity challenges, with these devices becoming prime targets for attacks due to their computational constraints and valuable data repositories. While Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) serve as critical defensive mechanisms, traditional approaches struggle with the scale, heterogeneity, and privacy requirements of IoT ecosystems. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for IoT-focused IDSs, progressing from conventional ML algorithms through Deep Learning (DL) architectures to privacy-preserving Federated Learning (FL) approaches. This paper compare these methodologies across key performance metrics including detection accuracy, privacy preservation, and computational efficiency. The analysis reveals that while FL offers promising solutions for privacy-sensitive IoT environments, significant challenges remain, including communication overhead, model personalization, and vulnerability to poisoning attacks. The paper categorize these challenges and synthesize potential solutions proposed in recent literature, providing a roadmap for future research directions in developing robust, privacy-preserving intrusion detection mechanisms for IoT networks."

    "abstract": "Traditional sentiment analysis has long been a unimodal task, relying solely on text. This approach overlooks nonverbal cues such as vocal tone and prosody that are essential for capturing true emotional intent. We introduce Dynamic Attention Fusion (DAF), a lightweight framework that combines frozen text embeddings from a pretrained language model with acoustic features from a speech encoder, using an adaptive attention mechanism to weight each modality per utterance. Without any fine-tuning of the underlying encoders, our proposed DAF model consistently outperforms both static fusion and unimodal baselines on a large multimodal benchmark. We report notable gains in F1-score and reductions in prediction error and perform a variety of ablation studies that support our hypothesis that the dynamic weighting strategy is crucial for modeling emotionally complex inputs. By effectively integrating verbal and non-verbal information, our approach offers a more robust foundation for sentiment prediction and carries broader impact for affective computing applications-from emotion recognition and mental health assessment to more natural human-computer interaction."

    "abstract": "Wind speed monitoring is crucial for environmental management and forecasting. However, current solutions often struggle with high power consumption, especially at the end device, which typically has a sensor and wireless radios with limited battery capacity. To this end, we present WindScatter, an ultra-low-power, long-range, and large-scale wind speed monitoring system. WindScatter adopts the Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) paradigm to enable low-power operation. It reuses the sensed data for communication by leveraging a TMR (Tunnel Magneto-Resistance) switch sensor to measure the wind speed information and control the backscatter communication simultaneously, thus avoiding the need for analog-to-digital conversion and a microcontroller for communication control. Our hardware-software co-design enables accurate measurements and stable concurrent transmission. We implement WindScatter and conduct extensive experiments and case studies to evaluate its performance. Results show that WindScatter supports measurements of all wind speed levels on the Extended Beaufort scale, from 1.5 m/s to 60 m/s, with an average error rate of 0.78%. WindScatter can sense and transmit wind speed data at a distance of 800 m with a power consumption of 136.5<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mu$</tex-math></inline-formula>W.

    "abstract": "Collaborative Perception (CP) has been shown to be a promising technique for multi-agent autonomous driving and multi-agent robotic systems, where multiple agents share their perception information to enhance the overall perception performance and expand the perception range. However, in CP, an ego agent needs to receive messages from its collaborators, which makes it vulnerable to attacks from malicious agents. To address this critical issue, we propose a unified, probability-agnostic, and adaptive framework, namely, CP-uniGuard, which is a tailored defense mechanism for CP deployed by each agent to accurately detect and eliminate malicious agents in its collaboration network. Our key idea is to enable CP to reach a consensus rather than a conflict against an ego agent's perception results. Based on this idea, we first develop a probability-agnostic sample consensus (PASAC) method to effectively sample a subset of the collaborators and verify the consensus without prior probabilities of malicious agents. Furthermore, we define collaborative consistency loss (CCLoss) for object detection task and bird's eye view (BEV) segmentation task to capture the discrepancy between an ego agent and its collaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus. In addition, we propose online adaptive threshold via dual sliding windows to dynamically adjust the threshold for consensus verification and ensure the reliability of the systems in dynamic environments. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework."

A FTESO is constructed to estimate the lumped disturbances and then is incorporated into the first-order sliding mode controller via real-time feedforward compensation. Compared with the conventional extended state observer (ESO), the FTESO not only achieves higher estimation accuracy but also ensures finite-time convergence of the estimation error. To compensate for the adverse effects of system uncertainties, the SERCFNN is employed to estimate the nonlinear dynamics. This incorporates a structure self-learning mechanism, which dynamically generates fuzzy rules to attain a suitable network architecture. Comparative simulation and experimental results demonstrate that under various test conditions, the proposed hybrid method has superior dynamic performance and disturbance rejection capability."

The system utilized Q-ITS optimization, combining Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) with federated vehicular learning to enable safe, privacy-preserving coordination among distributed network participants. Smartphones and other connected devices used by consumers enable the dynamic gathering of traffic information, and customized route modifications are possible in the Q-ITS system ecosystem. The simulation results on a synthetic urban topology demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces communication overhead by 37.4%, decreases average decision latency by 42.1%, and lowers the system-wide congestion index by 23.9% compared to traditional methods. Additionally, Q-ITS routing attains a packet delivery success rate of 98.2% under dynamic vehicular traffic conditions. The Q-ITS also shows 61.3% gain in entropic stability and a 2.8 times faster convergence."

    "abstract": "Distributed optical fiber sensing technologies, represented by Phase-sensitive Optical Time-Domain Reflectometry (Φ-OTDR), have gained widespread application in vibration monitoring for infrastructures like roads and pipelines due to advantages such as long monitoring distances, high spatiotemporal coverage, and convenient deployment. However, the monitoring data are simultaneously affected by complex and uncertain couplings involving optical cable structural response, vibration propagation medium characteristics, initial vibration states, and multi-modal environmental excitations, requiring proper decoupling for effective application. Most existing methods focus on extracting and processing only one or a few specific types of features, resulting in high computational load and insufficient mining of effective information from the sensing signals. Among these, decoupling and extracting multi-modal weak signals under unknown excitation scenarios remains a key technical bottleneck. To address this, this paper, based on the fiber-environment coupled vibration observation model for Φ-OTDR Distributed Fiber-optic Vibration Sensor (DVS), innovatively proposes an analysis framework combining a scenario-guided combined multi-head attention mechanism, achieving efficient decoupling, separation, and extraction of multi-modal weak signals in complex environments. This method can effectively focus on key signals for application scenarios, significantly improving the real-time performance of signal analysis, and provides a universal real-time solution for DVS signal processing in complex scenarios. Measured data from a 30km optical cable deployed on a city ring expressway validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating excellent performance and real-time processing capabilities in comprehensive application scenarios including road roughness detection, construction machinery detection and localization, and vehicle trajectory recognition."

They are particularly useful in applications that involve multi-criteria decision support. Recently, several techniques have been proposed for processing continuous skyline queries over uncertain data streams, however, they mainly focus on uncertainty that results from objects having many instances. Uncertainty owing to objects having range values wherein the exact values of the objects are not known at the point of processing has not been extensively explored. Moreover, identical objects may recur in the stream at different times while continuous skyline queries submitted by different users can overlap within the same time frame. Thus, it would be inefficient to repeatedly process the same segment of the data stream and the same objects in processing these multiple queries. We seek to overcome the aforementioned problems by introducing an efficient skyline model named MCSQ-UDS, for computing multiple continuous skyline queries over uncertain data stream. Several extensive experiments were conducted on synthetic and real datasets with different parameter settings. The results show that the proposed model outperforms the baseline techniques with regard to number of pairwise comparisons and execution time."

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a brain development condition influenced by genes and environment, with no known cause or cure. The diagnosis is challenging due to the absence of biological markers, requiring various examinations and specialist input. Delayed diagnosis often results in late intervention, emphasizing the need for early, individualized therapeutic approaches to enhance quality of life. Current ASD research emphasizes early detection, integrating clinical assessments with advanced technology to expedite diagnosis. One alternative for achieving rapid detection is the use of Machine Learning (ML) models, which have shown potential in identifying patterns in datasets, aiding in early ASD diagnosis. For this purpose, a representative dataset needs to be used to train these models for the ASD classification task. However, healthcare providers often lack access to detailed diagnostic data, making ML model applications challenging. This study proposes utilizing non-diagnostic data from healthcare providers, such as requests for consultations and procedures, to develop ML models for ASD classification. The approach involves creating a dataset without diagnostic data, selecting essential variables, and training ML models for classification. The classifiers utilized were Random Forest, XGboost, Catboost and a stacking strategy to combine the base classifiers. Models trained with parameter tuning presented better results, and the stacking strategy achieved the best accuracy (73.62%). The present study demonstrates the predictive power of a new strategy for ASD screening, providing an alternative where traditional diagnostic data is unavailable. The proposed approach is running in a healthcare provider operator for ASD screening and is benefiting many children and adolescents with faster and more accurate diagnoses."

To meet the future demands of meshed HVDC grids, high-voltage high-power dc-dc converters are required to serve as essential interfaces to bridge the HVDC links with different voltage levels. This paper proposes a T-type modular multilevel converter (T-MMDC) composed of two energy buffering arms to transfer partial power and an active filtering arm for removing bulky passive filters. By utilizing the coordination of arms, the proposed T-MMDC not only enables flexible power regulation and bidirectional fault ride-through, but also has the advantages of cost-efficiency, small footprint, and high efficiency. The topology configuration, quantitative characterization of operating principle, analytical parameter design, and fault ride-through control scheme are presented sequentially, providing a straightforward and detailed guideline for engineers. Full-scale simulations from a 320kV@0.5GW case and down-scale experiments from a 750V@5kW prototype confirm the effectiveness of the proposed operating principle and fault ride-through capability of T-MMDC and its good potential for HVDC grids."

    "abstract": "Modular multilevel matrix converter (M3C) is a topology that can directly realize the AC-AC power conversion and is widely used in high-power motor drive applications. However, when the motor frequency is close to the grid frequency, the voltage fluctuation problem of the sub-module capacitors worsens. The traditional method of reducing capacitor voltage fluctuations is to inject common mode voltage and circulating current, resulting in the increase of voltage and current stress of the bridge arms. In this paper, a new topology of M3C combined with cascaded H-bridge is proposed, which can effectively reduce fluctuations in the capacitor voltage of the M3C bridge arm submodule when the input and output frequencies are close or equal, while it still has the advantages of the traditional M3C such as easy modular design, low output harmonics, and strong scalability. Firstly, a mathematical model of the combined M3C topology is established. With the model, the cause of the capacitor voltage fluctuations of the M3C bridge arm is analyzed, and its mathematical expression is derived when the motor frequency is close or equal to the grid frequency. Then, a capacitive compensation method using cascaded H-bridges is proposed to provide the reactive power required by the motor to reduce fluctuations in the capacitor voltage of the M3C bridge arm submodule under the close or equal frequency working condition. Compared with the conventional methods, the combined M3C achieves smaller voltage fluctuations of the capacitors, eliminates the need for common-mode voltage and circulating current injection, and achieves lower power loss. Finally, the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed topology and control strategy are verified by simulations and experiments."

However, interpreting SAR images is challenging for both experts and non-experts. Inspired by deep learning-based style transfer, researchers have employed Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to convert SAR images into more intuitive optical ones. Yet, current loss functions and evaluation metrics focus mainly on pixel-level differences, overlooking the structural coherence required for target recognition and downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a semantic segmentation-driven framework for target-level SAR-to-optical image translation. Compatible with various supervised models, it incorporates segmentation loss and uses SAR segmentation maps as additional inputs to preserve target structure. Experiments on custom datasets, built from Sentinel 1-2 imagery with road binary segmentation labels, as well as public datasets, confirm the method's effectiveness across different base translation models.

    "abstract": "Enabling mobile augmented reality (AR) applications in 5G networks needs special consideration to achieve low latency and high quality of experience (QoE). This is doable thanks to the network function virtualization (NFV) and mobile edge computing (MEC) technologies. Such technologies are the main elements of the edge/cloud virtualization that can facilitate the deployment and running of AR applications over 5G networks. This work is dedicated to the development, deployment and testing of virtualized network functions (VNFs) that are evaluated in real-world 5G network testbed infrastructure. In fact, we evaluated the performance of the VNFs, which enable mobile AR streaming using the edge/cloud computing and 5G networking infrastructure. The results show the performance of the overall networking application (NetApp) that has been developed during the 5G-IANA project such as latency is decreased by two or three times while the data rate is increased two or three times depending on the number of transmission bytes."

    "abstract": "Fiber-optic distributed acoustic sensor (DAS) offers great potential for railway event monitoring due to its high sensitivity and robustness in complex environments. However, accurate recognition of acoustic events remains challenging, under real-time constraints where only short-duration signal segments with limited discriminative information are available. To overcome this, an efficient recognition framework was proposed by integrating multi-encoding image fusion and a lightweight transformer-convolutional network (CNN). Specifically, 0.032-second DAS signal segments were converted into complementary image representations, which were then fused into RGB images to enhance feature diversity. These multimodal images were processed by a compact backbone that combined vision transformer (ViT) modules with convolutional components, enabling effective extraction of multi-scale local and global features. The hybrid framework effectively mitigated the lack of temporal information in short segments, achieving 98.19% accuracy with only 1.33 million parameters and 3.3 ms latency per sample, substantially faster than existing methods. Compared to baseline models, the proposed architecture achieved superior accuracy and compactness, making it highly suitable for real-time and edge deployment in DAS-based monitoring systems."

To address this issue, a containment-oriented collaborative interception framework for the multi-spacecraft system is designed. Firstly, a relative dynamics model capturing pursuer-evader interactions is established, anchored to the orbit threat as a reference point. An objective function incorporating a relative distance penalty term is formulated for the individual spacecraft. Subsequently, an integrated objective function is constructed and applied to all spacecraft. Secondly, the optimal interception strategies for the multi-spacecraft system are derived and simplified by identifying the sufficient conditions guaranteeing strategy uniqueness. Furthermore, the equivalence between the integrated model and the multi-agent model in terms of optimal interception strategies is rigorously proven, along with a computationally efficient solution. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed interception strategy is validated through high-fidelity numerical simulations."

    "abstract": "To address the challenges of dynamic perception, real-time decision-making, and control stability in UAV visual tracking tasks, this study proposes an Attention-guided Visual Servoing Reinforcement Learning (AVSRL) framework. Unlike conventional Image-Based Visual Servoing (IBVS) methods that rely on analytical Jacobian control, AVSRL employs a virtual camera mechanism to normalize image observations and extract geometry-aware visual features as state inputs to a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent. The proposed framework integrates model identification, attention-enhanced actor-critic learning, and multi-source visual-environment encoding to enable robust and adaptive UAV control in dynamic and complex environments. A multi-head attention module selectively processes spatial-temporal observations from both static and dynamic objects, while a centralized critic facilitates cooperative optimization across agents. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments were conducted, including average reward analysis, hyperparameter sensitivity evaluation, trajectory tracking of complex geometric paths, and pedestrian following in outdoor scenarios. Results show that AVSRL outperforms baseline DRL and IBVS controllers in terms of tracking accuracy, control smoothness, and adaptability to visual and environmental variability. The findings validate the AVSRL framework as a promising solution for real-time UAV navigation and tracking tasks under uncertain and complex visual conditions."

    "abstract": "To efficiently amplify modulated signals with high peak-to-average power ratios (PAPRs) in modern wireless communication systems, outphasing power amplifiers (OPAs) are worth considering due to their high efficiencies at back-off. Conventional OPAs using an output Chireix combiner have limited bandwidth and back-off range. For the first time, two new outphasing-like topologies using coupler-based power combining techniques are proposed. Theoretical analysis provides a straightforward realization of OPAs without additional reactive compensation elements based on the output coupler, thus increasing the bandwidth, and significantly simplifying the OPA design procedures. For validation, the outphasing-like power amplifiers (OLPAs) I and II are designed using output branch-line and rat-race couplers with synthesized direct-matching networks (SDMNs) to obtain high drain efficiencies (DEs), respectively. The implemented OLPA I with measured peak output powers of 39.7–39.8 dBm achieves DEs of 61.3%–64.1% and 42%–48% at saturation and at 6-dB back-off from 3.4 to 3.5 GHz. Besides, the implemented OLPA II operates from 3.2 to 3.6 GHz with measured DEs of 61.8%–70% at saturation (43.5–44.3 dBm) and 41.5%–51.1% at 8-dB back-off."

    "abstract": "The growing adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has significantly expanded the attack surface of modern networks, underscoring the need for robust anomaly detection solutions. While machine learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) have been widely explored, most existing approaches rely on rigid, monolithic pipelines that hinder reuse, reproducibility, and generalization across heterogeneous datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a modular framework for IoT anomaly detection that integrates automation, configurability, and explainability within a unified pipeline. Each stage of the workflow (exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, feature selection, class balancing, model training, evaluation, and SHAP-based explainability) is encapsulated into independent modules controlled by a central configuration block, enabling the automatic generation of detection models and seamless adaptation without code modifications. Extensive experiments on the CIC-IoT2023 dataset, across fine-grained, grouped, and binary classification settings, led to the identification of an optimal configuration. Cross-dataset validation on CIC-Bot-IoT confirmed the effectiveness of this configuration, demonstrating the robustness of the framework and its ability to generate wellperforming models across heterogeneous IoT environments. Beyond this, the framework provides a unified environment for the systematic comparison of anomaly detection methods, supporting reproducibility, extensibility, and practical deployment."

    "abstract": "In the smart grid, data communication between smart meters and utility servers should be authentic, private, have integrity while being accessible. To mitigate the risks of potential attacks, securing these two-way communications is crucial. Equally important is maintaining near real-time communication and avoiding significant delays when extra security levels are involved. Existing research on smart grids has not simultaneously tackled the issues of security, communication speed, and network scalability. In this work, we propose a novel delay-optimized blockchain solution for securing cryptographic communication between consumers and the utility in a smart grid. Our solution, based on EOS smart contracts, Edge computing, asymmetric Cryptographic functions, and Group signatures ($E E C G$), treats data communication as transactions that are asymmetrically encrypted and signed in groups before being stored on the EOS blockchain, ensuring confidentiality, privacy, availability, and low cost. The use of edge computing reduces the computational burden of smart meters, increases transaction speed, enhances data privacy, and improves scalability. Furthermore, an optimization problem for associating smart meters with edge nodes is formulated to minimize data exchange and processing delays over the blockchain, facilitating near real-time secure data access."

To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes integrating synthetic data generated via Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to augment the CICIDS-2017 dataset. Our methodology involves preprocessing the original dataset to ensure data quality and generating synthetic samples that accurately replicate real-world network traffic patterns. This augmented dataset, combining real and synthetic instances, is then utilized to train state-of-the-art machine learning models, specifically Random Forest and XGBoost, for robust IDS implementation Comprehensive evaluations, employing standard classification reports and performance metrics, demonstrate that synthetic data integration significantly enhances IDS accuracy and robustness. Our results reveal substantial improvements in identifying minority-class attacks, effectively mitigating data imbalance issues, and enhancing IDS generalization capabilities.

As these conditions remain incurable, current treatments mainly aim to slow progression rather than restore vision. Most smart glasses follow a one-size-fits-all model, overlooking individual vision loss patterns and disease evolution. To bridge this gap, we developed a personalized prototype of smart glasses that adapt to each patient’s unique visual field using data from Humphrey visual field tests. The system detects the widest non-blind area and dynamically adjusts the display to project the full scene within that region, allowing users to see everything through their remaining functional vision. Our goal was to deliver a highly personalized solution by integrating patient-specific data with advanced simulation techniques for the most accurate and effective visual enhancement. The prototype combines two mini Wi-Fi cameras with a virtual reality (VR) headset to simulate and adjust vision in real time. Early results show promising improvements, offering a personalized and adaptive approach that redefines visual assistance and promotes greater independence and quality of life."

    "abstract": "The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has revolutionized key domains such as agriculture, smart cities, and healthcare. However, this growth has introduced critical security challenges, particularly in low-power and lossy networks that rely on the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). While RPL ensures energy-efficient communication, it remains vulnerable to sophisticated insider attacks, specifically version number (VN) and worst parent (WP) attacks, that exploit its inherent structural weaknesses, leading to network instability, reduced energy efficiency, and compromised data integrity. This study addresses these challenges by proposing and evaluating hybrid deep learning models, including CNN-LSTM, CNN-GRU, and GRU-GRU, for early and accurate detection of RPL-based insider attacks. The models are trained and evaluated using an enhanced Routing Attack Dataset for RPL-based IoT, incorporating feature augmentation and simulated real-world scenarios. This comprehensive dataset includes both small-and large-scale network topologies, enabling robust and scalable performance assessment across diverse IoT environments. A comprehensive evaluation using standard evaluation metrics demonstrates that all models exhibit strong detection capabilities. Among them, CNN-LSTM achieves superior performance across all metrics, particularly in complex attack scenarios. CNN-GRU shows notable efficiency in small-scale networks, while GRU-GRU offers robustness and stability in larger deployments. The results show a significant effectiveness of hybrid deep learning architectures in improving the security posture of IoT networks. This work contributes to a scalable and intelligent detection framework for mitigating evolving insider threats in RPL-based environments."

    "abstract": "The global ageing population necessitates new and emerging strategies for caring for older adults. In this article, we explore the potential for transformation in elderly care through Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI), powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). We discuss how Agentic AI facilitates proactive, autonomous decision-making in elderly care. Personalized tracking of health, cognitive care, and environmental management, all aimed at enhancing independence and high-level living for older adults, represents important areas of application. With the potential to significantly transform elderly care, Agentic AI also raises profound concerns about data privacy and security, decision independence, and access. We share key insights to emphasize the need for ethical safeguards, privacy protections, and transparent decision-making. Our goal in this article is to provide a balanced discussion of both the potential and the challenges of Agentic AI, and to offer insights into its responsible use in elderly care, aligning it with the requirements and vulnerabilities specific to the elderly. Finally, we identify the priorities for the academic research communities to achieve human-centred advancements and integration of Agentic AI in elderly care. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first comprehensive studies explicitly focused on LLM-based Agentic AI for elderly care. Hence, we address the literature gap by analyzing the unique capabilities, applications, and limitations of LLM-based Agentic AI in elderly care."

    "abstract": "Collaborative task offloading in vehicular edge computing (VEC) primarily emphasizes the diversity of offloading destinations, such as cloud centers, roadside units (RSUs), and other entities with underutilized resources. However, it often neglects the collaborative potential among vehicles whose tasks are associated with the same service. In this paper, we propose a collaborative task offloading strategy from the perspective of vehicles with offloading requests. Vehicles collectively accomplish task offloading by dividing responsibilities for specific service component offloading. To enhance the performance of the VEC system, we introduce a caching-assisted collaborative task offloading strategy. An optimization problem is formulated to minimize the response latency of tasks in VEC. Due to the complexity of solving this Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem, we decompose it into three subproblems: the Task Offloading and Service Caching (TOSA) problem, the Computing Resource Allocation (RA) problem, and the Service Component Assignment (CA) problem. We address the RA problem using a Lagrangian duality-based approach, solve the CA problem with a heuristic algorithm, and tackle the TOSA problem using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed strategy. The simulation results demonstrate that our solution outperforms existing methods in multiple dimensions, including convergence rate, average response latency, and task success rate."

In this study, we investigate the polymer chain dynamics of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) Boron Nitride (BN) nanocomposites using a combination of Solid-State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) phase imaging. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy, employing the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) echo sequence, provides quantitative insights into polymer chain dynamics and interfacial layer thickness by measuring transverse relaxation time (T<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>) correlating it to the wettability of the nanocomposites. Complementing the bulk dynamics captured by NMR, AFM phase imaging offers spatially resolved information on the viscoelastic properties and filler dispersion within the nanocomposites. Phase contrast in AFM identifies regions of constrained polymer mobility near nanofillers and highlights the heterogeneity in chain dynamics due to agglomeration or well-dispersed fillers. By correlating the bulk relaxation behavior from NMR with nanoscale heterogeneity observed in AFM phase images, we can establish a comprehensive understanding of how filler-polymer interactions influence chain mobility and macroscopic properties. Cross-linking density calculated for the composites provides a correlation with the elastic modulus which in turn provides an insight into the chain mobility."

This letter investigates a downlink communication system that integrates OTFS with SCMA to address the challenges of high mobility and large-scale connectivity. To improve detection performance with reduced complexity, we propose a novel detector architecture that incorporates a sparsity-constrained generalized minimum residual (GMRES) algorithm within the MMSE-OSIC framework.

    "abstract": "In interactive point cloud segmentation, users can achieve higher accuracy object masks than in instance segmentation by performing limited positive and/or negative clicks on the objects of interest in the scene. Existing methods often employ sparse click representations, leading the model to focus more on local detail features around the click points and failing to fully exploit the guidance information provided by each click, thus impacting the click effectiveness. We utilize a dense representation that reflects spatial distance relationships, known as the distance map, as the click channel to tackle the sparsity problem of click representation in current approaches. Based on the distance map, we introduce ClickEnhance, which is designed to maximize the guiding impact of each click. The proposed method encompasses the design of a click-specific encoder and the utilization of contrastive learning. The Click-Specific Encoder ensures that the network can adequately consider the influence of individual clicks during the feature encoding phase. Contrastive learning, on the other hand, reduces the feature distance between the click points and the target object, thus simplifying the subsequent segmentation process. Experimental results demonstrate that the ClickEnhance method markedly improves segmentation performance across multiple datasets, exhibiting superior generalization capabilities on challenging datasets compared to the state-of-the-art methods. This allows for the generation of high-precision object-level masks with fewer interactions, indicating great potential for practical applications."

However, programming languages such as C, characterized by pointer usage, introduce complex variable relationships such as pointer aliasing. Furthermore, the support for arbitrary type conversions in C complicates program analysis, particularly in adequately characterizing the diverse relationships among variables and handling type conversion issues during program execution. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a type region model for the formal description of variable and value information. The model constructs pointer and heap memory object representations to characterize the program states of relevant variables. Based on predefined vulnerability detection rules, it subsequently detects potential defects arising from pointers, memory operations, and type conversions. The proposed static detection methodwas evaluated using the Juliet C/C++ 1.3 test suite. The experimental results demonstrate that this method achieves a favorable balance between precision and false positive rates, making it suitable for defect detection in programs of moderate complexity."

Measured gain was approximately 5 dBi at 10.5 GHz in comparison to 6.24 dBi (10.076 GHz) simulated gain with broadside radiation pattern. Thus, a compact, flexible and desired radiation profile antenna was realized for emerging RF communication systems in the 10.27–10.72 GHz frequency range. Bending analysis of the antenna was also demonstrated and validated. Experimental results showed a good agreement with the simulation. Most conventional dielectric resonator antennas were non-flexible either in resonator and substrate. Therefore, this study focused on fully flexible design based on novel elastomer-ceramic composite radiator."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for adaptive wire–gauge selection in zonal automotive wiring harnesses under dynamic driving scenarios. Focusing on the centroid–to–battery (pre-distribution) segment, the method minimizes conductor mass while enforcing electrical constraints: a voltage–drop limit of 0.36V (3% of 12 V) and temperature–aware ampacity. Scenario–dependent current profiles are derived from a zonal dataset with four representative operating conditions; distances and topology are held fixed, and only wire types are optimized. A multi–head Deep Q–Network (DQN) selects a gauge per centroid using a reward that balances mass reduction, constraint compliance, and voltage–budget utilization. Validation with MATLAB scripts and a companion Simulink model shows near–identical voltage drops, margins, and validity flags across 65°C, 85°C, and 105°C. On a 12–zone High–application case at 85°C, the RL policy achieves 100% compliance with an average voltage drop of 0.30V, whereas baselines (a static–gauge design from Hossain et al. and a rule–based scenario–aware method) exhibit higher drops and lower compliance. System–level comparisons with Hossain et al. (distances unchanged) indicate total harness mass reductions of –3.62% (Low), –32.01% (Mid), and –34.51% (High). For the 12–zone High case, the RL design reduces centroid→battery mass by 12.52 kg, yielding about €108.13 copper cost savings (priced at € 8.6338/kg) and 51.95 kg CO<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>e lower embodied emissions per harness.

Existing solutions to improve factual accuracy typically rely on additional training, specialized architectures, or large-scale annotations, which are computationally costly and difficult to deploy in resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces a lightweight, training-free framework for enhancing abstractive summarization by combining decoding diversity with multi-metric reranking. Our method generates candidate summaries using both deterministic beam search and stochastic top-k sampling, then applies a composite scoring function that integrates ROUGE-1, METEOR, and BERTScore to select the most accurate and informative summary. Experiments on the XSum dataset demonstrate consistent improvements, achieving ROUGE-1 =51.7, ROUGE-2 =27.5, and ROUGE-L =42.7, outperforming competitive reranking baselines. A preference-based evaluation further showed that reranked outputs were favored in 71% of cases, confirming that automatic metric gains align with human-perceived quality. The results highlight a practical and resource-efficient solution for improving summarization quality without retraining."

Nodes dynamically transition between worker and cluster head roles based on trust thresholds, capability, and resilience metrics. The framework integrates a Sybil protection layer using unique ID checks, publickey validation, and rate limiting to prevent fake node infiltration. Additionally, TRACED features robust heartbeat-based failure detection, adaptive role reassignment, and detailed metrics logging for post-analysis. Through extensive simulations across multiple scenarios, TRACED demonstrated resilience against Sybil attacks, dynamically isolated misbehaving nodes, and maintained functional clustering without central coordination.

There is still no shared list of known vulnerabilities and no secure environment for testing spacerelated cyber defense. This paper identifies eleven key research gaps. These include secure routing, onboard attack detection, automated recovery, trusted supply chains, post-quantum encryption, zero-trust implementation, and real-time service impact monitoring. For each topic, we describe the challenge, explain why it matters, and propose a guiding research question. We also explore how a team of small, task-specific artificial intelligence agents, what we call an agentic (multi-agent) approach, could improve onboard defense without relying on large hardware.The paper ends with a proposed five-year roadmap. This includes flight tests of post-quantum and quantum key distribution (QKD) links, open-access cyber-ranges for practical testing, better rules for sharing vulnerabilities, and initial deployments of multi-agent security on operational spacecraft. Moving toward these proactive, modular defenses will help prevent outages like the KA-SAT incident."

To address these challenges, we propose two hierarchical FL architectures that integrate multi-key homomorphic encryption (xMK-CKKS) with clustered aggregation to achieve scalable, privacy-preserving learning. The first variant, HxFL, performs secure intra-cluster aggregation and local decryption. The second version, HxFL+, extends this by adding end-to-end encryption between cluster leaders and the central server. Our framework reduces cryptographic overhead through structured key distribution and multi-tier aggregation. Experiments on the MNIST dataset across client scales (10-100) show that HxFL and HxFL+ significantly reduce encryption and memory costs, achieving up to $42 \\%$ faster runtime and $27 \\%$ lower memory usage compared to a flat encrypted baseline, while preserving model accuracy comparable to unencrypted FL. These results demonstrate the feasibility of deploying secure and scalable FL in real-world, distributed systems."

In this work, we present a few-shot prompting framework tailored to news summarization from unstructured, multimodal inputs. The system leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce bilingual outputs in French and Arabic without requiring labeled training data. Our method combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a rewriting stage guided by professional examples. It first extracts and embeds content from various media sources, retrieves the most relevant items through semantic search, and generates initial summaries using prompt-based generation aligned with journalistic conventions. In a second step, the summaries are rewritten using support examples selected based on content similarity, and then translated into Arabic to produce final bilingual outputs. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating a support set during the rewriting phase leads to more relevant and well-structured summaries."

The detected regions were then used to guide the segmentation stage. A combination of advanced data augmentation techniques (e.g., flipping, lighting variations, and rotation) and a knowledge distillation strategy - where YOLOv11-Seg (student) learned from YOLOv8-Seg (teacher) - significantly improved segmentation accuracy.The final results of the evaluation avaluation of the test set demonstrated strong segmentation performance. The model achieved a class-averaged mask mAP50 of 0.891, with individual class results as follows: 0.975 for Serious Hot Spot, 0.931 for Slight Hot Spot, and 0.766 for Dirt. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining detection-guided segmentation with targeted training enhancements for real-world solar panel inspection."

    "abstract": "The global displacement of people due to conflict, persecution, and political instability has reached unprecedented levels, creating significant challenges for humanitarian organizations and host nations. Accurate prediction of refugee and asylum seeker flows is crucial for effective resource allocation and policymaking. This work presents a data-driven approach to predicting the scale of displacement events using a comprehensive United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) dataset. We extensively evaluate a diverse range of machine learning models, from traditional ensembles to deep learning architectures, including MLP Regressor, TabNet, FT-Transformer, and DistillBERT. A two-level Stacking Regressor combines XGBoost, LightGBM, and AdaBoost as base learners with a Ridge Regressor metalearner trained on their out-of-fold predictions to enhance final predictive performance. The proposed Stacking Regressor model achieved a remarkable R -squared value of 0.989 on a single holdout test set. A more rigorous 5 -fold cross-validation was conducted to assess model generalizability and robustness. These results identified LightGBM as the superior model, achieving the highest average $\\boldsymbol{R}^{\\mathbf{2}}$ score of 0.88, demonstrating its reliability and stability against data variance. As a key methodological contribution, we employ a comprehensive Explainable AI (XAI) framework using both LIME and SHAP to interpret model predictions, bridging the critical gap between predictive accuracy and the transparency required for real-world adoption. This work demonstrates the potential of interpretable and robust machine learning to support proactive and evidence-based humanitarian action."

    "abstract": "One-stream transformer-based trackers have shown remarkable success in single object tracking by jointly performing feature extraction and relation modeling. However, the update of temporal context, often propagated via temporal tokens, typically relies on general self-attention mechanisms within the transformer backbone. This paper introduces STTATrack, a novel framework that enhances one-stream tracking by explicitly leveraging the immediate spatial certainty from the current frame’s prediction score map to refine these propagated temporal query tokens. Our core contribution, the Score Temporal Token Attention (STTA) module, generates an embedding from the score map and employs a dual attention mechanism to facilitate bidirectional information flow between this spatial certainty embedding and the existing temporal tokens. This targeted refinement allows temporal tokens to be dynamically adapted based on the most current and spatially precise evidence, leading to improved adaptability and temporal consistency. STTATrack builds upon the ODTrack architecture and demonstrates significant performance improvements on the challenging GOT10k, OTB and UAV123 benchmarks, underscoring the efficacy of explicitly integrating current-frame spatial certainty into the temporal refinement loop."

By predicting semantic category trajectories rather than individual items, the system captures long-term user interests and improves generalization to unseen content. Retrieved documents and user context are dynamically injected into generation via prompt engineering strategies, enabling high-quality recommendations without model finetuning. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating category signals leads to substantial performance improvements, particularly in cold-start settings."

A novel dataset was meticulously created which contains handwriting samples collected at Habib Bourguiba Hospital in Sfax, Tunisia, specifically designed for differentiating between PD and ET. Preprocessing techniques such as image resizing, normalization, and data augmentation were employed to enhance robustness. Feature extraction was performed using the ResNet50 model, effectively capturing essential image characteristics through global average pooling. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) was then applied to identify the most significant features, followed by the training and validation of two classification models Random Forest and SVM using these selected features. The performance of these models is rigorously assessed through various metrics, revealing that the Random Forest model attained an accuracy of $92.83 \\% \\pm 2$, while the SVM model achieved an average accuracy of $94.66 \\% \\pm 1$. Visualizations such as confusion matrices and ROC curves provide deeper insights into model performance. Overall, the findings demonstrate the potential of machine learning techniques to enhance diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing between PD and ET, ultimately contributing to improved clinical decision-making."

    "abstract": "Traditional protocol fuzzing techniques, such as those employed by AFL-based systems, often lack effectiveness due to a limited semantic understanding of complex protocol grammars and rigid seed mutation strategies. Recent works, such as ChatAFL, have integrated Large Language Models (LLMs) to guide protocol fuzzing and address these limitations, pushing protocol fuzzers to wider exploration of the protocol state space. But ChatAFL still faces issues like unreliable output, LLM hallucinations, and assumptions of LLM knowledge about protocol specifications. This paper introduces MultiFuzz, a novel dense retrieval-based multi-agent system designed to overcome these limitations by integrating semantic-aware context retrieval, specialized agents, and structured tool-assisted reasoning. MultiFuzz utilizes agentic chunks of protocol documentation (RFC Documents) to build embeddings in a vector database for a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling agents to generate more reliable and structured outputs, enhancing the fuzzer in mutating protocol messages with enhanced state coverage and adherence to syntactic constraints. The framework decomposes the fuzzing process into modular groups of agents that collaborate through chain-of-thought reasoning to dynamically adapt fuzzing strategies based on the retrieved contextual knowledge. Experimental evaluations on the Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) demonstrate that MultiFuzz significantly improves branch coverage and explores deeper protocol states and transitions over state-of-the-art (SOTA) fuzzers such as NSFuzz, AFLNet, and ChatAFL. By combining dense retrieval, agentic coordination, and language model reasoning, MultiFuzz establishes a new paradigm in autonomous protocol fuzzing, offering a scalable and extensible foundation for future research in intelligent agentic-based fuzzing systems."

With the emergence of Scalable Matrix Extension(SME) on ARMv9-A CPU, we analyze SME-based accelerating strategies and tailor an optimal approach for 3D high-order stencils. We introduce algorithmic optimizations based on Scalable Vector Extension(SVE) and SME unit to address strided memory accesses, alignment conflicts, and redundant accesses. We propose memory optimizations to boost on-package memory efficiency, and a novel multi-thread parallelism paradigm to overcome data-sharing challenges caused by the absence of shared data caches. SMEStencil sustains consistently high hardware utilization across diverse stencil shapes and dimensions. Our DMA-based inter-NUMA communication further mitigates NUMA effects and MPI limitations in hybrid parallelism. Combining all the innovations, SMEStencil outperforms state-of-the-art libraries on Nividia A100 GPGPU by up to 2.1× . Moreover, the performance improvements enabled by our optimizations translate directly to real-world HPC applications and enable Reverse Time Migration(RTM) real-world applications to yield 1.8x speedup versus highly-optimized Nvidia A100 GPGPU version."

This task must be tackled with tools that both explain the mechanisms underlying the social dynamics and efficiently handle vast amounts of data. While agent-based models (ABMs) are generally used as simulating tools to describe social dynamics, their connection to data is lackluster. Instead, here we adopt a probabilistic machine learning approach for fitting ABMs to real data. To this end, we propose a variational inference (VI) framework that estimates the macroscopic and microscopic parameters of several opinion dynamics models. Our methodology encompasses three steps: (i) translation of the opinion dynamics models into probabilistic generative models (PGMs), (ii) relaxation of discrete variables to make the models differentiable, and (iii) estimation of the parameters and latent variables via stochastic VI (SVI). Experiments show that VI improves over existing methods in estimating discrete and continuous variables, both at the microscopic and macroscopic scales, in all four different categories of rules opinion dynamics models. Moreover, VI effectively estimates high-dimensional variables, up to 400 agent-level attributes, and is faster than the alternatives."

    "abstract": "The proliferation of mobile edge computing (MEC) enhances its capability to deliver low-latency services, while the geographical distribution and limited resources of edge servers simultaneously make them increasingly susceptible to distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Existing edge DDoS mitigation strategies primarily focus on improving serviceability, that is, the number of mitigated requests, or reducing latency, yet often overlook systematic modeling of load fairness among edge servers. This omission can lead to resource imbalance, local overload, and ultimately degrade the system's long-term service performance and responsiveness to attacks. To address this issue, we propose the Fairness-aware Edge DDoS Mitigation (FairEDM) problem, which explicitly incorporates load fairness into the mitigation objective. Specifically, we first formulate FairEDM as a constrained optimization problem and prove its NP-hardness. To obtain a sub-optimal solution, we further model it as a game named FEDMGame, and design a distributed strategy formulation (FEDM-DSF) algorithm, based on multi-player best response dynamics. The resulting Nash equilibrium serves as a feasible mitigation strategy. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed FEDMGame framework."

The primary purpose is to improve the wideband target detection performance through maximizing the target signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in the presence of signal-dependent clutter. To achieve narrowband communications and precise jamming, we constrain the communication SINR in the frequency domain and the jamming to-distortion-ratio (JDR) to a high value to minimize the matching error of the synthesized signals. To efficiently design the MFRF waveforms, an alternating direction method of multiplier algorithm is developed to tackle the resultant non-convex problem. Numerical results show that the waveforms synthesized by the proposed algorithm can improve the target detection performance, synthesize communication signals and jamming signals over the pre scribed direction and frequency region, and thus support multiple functions simultaneously. Compared with the competing method, the proposed algorithm exhibits significantly lower computational complexity, enabling more efficient design of transmit waveforms."

    "abstract": "Sit-to-stand (STS) is a common and important motion for maintaining the mobility and independence of a person. Assistive devices such as automatic chairs or exoskeletons are expected to assist people experiencing difficulties during STS. To control such assistive devices, it is important to predict STS motion intention with sufficient anticipation time before an actual STS motion begins, because most devices require a certain time before applying sufficient assistive force, and the delay of device activation significantly degrades the quality of assistance and user self-agency. Another challenge is that STS is a non-cyclic motion, which lacks of preceding information, making motion forecasting is more difficult. In this paper, we designed a deep neural network (DNN) structure with multilayer (i.e., multiresolution) long short-term memory (LSTM) that forecasts the temporal muscle synergy of STS motions observed by surface electromyography (EMG). Prediction accuracy and anticipation time were evaluated using STS data from 10 participants, and an average accuracy of 87.97% was achieved for a forecast step (time) of 300 ms. The anticipation time increased with a longer forecast step. In addition, we found that the DNN with multiresolution LSTM outperformed the DNN with a single-resolution LSTM. The prediction performance was evaluated using a real assistive chair that was controlled based on the predicted data. The leg muscles were less activated when the chair was triggered before significant muscle activation began. These results suggest that using our prediction scheme before actual posture changes effectively enables assistive devices to reduce users’ muscle strength required for STS."

    "abstract": "Since the general representations produced by pre-trained feature extractors are often insensitive to intra-class variations, existing anomaly detection methods that store them directly in memory banks are constrained in performance. In addition, the distribution discrepancy among different modalities may cause cross-modal interference, further weakening the ability to discriminate anomalies. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Prototype Guidance Network (APG-Net) for multi-sensor anomaly detection. First, to avoid cross-modal feature interference, we construct independent anomaly detection branches for multi-sensor data including RGB images, point clouds and infrared images. Then, we introduce a non-parametric feature space reshaping paradigm for each modality. This paradigm adds no additional trainable parameters, ensuring efficiency and ease of deployment. It first learns guiding prototypes from normal samples and matches them to the general representations produced by pretrained extractors. Subsequently, a two-stage adaptive prototype guidance strategy is applied to reshape the feature distributions. This strategy enlarges the separation between normal and anomalous features in the feature space. Finally, we perform decision-level fusion to integrate the anomaly detection strengths from all sensor data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves an object-AUROC of 97.4% on the MulSen-AD multi-sensor anomaly detection benchmark, surpassing previous state-of-the-art approaches."

Case studies validate TREE’s unique capability to expose energy-service asymmetries in hybrid traffic scenarios where conventional metrics prove inadequate. Although it is impossible to determine every design detail of AI-integrated 6G network at current time, we believe that the proposed TREE based framework will help the network operators to quantify the operating energy cost of AI services and continue to evolve towards sustainable 6G networks."

It is the first attempt to utilize the square slots for radiating energy of a DCPA at millimeter-wave (mm-W) band, and simultaneously serving as the feeding structure for a BPF operating at microwave band. The DCPA function involves exciting two square slots to generate dual-polarized (DP) radiations, which are then passed through two 3D-printed polarizers placed above the slots to generate directional circularly polarized (CP) beams. Also, two resonators are constructed above the square slots, forming a filtering circuit for the BPF function. In this way, the slots serve as both the radiation aperture for DCPA at mm-W band and the feeding structures for the BPF operating at microwave band. For measurement results, the DCPA function has a 18.7% overlapped bandwidth for 3-dB axial ratio (AR) and impedance matching from 36.2 to 43.7 GHz, with a high isolation level of 32 dB between two ports and an average realized gain of 13.7 dBic.

To further release the functionality of corridor as bridges connecting different physical spaces, in this paper, we propose Widor, the first <underline xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Wi</u>Fi indoor localization system that designed specifically for corri<underline xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">dor</u>. We first explore the neglected elevation angle dimension information in WiFi positioning and creatively place AP vertically to avoid the large-angle effect, which is caused by the unique slender structure of the corridor. To eliminate the impact of complex multipath introduced by the narrow environment, we make full use of the Toeplitz structure of the covariance matrix to further improve the spatial resolution of existing commercial WiFi AP without increasing the additional hardware cost. Furthermore, we design a tailored multi-APs joint height compensation algorithm to bridge the gap between 2-D and 3-D localization, which iteratively optimize the height difference between the AP and the client through an alternating optimization method. Both the time dimensional information and map constraint can be used to further improve localization accuracy.

    "abstract": "It has been witnessed with the thriving popularity of elevators in contemporary society during modernization while posing an unavoidable challenge to consistently maintain their safety and reliability in routine operations. The conventional monitoring mechanisms prove insufficient to consistently monitor and evaluate the health condition of elevators in actual deployment. Under a plethora of research utilizing data-driven approaches to measure the degradation status of elevators, there also exist multiple industrial pain points while constraining their broad applications in the elevator industry. For instance, the imbalanced dataset with rare abnormal samples in actual life would lead to incomplete and inadequate representative feature learning during the model training process; the excessive reliance on synthetic laboratory data with proprietary application domains in experiment would impair the model's generalization capability; whilst the complex architecture as stacked in pursuit of functionality comprehensiveness would by no means contribute to effectiveness enhancement at the cost of efficiency decrease. This paper established a lightweight deep learning model with streamlined elegant architecture to resolve the aforementioned issues. The real-life imbalanced data have been collected and utilized directly under the devised algorithmic structure and training strategy without any need for laboratory synthesis on their compositions, yet largely alleviating the impact of imbalanced dataset phenomenon in effect. With the proposed effective feature extraction mechanisms, the receptive field and temporal correlations have been enhanced to further facilitate the monitoring efficiency and accuracy. As validated by the systematic experimental results, the receptive fields have been enlarged by 75% in comparison with the vanilla model structure and the parameter quantity have also been reduced by 21% while boosting the model's training and inferencing efficiency during the actual deployment. Meanwhile, in order to rigorously evaluate the model's robustness, the results have been thoroughly validated after splitting the dataset for multiple times with comprehensive ablation study scenarios to explore the optimal model configuration parameters. The proposed model demonstrated its superior performance by the outstripped average detection precision ratios under asymmetrical data allocations while shedding light on its practical application by industrial practitioners for real-life elevator condition monitoring."

    "abstract": "Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) offers fine-grained opinion mining by linking sentiments to specific aspects within text. While modern models often act as black boxes, limiting interpretability and trust, particularly in sensitive domains like agriculture, where understanding the underlying explanation behind model predictions is essential for building trust among farmers, agronomists, and agricultural stakeholders. To address this, we present an explainable ABSA pipeline tailored to smart agriculture, combining a hybrid DeBERTaHAN architecture with SHAP post-hoc explainability. Applied to an enriched, domain-specific Twitter dataset, our model achieves high classification performance ($87 \\%$ accuracy and F1-score) while offering interpretable, token-level SHAP visualizations. With a local fidelity of 0.98 and sparsity of 0.13, our approach balances predictive accuracy with transparency, making it wellsuited for decision support in smart agriculture. Additionally, we tested our model on popular ABSA benchmark datasets: SemEval2014-Task4, SemEval2015-Task12, and SemEval2016Task5 restaurants datasets, where it achieved accuracies of $88.77 \\%, 98.01 \\%$, and $87.72 \\%$, respectively."

While this provides opportunities for efficiency and innovation, it also raises concerns regarding how consumers perceive authenticity and trust when exposed to AI-generated brand content. This study investigates the influence of artificial intelligence on brand content and consumer perception in the fashion sector. The DeepFashion and DeepFashion2 datasets were employed as the visual base, combining fashion images with both human-written and AI-generated brand texts. Consumer feedback on authenticity, trust, innovation, and purchase intent was collected through surveys, and multimodal models were applied to link image and text features with perception outcomes. The results indicate that models trained with human-written content achieved an accuracy of about 87%, while those using AI-generated content reached around 83%. These findings suggest that although artificial intelligence can produce effective brand content, consumers respond more positively to human-authored narratives. The study provides insights into how fashion brands can integrate artificial intelligence while maintaining consumer confidence and brand value."

    "abstract": "Ensuring accurate and reliable wind power prediction is paramount for efficient scheduling and safe operation of power systems. However, the inherent instability of wind poses challenges for traditional prediction models, often resulting in low accuracy and inadequate data fitting. To overcome these hurdles, a novel hybrid approach is proposed in this study. Initially, the northern goshawk optimization algorithm(NGO) is employed to optimize the parameters of variational mode decomposition(VMD), thereby enhancing the decomposition performance and mitigating parameter related uncertainties. Throughout the optimization process, fuzzy entropy (FE) serves as the fitness function. Subsequently, a hybrid attention temporal convolutional network (HATCN) is proposed to extract deep temporal features across multiple variables and time steps. Further, cascaded gated recurrent unit(GRU) layers are employed to delve into the temporal correlations of these features. The dataset utilized in this study was sourced from Jiangsu wind farms in 2019 and validated using quarterly wind power data. When compared to empirical mode decomposition (EMD), ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and VMD signal decomposition methods, the proposed NVMD-HATCN-GRU model exhibited a notable decrease in the RMSE evaluation index by 344.77%, 128.11% and 19.41% respectively, in the second-quarter data. These experimental findings underscore the high accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method."

To overcome these limitations, we propose a modular framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced by structured prompting techniques. Our method quantifies discrepancies between numerical ratings and textual sentiment, extracts detailed, feature-level insights, and supports interactive exploration of reviews through retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA). Comprehensive experiments conducted on three diverse datasets (AWARE, Google Play, and Spotify) demonstrate that our LLM-driven approach significantly surpasses baseline methods, yielding improved accuracy, robustness, and actionable insights in challenging and context-rich review scenarios."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced in recent years, achieving remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, this progress has come at the cost of increasingly large model sizes, which pose significant challenges for deployment, scalability, and energy efficiency. To address these limitations, post-training pruning has emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and inference latency without the need for retraining. Despite these advantages, many existing pruning methods result in substantial performance degradation or require computationally expensive fine-tuning. In this work, we introduce Z-Pruner, a novel post-training pruning method designed to induce sparsity in pretrained LLMs without any retraining. Unlike conventional approaches, Z-Pruner leverages both weight update magnitudes and activation patterns to identify and eliminate redundant parameters more effectively. Our method is model-agnostic, efficient, and easy to implement. We evaluate Z-Pruner using multiple widely-used LLM architectures, including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and OPT, across a diverse set of standard language benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Z-Pruner surpasses state-of-the-art pruning methods that require intensive weight updates. Specifically, Z-Pruner achieves the lowest perplexity scores and the highest overall average score for zeroshot accuracy. We have made the corresponding codes publicly available at https://github.com/sazzadadib/Z-Pruner."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Bus passenger profiling is a critical task for optimizing urban transportation, but it is hindered by three key challenges: the heterogeneity of passenger behaviors, complex station-level interactions, and the prevalence of sparse, noisy transit data. Conventional end-to-end models that operate on aggregated traffic flow often fail to address these issues systematically. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes GRASP, a novel two-stage paradigm for passenger profiling and flow prediction. In the first stage, GRASP acts as a disentangling module, constructing a passenger-centric graph to cluster individuals into distinct behavioral profiles based on their co-occurrence patterns. In the second stage, it performs profile-aware forecasting by learning group-specific, dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies using an adaptive station graph. This station-level model is further enhanced by a contrastive learning objective to ensure robustness against data imperfections. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GRASP not only achieves significantly superior flow prediction accuracy but also uncovers actionable passenger profiles. By structurally decoupling passenger behavior from station-level dynamics, GRASP offers a more interpretable and effective solution for data-driven public transportation management."

Building on a Cascaded Linear Systems Model that identifies 200–400 μm as the optimal a-Se thickness for the top layer detector, we manufactured 253 μm and 414 μm a-Se samples with a polyimide hole-blocking contact to suppress dark current to below 10 pA/mm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> at electric fields up to 10 V/μm. Under low-energy X-ray irradiation, both devices demonstrated increasing response to increasing tube energy, with the 414 μm layer achieving higher photocurrent due to increased photon absorption. Temporal lag analysis revealed more pronounced signal persistence in the thicker sample at a lower bias, consistent with increased carrier trapping for greater thicknesses. These measurements provide critical metrics such as leakage, photoresponse, and lag for guiding the design of readout electronics in future direct/indirect DL-FPD arrays."

    "abstract": "In precision magnetic field measurement, the combination system of magnetic shielding devices and coils is essential to provide a stable and controllable magnetic field environment. However, close proximity between coils and shielding introduces severe coupling effects that degrade performance of the system. Self-shielded coil is conventionally used to reduce this effect, but its suppression effect is limited, and its nested configuration causes a large volume waste. To address the problem, we propose a novel design method for coupling-free magnetic field coil set, including main coils and shielded coils, at identical surface inside magnetic shielding systems, which can achieve ultra-high coupling-resistance and uniformity with maximum space saving. Based on the Fourier-Bessel function and magnetic field boundary condition, analytical models for magnetic field of the designed coils set under free and ferromagnetic boundaries are established, respectively. Through comparative analysis, the additional term caused by the coupling effect is separated, which enables the complete suppression of the coupling effect at the source. In addition, the quantum-inspired genetic algorithm is employed to solve the complex problem with strong constraints of higher performance and identical surface configuration efficiently. Taking the most commonly used circular coils in the shielding cylinder as the optimization object, we carry out the optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that our optimized coils reduce coupling factor to 0.28%, and improve uniformity to the order of 10⁻⁴ without any volume loss. The method can also be extended to other types of coils and magnetic shielding configurations to improve the accuracy of magnetic field measurement."

Breaking from conventional shared-aperture topologies plagued by cross-band interference and radiation pattern distortion, we propose a partial-element-reuse-based (PER) topology that strategically repurposes 50% of dual-band dual-polarized elements for simultaneous transmit and receive (STAR) operation. This configuration eliminates active element pattern distortion while achieving a reduction in element count, enabling wide-angle beam scanning essential for dynamic satellite tracking. Furthermore, a sandwich-structured printed circuit board (PCB) lamination method is further employed to streamline integration by partitioning functional modules into antenna, coupler, and active circuit layers interconnected via ball grid array (BGA) technology. This 3D integration strategy simplifies vertical interconnects, minimizes PCB layer requirements, and enhances thermal dissipation through embedded air gaps. Experimental results validate robust beamforming performance across ±60° scanning ranges for both transmitting and receiving arrays, achieving high transceiver isolation and signal integrity, which are imperative for high-capacity satellite links. By addressing key bottlenecks in LEO terminal design, the proposed innovations can accelerate the deployment of energy-efficient, cost-effective satellite networks, thus advancing the 6G vision of ubiquitous global connectivity."

    "abstract": "Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to discover behaviors or events deviating from the normality in videos. As a long-standing task in the field of computer vision, VAD has witnessed much good progress. In the era of deep learning, with the explosion of architectures of continuously growing capability and capacity, a great variety of deep learning-based methods are constantly emerging for the VAD task, greatly improving the generalization ability of detection algorithms and broadening the application scenarios. Therefore, such a multitude of methods and a large body of literature make a comprehensive survey a pressing necessity. In this article, we present an extensive and comprehensive research review, covering the spectrum of five different categories, namely, semi-supervised, weakly supervised, fully supervised, unsupervised, and open-set supervised VAD, and we also delve into the latest VAD works based on pretrained large models and open-world learning, remedying the limitations of past reviews in terms of only focusing on semi-supervised VAD and small model-based methods. For the VAD task with different levels of supervision, we construct a well-organized taxonomy, profoundly discuss the characteristics of different types of methods, and show their performance comparisons. In addition, this review involves the public datasets, open-source codes, and evaluation metrics covering all the aforementioned VAD tasks. Finally, we provide several important research directions for the VAD community.

    "abstract": "MEMS vector hydrophones are poised to become the core devices of miniaturized underwater acoustic sensing. However, existing MEMS vector hydrophones suffer from low sensitivity and shallow concave point depth, which hinders long-range detection. In this work, we present an axisymmetric bionic seal whisker–type piezoelectric MEMS vector hydrophone (ASWVH) that leverages bioinspired geometries and stress-concentration regions to amplify piezoelectric output, yielding enhanced directivity and high sensitivity. The optimal microstructure dimensions for ASWVH were determined using COMSOL 5.6 simulations. The biomimetic seal whisker structure not only ensures an operational frequency bandwidth of 20–2000 Hz but also expands the effective acoustic reception area, thereby further enhancing sensitivity. The unique wavy bionic sealing whisker shape provides high sensitivity, and the measured X-axis and Y-axis sensitivities are -171.7 dB and -173.2 dB@2 kHz (re. 1 V/μPa), respectively. Moreover, the device exhibits an exceptional “8”-shaped directivity pattern with concave point depth exceeding 40 dB in both channels, rendering it well-suited for high-precision passive underwater detection."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning, which excels in simulation, often fails to transfer to real robot manipulation, where rewards are sparse and control is continuous, owing to exploration failure and low efficiency. We propose imitation-guided reinforcement learning (IGRL) that combines stable guidance from expert demonstrations with the adaptability of online reinforcement learning through simple two-point integration. At each step, the actions proposed by a reinforcement policy and an independently trained imitation policy are evaluated using a target Q-network, and an action with a larger Q value is executed. The same principle shapes the TD target, which reduces variance and mitigates early instability. This method avoids demonstration oversampling and auxiliary regularization, lowers the hyperparameter sensitivity, and permits distinct architectures for the imitation and reinforcement components to maximize representation learning. For pixel inputs, a deformable ViT encoder leverages the global context, and a tree-based optimal action search efficiently explores continuous action sequences. Empirically, the IGRL surpasses strong baselines across five manipulation tasks and walker and quadruped locomotion, with wider margins as the difficulty increases. For a real robot, IGRL attains 0.81 accuracy on pick and 0.74 on pick and place, with smaller degradation under harder settings, improving the sample efficiency, convergence speed, and reproducibility."

    "abstract": "With the increasing reliance on global air and sea transport, the need for effective underwater search mechanisms is becoming more pressing. However, complex marine environments presents substantial challenges for the recovery of crashed aircraft or sunken vessels. Existing underwater search methods rely heavily on acoustic communication, which is constrained in both range and energy. Although molecular communication offers considerable promise, there is a lack of search algorithms applicable to underwater scenarios. Therefore, we propose the hexagonal inverse gradient search (HIGS) algorithm for the search mission of lost objects underwater. HIGS employs the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) that navigates using molecular concentration gradients. To overcome the challenge of nearly zero-gradient regions, we develop a set of three-dimensional motion rules based on real-time chemical sensing, allowing AUVs to adjust their trajectories adaptively. Additionally, a zero-gradient escape strategy is incorporated to prevent the AUV from becoming trapped in local optima within complex underwater environments, thereby ensuring persistent and effective target search. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in underwater search missions."

    "abstract": "The geometry of road surfaces plays a critical role in the performance of autonomous driving systems. Consequently, achieving accurate and efficient road surface reconstruction (RSR) is of paramount importance. However, due to the inherent effects of perspective projection, distant regions often exhibit geometric distortions and a long-tailed distribution, which pose significant challenges to existing reconstruction methods. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, termed Direction-aware Pseudo-Stereo Road Reconstruction Network (DPS-Net), which incorporates two lightweight and plug-and-play modules: Direction-Aware Feature Enhancement (DFE) module and Pseudo-Stereo Fusion (PSF) module. The DFE module is designed to enhance the perception of sparse and geometry-invariant features by integrating directional context, while the PSF module captures global dependencies across spatial and channel dimensions through pseudo-stereo fusion. Both modules are constructed with an emphasis on maintaining low computational complexity. We conducted extensive experiments on the public RSRD dataset to evaluate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/yidanyi/DPS-Net."

    "abstract": "Open-set classification of small targets in high-resolution maritime radars is a difficult problem. Due to various small targets, classifiers in service always encounter samples from unknown classes, which do not participate in training. Closed-set classifiers cannot distinguish between targets of known classes and unknown classes. In this paper, an open-set classification method using standardized time-frequency distribution images is proposed to classify small targets. It combines the existing closed-set ResNet classifier with a proposed supervised variational autoencoder for feature extraction and an improved OpenMax layer. To meet the open-set classification demands, a supervised variational autoencoder feature extractor is constructed by imposing the loss terms on the loss function to increase interclass distances, decrease intraclass distances of known classes, and constrain them to the surrounding region in the feature space, thereby mapping the standardized time-frequency distribution images into low-dimensional feature vectors. In the low-dimensional feature space, each known class is modelled by Weibull extreme distribution and Mahalanobis distance. The SoftMax score from the closed-set ResNet classifier and statistical models of the known classes in the feature space are combined into the OpenMax layer with rejection ability to samples from unknown classes. The proposed open set classification method is verified by maritime radar small target classification datasets from three open radar databases and island-based radar measured datasets. The experimental results show that the well-trained classifiers can effectively classify known classes of small targets and reject the samples from unknown classes."

    "abstract": "Automated Visual Inspection is a cornerstone of modern manufacturing, yet the development of robust deep learning models is frequently impeded by the scarcity and imbalance of training data. This challenge is particularly acute for industrial defects, which often manifest as subtle anomalies intrinsically linked to complex, structured backgrounds. To address this challenge, CRG-DefectDiffuser is proposed as a collaborative generative framework for high-fidelity defect synthesis. At its core lies the Collaborative Refinement Guidance (CRG) mechanism, which orchestrates two specialized diffusion models: one trained on abundant defect-free images to master background context, and another trained on scarce defect patches to encode fine-grained defect semantics. The CRG mechanism steers the synthesis by dynamically generating a guidance map, which is refined through a four-stage process to ensure that morphologically accurate defects are seamlessly integrated into the appropriate background context. Augmenting training data with our method boosts the defect detection mAP@50-95 from a baseline of 0.496 to 0.557, corresponding to a 12.3 percentage point relative improvement. The framework also demonstrates superior scalability, with performance gains continuing up to the three-fold data augmentation evaluated in our experiments, a point where competing methods often falter. These results establish CRG-DefectDiffuser as an effective and practical solution to data scarcity in industrial visual inspection, with strong potential for generalization across diverse manufacturing scenarios.

Using a two-phase mixed-method approach, we surveyed 281 participants to measure three indicators: consistency, privacy vigilance, and privacy perception. The results showed that $77 \\%$ of the respondents always or often share their location without verification, with only $31 \\%$ demonstrating consistency between their stated privacy beliefs and actual behavior. The average privacy vigilance score was $28.2 \\%$, indicating limited caution, while the average privacy perception accuracy was $48 \\%$, revealing substantial misconceptions about privacy. In the second phase, we developed a multi-factor analytical framework that combined cultural, behavioral, and regulatory perspec-tives-drawing on Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions, Communication Privacy Management theory, and Contextual Integrity-to explain this behavior. Our findings revealed that social norms, high institutional trust, a lack of autonomy in service interactions, and the limited maturity of the new personal data protection law all contribute to risky data-sharing practices. These insights can guide policymakers, regulators, and educators in designing targeted awareness initiatives and legal methods of intervention to improve privacy behaviors in Saudi Arabia."

Despite their potential, ELF propagation in seawater is more complex due to interactions with the air-sea boundary and frequency-dependent attenuation caused by seawater. Here we present a new set of approximate formulas for the EM field components for cross-medium propagation from air-to undersea, due to a vertical electric dipole (VED). The formulas, derived through asymptotic and series expansions of Sommerfeld integrals (SIs), address the limitations of existing models by accurately characterizing EM field in the transition zone between near-field and intermediate-field regions and impose no restrictions on reception depth. Comparisons and analyses with related work and numerical results demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of our formulas. The formulas provide simplified calculations, clear physical interpretation, and broad applicability without distance or frequency restrictions. The results enhance the feasibility of ELF communication across air-sea interfaces."

These trends have expanded the parameter space while tightening the time window for tuning convergence, making it challenging to maintain high system performance. Existing tuning strategies often struggle to balance thorough parameter exploration with real-time responsiveness, limiting their effectiveness under fast-evolving workloads and heterogeneous deployment environments. To address these challenges, we propose KGQW, the first framework that formulates automated parameter tuning as a knowledge graph query workflow. KGQW models workload features and system parameters as graph vertices, with performance metrics represented as edges, and constructs an initial knowledge graph through lightweight performance tests. Guided by performance prediction and Bayesian-driven exploration, KGQW progressively expands the graph, prunes insensitive parameters, and refines performance relationships to build an informative and reusable knowledge graph that supports rapid configuration retrieval via graph querying. Moreover, KGQW enables efficient knowledge transfer across clusters, substantially reducing the construction cost for new clusters. Experiments on real-world applications and storage clusters demonstrate that KGQW achieves second-level tuning latency, while maintaining or surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the promise of knowledge-driven tuning in meeting the scalability and adaptability demands of modern distributed storage systems."

    "abstract": "The real-time knowledge of mmWave device orientation offers dual benefits for wireless networks and Internet of Things (IoT) applications: it enhances communication and localization performance through link diagnosis, and it enables context inference with asset and wearable tracking. This paper presents MetaPol, a novel system architecture that augments commodity mmWave access points (APs) with a carefully designed ultra-low-cost anisotropic metasurface to non-invasively extract the orientation of client devices, without hindering data reception or modifying hardware. MetaPol leverages the polarization of transmitted electromagnetic (EM) waves as an accurate indicator of the orientation of linearly polarized antenna arrays, prevalent in commercial mmWave mobile and IoT devices. Yet, polarization sensing is rarely supported by commodity APs due to the need for two orthogonally polarized antenna arrays to capture the incident electric field. Instead, MetaPol creates virtual polarization channels to characterize impinging electric fields, through the conversions of wave polarization on the fly as it interacts with the metasurface. To design MetaPol, we model and exploit the properties of a unique anisotropic metamaterial based on C-shaped split-ring resonators. We discover that, when grouped in certain configurations, these meta-elements can convert the incident polarization in a deterministic way. We show that three polarization channels are sufficient for unambiguous orientation sensing, and we provide a corresponding three-shot non-coherent protocol that extracts user orientation by comparing the power received from distinct surface areas. Through extensive over-the-air experiments with more than 1000 measurements in the mmWave band, we demonstrate that MetaPol achieves a mean error of 2.6° across practical settings with negligible compromise to the underlying data communication link."

    "abstract": "Aligned with the requirements of efficient charging infrastructure operation and user satisfaction, this study treats smart charging scheduling for the DC fast-charging infrastructure of a shopping mall (SM) parking lot as an operator profit maximization problem. The proposed approach simultaneously enforces with realistic station-level constraints, that plug uniqueness, plug reservation, vehicle/plug matching continuity, plug-power limitation and capacity limits and with vehicle and user level requirements, namely the attainment of the target battery state of energy (SoE), the time-of-use (ToU) tariff, and an incentive-based dynamic user tariff derived from renewable energy generation. A genetic algorithm (GA) based optimization framework is established; solutions that maximize operator profit are sought. Defined on a one-day time series comprising the photovoltaic (PV) and wind-turbine (WT) generation profiles integrated on the SM rooftop, together with grid buy-sell prices, the model enforces that all vehicles attain their end-of-day target state of energy (SoE), targets higher operator profit through enhanced user incentives during periods of renewable generation, and reduces peak loading on the grid. The study framework is structured around cases in which system capabilities and scale are varied, and resources are commissioned sequentially. The results of case simulations indicate that, without violating any constraints, operator profit can be increased, peak demand can be reduced, the load profile can be smoothed, and user cost can be lowered through the proposed incentive mechanism."

    "abstract": "Improving the quality of Satellite images using an enhancement technique is an important and complex phenomenon. These images are mainly used in applications like urban development, navigation, and climate monitoring, and conducting research with these applications requires a high-quality enhancement of the image to provide more information. In fact, the traditional techniques for image enhancement work less well in areas with high noise or low light levels because they are not designed for striking a balance between contrast improvement and noise amplification. The proposed method is an advancement of the existing method using contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization with a hybrid metaheuristic approach. The proposed hybrid approach is developed by combining the exploration ability of the original particle swarm optimization with the exploitation refinement of the grey wolf optimizer. The proposed method is validated on satellite images taken from different platforms. The enhanced images obtained by the proposed method are compared with the three popular traditional image enhancement techniques, namely Histogram Equalization, Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization, and Adaptive Gamma Correction with Weighting Distribution, as well as with four different metaheuristic-based methods, such as the original Particle Swarm Optimization, Grey Wolf Optimizer, Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm, and Elk Herd Optimizer. Further, the proposed method is also compared with four different kinds of other recent state-of-the-art methods, which include recent traditional and optimization algorithms, as well as recent deep learning and transformer-based models. The comparison of the proposed method with the other methods is carried out using several image quality metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index, feature similarity index, entropy, mean squared error, etc. The proposed method shows quality improvements in images with a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 34.51 dB, a structural similarity index measure of 0.914, and entropy of 7.76, thus proving its ability in satellite image enhancement. This work impacts tasks relevant to image processing, such as improving the quality of satellite images to provide good visual clarity, in situations like a lack of visual appearance and details of the image, and, therefore, makes it much better to make decisions in higher-level applications involving satellite images. The proposed method, with an approach of automated parameter optimization, is better in performance compared to traditional techniques, as well as with deep learning and transformation-based approaches. It establishes a premise for further and more efficient, and accurate satellite image enhancement techniques."

However, existing chaos-based encryption schemes often face challenges in flexibly generating complex chaotic attractors and achieving a practical balance between security, flexibility, and efficiency. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel universal method for generating multi-structure chaotic attractors based on a quaternion rotation matrix transformation. This method enables flexible control over the position, scale, and number of wing units in attractors by configuring quaternion parameters and multi-level pulse function. Building upon this, we design a high-performance chaos-based audio encryption algorithm, and implement an encryption system for wireless transmission using a microcontroller and LoRa module. The system integrates audio recording, encryption, wireless transmission, and decryption. Comprehensive security analyses demonstrate the proposed algorithm achieves robust performance. The successful integration of flexible chaotic attractor design, robust cryptographic security, and hardware realization confirms the practical viability of our scheme for information transmission in resource-constrained environments."

    "abstract": "Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) systems face challenges in maintaining efficient reconciliation over long distances due to the time variant signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) imposed by channel quality fluctuations. Hence fixed-rate error-correction schemes using low-density parity-check (LDPC) or Polar codes lead to high block-error rates (BLER) and degraded secret key rates (SKR). To overcome this, we propose an incremental redundancy aided hybrid automatic repeat request (IR-HARQ) protocol using rate-compatible Polar and LDPC codes. Explicitly, by puncturing a mother code and progressively transmitting additional redundant bits, our method dynamically adapts the effective coding rate to the prevalent channel conditions, achieving 2–3 dB SNR gains per retransmission. This adaptive strategy avoids unnecessary redundancy in good channels and strengthens protection in poor channels, thereby improving reconciliation efficiency. Simulation results show that our IR-HARQ scheme significantly enhances the BLER, throughput, and secure transmission distance compared with single-transmission schemes. Moreover, our study highlights that Polar IR-HARQ achieves superior performance in short block-length and low-SNR scenarios, while LDPC IR-HARQ is more competitive for longer codes and higher SNR. These findings confirm IR-HARQ as an attractive and versatile reconciliation solution for real-world CV-QKD deployments."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a robust control strategy for a Buck-type DC–DC (BTDCDC) converter under voltage-mode control (VMC) using only output-voltage feedback. Robust control design is challenging due to parametric and unstructured uncertainties, set-point tracking, source-voltage and load disturbances, and high-frequency (HF) sensor noise. To address these issues, a Quantitative Feedback Theory (QFT) based two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) control architecture is developed. The advantages of the proposed QFT approach are: (i) 2-DOF control structure comprises PID controller and a pre-filter, which provides additional flexibility to improve the output voltage set-point tracking despite model variations (ii) Low transient inductor current, leads to subsequent reduced losses (iii) Inclusion of disturbance dynamics and an unstructured uncertainty in the controller loop-shaping design itself (iv) Reduced output voltage deviation for source and load disturbances (v) Improved suppression of HF sensor noise with less peak-to-peak inductor current and duty ratio variation. Experimental validation on a BTDCDC prototype confirms superior tracking and regulation performance. For source-voltage disturbances, the proposed method reduces peak voltage deviation by 30–50% and achieves settling times 4–8 faster. HF noise attenuation is also significantly improved."

    "abstract": "Camera-based 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction (SOP) is crucial for understanding complex 3D scenes from limited 2D image observations. Existing SOP methods typically aggregate contextual features to assist the occupancy representation learning, alleviating issues like occlusion or ambiguity. However, these solutions often face misalignment issues wherein the corresponding features at the same position across different frames may have different semantic meanings during the aggregation process, which leads to unreliable contextual fusion results and an unstable representation learning process. To address this problem, we introduce a new <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Hi</i>erarchical context alignment paradigm for a more accurate <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SOP</i> <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">(Hi-SOP)</i>. Hi-SOP first disentangles the geometric and temporal context for separate alignment, which two branches are then composed to enhance the reliability of SOP. This parsing of the visual input into a local-global alignment hierarchy includes: (I) disentangled geometric and temporal separate alignment, within each leverages depth confidence and camera pose as prior for relevant feature matching respectively; (II) global alignment and composition of the transformed geometric and temporal volumes based on semantics consistency. Our method outperforms SOTAs for semantic scene completion on the SemanticKITTI & NuScenes-Occupancy datasets and LiDAR semantic segmentation on the NuScenes dataset."

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used for environmental monitoring and riverine studies; however, their dependence on Global Positioning System (GPS) localization is often compromised in forested areas, under bridges, or above highly dynamic water surfaces. Conventional vision-based navigation methods struggle with sparse textures and transient disturbances, leading to unstable positioning and drift. This paper presents a robust real-time visual–inertial navigation framework that integrates neural network–based optical flow estimation (NeuFlow v2), the Dynamic Divided Method (DDM), and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data through a Kalman Filter (KF). The DDM adaptively segments the optical-flow field according to water-surface dynamics and local texture stability, suppressing transient artifacts such as ripples and reflections, while the KF stabilizes state estimation by compensating for outliers and short-term measurement loss. Field experiments at Kangqiao, Green River, and Wu River sites demonstrate that DDM-enhanced visual odometry (VO) significantly improves robustness in low-texture and dynamic conditions. The fused framework combining NeuFlow v2, DDM, and KF achieves high trajectory similarity with GPS benchmarks, reduced drift, and enhanced spatial consistency. These findings validate a practical and effective solution for accurate UAV localization and autonomous environmental monitoring in GPS-degraded riverine environments."

SENet(Squeeze and Excitation) attention mechanism is added after AtrousSpatial Pyramid Pooling(ASPP) enabling the model to adaptively select more important thermal spot feature scales and assign corresponding weights;Simultaneously incorporating BiFPN (Bi-directional Feature) into the decoder to retain edge information and suppress noise interference.The Pyramid Network module is designed to adapt to the characteristics of thermal spot damage. The experimental results show that the BS-DeepLabV3+ model proposed in this study can accurately identify thermal spot damage and detect the degree of damage. Compared with the original DeepLabV3+ model, the recognition accuracy of the BS-DeepLabV3+ model has been improved by 2.75%, and the MPA value has been improved by 4.97%. It has achieved significant improvements in key indicators such as accuracy and intersection to union ratio, while effectively reducing the number of parameters, fully verifying its superior performance and lightweight advantages in thermal spot detection tasks with different degrees of damage."

In the paper, tower-based tomographic radar observations of a boreal forest at L-band are used to measure canopy-only backscatter. Results show that the latter is anticorrelated with stem water content. Time series of both canopy backscatter and attenuation were extracted and linked to in situ stem water content using a scattering model. Results show that the proposed canopy backscatter model effectively captures the diurnal and long-term variations in stem water content, with an RMSE of 4%. The estimated model coefficients indicate that the sensitivity of extinction to stem water content dominates over the sensitivity of volume backscatter to stem water content. Moreover, the attenuation time series and corresponding model resulted in a better agreement with an RMSE of 2%. However, attenuation requires a known concealed reference target in the forest which limits its use over extended areas. While the study is limited in scope and the model has not been validated for broader generalization, these findings offer preliminary insights into the sensitivity of L-band radar to forest VWC and may support future observational strategies."

From resume parsers to interview analyses to job market management, several AI-based tools are gradually introduced to facilitate and fast-track recruitment processes. To preselect candidates during a recruitment operation, we propose a recommender system (RS) that employs a neural network (NN) architecture integrating transformers and graph neural networks (GNNs). We transform the initial data into a heterogeneous graph, which is later converted into a GNN. Then, various convolutional layers extract fine-grained structural and semantic information from the input data. Next, the relationships between the nodes of the GNN are passed to a transformer model (both encoder and decoder) to predict a user’s (or group of users’) preference. From our experiments, graph attention network (GAT) is the best-performing architecture, while residual gated graph ConvNet (RGGC) is the most robust. As well, the combination of GAT and GraphSAGE is the best-performing composite architecture. Finally, the combination of GAT and graph convolutional network (GCN) exhibits the highest diversity in the recommendation. Overall, these results demonstrate the reliability, effectiveness, accuracy, robustness and scalability with enhanced diversity in combining GNN for representation learning and a transformer as a scoring model in RSs."

This study investigates the nature of digital persuasion and its impact on the audience engagement in political discourse on the X platform (formerly Twitter). Specifically we analyze how persuasive strategies employed by political influencers and news media accounts differ during a U.S. election event, and how types of persuasion correlate with the engagement the audiences. Our approach encompasses an analysis of the Aristotles persuasion framework that consists of three appeals: Ethos (credibility), Pathos (emotion appeal), and logos (logic and reasoning), along with sentiment, and social network analysis. The findings identify that political influencers tend to employ a hybrid strategy that combines ethos and logos to maximize user engagement and exhibit high linguistic homophily with their ego networks. In contrast, news media accounts predominantly rely on ethos-driven appeals and show limited rhetorical alignment with their audiences. These insights highlight how rhetorical adaptation and audience alignment differ between influencers and institutional actors, offering a new lens for understanding digital political communication."

Existing studies address isolated issues such as gender bias in embeddings, dialectal imbalance, or cultural misrepresentation, but they do not provide a unified approach that spans the entire data lifecycle. This paper proposes a conceptual, Arabic-specific framework for ethical dataset preparation. The framework consolidates automated bias detection tools, mitigation techniques, and governance practices into a structured, auditable pipeline. Its novelty lies not in the creation of new algorithms, but in the systematic integration and adaptation of established methods such as AraWEAT, counterfactual augmentation, and sample reweighting to the sociolinguistic complexities of Arabic, including diglossia, dialect diversity, and gender representation. The work is presented as a conceptual and methodological contribution. A schematic case study illustrates how the framework operates in practice, showing how detection, dialectal enrichment, and fairness audits can reduce representational skew. While the focus is Arabic, the framework provides a transferable foundation for building ethical and inclusive datasets in other low-resource languages."

In scenarios such as gravity gradient measurements on moving-platforms, strong motion disturbances make this consistency assessment and compensation essential, yet challenging with conventional methods. This paper proposes a method of precisely evaluating accelerometer frequency response consistency (FRC) by introducing an auxiliary reference frequency in addition to the test frequency. Two accelerometers are excited side by side during the sweep test. Systematic analysis indicates that it can significantly suppress dominant common-mode errors which result from the test apparatus, the monitoring instruments, the accelerometer under test and the susceptibility of them to the environmental conditions in such an FRC test. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method yields substantially more precise evaluation of the FRC than individually testing every accelerometer. A compensation filter is accordingly designed to correct the inconsistency between two self-developed accelerometers, improving amplitude consistency to better than 10 ppm and phase consistency to better than 10 μrad."

    "abstract": "The rapid development of Internet-connected devices has driven the rise of smart cities, where large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) systems require efficient infrastructure management with centralized monitoring and control. In this context, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) architecture offers an effective solution to fulfill centralized management needs and optimize network quality. By decoupling the data plane from the control plane, SDN consolidates control over network traffic, allowing flexible configuration and real-time traffic optimization. However, the separation also exposes SDN to severe attacks, particularly Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, along with other exploitation techniques targeting its architecture. In this study, we propose a network traffic classification model for SDN environments that leverages multiple Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models integrated with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) technology. This approach enables precise and transparent model decisions while reducing computational costs and improving classification accuracy. The proposed model achieves up to 99% accuracy across various network attack detection and classification scenarios within SDN, both with and without XAI assistance. Notably, the incorporation of XAI allows the model to retain high performance using only approximately 15% of the original feature set, significantly outperforming models without XAI. This feature reduction contributes to substantial decreases in training time, inference time, and model size, demonstrating the method’s feasibility and effectiveness for real-time deployment in SDN-based networks."

    "abstract": "Small surface defects in automotive manufacturing such as micro-cracks, springbacks, and minor deformations typically appear in highly curved or reflective regions of large and complex components. Although recent Artificial Intelligence (AI)–based visual inspection systems have improved classification, existing whole-image classification methods still struggle to identify subtle or localized defects that occupy only a small portion of the image. These subtle defects occupy only small and localized regions, analyzing the entire image as a single representation often leads to missed detections and insufficient sensitivity. To address these issues, we propose a small defect classification system using patch-based methodology. The approach divides each car-door image into spatial windows, enabling localized inspection of subtle defects that would otherwise be masked in full-image representations. First, Each window is processed using an enhanced Large Kernel Attention (LKA)-based ResNet50 backbone, where the LKA mechanism increases the effective receptive field and improves small-defect discriminability within each patch. Second, To overcome the limitation of independent patch predictions, we introduce a Self-Attention-Based Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Aggregator that learns inter-patch dependencies and adaptively fuses window-level outputs into a robust whole-image decision, ensuring that cross-window defects are not overlooked. Experimental results showthat the combination of localized patch inspection, LKA-enhanced feature extraction, and self-attention based MLP aggregation yields superior performance, achieving 95% accuracy and 95% F1-score. These results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed image patching methodology as a reliable and scalable solution for industrial small-defect detection."

    "abstract": "Cloud APIs serve as critical facilitators for data exchange, capability replication, and service delivery, having become integral to the digital infrastructure that underpins modern service-oriented software development and operations. However, the rapid proliferation of available cloud APIs poses considerable challenges for developers in selecting the most appropriate cloud APIs to fulfill their development requirements. Current methods primarily rely on historical interaction data, which are particularly inadequate in cold-start scenarios where such data is scarce. Furthermore, these approaches often neglect the complementary relationships that inherently exist between mashups and cloud APIs. To this end, we propose a functional complementarity-aware representation learning (FCRL) model for mitigating cold-start in cloud API recommendation. FCRL has a three-fold main idea: 1) constructing a functional complementary graph by examining tag co-occurrence patterns between Mashups and cloud APIs; 2) exploiting a graph convolutional network to derive representations that encapsulate functional complementarity for both mashups and cloud APIs; and 3) utilizing an attention mechanism to dynamically integrate representations of functional complementarity, collaborative interaction, and content information, thereby producing high-quality feature embeddings for cold-start mashups and cloud APIs. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FCRL significantly outperforms existing methods in both sparse and cold-start scenarios. Furthermore, the incorporation of attention weights within FCRL facilitates the identification of the primary types of information that influence predictions, thereby enhancing the understandability of FCRL. Our code is available at https://github.com/whitewolf666/FCRL."

    "abstract": "Large language models are increasingly used for legal research, drafting, and analysis, but their answers can be inconsistent, hard to verify, and sensitive to small changes in prompt wording. This paper introduces a structured prompting framework for applying large language models to five core legal tasks: statutory interpretation, contract review, case summarization, legal question-answering, and clause extraction. The framework helps draft prompts using task-specific templates, role-based instructions, example-based guidance, chain-of-thought reasoning and context-layered reasoning, and is paired with an evaluation that measures exact match, F1, ROUGE-L, macro F1, and a legal hallucination rate defined through a rubric for unsupported or incorrect legal claims. To contextualize these results, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation baseline is implemented and evaluated on the same tasks. Experiments across multiple state-of-the-art models show that the structured prompting framework consistently improves accuracy and stability over less structured prompts and over the Retrieval-Augmented Generation baseline in this setting, with the largest gains for reasoning-intensive tasks such as statutory interpretation and legal question-answering. Context-layered and chain-of-thought prompts yield the highest scores and the lowest hallucination rates overall. Statistical analysis over multiple runs, using mean, variance, standard deviation, and 95% confidence intervals, indicates that the best model–prompt combinations are both strong and stable. The findings offer practical guidance on which structured prompting strategies are most effective for different categories of legal tasks."

The framework, based on a wormhole router architecture, automatically configures interconnections, routing paths, and network parameters according to user specifications, eliminating manual intervention and reducing design time errors.

The proposed design was evaluated for throughput, latency, packet delivery ratio (PDR), and energy per packet. Results show that the BFT topology delivers the highest PDR (98.2%) and the lowest energy consumption (1.80 nJ), confirming the framework scalability.

    "abstract": "Geometry problem solving (GPS) requires high-level symbolic and logical reasoning based on geometry theorem knowledge to arrive at the answer. Despite the remarkable advances achieved by Large Language Models (LLMs) in various problem-solving tasks, they still struggle to perform rigorous multi-step geometry reasoning, which is essential for GPS. In this paper, we propose a dynamic tree-based geometry problem solver named GeoTree, which combines a knowledgeable LLM with a rigorous symbolic solver to perform geometry reasoning cooperatively. Specifically, an iterative multi-step geometry reasoning process is performed dynamically based on a tree-like structure, thereby emulating divergent and deliberate human problem-solving thinking. Each geometry reasoning step is completed collaboratively through four components, consisting of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Theorem Seeker</i>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Symbolic Solver</i>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Evaluator</i>, and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Controller</i>.

    "abstract": "In the era of the Internet of Things, massive network data streams are continuously generated, with distributions that evolve unpredictably over time. This dynamic nature poses significant challenges for effective analysis. To address this, we propose a novel double-layer concept drift detection algorithm based on isolation forest, termed IF-DLDD, designed to identify multiple types of concept drift. The framework consists of a detection layer, where isolation forest detects anomalies across consecutive sliding windows, and a verification layer, where a T-test is employed to precisely localize drift points and reduce false alarms. We evaluate IF-DLDD on both noisy synthetic datasets and the real-world CIC-IDS2017 intrusion detection dataset. The results demonstrate that IF-DLDD achieves timely and accurate detection across diverse drift types, maintaining a high detection rate with low false positives and strong noise robustness. In network intrusion detection tasks, IF-DLDD effectively identifies all attack drifts with minimal false positives and detection delays under practical parameter settings. These findings highlight IF-DLDD as a promising and practical approach for concept drift detection in dynamic data streams."

    "abstract": "Functional electrical stimulation (FES) has emerged as a promising technique for motor rehabilitation, yet quantifying its effects remains challenging. While current assessment methods utilizing clinical scales, kinematic parameters, and biomarkers offer comprehensive evaluations, they fail to delineate the specific motor function domains influenced by FES, and quantify both therapeutic outcomes and functional improvements. To address these limitations, we introduced multi-objective decision analysis method to propose a novel multidimensional evaluation framework for assessing FES-driven motor performance under varying stimulation parameters. This study represents the first systematic analysis of the effects of different FES parameters on motor function from three dimensions: movement execution completeness, dynamic movement stability, and muscle fatigue. For this, we collected surface electromyogram (EMG) and inertial signals under different parameters of FES-driven wrist movements. As a result, we found a relationship between the FES stimulus parameters and different movement level features. Our findings demonstrate that completion indicators generally increased with increasing stimulus amplitude, while movement stability indicators showed an inverse relationship with stimulus frequency. Notably, fatigue indicators exhibited dual trends, reflecting different aspects of motor unit performance. Further analysis showed revealed that our proposed model was sensitive to changes in stimulus parameter conditions while maintaining consistent evaluation rankings as sample sizes increase. This work establishes a novel, cost-effective model and methodology to quantify motor function and stimulus effects during FES application, providing a crucial foundation for subsequent precise modulation of FES parameters and timely evaluation of rehabilitation progress."

This paper addresses the trajectory planning problem for high-speed penetration, specifically focusing on minimizing oscillations in the reference trajectories. We propose S-Flocking, an integrated framework that reduces abrupt transitions in behavioral vector synthesis through the sigmoid-based transformation. For global path planning, we propose the Bisection-based Rewiring RRT* (B-RRT*) algorithm, which combines bidirectional search with dual backtracking optimization and bisection-based node insertion strategy to enhance computational efficiency and path quality. For reactive local planning, we introduce a dual-layer avoidance strategy (DAS) that integrates COLREGs-compliant maneuvers with 1-vs-1 emergency mechanism, resolving conflicts between formation-keeping and avoidance in dynamic encounters. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that S-Flocking generates smoother reference trajectories with effective formation cohesion, thereby providing a robust solution for autonomous cooperative navigation in partially unknown dynamic maritime environments."

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is one of the key usage scenarios for future sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication networks, where communication and sensing (C&S) services are simultaneously provided through shared wireless spectrum, signal processing modules, hardware, and network infrastructure. Such an integration is strengthened by the technology trends in 6G, such as denser network nodes, larger antenna arrays, wider bandwidths, higher frequency bands, and more efficient utilization of spectrum and hardware resources, which incentivize and empower enhanced sensing capabilities. Moreover, emerging applications such as Internet-of-Everything (IoE), autonomous ground and aerial vehicles, virtual reality/augmented reality (VR/AR), and connected intelligence have intensified the demands for both high-quality C&S services, accelerating the development and implementation of ISAC in wireless networks. As in contemporary communication systems, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is expected to be the dominant waveform for ISAC, motivating the need for study of both the potential benefits and challenges of OFDM ISAC. Thus, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive tutorial overview of ISAC systems enabled by large-scale multi-input multi-output (MIMO) and OFDM technologies and discuss their fundamental principles, advantages, and enabling signal processing methods. To this end, a unified MIMO-OFDM ISAC system model is first introduced, followed by four frameworks for estimating parameters across the spatial, delay, and Doppler domains, including parallel one-domain, sequential one-domain, joint two-domain, and joint three-domain parameter estimation. Next, sensing algorithms and performance analysis are presented in detail for far-field scenarios where uniform plane wave (UPW) propagation is valid, followed by extensions to near-field scenarios where uniform spherical wave (USW) characteristics must be considered. Finally, the paper presents open challenges and outlines promising avenues for future research on MIMO-OFDM ISAC."

First, a pretrained VLM is co-finetuned with vision data to construct an action-level VLM called vision-language-action model (VLAM). Such an end-to-end model can directly generate proper target poses on deformable linear objects (DLOs), without the need for complex segmentation modules. Second, an admittance control with stiffness and damping adaptation is proposed to enable the robot to effectively interact with unmodeled DLOs. Then, a learning from demonstration (LfD) strategy based on DMP with fuzzy clustering is designed to transfer the live-maintaining skill. Additionally, an FLS-based adaptive controller with ETM is proposed to compensate for complex nonlinear dynamics and reduce communication frequency. Finally, a mobile manipulator for power substation live-maintaining is exploited to validate the proposed approaches through extensive experiments."

To facilitate the controller design, the quadrotor helicopter dynamics are decoupled into translational and rotational subsystems. For the translational subsystem, an adaptive fault-tolerant game controller is developed via the fault and evader's strategy estimators, enabling the capture of the evader. Moreover, based on the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), the unknown objectives of the evader are estimated online, achieving the evader's intent recognition. For the rotational subsystem, a fault-tolerant attitude controller is designed by combining the adaptive fault compensation method and reinforcement learning (RL), ensuring the attitude tracking errors converge to a neighborhood of the origin. To improve tracking performance, the proposed attitude controller augments the optimal control law with a robust compensator dependent on the magnitude of the attitude tracking error, which ensures accelerated state convergence and attitude tracking. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through numerical simulations."

    "abstract": "This study investigates how quantum dots (QDs) influence carrier migration under both low and high electric fields. The effects of CdSe QDs at different concentrations on the direct current (DC) conductivity and breakdown strength characteristics of polypropylene (PP) were systematically examined. The ohmic conductivity decreases with the incorporation of QDs, but the threshold electric field of ohmic conductivity remains unchanged at a certain temperature. The results indicate that under low electric fields, QDs act as scattering centers for carriers due to the Coulomb blockade effect, which increases the migration path and reduces conductivity. Under high temperatures and high fields, QDs primarily function as carrier traps, and the trapped carriers are difficult to de-trap because of the quantum confinement effect. As a result, adding QDs increases the threshold electric fields for Schottky injection and Poole-Frenkel (P-F) emission. For instance, at 105°C, the threshold electric field increases from 35 kV/mm to 50 kV/mm. Thermally stimulated depolarization current (TSDC) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) simulations confirmed that QDs introduce deep traps at 0.9-1.0 eV in the polymer matrix, effectively capturing carriers. In conclusion, this study demonstrates low-field scattering and high-field trapping of QDs, which reduce carrier mobility and improve dielectric characteristics."

Here, we theoretically demonstrate a nanophotonic perfect meta absorber comprised of a two-dimensional (2D) array of pyramidal multi-layered metal-dielectric (MD) structures. Each multi layered structure has 20 pairs of alternating MD layers comprising titanium nitride (TiN) and silicon dioxide (SiO2), with an optically thick TiN metal layer as back reflector. We theoretically show an exceptional average absorbance of 99.17% at normal incidence spanning ultra-broadband wavelength range of 0.3–5 μm, with peak absorbance of 99.99% at 1.28 μm wavelength. The proposed nanophotonic meta-absorber has an average absorbance of at least 94% for up to 60° of oblique incidence for random polarization. Thus, our proposed design is both angle-insensitive and polarization-independent. Our effective medium theory-based theoretical modeling comprehensively verifies the results obtained from full-wave simulations. Furthermore, the calculated figure-of merit for the proposed meta-absorber suggests that it can outperform some broadband absorbers recently reported in the literature. Thus, the suggested meta-absorber has potential applications in energy harvesting and thermal infrared detection."

This recent surge in growth in AI underscores the industry’s shift towards application-driven innovation. Unlike methods-driven research, which often falls short in real-world tasks, the integration of AI with practical challenges in PEs is fostering broader innovations in the field. This white paper explores the mainstream application of AI in PEs, expanding beyond the use of performance metrics alone, to consider the energy implications of such AI methods and the data quality requirements to achieve high performance at a reasonable economic and energy cost. This work also emphasizes the importance of explainable AI, considering both data quality and predictions, but notes that PEs as a field requires dependency on multiple independent and interdependent inputs, due to inherent cross-coupling effects. This article also advocates the use of physics-informed machine learning, which combines theoretical mechanisms with data to balance domain knowledge and data-driven predictions. This approach is particularly effective in offline settings but faces challenges in online environments without relevant high-quality data. The discussion extends to the energy demands of AI, emphasizing the need for sustainable design and implementation to avoid over-dimensioned models that consume excessive energy. In addition, this article provides a number of case studies across various applications of AI using different methodologies to illustrate the challenges in achieving high quality performance and consideration of energy as a metric. Finally, this article proposes a framework for application-driven AI innovations in PEs, addressing common deficiencies in deployment-scale assessments and concluding with the environmental sustainability of AI applications in this field."

    "abstract": "Accessing authoritative information in areas such as healthcare, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence remains a challenge due to the heterogeneity of data sources and the varying credibility of content. With the increasing integration of advanced technologies into daily life, there is an urgent need for systems that can streamline the retrieval of information and extraction of knowledge from different formats. In this paper, we present a distributed, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based framework that aims to automate the extraction and structuring of information from multimodal resources, such as websites, PDFs, images, audio, and video. The framework supports real-time data processing and is optimized for the creation of open data sets in any subject area. To validate our approach, we applied it to cigars and beverages, using content from online articles, reviews, and posts. Our results show the framework’s potential to simplify data integration, improve usability and enable scalable, contextual knowledge generation."

Experiments on a real-world encryption detection task demonstrate the efficacy of using the proposed features across several learning algorithms.

    "abstract": "The escalating sophistication and volume of malware necessitate advanced, automated analytical tools. This paper first outlines a methodology using a high-performance classifier to identify and categorise malware instances from the comprehensive MalMem2022 dataset. Building on this, the research then investigates the capability of seven distinct open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate customised malware information and pertinent mitigation strategies for such identified malware (types/names), leveraging the MITRE ATT&CK framework for verification and data extraction. The LLMs are tasked (using Chain-of-Thought prompting) with systematically querying the MITRE ATT&CK knowledge base to verify the malware, extract relevant attack data, and then synthesise structured outputs comprising a threat description, primary attack vector(s), and actionable mitigation strategies. The accuracy and relevance of the LLM-generated information are quantitatively evaluated by calculating the cosine similarity between sentencetransformer embeddings of the outputs and expert-defined reference descriptions. Experimental results demonstrate that leading evaluated open-source LLMs can achieve high semantic similarity (e.g., median scores around 0.90) with the reference descriptions. Furthermore, this detailed information generation is performed efficiently, with most models averaging response times between 2 and 6 seconds. These findings highlight the significant potential of combining malware classification with LLM-driven analysis to provide rapid and substantially accurate tools for generating actionable malware information and mitigation advice, offering a promising avenue for enhancing cybersecurity operations and incident response by leveraging established threat intelligence repositories."

This work proposes CycleSiamese, a lightweight, class-aware domain adaptation framework suitable for passive RFID systems, which integrates cycle-consistent Received Signal Strength (RSS) transformations with a Siamese classifier, for LAR using minimal labeled target samples. Evaluated on the COTS UHF RFID floor dataset featuring Impinj Monza 4 Quiet Tag (QT) passive tags beneath an apartment floor interrogated by an Impinj Speedway Revolution R420 reader for device-free ambient assisted living monitoring, the proposed method reduces linear inter-personal domain discrepancy from 21.58 to 2.16 (88 % reduction), achieving 82.2 % Human Activity Recognition (HAR) accuracy with limited target samples. Further, the proposed method is successfully validated on three additional Radio Frequency (RF)-based datasets, which include temporal drift, device heterogeneity, and dynamic environments, while supporting real-time edge deployment on resource-constrained RFID gateways."

    "abstract": "Motion artifacts (MA) significantly compromise the quality of photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals in wearable devices, hindering the accurate extraction of vital sign parameters. To address the limitations of existing methods in cross-user MA detection and the low accuracy of signal reconstruction, this paper proposes FlexiMA, a two-stage co-optimization framework that operates without reference signals. This framework is designed to tackle two key tasks: MA detection and MA removal. In the detection phase, a task-adaptive diffusion model, IMD-XResNet1D, is developed by integrating meta-learning and diffusion mechanisms, enabling efficient modeling of artifact-related features in new users. In the removal phase, an adversarial variational autoencoder (AVAE) is employed to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction of PPG signals. Experiments conducted on multi-user, multi-scenario datasets demonstrate that FlexiMA achieves 99.68% accuracy in MA detection and maintains a cross-user generalization performance of 99.32%. In the MA removal task, it attains 87.85% waveform structure similarity with an interbeat interval (IBI) error of 4.60 ms, indicating reliable signal reconstruction. These results verify the robustness and adaptability of FlexiMA in dynamic and complex environments, highlighting its strong potential for deployment in wearable applications."

    "abstract": "Health monitoring of planetary reducers in antenna drive systems is crucial, but two major challenges hinder practical applications: non-stationary features caused by time-varying speed conditions and the few-shot samples. First, under time-varying speed conditions, fault feature distributions become highly dispersed, undermining the ability of prototype-based methods to construct stable and representative class prototypes. Second, the coupling of few-shot samples with dynamic operating conditions further weakens feature discriminability, while existing contrastive learning methods fail to simultaneously address feature dispersion and data scarcity. To address these issues, this paper proposes a prototype-aware contrastive learning (PACL) framework. The framework enhances data diversity through signal augmentation and introduces prototype calibration to refine more representative class prototypes. Based on this, the feature perturbation weighted multi-prototype (FPMP) module extracts fault features unaffected by operational conditions by introducing feature-level perturbations to the prototypes. A prototype-centric contrastive loss (PCC loss) function is proposed by integrating prototypes constructed by FPMP, which enhances intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Comprehensive experiments on planetary reducers and two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms established fault diagnosis methods under time-varying speed conditions with few-shot samples."

    "abstract": "The growing demand for robust, green, and wide-area sensing in applications like the low-altitude economy necessitates scalable, low-cost, and energy-efficient network architectures. To meet this need, this paper proposes a one-bit bi-static integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system architecture designed to cover sensing blind spots in a cost-effective and energy-efficient manner. The system employs micro receiving nodes equipped with one-bit analog-to-digital converters to minimize hardware cost and power consumption. However, this design introduces the dual challenges: severe signal distortion from one-bit quantization and parameter ambiguity from clock asynchronism between the transmitter and receiver. These issues render conventional synchronization and parameter estimation methods ineffective. This paper presents a novel algorithm that directly tackles these challenges by processing the one-bit temporal data. Our method first estimates the direction of arrival (DOA) using the one-bit MUSIC algorithm, and leverages it to coherently accumulate signal energy in the spatial domain for each preamble. Aided by the DOA, a compressive sensing-based approach then estimates the combined delay and timing offset, followed by the extraction of the Doppler shift mixed with carrier frequency offset. By systematically processing these estimates, our algorithm obtains absolute target delays and relative Doppler shifts without requiring a dedicated reference path. The Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived, and simulations validate that the proposed method achieves high-accuracy parameter estimation, i.e., the optimization result reaches the CRLB. In addition, simulation under practical settings illustrates that the sensing range is extended from 400 m to 900 m, increased by 125%, demonstrating the feasibility of low-cost, one-bit bi-static ISAC systems."

    "abstract": "The growing demand for sustainable transportation has accelerated innovations in Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs).Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) has become a key technology for overcoming battery range and charging limitations. This paper presents a focused review of WPT advancements for AGV applications, covering recent developments in coupling mechanisms, magnetic coupler designs, and compensation topologies that maintain high efficiency under dynamic operating conditions. The review also examines the role of Machine Learning (ML), organizing prior work into four functional domains: sensorless parameter estimation, adaptive impedance control, fault and anomaly detection, and coupling-geometry optimization. By mapping these domains to corresponding WPT challenges, the paper establishes a structured framework linking ML techniques with the underlying physical parameters governing power transfer.To ensure methodological rigor, this review is based on a structured literature search across IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, and MDPI databases for publications between 2015 and 2024. Studies were included only if they (i) focused on WPT for mobile platforms, (ii) provided FEM-based modeling or experimental validation, and (iii) reported quantifiable performance metrics such as efficiency, coupling coefficient, misalignment tolerance, switching frequency, or ML accuracy. More than 180 papers were screened, and 112 studies meeting these criteria were included in the final analysis. Despite considerable progress, key challenges persist, including efficiency degradation under misalignment, electromagnetic field (EMF) leakage, compensation detuning with load variation, and the lack of AGV-specific interoperability standards. Addressing these issues requires coordinated advances in magnetic design, adaptive compensation, power electronics, and ML-assisted control. This paper summarizes major performance trends and outlines practical research directions to support the development of intelligent, self-optimizing WPT systems for future AGV platforms.Unlike prior WPT surveys primarily focused on electric vehicles, this review explicitly targets AGV-specific charging constraints—including low-voltage operation, compact pad geometries, dynamic misalignment during docking, narrow air-gap operation, and opportunity charging in indoor industrial environments—highlighting design requirements unique to AGV wireless charging and not addressed in EV-oriented literature."

Existing studies mainly focus on detection or program analysis, but they do not explain why and under what conditions attackers decide to exploit. In this work, we introduce a decision-theoretic framework that models reentrancy as a profit-maximizing problem under gas, risk, and atomicity constraints. Our framework derives the conditions under which reentrancy attacks are economically viable and provides an algorithm for computing optimal exploit strategies. We further extend the analysis to multi-contract attacks, capturing sequential, parallel, and optimized execution strategies. A simulation environment evaluates profitability across varying balances and gas configurations, highlighting thresholds where attacks become infeasible. Finally, we translate attacker decision profiles into practical defense recommendations for developers, auditors, and DeFi system designers. This framework bridges the gap between exploit detection and adversarial economics, offering a rigorous basis for strengthening smart contract security. This framework establishes a theoretical baseline for adversarial economics in smart contract security, forming a foundation for future MEV-aware exploitability models and Layer-2 risk analysis."

    "abstract": "In optical remote sensing, thin clouds pose a significant challenge for cloud removal due to their high brightness and spectral similarity to bright man-made objects such as buildings. Existing thin cloud removal methods typically rely on single feature extraction or fixed physical model, which struggle to differentiate thin clouds from bright backgrounds in complex scenes, resulting in suboptimal image recovery. To address these issues, we propose ASENet, a novel network that integrates atmospheric scattering modeling with multi-level feedback enhancement mechanism to improve thin cloud removal for complex scenes. By learning the shape details of both thin clouds and ground features, ASENet dynamically adjusts weights in high-concentration cloud regions, ensuring clearer image recovery. Specifically, we design a feature fusion residual dehazing generator (FFRDG), which leverages deep residual blocks and high-resolution dehazing modules to capture environmental memory and enhance detail features, improving the model's adaptability and recovery accuracy in thin cloud regions. Additionally, to better preserve the edges and textures of buildings and other ground objects, we introduce a spatial detail enhanced discriminator (SDED) that incorporates the cascaded feedback-based feature mapping. This enables ASENet to better capture image details, maintain structural consistency, and effectively distinguish thin clouds from high-reflectance background objects. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets L8-ImgSet, RICE1, and WHUS2-CR demonstrate that our proposed ASENet outperforms state-of-the-art methods across both subjective and objective evaluation metrics, proving its effectiveness in thin cloud removal tasks under complex scenes."

    "abstract": "In the realm of emotion recognition concerning continuous temporal sequence data, scholars have delved into various effective integration strategies from multiple perspectives, yielding commendable results. The majority of these studies have comfortably relied on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to extract features from both video and audio, of ten overlooking the thorough extraction of underlying features prior to integration. We have entirely eschewed convolutional and recurrent architectures, opting instead to design a simple, stackable Temporal Slicing Encoder (TSE) to distill temporal characteristics. Empirical evidence from two sentiment analysis datasets demonstrates that the TSE module excels in the extraction of emotional features. Building upon this foundation, we have further explored modality interaction, addressing cross modal data activation and synergy optimization between different features, devising the Deep Bimodal Information Transfer Module (DBIT) and the Dynamic Synergy Optimization Network (DSON), which, in conjunction with the TSE module, form our TASE-Net (Temporal Attention Synergy Emotion Network). The DBIT module establishes a cross-attention mechanism guided by mutual information to facilitate text-guided cross-modal data activation, while the DSON module achieves adaptive emotional feature confidence allocation and knowledge transfer between trimodal and unimodal features through an Emotional Weight Adjuster (EWA) and an Asymmetric Bidirectional Distillator (ABD). Extensive experiments on the CMU-MOSI and CMU MOSEI datasets substantiate the efficacy and advancement of our TASE-Net and TSE encoder."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a safety-critical fixed-time sliding mode control (SMC) strategy for quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to achieve precise trajectory tracking under external disturbances and prescribed performance constraints. A fixed-time prescribed performance function is first introduced, and by incorporating the state transformation technique into the SMC design, the proposed method guarantees that the closed-loop systems converge to prescribed small neighborhoods of zero within fixed time. Simultaneously, the tracking errors are strictly confined within user-defined safety boundaries at all times, despite external disturbances. To mitigate communication bandwidth limitations, a dynamic event-triggered mechanism is further developed for electronic speed-data transmission. Fixed-time convergence to the sliding surfaces and overall system stability are rigorously established using Lyapunov stability theory. Moreover, a cascaded control architecture is devised, wherein the proposed controller determines the desired accelerations, which are then utilized to compute the corresponding orientation and angular rates. Compared with existing tracking control approaches, the proposed framework not only ensures rapid convergence and guaranteed tracking performance but also significantly reduces communication overhead. The effectiveness and advantages of the method are demonstrated through simulation results."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) specialized in code have demonstrated impressive capabilities in various programming tasks such as code generation. However, these models often generate vulnerable code due to inherent flaws in training datasets derived from large-scale, unfiltered open-source repositories. Existing methods like SVEN (prefix tuning) and CoSec (supervised co-decoding) attempt to address these risks but face challenges with transferability or inflexible security constraints. To mitigate these issues, we propose SCoDE, a two-stage approach for secure and functionally correct code generation. After an initial functional tuning phase, we integrate a plug-andplay security steering matrix at the model’s output embedding layer. This matrix can be transferred across models without modifying their original weights. During inference, we introduce a novel contrastive decoding mechanism that adaptively balances the base model’s functional logits with positive and negative security steering signals. Extensive experiments on 60 security scenarios and two standard benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP) using StarCoder, Qwen2.5-Coder, and CodeLlama demonstrate that SCoDE enhances security while maintaining functional correctness. On average, SCoDE improves security by 28.09% over the original models, 12.07% over CoSec, and 4.82% over SVEN. For functional correctness, it achieves average gains of 55.03% on HumanEval and 41.81% on MBPP over the original models."

In the medical field, RFID technology enable patient monitoring and equipment management. However, the constrained resources of RFID tags make them vulnerable to security threats, raising concerns about data integrity, secure access, and patient privacy. This paper proposes a novel group-based RFID authentication protocol that introduces a threshold-based mechanism that enables group authentication even when some tags fail to respond. We conduct both formal and informal security analyses using tamarin prover to evaluate the proposed protocol. In addition, we analyze its performance using a thresholdbased availability model. The proposed protocol achieves improved resilience, privacy, and fault tolerance, making it well suited for sensitive Internet of Things (IoT) environments."

    "abstract": "All-Intra coding is a video compression method used in recent codecs where each frame in a YUV sequence is compressed independently. This approach enables high editing precision, random frame access, and low-latency processing, making it ideal for video editing, digital cinema, surveillance, medical imaging, and live production workflows. Recent work showed that multidimensional transpose of YUV sequences prior to encoding increases homogeneity of the frames and therefore reduces the bitrate. Such a solution is sequence-dependent and therefore, it is not suitable for all YUV sequences. In this work, we propose a classification approach in which the suitability of YUV sequences for multidimensional transpose is assessed prior to committing to full encoding. Features are first extracted from the sequences at various resolutions ranging from $\\mathbf{4} \\boldsymbol{\\times} \\mathbf{4}$ to $\\mathbf{6 4 \\times 6 4}$ pixels. The features include the statistical entropy and measures of dispersion such as variances and interquartile ranges. The proposed multi-scale feature extraction is inspired from the recursive quadratic split of coding units in video compression. Consequently, video frames are classified individually, and the video they belong to is labeled based on a majority vote of the frame classifications. Tested using a leave-one-sequence-out strategy on video sequences with different resolutions and textures, the proposed classification solution successfully distinguishes sequences that are suitable for multidimensional transpose prior to encoding. It is also shown that the proposed multi-resolution feature extraction solution is more suitable for this classification problem than existing CNNs. Furthermore, it is shown that the computational time of the proposed solution is around third of what is required for a lightweight first pass encoding as reported in the literature."

The novelty lies in reimagining public health as a continuously adaptive, stakeholder-informed service ecosystem, enabled by emerging technologies such as AI, IoT, cloud computing, and distributed ledger technologies. Methodologically, the paper presents a cyclical workflowevent monitoring, validation, decision-making, feedback, and knowledge translation, illustrated through a use case that demonstrates how real-time analytics and participatory design enhance responsiveness and trust.

Most of the bulk system stability analytics assume that the distribution system is a passive consumer of electricity, which needs to be reevaluated with the evolving power grid. Large-scale integration of inverter-based technology, like distributed generation (DG) and flexible loads [(collectively called <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">distributed energy resources</i> (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DERs</i>)], in the distribution system is leading to an increase in transmission and distribution (T&D) system interactions. <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">T&amp;D interactions</i> can be defined as the interdependence of system planning, performance, and operational decision making between T&D systems. T&D interactions impact several power grid aspects, including system stability, system planning, protection and controls, system resilience and reliability enhancement, etc. The California Independent System Operator (CAISO) has shed some light on the operational challenges observed in the real world and has highlighted the need to develop mechanisms to utilize T&D interactions for reliable grid operation (e.g., DER-based automatic generation control). For a stable future power grid, modeling, analyzing, and utilizing these T&D interactions effectively will be crucial. Aggregated models like the composite load models (CLMs) and other reduced order models (ROMs) can capture certain aggregated behavior of distribution system aspects, but they do not capture some features, like unbalanced nature and feeder voltage impacts on the distribution loads and DERs. T&D cosimulation can effectively capture the T&D interactions and their impact on power system stability."

    "abstract": "The spatial structure of multispectral remote sensing images (MRSI) constitutes a fundamental component of the geospatial data. Recently, Boltzmann entropy has been introduced into the measurement of spatial information of MRSI, which has proven effective in capturing the composition and configuration of MRSI. However, the existing Boltzmann entropy calculation approach does not account for information redundancy caused by image noise and spatial correlation. This results in the spatial information content of MRSI being imprecise and incomplete. Thus, a new approach to calculate Boltzmann entropy based on image texture features is proposed in this paper, which adds redundancy and noise-reduction mechanisms. Specifically, this novel approach extracts the texture features of the MRSI using the Local Binary Patterns (LBP) operator, and then the macrostate is defined as an abstract representation of the original microstructure, such as edges, corners, flat areas, spots, and noise. The microstates originate from the uncertainty of the grayscale value due to spectral mixing between neighboring units. Three experiments demonstrate that the proposed Boltzmann entropy calculation approach can effectively capture the disorder of the spatial structure of MRSI and satisfy the requirement for thermodynamic consistency. Furthermore, it can reduce the information redundancy caused by the spatial correlation of the image neighborhood and mitigate the effect of noise on the image information content. Consequently, this approach addresses a limitation of the existing Boltzmann entropy, providing a novel metric for the spatial information measurement of MRSI."

    "abstract": "Incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) tackles the problem of effectively combining complementary yet incomplete data from multiple views to improve clustering results. Conventional IMVC techniques typically focus on either imputing missing entries and constructing separate similarity graphs for each view to derive a unified partition matrix or directly learning a shared representation via matrix factorization. Nevertheless, these methods often fall short in struggling with insufficient mining of geometric information in the Euclidean space, which may introduce noise and redundant information—particularly when handling data with significant missing rates. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Unified Grassmann Manifold-Based Completion and Alignment (UGMCA), a novel approach for IMVC. UGMCA integrates three essential processes: (1) completing missing entries in view-specific partition matrices, (2) aligning these matrices on the Grassmann manifold, and (3) learning adaptive view-specific graphs. Unlike traditional Euclidean-based methods, UGMCA treats multiple partition matrices as the basis of an element on Grassmann manifold, leveraging manifold geometry for more robust integration. By formulating a low-rank tensor learning framework on the Grassmann manifold, UGMCA effectively captures intricate, nonlinear structures inherent in incomplete multi-view data, thereby enhancing clustering accuracy. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets confirm that UGMCA outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of clustering performance."

Specifically, quantized discrete values are encoded into binary sequences using the two’s complement and transmitted over multiple subcarriers. At the receiver, we design a decoder that constructs a functional mapping between the superimposed digital modulation signals and the target of computational results, theoretically ensuring asymptotic error-free computation with the minimal codeword length. To further mitigate the adverse effects of channel fading, we adopt a truncated inversion strategy for pre-processing. Benefiting from the unified symbol distribution after the proposed encoding, we derive the optimal linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) detector in closed form and propose a low-complexity algorithm seeking for the optimal truncation selection. Furthermore, the inherent importance differences among the coded outputs motivate an uneven power allocation strategy across subcarriers to improve computational accuracy. Numerical results validate the superiority of the proposed scheme over existing digital AirComp approaches, especially at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes."

    "abstract": "Reflectionless and high-attenuation characteristics are crucial for protecting sensitive front-end components, such as power amplifiers and mixers, in modern communication systems. This paper proposes a novel microstrip absorptive bandstop filter (ABSF) that offers comprehensive protection across a wide frequency range. The filter achieves an exceptionally wide stopband bandwidth through a core topology utilizing two coupled lines interconnected by central transmission sections. Crucially, high absorption is realized by incorporating resistor-terminated absorptive transmission lines at the input port. Complete design equations and the theoretical framework necessary for synthesis are detailed. The fabricated prototype demonstrates outstanding measured performance, achieving a stopband attenuation of 40 dB and a minimum absorption of 18 dB over a remarkable fractional bandwidth of 62.9%. This rigorously validates the proposed absorptive bandstop filter as a highly practical and effective solution for wideband component protection."

    "abstract": "The Cooperative Multi-Robot Observation of Multiple Moving Targets (CMOMMT) is a representative task in IoT-enabled applications. In this task, UAV swarm aim to maximize the average observation rate by tracking previously detected targets while searching for undetected ones. However, these two objectives present a trade-off, requiring effective coordination strategies to balance. Traditional methods, such as heuristic optimization and reinforcement learning(RL), often struggle with generalization and are difficult to train in complex multi-agent scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Supervised and Transfer Learning Framework (STLF), a two-stage architecture for UAV swarm coordination. In the first stage, a Teacher Model is trained under the assumption of full access to undetected target positions, generating near-optimal actions. In the second stage, a Student Model is initialized with the Teacher’s knowledge and fine-tuned via transfer learning, using a probabilistic map to approximate undetected target position under realistic constraints. Furthermore, by introducing a Lévy flight-based motion model, we expose the limitations of random walk-based models used in previous studies, which tend to underestimate the complexity of realistic target movements. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with the STLF achieving an average observation rate of 40.75%, outperforming all five baselines by 5.92% to 14.93% across various settings."

    "abstract": "Equipping deep learning models with a principled uncertainty quantification (UQ) has become essential to ensure their reliable performance in open-world environments. To address uncertainty arising from two prevalent sources - distribution shifts and out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, this paper presents a unified, uncertainty-informed approach for quantifying and managing the risks these factors pose to deep learning models. Toward this goal, we leverage a principled UQ approach, Spectral-normalized Neural Gaussian Process (SNGP), to quantify the epistemic uncertainty associated with model predictions. Unlike other UQ methods in the literature, SNGP offers two distinctive properties: (1) spectral normalization applied to hidden layer weights to preserve relative distances among data points throughout feature transformations, and (2) replacement of the output layer with a Gaussian process to produce distance-aware uncertainty estimates. Using the uncertainty estimates from SNGP, we employ Youden's index to derive an optimal threshold that categorizes predictions into different risk levels, enabling uncertainty-informed decision making. Experiments on two datasets of varying scale demonstrate that the proposed method facilitates effective risk assessment and management in open-world settings. Computational results show that the proposed method achieves predictive performance comparable to Monte Carlo dropout and deep ensembles, while providing more computationally efficient, consistent, and principled uncertainty estimates under no shift, distribution shift, and OOD conditions."

Current emotion recognition techniques, primarily using single-modality data such as electroencephalography (EEG) or facial expressions, fail to capture the complex interplay of emotional states in patients with DoC, leading to incomplete assessments. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel multimodal fusion framework that integrates heterogeneous EEG and micro-expression data through an innovative spatio-temporal attention mechanism. This approach significantly enhances the detection and classification of emotional states by leveraging differential entropy features from EEG and temporal features from micro-expressions, fused using deep learning techniques. The proposed method not only achieves mainstream models in terms of accuracy but also demonstrates potential for broad application in medical diagnostics, providing a basis for more personalized patient care and opening avenues for future research in clinical practice settings. We found that two patients had significantly better indicators than the others, indicating better brain activity levels and outcomes in these two patients, which is also consistent with the clinical results one month after the experiment. By effectively merging data from multiple sources, our study sets a new benchmark for emotion recognition in DoC, contributing to more accurate clinical assessments and enhancing the quality of life for affected patients."

    "abstract": "Occluded person re-identification (ReID) poses substantial challenges in computer vision, primarily due to incomplete information and occlusion interference. Although Transformer architectures have become dominant in ReID due to their strong feature modeling capabilities, their lack of an adaptive weight allocation mechanism for multi-granularity feature processing limits their ability to extract generalizable and robust features. Recently, Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has demonstrated considerable promise in visual tasks, but its integration into ReID models remains underexplored. This paper presents AMFOR (Adaptive Multi-granularity feature Fusion and Occlusion Reconstruction), a novel framework combining MIM and Transformer architectures. AMFOR consists of three key components: AMFF-Encoder, HPR-Decoder, and Teacher-Student Decoder. The AMFF-Encoder enables adaptive fusion of multi-granularity features through learnable queries, allowing interaction between text-visual features and visual features extracted from multiple Transformer layers. The HPR-Decoder conceptualizes occluded regions in pedestrian images as reconstructable patches, guiding the encoder to extract more discriminative features through reconstruction. Additionally, the self-distillation teacher-student decoder is employed to refine pedestrian part features, further optimized by the proposed AMGDLoss. This paper represents the first successful implementation of the MIM mechanism in person ReID models. Empirical evaluations on five benchmark datasets, covering both occluded (Occluded-DukeMTMC, Occluded-REID, and P-DukeMTMC-reID) and complete (Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID) scenarios, demonstrate that AMFOR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in person ReID.

    "abstract": "Integrating resilience into system expansion planning models requires reckoning with extreme event risks, which are multifaceted, uncertain, and irreducible to expected costs. We propose a unified resilience and capacity expansion planning model that optimizes generation, transmission, and hardening investments by treating events as probability-free, multi-criteria stress tests that prevent unacceptable unmet demand and damage outcomes in extreme conditions while operating costs are optimized over ordinary conditions. Each event can contain multiple hazards that can disrupt operations, damage assets, and increase demand. Resilience can be improved with various hardening options that protect against some hazard impacts and by changing the timing, location, or technology of conventional investments. The model's solution is the least-cost, long-term expansion plan that meets all resilience and conventional planning criteria, such as emissions reduction targets. Resilience criteria are then varied to find Pareto-optimal cost and resilience tradeoffs. We execute the method on a large-scale 4,894-node synthetic Texas system with extreme heat, winter storm, and hurricane events, modeled as a linear program. The representative case study results show that a mix of hardening options and changes to capacity decisions relative to the baseline plan can improve system resilience while limiting cost increases to about 9%. The optimal adaptations de pend on both emissions targets and resilience criteria thresholds, which underscores the need for integrated models to meet the real-world requirements of planners and policy makers."

    "abstract": "Perpetual view generation aims to synthesize a long-term video corresponding to an arbitrary camera trajectory solely from a single input image. Recent methods commonly utilize a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to synthesize new content of previously unseen regions along camera movement. However, the underlying 2D diffusion model lacks 3D awareness and results in distorted artifacts. Moreover, they are limited to generating views of static 3D scenes, neglecting to capture object movements within the dynamic 4D world. To alleviate these issues, we present DreamJourney, a two-stage framework that leverages the world simulation capacity of video diffusion models to trigger a new perpetual scene view generation task with both camera movements and object dynamics. Specifically, in stage I, DreamJourney first lifts the input image to 3D point cloud and renders a sequence of partial images from a specific camera trajectory. A video diffusion model is then utilized as generative prior to complete the missing regions and enhance visual coherence across the sequence, producing a cross-view consistent video adheres to the 3D scene and camera trajectory. Meanwhile, we introduce two simple yet effective strategies (early stopping and view padding) to further stabilize the generation process and improve visual quality. Next, in stage II, DreamJourney leverages a multimodal large language model to produce a text prompt describing object movements in current view, and uses video diffusion model to animate current view with object movements. Stage I and II are repeated recurrently, enabling perpetual dynamic scene view generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our DreamJourney over state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Eleven features encompassing volumetric measurements, morphological dimensions, and categorical dental aging stages were analyzed.

CatBoost and Gradient Boosting regressors consistently outperformed conventional regression methods, demonstrating superior predictive accuracy as measured by Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Standard Error of Estimate (SEE). Notably, the CatBoost regressor exhibited exceptional robustness, achieving the best overall performance with a MAE of 7.14 ± 2.11 (Male), $6.19 \\pm 1.95$ (Female), and $6.64 \\pm 1.15$ (combined). Additionally, the Support Vector Regressor achieved the lowest MAE for females: $6.04 \\pm 2.45$. Decision Tree and Gradient Boosting models also demonstrated commendable accuracy, further emphasizing the effectiveness of ensemble-based ML approaches. These results highlight the strong potential of ML techniques to enhance objectivity, accuracy, and applicability in dental age estimation by leveraging comprehensive dental feature sets."

The complexity of IIoT ecosystems, with their interconnected devices, dynamic processes, and exposure to threats, requires strict compliance with diverse security standards. However, organizations struggle to efficiently navigate and select from numerous cybersecurity norms, each with unique, context-dependent requirements. This fragmentation creates confusion, misalignment, and compliance risks, especially for global enterprises. The absence of unified guidance makes scalable, coherent governance difficult. This paper presents an integrated approach that combines Business Process Modeling and Notation (BPMN) with an intelligent recommendation system to address this challenge. The proposed methodology allows organizations to model their cybersecurity processes while receiving context-aware guidance on relevant security standards. By extending BPMN with adaptive decision support, the approach simplifies norm selection, improves alignment, and strengthens IIoT governance.

    "abstract": "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has proven to be effective in learning cooperative policies, where agents learn decentralized policies, sharing the same network parameters, through centralized training. However, this parameter sharing can lead to similar behaviors among agents, hindering effective exploration. Existing multi-agent diversity methods that rely on the variational inference methods to differentiate agents may suffer from significant overfitting, which in turn hinders the exploration of new trajectories. To encourage multi-agent diversity and efficient exploration, we propose Active Exploration with Agent-Identity (AEAI), a novel exploration method, which maximizes the entropy over trajectories of different agents to promote sufficient exploration. Moreover, we derive a novel lower bound for the mutual information objective based on the successor features to align the directions of trajectories and agent identities in order to learn agent identity-conditioned policies. We combine these two items and integrate our method with existing MARL methods. We evaluate our proposed AEAI on challenging multi-agent tasks across various MARL benchmarks. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness in fostering diversity and improving exploration."

First, a finite-time stochastic stability framework is established to demonstrate the global stochastic practical finite-time attraction of the origin, enabling robust control design for stochastic nonlinear systems. The proposed method achieves faster convergence rates and provides bounded finite convergence time estimates, outperforming asymptotic methods. Second, a novel distributed optimization algorithm (DOA) is introduced, incorporating consensus-gain function, state-dependent optimization gains, and integral information of the gradient of local objective functions.

Furthermore, a new adaptive dynamic event-triggered mechanism (ETM) integrated with the DOA is proposed. This mechanism significantly enhances communication efficiency and reduces resource consumption throughout the process of tracking the optimal solution while preventing Zeno behavior. Finally, numerical simulations in multiuncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) target tracking validate the effectiveness of the robust continuous-time DOA against random EBAMN."

    "abstract": "Conventional methods for enhancing the response of SERF magnetometers primarily focus on optimization of the cell working state but remain constrained by the limited equilibrium polarization. To overcome this limitation, we proposed a response-enhanced over-polarization measurement method for SERF magnetometer based on pump beam modulation, which allows the polarization and measurement processes to be independent. We established the theoretical model of the transverse polarization during the transient response after the pump beam is altered off. Then we verified the validity of our method under different modulation frequencies and duty cycles, and proposed the parameter selection criteria to meet the acquirements of our over-polarization measurement mode. Compared to the traditional DC-mode, numerical simulation and experiment have both demonstrated that the response can be enhanced by 47% and 43%, respectively, which is consistent with our theoretical analysis. Moreover, this method inherently mitigates the light-shift effect and facilitates high polarization uniformity across the vapor cell. These findings, supported by comprehensive sensitivity analysis and robustness evaluation, demonstrate the method's potential for practical applications in high-sensitivity magnetometry, such as biomagnetic imaging and anomaly detection."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel framework based on edge computing, implemented using Kubernetes orchestration, to optimally offload the computational tasks required for centralized control of multiple robotic agents. Edge-based centralized control architectures are prone to failure due to communication delays. The proposed framework computes the maximum round-trip time delay for which the system remains stable and modifies the controller parameters to ensure the control computation within the critical time. For higher processing and communication delays, the complexity of the controller needs to be reduced by reducing the number of agents, the prediction horizon, and the efficient use of edge resources. The edge resources are dynamic, and the controller needs to be designed to guarantee the online computation within a desired time. A dynamic resource allocation method (based on an approximate function of the controller parameters, complexity, and computational resources) is proposed to design the controller parameters to ensure the bounded computation time. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we conduct experimental evaluations that analyze system behavior under various conditions, providing valuable insights into the performance, scalability, and robustness of multi-agent control systems deployed on edge infrastructure."

Reported studies demonstrate competence on various tasks ranging from EHR analysis and differential diagnosis to treatment planning and research workflows. Yet the literature largely consists of overviews which are either broad surveys or narrow dives into a single capability (e.g., memory, planning, reasoning), leaving healthcare work without a common frame. We address this by reviewing 49 studies using a seven-dimensional taxonomy: Cognitive Capabilities, Knowledge Management, Interaction Patterns, Adaptation & Learning, Safety & Ethics, Framework Typology and Core Tasks & Subtasks with 29 operational sub-dimensions. Using explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria and a labeling rubric (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Fully Implemented</i> ✓, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Partially Implemented</i> Δ, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Not Implemented</i> ✗), we map each study to the taxonomy and report quantitative summaries of capability prevalence and co-occurrence patterns. Our empirical analysis surfaces clear asymmetries. For instance, the External Knowledge Integration sub-dimension under Knowledge Management is commonly realized (∼76% ✓) whereas Event-Triggered Activation sub-dimenison under Interaction Patterns is largely absent (∼92% ✗) and Drift Detection & Mitigation sub-dimension under Adaptation & Learning is rare (∼98% ✗). Architecturally, Multi-Agent Design sub-dimension under Framework Typology is the dominant pattern (∼82% ✓) while orchestration layers remain mostly partial. Across Core Tasks & Subtasks, information centric capabilities lead e.g., Medical Question Answering & Decision Support and Benchmarking & Simulation, while action and discovery oriented areas such as Treatment Planning & Prescription still show substantial gaps (∼59% ✗). Together, these findings provide an empirical baseline indicating that current agents excel at retrieval-grounded advising but require stronger adaptation and compliance platforms to move from early-stage systems to dependable systems."

    "abstract": "Edge caching is a critical application scenario in edge networks. By storing diverse files on edge servers and dynamically fetching new files from the cloud, edge networks can provide low-latency file access services for mobile users. In practice, the file fetching latency is non-negligible. Consecutive requests for the same missing file during the fetching phase introduce additional latency (referred to as delayed hits). Existing studies either ignore the delayed hits when making caching decisions or are not applicable to multi-server edge networks. In this paper, we investigate the online caching problem with delayed hits in the multi-server edge networks and prove its hardness. The objective is to minimize the total file access latency. To solve the proposed problem, we propose Cadle, which makes caching decisions based on the latency of different file access operations and weights of files in an online manner, without relying on any prior knowledge of future requests. We prove the competitive ratio of Cadle.We also conduct extensive experiments on the real-world dataset to verify the performance of Cadle. The experimental results show that Cadle reduces the total file access latency by at least 31.8% on average, and improves the hit ratio by at least 25.9% on average compared with state-of-the-art approaches."

    "abstract": "Omnidirectional Video Quality Assessment (OVQA) is a challenging task due to the limited availability of adequate numbers of training samples for learning representations of distortions on omnidirectional videos. The recent masked autoencoder (MAE) has shown promising performance in learning local and global representations in a self-supervised way, and can be used to attempt to mitigate the difficulty of having insufficient annotated samples to adequately train omnidirectional video quality prediction models. But the reconstruction tasks that MAE models are designed for do not pertain to predicting diverse perceptual distortions, especially those relevant to the task of OVQA. We have attempted to overcome these limitations to harness and apply the power of the MAE concept to the OVQA problem. Towards this purpose, we create a Distortion-Sensitive Masked AutoEncoder (DS-MAE) that is able to represent perceptual distortions on omnidirectional videos. DS-MAE extracts viewports from omnidirectional videos and employs a masked autoencoding module (MAM) and a knowledge replay module (KRM) to learn representations on each viewport. In the MAM, distorted patches from omnidirectional videos are masked, by replacing them with undistorted counterparts. The autoencoder is trained to reconstruct the masked distortions, imbuing them with the ability to represent diverse video degradations. The KRM extracts and stores content representations, which are then “replayed” to mitigate potential catastrophic forgetting of content during training of the DS-MAE. Finally, a simple OVQA model is constructed using the pre-trained DS-MAE across all viewports. The new model, called OmniVQA, was tested on three public OVQA datasets. The experimental results show that OmniVQA delivers competitive performance against all compared models."

    "abstract": "The growth in e-commerce sales has been constant and, driven by the Covid-19 pandemic, has exceeded previous expectations. Owing to social isolation, parcel lockers - systems for goods collection - have become widely used to reduce physical contact between people involved in the delivery process. This resource has also become an important strategy for reducing costs, as it enables deliveries from multiple customers to be consolidated in the same location. In the context of smart cities, in which the optimization of urban transport plays a key role in building more sustainable and efficient environments, the inclusion of parcel lockers is essential. Thus, research in this area that considers their use aligns with the concept of smart cities, promoting the use of innovative technologies to improve mobility and urban logistics. Specifically in this context, the Vehicle Routing Problem With Parcel Lockers (VRPPL) is an extension of the Vehicle Routing Problem with TimeWindows (VRPTW), introducing the use of lockers, with the objective to reduce the total distance traveled. In this study, an algorithm based on Iterated Greedy (IG) and Random Variable Neighborhood Descent (RVND) was developed to reduce the costs and computational times presented in the literature. We selected a set of 168 well-known instances for the problem. Computational experiments and comparative analyses were performed. The developed algorithm achieved better results in 167 instances, with an average gap of −1.315%. The best execution times were obtained for all instances, thereby reducing the mean execution time from 240.293s to 0.104s."

    "abstract": "Cultivating plants can be challenging due to the subtle and varied needs of different species. The proposed smart pot offers an efficient solution by automating key maintenance tasks, including watering, light exposure, and soil moisture management. Ideal for individuals with busy lives or limited plant care experience, the smart pot also supports sustainable practices. It features an interactive display that conveys the plant’s needs through messages and emotions, making care intuitive. An automatic watering system activates only when soil moisture falls below a set threshold, maintaining optimal conditions while minimizing water waste. To evaluate its performance, data on temperature, humidity, and light intensities (natural, blue, green, red, and white) were collected over six months, along with soil moisture, temperature, and light sensor data, which an embedded controller automatically processed. The dataset was refined using Python’s Pandas library to ensure statistical analysis accuracy. Key metrics such as mean, standard deviation, and correlation coefficients revealed significant patterns. For instance, temperature showed a positive correlation with red light intensity and an inverse correlation with white light intensity in roses. These relationships varied in rice, highlighting the system’s adaptability to different environmental and experimental conditions. Correlation matrices visualized complex interactions, such as competition between natural and blue light intensities in roses, which were less pronounced in rice. Overall, roses showed up to a 70% reduction in flower production under heat stress, and automated irrigation maintained soil humidity within the 40-70% optimal range, validating system efficiency. These insights underscore the smart pot’s ability to support diverse plant species while promoting sustainability. The system’s effectiveness in optimizing plant growth lays a strong foundation for advancements in interactive gardening technology."

Here, we construct a biophysically grounded mean-field network model to investigate how acetylcholine (ACh) modulation alters gamma oscillations, excitatory-inhibitory phase coupling, and thalamus-like stimulus-evoked responses in cortical microcircuits. We show that cholinergic modulation increases excitatory and inhibitory firing rates, gamma-band synchrony and burst duration nonlinearly, but slows oscillation frequency. Upon thalamus-like pulse stimulation, ACh enhances encoded information, spectral power, burst duration, and excitatoryinhibitory coupling, but weakens thalamus-like stimulationevoked response gain and entropy nonlinearly with effective modulation threshold of 15Hz. These findings identify a unified mechanism by which ACh reshapes cortical computation by selectively enhancing temporal precision and stimulus discriminability through nonlinear reorganization of excitatoryinhibitory phase dynamics and input gain."

    "abstract": "The increasing frequency and severity of wildfires pose significant threats to utility infrastructure and community safety. Wildfires can be ignited due to component failures under extreme weather conditions. System hardening measures aimed at preventing these failures can reduce the probability of endogenous wildfire ignition, introducing decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU). However, existing methods that consider such DDU typically assume independent component failures, neglecting the critical interdependencies between components destroyed by wildfire and those affected by their spread. These interdependencies render such methods inadequate. To address this, we propose a novel formulation that incorporates both wildfire-ignition DDU and a second type of DDU — the interdependency between wildfire-ignited and wildfire-affected components. We develop a two-stage wildfire-preventive decision-dependent resilience enhancement (WDDRE) model for distribution systems. The model optimizes line hardening, distributed generation allocation, and network reconfiguration to enhance system resilience by preventing endogenous wildfire ignition caused by component failures. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the WDDRE model, showcasing its robustness in managing wildfire stochasticity and the two kinds of DDUs related to planning decisions, significantly reducing potential wildfire risks."

    "abstract": "The virtual resistor (VR) has positive effects on the small-signal stability of the virtual synchronous generator (VSG), but decreases the dynamic-state synchronization performance. To solve that conflict, a virtual admittance (VA)-based state observer (VABOB) is designed. First, the small-signal model of the VSG is analyzed, and it is found that the extra VR is only needed at 0 Hz to suppress the synchronous frequency resonance (SFR). The extra resistor at the synchronous frequency (SF) will decrease the dynamic response performance. Second, a state equation is designed for the accurate estimation of the SF component, and the VA without VR is designed as the output equation. Then, the state observer is deduced based on these equations. Third, the analysis of the grid voltage and frequency deviation shows the robustness of the VABOB. Furthermore, the selection principle for the observer gain is also analysed. Simulations and experiments verify the effectiveness of the VABOB in SFR suppression and dynamic performance enhancement by reducing the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</i>/<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">X</i>.

    "abstract": "In the era of 6G and dynamic spectrum access, the exponential growth of connected devices and diverse service demands intensifies spectrum scarcity and interference. Reliable spectrum prediction is thus essential to enable proactive access, alleviate congestion, and enhance spectral efficiency. Existing approaches suffer from a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency: model-driven methods often fail to capture inter-dimensional correlations, whereas data-driven methods achieve higher accuracy at the cost of excessive computational complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight spectrum prediction framework that integrates patch-based local feature extraction, sparse graph attention for efficient global dependency modeling, positional reconstruction for time–frequency alignment, and a closed-form continuous-time prediction network for accurate temporal forecasting. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces the root mean square error by 2.7%~65% while lowering computational resource consumption by 19%~84% compared with state-of-the-art baselines. These results underline the potential of the proposed approach to support scalable spectrum management in 6G wireless networks, thereby facilitating ultra-reliable low-latency communication, massive IoT connectivity, and intelligent spectrum sharing."

    "abstract": "Under square wave electric fields, charge transport and associated energy dissipation drive the aging and degradation of polymer insulations. During this process, part of the energy is released in the form of photon emission namely electroluminescence (EL). As one of the excitation mechanisms of EL, charge recombination links the charge dynamics with energy transfer, providing a point for revealing the underlying physical mechanisms of EL. In this paper, the effect of the square wave parameters on EL in polyimide (PI) is experimentally and numerically investigated. A recombination dynamics simulation based on the bipolar charge transport (BCT) model is adopted to reproduce the EL performance under square wave voltage with a wide frequency range. Further analysis indicates that EL behavior is determined by the charge distribution under the square wave electric field. The intensity and distribution of recombination-induced EL are jointly regulated by frequency and rise time, which exhibits characteristic turning points related to these two square wave parameters. Moreover, EL is likely to concentrate near the interface of the material, suggesting that the insulation aging caused by energy dissipation may be a long-term evolution of gradual penetration from the interface to the interior."

Existing HSV struggle to resolve the tradeoff between high performance and a compact form factor. To address this challenge, this study proposes a novel integrated HSV pair (IHSVP) combined with an opposite reverse-drive three-level strategy (ORTS). Structurally, the IHSVP utilizes a single mover to cooperatively control two ports, achieving a three-position three-way configuration. This innovative design enhances integration and reduces weight while preserving servofunctions. Strategically, the ORTS facilitates active, high-speed closure by energizing an opposing coil. The proposed design is validated through electromagnetic finite element and multiphysics simulations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed IHSVP with ORTS, when compared to conventional designs, shortens the total closing time by 59%, expands the linear zone of average flow characteristics by 29%, and completely eliminates pressure overshoot in the step response. These results confirm that the IHSVP with ORTS resolves the conflict between dynamic performance and compactness."

    "abstract": "Mobile devices (MDs) are increasingly incorporating deep neural network (DNN) inference into their systems due to the rapid growth of intelligent applications. Mobile edge computing-based distributed DNN collaborative inference has gained popularity due to limited on-device computation and energy budgets. However, the resource competition among MDs, along with the coupling of collaborative inference tasks across MDs and servers, creates significant challenges for efficient resource management. This issue is further exacerbated by the complexity of directed acyclic graph (DAG)-structured DNNs. Most prior studies do not jointly address the dual challenges of partitioning complex-structured DNNs and leveraging advanced optimization for collaborative inference, and their resilience to channel condition fluctuations remains underexplored. To address these challenges, we propose a novel task-aware collaborative inference framework. First, we devise a fine-grained partitioning point search algorithm based on a bidirectional graph linked list, which enables one-dimensional and flexible partitioning of DAG-structured DNNs. We then reformulate the problem of minimizing collaborative inference energy consumption and latency as a task-aware Markov decision process (MDP), which partitions each user's inference task queue into consecutive task windows for resource allocation. Building on this, we propose an Embedded Multi-Agent Hybrid Proximal Policy Optimization (EMH-PPO) algorithm to learn effective policies. Extensive experiments conducted across diverse network scenarios reveal that, compared to local DNN inference on MDs, our proposed method reduces inference latency by up to 64% and energy consumption by up to 46%."

    "abstract": "The cooperative control of UAVs in a complex environment is the key and fundamental problem in intelligent transportation and IoT communication systems. The cooperative control policy of the UAVs is challenging to determine due to the non-stationarity of the environment caused by the interactions between the UAVs and the environment under IoT communication. The use of deep learning algorithms based on a digital twin(DT) system to optimize the control policy has shown significant benefits in terms of efficiency and flexibility. However, the DT is prone to being inconsistent with real-world applications due to sensor errors and data delays, which lead to incorrect policy, even if the learning process is convergent. To address this issue, this paper proposes a federated deep reinforcement learning solution to the multi-UAV intelligent control problem, with a newly developed constrained optimization framework. To effectively eliminate the negative impact of uncertainties such as sensor errors and data delays on system performance, the safety constraint function is integrated into the objective function for optimization. The model undergoes training through the constrained distributed federated reinforcement learning framework, avoiding potentially dangerous behavior and thereby improving the safety and robustness of the resulting control strategies. Experimental results have shown that the proposed solution ensures the safety of the strategy, effectively avoids potential dangerous behaviors, and improves the success rate of multi-UAV cooperative control tasks as well as the average task completion time under IoT communication. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves substantial performance improvements while ensuring operational safety. Compared with baseline methods in IoT environments, the algorithm exhibits min 26.7% faster convergence, min 1.8% higher success rate across swarm sizes, and min 12.3% reduction in task completion time."

In harsh thermal environments, piezoelectric MEMS devices are expected to sustain severe damage because of material degradation and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatches between the functional layers and the carrier wafer. This paper investigates the thermal endurance of the suspended thin-film lithium niobate (LN) platform by observing the structural integrity and performance of acoustic Lamb wave resonators after annealing rounds at increasing temperatures, with a focus on temperatures between 550 °C and 800 °C, with 50 °C temperature increments. Fundamental symmetric (S0) mode acoustic resonators are fabricated on 600 nm stoichiometric LN (sLN) with 40 nm thick platinum top electrodes and a thin titanium adhesion layer. After each annealing round, changes in the devices’ resonant frequency and quality factor (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Q</i>) are quantitatively studied.

The results provide valuable insights into the design and material selection necessary to optimize the suspended thin-film LN platform for high temperatures. Understanding the thermal limit of the platform enables its use for sensors, actuators, resonators, and potentially other thin-film LN microsystems, e.g, photonics, electro-optical, and acousto-optical systems in harsh thermal environments."

    "abstract": "Data-driven fault diagnosis is a method widely used in the maintenance and support of radio frequency (RF) front-end. Its effectiveness depends on a large volume of high-quality training data. However, due to the low probability and uneven occurrence of faults, quantity of fault data is often less than the normal data. This data imbalanced problem greatly affects the accuracy of fault diagnosis for RF front-end. Data generation is an important way to address this problem, including generative adversarial networks (GAN), variational autoencoders (VAE), and denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM). However, these methods suffer from issues such as unstable training, mode collapse, and uncontrollable generation. To solve these problems, this article proposed an adaptive conditional DDPM (Ada-CDDPM) based on improved U-Net3+, aiming to enable the model to better extract features of RF fault data and then guide it to generate the modal data required for RF system diagnosis. More specifically, this article proposed an adaptive CDDPM, which uses a conditional function with learnable coefficients vector to guide direction of training data generation. A differentiable loss function is proposed by this article to evaluate the quality of the generated training data. The learnable coefficient vector is optimized adaptively based on the evaluation results, enabling the final generated data to have good fidelity, diversity, and modal characteristics. This article constructed a simulation platform and an experimental platform to test the performance of the method. Comprehensive experiments show that data generated by the proposed method has significant advantages in diversity, fidelity, and is effective in solving RF front-end diagnosis problem under imbalanced data."

This paper systematically analyzes the convergence trends and development prospects of generative AI and brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. In particular, by defining the notions of generative brain decoding and discriminative brain decoding, it examines how generative AI is reshaping the decoding paradigms of BCIs. Generative AI has shifted BCI decoding from conventional discriminative paradigms toward generative decoding, enabling the reconstruction of semantically rich outputs such as text, speech, and images. Through data augmentation and the generation of virtual samples, generative AI improves the quality of BCI data and mitigates fairness issues arising from data scarcity and population imbalance. In hardware design, generative methods accelerate the discovery of electrode materials and sensor architectures that enhance stability and biocompatibility. These advances expand BCI applications in medical rehabilitation, industrial systems, and consumer electronics. At the same time, the integration of generative AI introduces critical challenges in security, privacy, and ethics, particularly concerning the misuse of synthetic data and unauthorized cognitive inference. This survey reviews current progress, identifies persistent challenges, and outlines future directions for developing reliable and equitable generative AI-empowered BCIs."

We first conduct a detailed analysis of the transceiver model, in which delay and Doppler precompensation is introduced to ensure coherent transmission. In this analysis, we examine the impact of precompensation errors on the transmission model, emphasize the near-independence of inter-satellite interference, and ultimately derive the received signal model. Based on such signal model, we formulate an approximate expected rate maximization problem that considers both statistical channel state information (sCSI) and compensation errors. Unlike conventional approaches that recast such problems as weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) minimization, we demonstrate that this transformation fails to maintain equivalence in the considered scenario. To address this, we introduce an equivalent covariance decomposition-based WMMSE (CDWMMSE) formulation derived based on channel covariance matrix decomposition. By exploiting the channel characteristics, we develop a low-complexity decomposition method and propose an optimization algorithm. To further reduce computational complexity, we introduce a model-driven scalable deep learning (DL) approach that leverages the equivariance of the mapping from sCSI to the unknown variables in the optimal closed-form solution, enhancing performance through novel dense Transformer network and scaling-invariant loss function design. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method in some practical scenarios. We also demonstrate that the DL approach can adapt to dynamic settings with varying numbers of users and satellites."

We give an affirmative answer by introducing SpotSound, a novel acoustic communication system that exploits the diversity of multi-path indoors as a natural <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">beamformer</i>.

Since the multipath channel decorrelates rapidly over the distance between receivers, SpotSound can ensure the signal is decodable only at the target position, achieving precise physical isolation. SpotSound is a purely software-based solution that can run on most IoT devices where speakers and microphones are widely used.

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been successfully used in various fields, nonetheless their lack of clarity poses serious issues in trust, interpretability, and responsibility in critical areas such as healthcare. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid approach of explainability by combining SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanations (LIME) towards improving the interpretability of deep learning models. SHAP offers a global feature importance, which gives a wide-ranging perspective on model behavior while LIME provides local instance-based explanations that clarify individual predictions. Our hybrid approach of SHAP and LIME combines both techniques to improve understanding of model decision making. We evaluated our method with two case studies including Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST) and Alzheimer’s disease detection. The experimental results demonstrated that the hybrid approach improved accuracy by $97.92 \\%$, increased trust in Al powered decision making, and outperformed other standalone explainability methods in local and global interpretability. The work presented in this document deepens the research on explainable AI (XAI) by proposing a meaningful and straightforward approach that is generally applicable to deep learning systems."

    "abstract": "The accurate identification of line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions is a critical challenge in wireless communication, particularly in the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) channels, owing to the high dynamics inherent to V2V environments. This study explores the use of machine learning (ML) techniques for LOS/NLOS classification based on wireless channel features extracted from both the measured received power level and the difference between the measured attenuation and free space loss (FSL). Feature correlation, importance analysis, and cumulative scoring are applied to derive a compact and informative feature set. A performance analysis with varying numbers of input features, along with an ablation study, shows that reliable classification can be maintained even with a reduced feature set. In addition, per-class evaluation is performed to capture distinct LOS and NLOS behaviors, which is particularly relevant when prioritizing specific outcomes such as minimizing false LOS or false NLOS detection. Balanced datasets were created through random sampling from the LOS and NLOS classes, with training and testing performed using K-fold cross-validation (CV). Three models, random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVM), and LogitBoost, were evaluated based on recall, specificity, precision, and the F1-score metric. The results indicate that the RF model outperforms the others and that a minimal yet balanced training dataset from both LOS and NLOS classes is sufficient to achieve high classification reliability. The proposed method offers interpretability, a low computational load framework, and flexibility addressing specific classification needs. This aspect provides valuable insights into improving the performance of vehicular communication systems."

    "abstract": "Intelligent vehicles rely on hybrid On-Board Automotive Networks (OANs), such as Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and Controller Area Networks (CAN), to support autonomous driving and ADAS. Securing these networks is challenging due to resource constraints, heterogeneous protocols, and evolving attacks. We propose an embedded-optimized, privacy-preserving collaborative IDS for hybrid OANs. Leveraging Cloud Vehicle Functions (CVFs), the framework enables robust model training across vehicles without sharing raw data. To efficiently process multi-protocol traffic, we introduce the Network Traffic Temporal Encoder (NTTE), which transforms network packets into temporal traffic images for anomaly detection. These NTTE representations are analyzed by TCNnet, a lightweight neural network designed for efficient embedded deployment. To make TCNnet suitable for resource-constrained embedded systems, we propose post-training quantization, significantly reducing its computational and storage demands. Evaluated on real traffic, the quantized TCNnet maintains over 99% detection accuracy, while reducing model size by over 91% and memory footprint by 51%, enabling practical deployment on resource-constrained ECUs. To link IDS outputs to real-world transportation outcomes, we develop the Transportation Impact Modeling Module (TIMM), which maps network-level detection performance to vehicle-level safety metrics (collision likelihood and Safety Message Delivery Ratio, SMDR) and fleet-level traffic indicators (Vehicle Flow Efficiency, VFE). TIMM simulations across Urban, Suburban, and Highway scenarios show the IDS reduces expected collisions by up to 97.9%, while maintaining high traffic flow efficiency (VFE = 0.949–0.995) and message reliability (SMDR = 0.988–0.994). These results demonstrate that the proposed IDS not only excels in network-level detection but also directly enhances vehicular safety and traffic performance, confirming its practical applicability in Intelligent Transportation Systems."

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training across distributed clients but remains vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, especially stealthy ones. The threat is even amplified in non-IID settings, where client heterogeneity causes greater divergence in feature distributions and inter-client distances. Existing defenses often rely on strong assumptions or raw update distances, limiting their effectiveness under such heterogeneity. To address this gap, we propose <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">FedRefiner</i>, a decoupled dual-refined aggregation algorithm designed to mitigate stealthy attacks on heterogeneous data. Our intuition is that the significance distribution of client updates reveals subtle malicious evasion, altering critical features for attack while perturbing unimportant ones, thereby exposing true inter-client distances. <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">FedRefiner</i> goes beyond norm-based filtering by refining both weighted scores and aggregated updates, enabling more accurate distinction between malicious behavior and benign non-IID variation. It first derives significance distribution vectors as refined updates by sparsity, then clusters them to compute weighted similarity scores for group reliability. These clusters then align raw updates into groups for group-wise refinement, yielding robust aggregated updates. We theoretically prove the convergence of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">FedRefiner</i> under Byzantine attacks in non-IID settings.

Ablation studies further demonstrate its robustness across different hyperparameters, attacker ratios, data heterogeneity, and model/client scales, while incurring low computation and no storage overhead."

This study presents a noise-aware multitask deep learning framework that simultaneously reconstructs tissue elasticity and viscosity maps. The proposed unified model directly estimates viscoelastic parameters from noisy shear-wave data, eliminating the need for explicit shear wave attenuation measurements and improving robustness to noise. The framework was trained on 1,000 velocity field datasets generated from numerical simulations, and validated across numerical simulations, tissue-mimicking phantoms, and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in vivo</i> duck liver datasets. Results demonstrated high fidelity in reconstruction accuracy, with strong agreement with ground truth in simulations and phantoms. In simulated phantoms where ground truth was available, the root mean square error for viscosity across samples was 0.128 (95% CI: 0.105–0.150) and for elasticity was 2.363 (95% CI: 2.157–2.573), and the structural similarity index was more than 0.96. In four <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in vivo</i> duck liver datasets, elasticity values ranged from 11.50 ± 6.32 to 25.50 ± 17.16 kPa and viscosity ranged from 0.85 ± 0.46 to 1.8 ± 0.37 Pa·s. The denoising module improved the signal-to-noise ratio up to threefold and enabled reliable performance even in low-SNR conditions. The framework enables rapid, noninvasive viscoelastic imaging and establishes a foundation for future diagnostic tools that go beyond stiffness-based assessments."

Recent methods solve this task by optimizing material parameters through differentiable physically based rendering. However, due to the coupling between object geometry, materials, and environment lighting, there is inherent ambiguity during the inverse rendering process, preventing previous methods from obtaining accurate results. To overcome this ill-posed problem, our key idea is to learn the material prior with a generative model for regularizing the optimization process. We observe that the general rendering equation can be split into diffuse and specular shading terms, and thus formulate the material prior as diffusion models of albedo and specular. Thanks to this design, our model can be trained using the existing abundant 3D object data, and naturally acts as a versatile tool to resolve the ambiguity when recovering material representations from RGB images. In addition, we develop a coarse-to-fine training strategy that leverages estimated materials to guide diffusion models to satisfy multi-view consistent constraints, leading to more stable and accurate results. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on material recovery.

In other words, the investigated system integrates a stocker and an SACT, which is named as an S-SACT system. Multiple wafer types (more than two) may be processed simultaneously by different processing chambers (PCs) in the SACT. Thus, PC cleaning is necessary when switching between wafer types. Stochastic lot arrivals necessitate dynamic decisions on lot sequencing in the stocker and their PC assignments, generating a partially-determined schedule that is updated when a new lot arrives. Then, an activity-driven simulation is used to obtain the final schedule. Generating high-quality partially-determined schedules is challenging. To address this, we propose a two-stage learning-assisted evolutionary framework combining Multi-tree Genetic Programming (MTGP) and Deep Contextual Bandit (DCB). In stage one, MTGP automatically generates scheduling rules that produce high-quality partially-determined schedules in dynamic environments offline, forming the action set for stage two. In stage two, DCB is pre-trained to select the most effective action with over 90% probability, then deployed to choose actions in real time while continuously updating its rule-selection agent. Computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing approaches across all tested cases."

However, specialized analysis of large volumes of wildlife images is extremely chal lenging, necessitating the use of artificial intelligence techniques to automatically detect, segment, and classify species captured by trap cameras. Despite the increasing use of AI in wildlife monitoring, challenges with data quality and availability persist. The Snapshot Serengeti (SS) dataset only has image-level labels and very few bounding box labels, and there's no dataset with pixel-level labels due to the significant annotation costs. To this end, we create and release the large-scale Semantic Segmentation for Snapshots of the Serengeti (S4) dataset, consisting of 24K high-quality images across 47 species with precise masks, for both common and rare species. This dataset serves as a resource for developing semantic segmentation algorithms in wildlife studies. Additionally, we introduce HitBack, a novel method leveraging Hierarchical-Semantic Cross Attention (HCA) and Background Contrast (BC) for weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS). The HCA module is used to capture both the shared and distinct features across species, and the BC module is designed to enhance foreground activation by ensuring consistency in the backgrounds.

    "abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) frameworks are fundamental components of DL systems in their development, deployment, and execution, while defects in DL frameworks can cause severe consequences. Ensuring the quality of DL frameworks has therefore become a pressing challenge. Among the various testing techniques, model mutation has emerged as a widely adopted approach. Such methods generate mutants by applying mutation operators to DL models (e.g., structural changes or parameter edits) and then analyzing inconsistencies, crashes, or abnormal behaviors across different frameworks or hardware. Despite its effectiveness, existing methods suffer from the following limitations. First, they mainly reuse operators designed for model testing, raising doubts about their ability to expose framework-level defects. Besides, they insufficiently consider mutation constraints, such as mutation type, position, and order, which directly affect the defect detection ability of generated mutants. Finally, they rely on the limited detection range and narrow test oracles, focusing on functional correctness in model inference while overlooking defects in efficiency, resource usage, and other defects that developers care about in other stages, such as model training or deployment. These limitations result in a weak alignment with the critical defects that developers are most concerned about in practice. Motivated by these observations, this study conducts a comprehensive investigation into the effectiveness of existing mutation-based testing methods. We first collect and classify defect reports from PyTorch and MindSpore according to developers’ priority tags, building a taxonomy of seven categories and 19 sub-categories of HP defects. We then map the defects reported by five state-of-the-art methods into this taxonomy to evaluate their detection abilities. To explain these limitations, we further analyze how three key factors, mutation type, mutation position, and mutation order, affect the generated mutants. Based on the experiment results, we summarize ten findings ranging from revealing the priority of developers on fixing framework defects, evaluating the defect detection ability of existing methods, to how mutation factors affect the generated mutants. Furthermore, we reveal four limitations and their root causes of existing methods and propose four targeted optimization strategies. We further apply these strategies to COMET and successfully uncover six new defects spanning four types, including two previously unreported categories. Overall, our study identifies 38 unique framework defects, of which 30 are confirmed by developers and 12 have been fixed, demonstrating the practical value of our findings."

    "abstract": "Brittle failure by crevasses and rifts formation is the most directly observable expression of stress state in glacier ice. Both satellite imagery and satellite altimetry are effective tools for characterizing them. However, the ice shelf surface exhibits non-fracture-related features that can appear similar to crevasses and rifts in images or elevation profiles, making it challenging to distinguish them using a single observational perspective. Here we combine satellite altimetry and satellite imagery to map these fracture features and provide their three-dimensional structure. During this process, we develop a novel algorithm for detecting and characterizing depressions on the ice surface using Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) L2A Global Geolocated Photon Data, Version 6 data set (ATL03). The strengths of the algorithm include estimation of surface elevation in 10 m along-track segments, broad applicability to different crevasse types, and robustness against surface irregularities. We apply this workflow to the Thwaites Eastern Ice Shelf (TEIS) as a case study and estimate the general depth and width of various crevasse types. Integrating altimetry with imagery, we find that V-shaped depressions, occurring at the early-stage of fracturing, could serve as an indicator of development of large-scale surface crevasses. Within the shear zone upstream of the pinning points, apart from shear failure, the ice surface also deforms due to strong compression, creating peaks a few meters high. This study highlights that including three-dimensional morphology in the detection and analysis of ice shelf crevasses and rifts improves the ability to distinguish between crevasse types and provides insights into ice shelf deformation."

Specifically, the proposed algorithm combines the variance and mean of multi-view image features to construct the fused matching cost and utilize both geometry and semantic constraints. The model extracts 360-degree semantic context during matching cost aggregation, and predict the corresponding panoramas jointly with omnidirectional depth maps. A semantic-aware spatial propagation module is then employed to further refine the depth estimation. We leverage a multi-scale multi-task learning strategy to supervise the prediction of omnidirectional depth maps and panoramas jointly. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on public datasets, and also demonstrates high-precision results on real-world data. The experiments with varying camera configurations validate the generalization ability and flexibility of the algorithm."

    "abstract": "Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), such as DINOv2 and SAM, have demonstrated unprecedented generalizability in natural imaging and show strong promise in medical imaging due to their semantically rich representations. However, their effective application to 3D volumetric segmentation remains largely underexplored, especially concerning optimal adaptation strategies for transferring 2D pretrained knowledge to the structurally disparate 3D domain. To address this, we present a comprehensive investigation into the transferability and task-specific adaptability of six diverse 2D VFMs (including Self- Supervised, Vision-Language, and Segmentation Generalists) for 3D medical image segmentation. We systematically evaluate four distinct transfer learning paradigms, including advanced Fine-Tuning methods, across four heterogeneous 3D medical datasets. Our results establish VFMs as a powerful and cost-effective generalist baseline, consistently outperforming non-pretrained and standard 3D ViT architectures despite the substantial domain shift. Crucially, our systematic exploration reveals that parameter-efficient finetuning achieves the highest segmentation accuracy across all datasets. Feature-level analyses using PCA and CKA provide key insights, confirming that optimal performance stems from successfully balancing the preservation of generalizable low-level visual features with the adaptation of high-level, task-specific semantics."

The advancement of sophisticated Large Language Models (LLMs), including ChatGPT, Llama, and Claude, has facilitated the production of highly convincing yet inaccurate content, complicating traditional detection approaches based on human-driven fact-checking or simplistic algorithmic methods. Many recent efforts have explored leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated disinformation detection. Due to several shortcomings of LLMs, a few recent studies started exploring the use of Small Language Models (SLMs) on various practical tasks. This article investigates whether SLMs can defeat LLMs on the task of disinformation detection. It evaluates two LLMs, namely Llama 3.18 B and Llama 3.2 3B against a finely optimized SLM model, namely RoBERTa. Our findings show that LLMs fall behind when confronted with intricate, multi-step reasoning tasks, and on the contrary RoBERTa reaches almost $99 \\%$ accuracy, and exhibits exceptional accuracy even after significant pruning ($50 \\%$) of its parameters."

In this work, we propose an automated competency tagging method leveraging semantic search with fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM). Our approach encodes textual data from learning materials and competency descriptions into a shared embedding space, enabling efficient retrieval of relevant competency tags via similarity search. We systematically evaluate semantic matching at different levels of granularity-document, paragraph, and sentence-to optimize retrieval performance. Furthermore, we fine-tune the LLM using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to improve competency tagging while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on a dataset of 164 pages of learning content and 96 competencies demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a recall@10 of $80.29 \\%$. Notably, fine-tuning with LoRA led to a $6 \\%$ improvement in recall@10, highlighting its impact on enhancing retrieval performance. Our findings underscore the potential of fine-tuned LLMs for high-precision competency tagging."

This graph effectively captures real-time structural and behavioral relationships, such as pod-to-node assignments and service-to-pod targeting, directly from the Kubernetes API. This model facilitates the efficient detection of environmental changes and propagates only pertinent deltas to the OWL-based ontology, thereby significantly reducing update overhead. We enhance the ontology with OWL RL reasoning and custom SWRL rules to infer implicit knowledge, identify inconsistent states, and enable expressive SPARQL-based queries for semantic supervision. Through a series of controlled experiments and simulated cluster events, we validate the model’s capability to maintain logical consistency, adapt to runtime volatility, and achieve high inferential accuracy. The proposed architecture yields measurable improvements in update efficiency and query responsiveness. Our findings indicate that this hybrid approach effectively integrates cloud-native operational data with semantic technologies, paving the way for intelligent, ontology-driven observability and decision-making in Kubernetes environments."

A lightweight algorithm is proposed in this study for detecting abnormal interactive behaviors of bid evaluation personnel. The algorithm, derived from an improved version of YOLOv11n, replaces the original model's backbone network with EfficientNet to reduce network scale. Additionally, the model incorporates the LSKA attention module and BiFPN net to enhance detection capacity. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in detection accuracy: precision increases by 3.2%, mAP by 1.2%, and F1-score by 1.6%. The improved YOLOv11n model is 3.9 MB in size, 63.9% smaller than the original, with a faster detection time per image by 0.2 ms and reduced FLOPs by 2.4G. These results indicate the model's strong detection capabilities and lightweight advantages, offering potential for efficient bid evaluation supervision support."

Although promising, previous schemes confront three barriers: (1) An adversary can launch a correlation attack to acquire the similarity between keywords. (2) The WKSE schemes exhibit false positives which can lead to wrong search results. (3) Existing feature extraction strategies limit the flexibility of search expressions. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Character Searchable Encryption scheme (MCSE) that overcomes the aforementioned barriers. To resist correlation attacks, we design the randomize pad model to encrypt the vector. To eradicate false positives, we apply the vector space model and complete feature extraction strategies so that a feature set uniquely identifies a keyword or expression. To enhance search flexibility, we introduce three distinct feature extraction strategies for keyword expressions, wildcard expressions, and logical expressions, enabling effective multi-character search. These strategies enable indexes to accom modate the search of diverse expressions. Finally, we prove that MCSE is indistinguishable against chosen-feature attacks and implement MCSE on two real datasets. Compared with state-of the-art schemes, the experiment results show that MCSE achieves good performance."

    "abstract": "Equivalent contact resistivity is a key parameter that affects the dynamic process and overcurrent characteristic of the non-insulation (NI) HTS coil. Adding stainless-steel material between turns of a parallel-wound NI coil results in the formation of various types of internal contact interfaces. Therefore, describing the shunt behavior of the coil, i.e., the parallel-wound metal-insulation (PWMI) coil, requires more than one equivalent contact resistivity, which makes it difficult to determine their specific values only through coil inductance and time constant. To handle this problem, we propose a method for acquiring distinct equivalent contact resistivities of the PWMI coil. In this method, the equivalent contact resistivities are inverted based on the measured coil voltage or magnetic field. The bridge to connect the experimental data and equivalent contact resistivities is the streamlined field-circuit coupling model based on T-A formulation, which can reflect the complex electromagnetic topology and the distribution of equivalent contact resistivities of the PWMI coil. After obtaining the measurement results, the least squares method is used to optimize the equivalent contact resistivities until the simulation curve is sufficiently consistent with the experimental curve. In order to improve the efficiency of the optimization, we construct the lumped circuit model of the PWMI coil. Before the optimization process begins, the initial values of equivalent contact resistivities can be obtained based on this model, which can reduce the search scope of the optimization. The results of multi-process testing indicate that using the equivalent contact resistivities obtained by the proposed method can effectively predict the transient behavior of the coil."

However, the literature confirms the prevalence of inaccurate, biased, or misleading content on this platform and underscores the need for robust quality assessment. This paper presents MediCERN, a platform that leverages a large language model (LLM) to evaluate the quality of medical videos using DISCERN, a widely accepted instrument for assessing health information reliability. Users can access MediCERN through a web interface to search for medical videos. The platform forwards each search query to YouTube and retrieves a list of relevant videos. MediCERN then checks whether any of these videos have been previously evaluated. Evaluated videos are presented to users ranked by their quality scores, while unevaluated videos are displayed without a score; however, users can request on-demand evaluation. The system processes these requests and provides scores within a few seconds. Sample analyses demonstrate substantial agreement between the model’s and experts’ ratings, with a Brennan–Prediger Kappa of 0.87. We further demonstrate the platform’s utility by analyzing over 5,000 videos. The results indicate that quality scores followed a Gaussian-like distribution, with most videos exhibiting medium quality. We also assessed the platform’s efficiency in terms of cost, time, and storage. For instance, the current prototype can evaluate one hour of video content in approximately 0.6 minutes at a cost of $0.0026 USD. These findings demonstrate that MediCERN offers a scalable and efficient solution for promoting access to high-quality medical content on YouTube."

    "abstract": "Neural architecture search (NAS) has been widely adopted to design high-accuracy architectures, which are often vulnerable against adversarial attacks. To address this problem, existing robust NAS methods mainly focus on optimizing both natural accuracy and adversarial robustness in a fixed supernet, which is designed for natural accuracy. As a result, the derived architectures have the same construction scheme as the supernet, suffering from limited adversarial robustness and flexibility. In this article, we present the ARNAS++ method to search for accurate and robust neural architectures via a supernet with flexible parameter budgets and width. Specifically, we propose a parameter budget controlling loss to make architectures contain less parameters in the rear cells, based on which the adversarial robustness can be guaranteed. Moreover, we also propose a learnable filter number reduction ratio to control the filter numbers in the supernet, which can find more robust architectures beyond the fixed supernet, and make the supernet more flexible at the same time. We conduct experiments on six widely used benchmark datasets against the state of the art. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ARNAS++ method outperforms the competitors in terms of both natural accuracy and adversarial robustness under various popular adversarial attacks. In addition, the ablation studies show the effectiveness of the designed components and their positive contributions to the overall performance.

Meanwhile, the self-attention mechanism based prototypical feature reprojection alignment module is proposed to construct accurate prototypes. Besides the prototypical feature alignment, the graph convolution network with structure-aware alignment is further designed to build structural feature relationships in the instance graphs, which can effectively achieve inter-domain structural distribution alignment under class imbalance.

    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OoD) inputs pose a persistent challenge to deep learning models, often triggering overconfident predictions on non-target objects. While prior work has primarily focused on refining scoring functions and adjusting test-time thresholds, such algorithmic improvements offer only incremental gains. We argue that a rethinking of the entire development lifecycle is needed to mitigate these risks effectively. This work addresses two overlooked dimensions of OoD detection in object detection. First, we reveal fundamental flaws in widely used evaluation benchmarks: contrary to their design intent, up to 13% of objects in the OoD test sets actually belong to in-distribution classes, and vice versa. These quality issues severely distort the reported performance of existing methods and contribute to their high false positive rates. Second, we introduce a novel training-time mitigation paradigm that operates independently of external OoD detectors. Instead of relying solely on post-hoc scoring, we fine-tune the detector using a carefully synthesized OoD dataset that semantically resembles in-distribution objects. This process shapes a defensive decision boundary by suppressing objectness on OoD objects, leading to a 91% reduction in hallucination error of a YOLO model on BDD-100K. Our methodology generalizes across detection paradigms such as YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and RT-DETR, and supports few-shot adaptation. Together, these contributions offer a principled and effective way to reduce OoD-induced hallucination in object detectors.

    "abstract": "Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading is a modern technique that revolutionizes how energy is distributed and consumed. Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) plays a crucial role in enabling renewable energy trading. It provides both physical and virtual channels for exchanging electricity and information between peers. Thus far, several authentication protocols (APs) have been suggested to secure information exchange in the AMI. However, most of them are just anonymous from the view of external adversaries making them improper for P2P energy trading systems. Therefore, to fully address critical privacy concerns in the AMI, this paper proposes a novel AP that presents the following distinct contributions. First and the foremost, our suggested AP provides “conditional unlinkability” of consumer smart meters (SMs) and “conditional anonymity” of producer SMs during the session key agreement. More specifically, by employing an innovative zero-knowledge authentication approach, producer SMs would not require any certificate for authenticating consumer SMs. Second, to add the unclonability property to SMs, the suggested AP uses physical unclonable function (PUF) and to alleviate noise consequences on PUF, it uses enhanced “soft-BD-PUF.” Third, since in P2P energy trading both parties are resource-limited, we have tried to diminish the overhead of AP and provided a computational balance between SMs. Last but not least, our AP can offer desired security properties like perfect forward secrecy and unlike blockchain-based APs can resist distributed denial of service attacks. Security and efficiency improvements of our suggested AP have been both supported by comparative performance and property analyses."

    "abstract": "This letter studies symbol-level precoding (SLP) for multi-cell multi-input multi-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) under a coordinated beamforming (CBF) architecture. The goal is to maximize the target illumination power for sensing while meeting SLP constraints for communications. Unlike most multi-cell ISAC works in single-carrier settings, OFDM sensing couples the precoders both across base stations and across subcarriers, which complicates the design. To enable network-friendly computation, we develop a distributed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm that uses only local channel state information and user data at each base station and exchanges a small set of consensus variables. We further propose a payload-reduced variant that aggregates inter-cell terms over subcarriers into a frequency-agnostic consensus, decoupling the exchanged payload from the number of subcarriers. A centralized successive upper-bound minimization method is provided as a benchmark. Simulations show that the distributed method converges quickly, approaches the centralized benchmark, and exhibits a predictable tradeoff in the payload-reduced setting."

However, contempt its promise, many FL approaches struggle to balance predictive accuracy with explainability, an essential requirement for clinical approval. To address this gap, this study presents an explainable multi-modality FL framework that consolidates a transformer model for unstructured clinical notes with a tree-based model for structured patient data. Using both data modalities, the proposed hybrid architecture empowers robust mortality prediction while ensuring traceability in model decision-making. The framework is evaluated in the large-scale MIMIC-IV dataset within a decentralized hospital environment, where the global fusion-based model achieves an AUC of 0.89 that surpasses traditional baselines while providing interpretable insights on clinical outcomes. These findings validate a scalable and reliable solution for the deployment of explainable AI (XAI) in federated healthcare systems, spanning the critical gap between model performance and clinical confidence."

DevOps is a contemporary software development life cycle paradigm in which development and operations teams join together during all stages of software development. Nonetheless, security is inadequately integrated inside DevOps. Although there have been attempts to amalgamate security with DevOps, resulting in the emergence of DevSecOps, considerable progress is necessary. The aim of Hybrid Intrusion Detection and Ensemble Learning System (HIDELS) is to present the incorporation of intrusion detection into the continuous monitoring phase of DevOps, hence enhancing DevSecOps. The integration comprises five machine learning (ML) models and assesses the performance of each model independently. Subsequently, the models are consolidated into an ensemble learning (EL) framework to improve overall robustness and provide more stable predictive outcomes. The results of the individual models show the decision tree (DT) classifier outperforming all the remaining models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score, with 99.5%, 99.5%, 99.7%, and 99.6% on average. Conversely, the EL model attained an average of 99.4%, 99.6%, 99.7%, and 99.7% for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, respectively, exceeding the performance of all other individual ML models."

    "abstract": "Effective process monitoring is increasingly vital in industrial automation for ensuring operational safety, necessitating both high accuracy and efficiency. Although Transformers have demonstrated success in various fields, their canonical form based on the self-attention mechanism is inadequate for process monitoring due to two primary limitations: ❶ the step-wise correlations captured by the self-attention mechanism struggle to capture discriminative patterns in monitoring logs due to the lack of semantics of each step, thus compromising accuracy; ❷ the quadratic computational complexity of self-attention hampers efficiency. To address these issues, we propose DeepFilter, which modifies the Transformer for process monitoring. The core modification is replacing the self-attention layer with an efficient filtering layer that excels at capturing long-term discriminative patterns with reduced complexity. Equipped with the efficient filtering layer, DeepFilter enhances both accuracy and efficiency, meeting the stringent demands of process monitoring. Experimental results on real-world process monitoring datasets validate DeepFilterȉs superiority in terms of accuracy and efficiency compared to existing state-of-the-art models."

Patients’ chances of recovery could be improved by the precise early diagnosis of malignant skin lesions. In that sense, dermatologists need to embrace the promise that artificial intelligence techniques present.

In the first half of 2024 alone, nearly $25 \\%$ of ICS engineering workstations reported attack attempts. EtherNet/IP (ENIP), a widely used protocol in ICS networks, adapts the Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) to Ethernet but lacks built-in security features like authentication and encryption. This paper presents an anomaly-based intrusion detection system (IDS) for ENIP. Our approach models protocol behavior using n-grams and applies machine learning to detect anomalies and classify attacks. We evaluated our method using data collected from an ICS testbed at the University of Arizona.

Although collaboration can substantially improve the learning process, it also introduces vulnerabilities, as not all participants contribute beneficially. Clients may engage in detrimental activities, such as data poisoning, that compromise the integrity of the global model. Additionally, in a realistic scenario, the quality of the data possessed by these clients is highly heterogeneous, which influences the model training performance. Moreover, malicious clients (aka free riders) intend to obtain the global model without making a real contribution to the training process. Hence, a reliable and fair evaluation of the client contribution is essential to promote diverse client engagement, improve robustness, and address the free-rider problem. This paper proposes a reputation-aware contribution evaluation approach (RBFL) that provides adversarial robustness by tracking reputation over multiple training rounds to ensure that clients consistently contribute positively. We employ CosineGradient as the utility function and Truncated Monte Carlo (TMC) Shapley as the data valuation function. Empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in a fair evaluation of clients’ contributions and effective identification of adversarial clients while maintaining a model accuracy of $92 \\%$ with adversarial robustness."

First, a polyhedral uncertainty set is employed to characterize the uncertainties in both generation and loads, while comprehensively considering operational costs, transformer loading rates, and other relevant performance indicators within the distribution station area. Second, by treating flexible loads—such as air conditioning systems, energy storage units, and electric vehicles—as controllable resources, a multi-timescale optimization model is developed to capture the diverse response characteristics of these loads. Finally, the original problem is decomposed into a master problem and a set of subproblem, which are solved iteratively using a column-and-constraint generation algorithm. The results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces operating costs by 6.7%, decreases the loads peak-to-valley difference of the distribution station area by 75%."

This work shifts the design paradigm in crystalline photonics from “electrode-centric” to “morphology-aware,” providing a general, fabrication-compatible route to co-optimize optical, RF, and crystallographic responses through deliberate morphological control."

    "abstract": "Numerous factors, such as load, strain, stress, humidity, weather, and external conditions, inevitably have an impact on a machine’s endurance during continuous operation, which eventually results in wear and failure. Monitoring the health of a machine involves analyzing data related to tremors, temperatures, stress, strain, pressure, and more. This data serves as a foundation for predictive maintenance, a strategic approach aimed at forecasting potential breakdowns or failures, thereby enabling timely and cost-effective preventive measures. The primary goal is to minimize the necessity for expensive repairs and reduce periods of equipment unavailability. A critical aspect of prognostic protection lies in forecasting the durability of tools and assessing their Remaining Useful Life (RUL). This proactive approach to maintenance proves instrumental in overall equipment management. To enhance RUL estimation, this research advocates for the adoption of Deep Learning (DL) methods based on contextual information. Traditionally, prognostics tend to concentrate on a limited set of critical factors. However, our research highlights the significance of context-specific elements in boosting the effectiveness of learning algorithms. We use NASA-generated CMAPSS turbofan motor run-to-failure data to find contextual characteristics and use a variety of methods to include environmental information in model training. Adding contextual data to predictive models is the most important part of our approach. This gives us better prognostic accuracy and computational efficiency than other network architectures. In this work, contextual-based strategies such as contextual expansion, contextual adjustment, and contextual normalization were incorporated into learning models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Deep Neural Network (DNN), and Linear Regression (LR). Combining various contextual-based strategies, such as contextual adjustment and contextual normalization, we developed hybrid contextual-based learning models. Among all models, the LSTM with the hybrid contextual strategy combining normalization and adjustment achieved the best results, with the lowest RMSE of 22.36 and highest R² of 0.77, outperforming traditional and benchmark models. These findings confirm the effectiveness of context-aware learning in predictive maintenance and establish a robust framework for future prognostics in industrial systems."

    "abstract": "Achieving optimal parameter settings in epitaxial silicon carbide (Epi SiC) manufacturing is challenging due to the need to simultaneously meet conflicting multi-objective requirements, such as precise thickness control and uniform doping. This paper presents an extended Digital Twin (DT) framework that incorporates the Multi-Objective Optimization with Deep-Feature Gaussian Process (MOODFG) algorithm, explicitly extending our prior DT-in-the-loop framework (MRBORI) in [26] from single-objective tuning to spec-driven multi-objective recipe optimization. The framework enables the effective optimization of high-dimensional and interdependent process parameters, overcoming limitations of traditional methods. The key innovation of the MOODFG algorithm lies in its integration of deep feature extraction and Gaussian Process Regression, which allows dynamic refinement of feature representations and surrogate models through iterative learning. Unlike MRBORI [26] (one objective per run), MOODFG minimizes a weighted distance to a user-specified target vector (e.g., thickness and doping) and provides an uncertainty-aware target-attainment certificate with a practical stopping rule for deployment. This approach ensures robust convergence to optimal parameter values while efficiently balancing multiple objectives. Experimental validation using real-world Epi SiC manufacturing data demonstrates significant improvements in yield, parameter stability, and process adaptability, highlighting the framework’s transformative potential for semiconductor manufacturing."

    "abstract": "Fast charging technology considerably decreases the equivalent load resistance of low-voltage batteries, necessitating active rectifiers of the inductive power transfer (IPT) charging system to provide a larger resistance conversion ratio for optimal efficiency tracking. However, conventional active rectifiers have limited resistance conversion ratio ranges due to topology constraints, heightened MOSFET voltage stresses, and elevated semiconductor costs. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel multi-variable-level active rectifier (MVAR), which integrates a multi-level active rectifier with an interleaved buck converter. By decoupling the input voltage conduction angle from the duty cycle of the interleaved parallel buck topology, the proposed MVAR features a resistance conversion ratio range of [0,+∞) theoretically, along with reduced MOSFET voltage stress and lower semiconductor cost in small load resistance applications. Additionally, the interleaved operation also reduces the output current ripple. Combined with the proposed segmented modulation method and the optimal phase angle control strategy, the IPT charging system with MVAR can maintain the optimal resistance throughout the constant power (CP) charging mode. A 350 W experimental prototype was built to validate the performance of the MVAR. Experimental results demonstrate that the IPT charging system employing the MVAR a achieves peak efficiency of 95.3% at the coupling coefficient of 0.18."

    "abstract": "The emergence of 6G edge intelligence demands highly efficient, adaptive Machine Learning (ML) solutions that operate under severe resource constraints. In this paper, we introduce FEDCOM, a scalable framework designed to support Continual Learning (CL) in federated edge environments through selective communication and adaptive model updates. FEDCOM uses Federated Continual Learning (FCL), which combines Federated Learning with CL and low-power optimization strategies, to minimize energy usage and bandwidth consumption during communication between server and clients. The core idea is to reduce the environmental and computational costs of distributed training by transmitting only unfrozen (trainable) layers during communication and scheduling client participation based on a data novelty metric. This approach limits unnecessary computation and avoids redundant communication, aligning with the goals of sustainable and low-latency 6G edge intelligence. We tested FEDCOM in a precision agriculture setting for an object detection (OD) task, using the YOLOv12s model. The system leverages edge datasets across multiple domains and evaluates energy consumption and OD performance in realistic scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that FEDCOM reduces computational costs and carbon footprint compared to full retraining and standard FCL, while preserving detection performance. It reduces energy consumption by over 60% compared to the baseline, especially in later domains, thanks to layer-freezing and client selection. FEDCOM shows how FCL, along with scheduling and communication-efficient strategies, can be powerful in 6G TinyML real-world applications, extending the operational lifespan of edge devices and improving the use of FCL in limited environments.

LoRa (Long Range) is specially designed for Low-Power, Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs) and has a broad range of applications in Internet of Things. Tens of billions of mobile devices (e.g., smartphones) are manufactured with limited types of wireless radio, making it challenging to access the data in the heterogeneous IoT devices. To address this challenge, we propose a method that enables LoRa devices to establish connections and engage in communication with Wi-Fi networks. A key observation of this study is that when a LoRa frame collides with an ongoing Wi-Fi transmission, the Wi-Fi receiver captures and retains the LoRa data. By analyzing the decoded Wi-Fi payload, we can retrieve the LoRa data, and this method remains fully compatible with existing commodity Wi-Fi hardware. Moreover, evaluations with Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) and commodity devices demonstrate reliable wireless communication from LoRa to Wi-Fi networks with a high reliability in frame reception and low frame error rates across various indoor and outdoor environments."

This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages pre-trained large models for distributed PV power forecasting by integrating retrieval-augmented generation with cross-modal semantic alignment. To unlock the reasoning capabilities of pre-trained large models, we design a scenario-consistent RAG module that retrieves relevant historical PV sequences guided by long-term dependencies and temporal correlations, and integrates them through a Chain-of-Thought prompting paradigm. Furthermore, we develop a cross-modal semantic alignment mechanism to bridge the representational gap between numerical PV series data and the language semantic space of PLMs, enabling effective pattern recognition across modalities. To ensure physically meaningful forecasting within the training and inference processes, we also establish a constrained activation function that explicitly considers the inherent characteristics of PV power generation. Extensive experiments on nine real-world distributed PV datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming six benchmark models."

This work presents inverse hybrid bonding (IHB), a die-to-die/die-to-wafer (D2D/D2W) bonding technology for heterogeneous integration that enables optimized interconnect designs, process flexibility, and a batch scale “underfill” that employs a gas-phase deposition process for dielectric underfill. It is “inverse” because the metal-metal bonding occurs first; subsequently, the dielectric underfill improves the mechanical reliability. To demonstrate IHB, copper-copper (Cu-Cu) thermal compression bonding (TCB) is first used for electrical connectivity, followed by a vapor-phase deposition of metal organic framework (MOF) for dielectric underfill. A detailed study of the process parameters for the MOF deposition process and its effect on underfill coverage is presented. IHB is demonstrated on an electrical testbed that features simultaneous bonding of fine-pitch (20 μm) and large-pitch (100 μm) interconnects, demonstrating true heterogeneous integration. Compared to solder-based technologies and hybrid bonding, IHB is a simplified D2D/D2W process that enables interconnect design flexibility, a batch scale underfill process that is not constrained by legacy underfills, and reduced process sensitivity to surface particles and roughness."

This model employs the Arctic Puffin Optimization (APO) to optimize the hyperparameters of a bidirectional long short term memory (BiLSTM) network. The research results indicate that rainfall has caused the formation of nine distinct subsidence areas in the mining area, with Subsidence Area IX experiencing the most severe subsidence, covering an area of 9.31 km², with an average annual subsidence rate as high as -331 mm/a and a maximum cumulative subsidence of 427 mm. In the early stages of subsidence, a “subsidence-lifting-subsidence-lifting” phenomenon is observed, which gradually stabilizes in the later stages. Additionally, compared to the LSTM and BiLSTM models, the proposed APO-BiLSTM model reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) of single-step predictions by 79.8% and 76.6%, respectively, and the mean absolute error (MAE) by 79.1% and 75.9%, while increasing the R² by 6.0% and 4.4%. The absolute error of 78.3% of the high coherence points is less than 4 mm, indicating that the model has promising application prospects in large-scale surface subsidence prediction in mining areas."

This system maintains confidentiality while improving the accuracy of classifications using collaborative learning techniques among multiple edge devices. Federated averaging makes model aggregation possible and thus makes collaborative learning possible among multiple devices and not at a central location to avoid confidentiality breaches. From experiments, there is promising accuracy of 87% and a loss of 0.39 using federated learning.

This paper presents a robust global navigation satellite system/inertial measurement unit (IMU) fusion framework that integrates an error-state Kalman filter (ESKF) with a residual based detection–identification–adaptation (DIA) mechanism. Operating directly on GNSS observation dimensions, the framework selectively rejects or corrects inconsistent measurements using residual statistics and temporal consistency. The ESKF ensures stable propagation of position, velocity, attitude, and sensor bias, while the DIA module performs real-time residual evaluation, adaptive thresholding, and subset-based fusion to mitigate degraded GNSS inputs. The proposed method was evaluated through high-fidelity simulations and real-world road tests. Under typical GNSS signal degradation scenarios, including multipath propagation, partial obstruction, and sudden jumps, ESKF-DIA consistently delivers the highest trajectory accuracy and anomaly tolerance. Compared to the baseline ESKF method, the proposed method reduces the root mean square error by 20% to 35%, maintaining stable performance compared to other novel methods even with performance degradation. These results demonstrate that the framework provides a robust and practical solution for autonomous localization in complex environments with limited GNSS signals."

    "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) have become a dominant paradigm in Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) for synthesizing features of unseen classes. However, the efficacy of these models relies heavily on their network architectures, the manual design of which is labor-intensive. While Neural Architecture Search (NAS) automates this process, existing approaches typically adopt a “divide-and-conquer” strategy that decouples the optimisation of the generator and discriminator to ensure stability. This separation neglects the intrinsic co-adaptive nature of adversarial training, often leading to mismatched architectures and sub-optimal performance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework named Multi-Population Co-Evolutionary Generative Adversarial Network Architecture Search (MC-GANS). MC-GANS reformulates the search as a co-evolutionary task that evolves the generator and discriminator as a symbiotic system, integrating three key strategies: (1) a Wasserstein distance-based adaptive mechanism to dynamically balance adversarial training stability; (2) a diversity-guided multi-population strategy to prevent premature convergence; and (3) a channel attention mechanism is integrated into the search space to enhance feature selectivity. MC-GANS outperformed the state-of-the-art generative ZSL methods on two datasets and achieves competitive results on the other dataset. The maximum performance improvement in harmonic mean reaches up to 2.3%. Ablation studies and theoretical analysis further confirm the effectiveness of each component and the model’s ability to capture complex data distributions.

    "abstract": "Deep survival models are increasingly used for time-to-event prediction under censoring, yet training objectives remain a bottleneck. The widely used discrete-time negative log-likelihood (NLL) supervises hazards and can suffer from temporal information imbalance and gradient attenuation, yielding early-dominated probability mass and degraded late-horizon calibration, especially under heavy censoring and competing risks. We introduce Pathwise Cross-Entropy (PCE), which utilizes a symmetric, full-path objective that directly learns the occurred-by-t trajectory as a Cumulative Incidence Function (CIF). This direct approach seamlessly yields a normalized Probability Mass Function (PMF) for predicting event times, unlike NLL, where the derived PMF is structurally biased toward monotonic decrease, hindering its predictive utility. In a counting-process view, PCE supplies bidirectional gradients and constitutes a strictly proper scoring rule on counting paths. We extend PCE to competing risks with cause-specific supervision that avoids the multinomial coupling in NLL under competing risks. Empirically, across the tabular SEER and a WSI-derived kidney dataset and multiple backbones, PCE consistently improves discrimination (C-index, AUC) and calibration (IBS), produces calibration plots (ECE and PP plots) that are closer to observation, and enables ordinal first-hit time prediction directly with minimal practical monotonicity violations. These results indicate that PCE is a reliable and interpretable objective for single and competing-risk survival."

    "abstract": "Understanding human gaze communication from a video is critical for decoding complex social interactions in dynamic, real-world environments. Existing gaze communication models focus on a single interaction, such as mutual gaze or shared attention, leaving the full spectrum of dyadic gaze states unaddressed. Unlike low-level gaze tracking that focuses on eye movement anatomy, this work addresses high-level gaze behaviors such as mutual gaze, referential gaze, and shared attention, which reflect the social-cognitive functions of gaze in multi-agent contexts. To this end, a spatiotemporal transformerbased framework is proposed, which involves human-object detection and tracking, gaze-following prediction, and a robust spatiotemporal transformer architecture for fine-grained classification and localization of these gaze behaviors. Moreover, the proposed model incorporates human gaze information, which provides explicit, fine-grained cues about each individual’s focus of attention, allowing more precise alignment of visual features with underlying social intent. Evaluated on a benchmark dataset, the proposed model substantially improves over strong graph-based and transformer-based baselines, particularly in accurately identifying rare yet socially meaningful gaze behaviors. This study contributes a scalable architecture for multi-class gaze analysis, supporting socially aware AI systems in healthcare through applications like autism screening and social engagement assessment, as well as in robotics and behavioral science."

Existing defenses largely focus on inference-time adversarial examples, yet remain insufficient to detect or mitigate poisoning attack that corrupts the training dataset and long-term decision-making process. To address this gap, we present a zero-trust, multi-phase architecture that secures both static (offline) and dynamic (online) training workflows. The architecture integrates asymmetric encryption, secret-sharing, diversity, redundancy, Moving Target Defense (MTD), decoy datasets, and fingerprint anonymization to reduce adversarial influence. Dataset integrity is ensured through a robust Proof of Integrity (PoI) mechanism combining hash chaining, rabin fingerprints, bloom filters, and digital signatures. A dual-controller design strengthens resilience: the Training-Phase Controller validates datasets and models through PoI before training, while the Operational-Phase Controller re-validates models and applies majority voting during inference. Together, these mechanisms ensure only integrity-verified data and models are used throughout the ML workflow. Analytical resilience modeling shows that the architecture significantly reduces attack success rates while maintaining efficiency."

Leveraging the HYPERAKTIV dataset, which contains health activity and neuropsychological data from adults diagnosed with ADHD, we developed a hybrid deep learning model that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The model analyzes key diagnostic indicators such as the ADHD Confidence Index, omission/commission T-scores, and reaction times extracted from the Conners CPT-II. FedADHD enables collaborative training across multiple mental healthcare institutions, treated as autonomous agents in a federated network, without requiring raw data sharing. This privacy-preserving architecture addresses critical ethical and legal concerns in mental health research. Evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), FedADHD outperforms traditional centralized Machine Learning (ML) models, showcasing its robustness and generalization capabilities. This work demonstrates how distributed ML and secure collaboration can significantly advance mental health diagnostics in real-world, multi-institutional settings."

We assess four ML models-Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and XGBoost (XGB)-utilizing various feature engineering methods, such as Correlation-Based Selection (CBS) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Our results indicate that ensemble techniques, especially RF and XGBoost, consistently attain a flawless F1-score of $\\mathbf{1. 0 0}$. We illustrate that the CBS approach maintains this elevated level of performance while significantly decreasing the number of features, thus providing a computationally efficient and practical solution for IoT environments with limited resources. Unexpectedly, the PCA-based technique proved ineffective, underscoring a notable limitation for this application."

This paper introduces CHOP, a novel framework that leverages vertex-level feature extraction and optimization-aware clustering to achieve significant improvements in the efficiency and quality of logic synthesis. Unlike existing cluster-level approaches that follow a “partition-then-predict” paradigm, CHOP operates under a “predict-then-partition” approach where the optimization method most appropriate for a given circuit vertex is determined by analyzing its local structural and functional context. To capitalize on this insight, CHOP extracts a subgraph centered on each vertex and calculates its circuit cost, which serves as a vertex feature for the subsequent circuit partitioning process. Furthermore, we introduce a self-supervised prediction model to obtain these vertex features efficiently. Following circuit partitioning, CHOP determines the optimization method for each partition and then iteratively applies these methods to derive the optimized circuit. The experimental results from logic optimization and LUT mapping tasks on the EPFL benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CHOP."

We propose CFSCNet, a novel model that integrates multimodal signals—audio, nasal airflow, and tri-axial accelerometry—to enhance swallowing event segmentation. The model employs a dual-stream architecture to capture swallowing information across varying durations and utilizes an exponential moving average-based cost-sensitive weighting method to address data imbalance. To further improve the stability of predictions for clinical applications, a Swallowing State Machine-Driven Post-Processing Method is introduced to smooth the segmentation sequences. CFSCNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets, reaching an AUC of 89.83 on the HRCA dataset and 94.10 on the SMSD dataset, significantly outperforming existing methods. Built on a series of tailored methodological innovations, the proposed framework offers a comprehensive and novel solution for swallowing event segmentation. It demonstrates strong accuracy and reliability, as well as great potential for future extension and clinical translation. This work is expected to advance high-precision detection and diagnosis of dysphagia, thereby supporting more effective swallowing rehabilitation and medical interventions."

    "abstract": "Accurate online detection or prediction of key quality variables provides critical reference information for optimizing and controlling operating variables in industrial processes. However, frequent fluctuations in raw material properties and environmental conditions often give rise to multiple data distribution modes within the same production process. Moreover, the inherent uncertainties and the energy-material coupling characteristics of industrial processes make it particularly challenging to uncover the underlying topological relationships among process variables. To address these issues, this article proposes a novel jointly shared-specific variational graph attention autoencoder (JSS-VGATE) model for spatial topological feature extraction and key quality variable prediction in multimode industrial processes. Specifically, a variational graph attention autoencoder is first constructed, which combines graph attention mechanisms with the variational inference architecture to adaptively learn the dynamic correlation strengths between adjacent nodes, thereby capturing complex variable interactions. Subsequently, a comprehensive loss function is designed to achieve high-fidelity extraction of representative latent feature distributions. Furthermore, a cross-mode jointly shared-specific learning framework is developed to simultaneously capture global shared features across modalities and preserve local specific features of each modality, while a learnable gated fusion mechanism is introduced to balance modality invariance and heterogeneity, thereby enhancing cross-mode information integration. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed JSS-VGATE are validated on two representative real-world industrial datasets compared to other state-of-the-art methods."

To extend the charging range in a wireless inductive link for reliable and seamless power transfer, it automatically switches between normal and resonant modes (NM and RM) by sensing current variation induced from the frequency splitting phenomenon, thereby achieving an extended charging distance up to 104.34 %. In addition, the proposed charger limits the maximum current to avoid excessive charging, that potentially degrades the battery’s health. The prototype SSRC has been fabricated using a 180 nm bipolar/CMOS/DMOS high voltage process with an active area of 0.575 mm2. The performance of the fabricated chip has been characterized on benchtop and ex vivo using a custom-designed 3-D printed fixture. The measurement results verified efficient power delivery to batteries while extending the charging distance from 23 mm to 47 mm in air and a 20-mm-thick pork slice without over-current issues. The measured peak power conversion efficiencies were 89.42 and 76.6 % in the NM and RM, respectively."

Closed-form continuous-time (CFC) neural networks offer superior expressivity for modeling time series data compared with recurrent neural networks. Additionally, their lower training and inference overhead make them well-suited for deployment on microcontroller-based IoT devices. This paper introduces FedCFC, an on-device federated learning network that operates based on the CFC models distributed across IoT devices. FedCFC incorporates a novel and communication-efficient aggregation strategy designed to mitigate the effects of class distribution imbalances across the participating IoT devices’ training data. The strategy is designed based on a new property of CFC identified in this paper, i.e., the insensitivity of a sub-model of CFC with respect to training data’s class distribution shift. Extensive evaluation with multiple time series datasets demonstrates that FedCFC attains comparable or superior accuracy while achieving a 7.6× to 11× reduction in communication overhead compared with recent federated learning approaches designed to address the class distribution skew problem. Furthermore, deployments of FedCFC on four IoT platforms highlight its suitability for resource-constrained devices with as little as 256 kB of memory or even less."

This method uses spectral clustering techniques and E- Silhouette evaluation in the pre-clustering stage to optimize the determination of the number of clusters. CH selection is based on four main criteria optimized using gradient descent. MCACOF involves an E-Silhouette score-based cluster reconstruction process to evaluate and relocate unsuitable Cluster Members (CMs). Nodes identified as isolated nodes are reconnected through relay-based multi-hop sub-clusters, maintaining participation in data delivery and improving cumulative throughput. Simulations were conducted in six scenarios with uniformly deployed nodes and a centrally located Sink in each case, supplemented by two additional scenarios with non-uniformly deployed nodes where the Sink was placed at five distinct static positions. Across all these evaluated scenarios, MCACOF consistently outperforms REAC-IN, SFC, and MCDM, yielding lower node isolation, improved energy conservation, higher cumulative throughput, and extended network lifetime."

Although extensive research has investigated transit signal priority (TSP) and bus guidance to achieve these objectives, mixed traffic conditions without dedicated bus lanes remain constrained due to inefficient traffic organization and underutilized intersection lanes. To address these limitations, this study proposes a multi-strategy bus guidance approach for connected environments that maximizes intersection lane utilization through right-turn lane sharing (RTS), particularly in China where dedicated and uncontrolled right-turn lanes are common. The approach is implemented via a dual-stage hybrid Bayesian network (HBN): Stage I forecasts bus travel times and queuing states using real-time bus positions and signal states data; Stage II determines the combination of speed guidance, dwell-time management, and RTS by accounting for passenger car speed distributions and allowable dwell times at stops. We evaluated the approach in a SUMO simulation environment of a real-world urban arterial in Kunshan, China, under four demand scenarios with varying volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios of total traffic flow. Simulation results demonstrated that the proposed approach significantly reduced bus waiting times and stops at intersections. Under low-to-moderate demand situations, the combination of three strategies outperformed other strategies, and RTS-incorporated strategies achieved the greatest benefits under high-demand conditions."

    "abstract": "The asymmetrical uplink and downlink transceiver architecture has emerged as a promising solution to reduce hardware cost and complexity in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, especially under scenarios with dense antenna deployments, such as uniform planar arrays (UPAs). However, accurate full-dimensional channel state information (CSI) recovery becomes more challenging than uniform linear array (ULA) scenarios due to the significantly reduced number of radio frequency (RF) chains. Directly extending the ULA channel recovery method into UPAs will not only result in high computational complexity but also introduce angle estimation ambiguity owing to the extra vertical array dimension. To address these challenges, we propose a channel recovery framework for UPA-assisted massive MIMO systems with asymmetrical transceiver architectures. First, we introduce the concept of the mixed angle to deal with the low elevation angular resolution originating from the compact array form, and a virtual array is then constructed based on the mixed angle via the spatial correlation matrix. After that, an antenna selection algorithm is designed to maximize the virtual array aperture with a minimal number of RF chains, and a low-complexity UPA-based modified newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit (UPA-based mNOMP) channel recovery algorithm is developed to enable accurate full-dimensional CSI reconstruction. Finally, the imperfect spatial correlation matrix is considered and a orthogonal rank-one matrix pursuit-based spatial correlation matrix recovery algorithm is proposed to recover the spatial correlation matrix from its spatial sparse measurements by exploiting the low-rank property of massive MIMO channels. Simulation results validate the superiority of the proposed algorithms in achieving excellent full-dimensional channel recovery performance for asymmetrical transceiver-based massive MIMO systems with UPAs."

    "abstract": "Multiple-input-multiple-output inverse synthetic aperture radar (MIMO-ISAR) is widely used in three-dimensional (3D) imaging due to its excellent angular resolution. After range compression, by applying super-resolution algorithms, i.e., sparse Bayesian learning (SBL), on the Doppler dimension and the height dimension sequentially, the 3D point cloud of the target is obtained. However, this cascaded processing approach leads to error accumulation and may even impair the interference phases between antennas. In contrast, joint multi-channel processing can achieve better performance but incurs heavy computational costs. Hence, the SBL method with space-time adaptive dimensionality reduction (STADR SBL) is proposed for 3D imaging efficiently. Firstly, the space-time domain dictionary is constructed for joint sparse recovery in the angular (height) and Doppler frequency dimensions. Then, edge detection is performed on the angle- Doppler spectrum, and the frequency search range of the dictionary is reduced to within the edge boundaries. Finally, the dimensionality-reduced dictionary is further split into a spatial and a temporal dictionary utilizing the Kronecker product property, and super-resolution 3D imaging is achieved efficiently by the fast SBL method. Experiments with both measured real data and simulated data verify the algorithm's effectiveness."

It maps ambiguous and half-ambiguous velocities into the unambiguous region through corresponding velocity compensation, performs slow-time correction and coherent integration to accumulate target energy, and reorganizes the Doppler frequency spectrum to obtain the final result. The VRKT algorithm achieves accurate RM correction and robust energy accumulation across arbitrary target velocities. For range-spread target detection, a deep neural network named RSTDNet is proposed, which integrates multi-scale convolutions and residual connections for multi-scale hierarchical feature extraction. The training dataset is generated based on the electromagnetic scattering model of a typical target, enabling RSTDNet to learn priors for effective detection across varying velocities, attitudes, and Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs). Simulation results demonstrate that the VRKT algorithm outperforms conventional keystone transform methods in half-ambiguous velocity regions, achieving an integration gain improvement. Meanwhile, compared to classical range-spread target detection algorithms, such as energy integration, order statistics, M-out-of-N, and scattering density dependent generalized likelihood ratio test, RSTDNet demonstrates superior detection performance across various target attitudes. Furthermore, the overall VRKT-RSTDNet method is validated for high-speed range-spread target detection."

Existing heuristics (Poison, Haircut, FIFO) either over-taint or lack formal proofs. We propose a sub-range Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model that assigns each satoshi a compact Base62 identifier and commits all sub-ranges into a 62-ary Verkle tree. Spenders publish succinct Kate-Zaverucha-Goldberg (KZG) multi-point openings that (i) prove membership of selected sub-ranges, (ii) show a homomorphic delta split between spent and change roots, and (iii) aggregate multi-input spends. We quantitatively evaluate the scheme: proofs are $\\lt 150$ bytes in the 256-branch Verkle configuration and KZG commitments/proofs are 48 bytes each, yielding constant-time verification with 3-5 pairings. These metrics make satoshi-level taint tracing practical for high- throughput blockchains. We discuss limitations, including the need for protocol integration and prototype benchmarks, and outline directions for future work."

This paper presents WAMflow, a web-based diagram editor designed explicitly for supporting the creation and editing of WAM diagrams. The editor enables Web Engineers to visually design federated web architectures in the browser and allows to export diagrams for sharing and documentation purposes.

Our enhanced models demonstrate a significant improvement in classification accuracy and a reduction in false positive rates. The results indicate that incorporating human perceptual elements not only bolsters technical performance but also enhances the real-world effectiveness of Arabic spam detection systems.

    "abstract": "Visual Prompt (VP) learning has rapidly emerged as a popular paradigm for parameter-efficient task adaptation in CLIP-based models. However, while VP optimizes pixel-space vectors without altering CLIP’s internal weights, this decoupled design inadvertently introduces critical security vulnerabilities.

Existing backdoor techniques, however, rely on visually noticeable patterns and exhibit inconsistencies in representation alignment, which make them prone to detection and ineffective against robust defenses. In response to these limitations, we propose Stealthy Backdoor Carriers (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SBC</i>), a novel attack framework that leverages CLIP’s inherent vulnerabilities to covertly and persistently inject backdoors. <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SBC</i> adopts a dual-constrained optimization strategy that balances imperceptibility—minimizing trigger perturbations for visual stealth—and cross-modal embedding alignment—ensuring poisoned and target samples share consistent representations within CLIP’s multimodal space.

The designed single layer superstrate acts as a highly reflecting surface for FPC antenna and a highly transmitting phase correcting surface for lens antenna. The transmission and reflection properties of superstrate unit cells can be selected independently. A combination of two different types of unit cells is used to increase the transmission phase variation while keeping the reflection band properties intact. A single feed dual band source patch is designed to illuminate the cavity, whose both operating frequencies can also be decided independently. For small frequency ratio and without any complicated feed network, this antenna achieves high gain at both the operating bands. The fabricated prototype antenna provides a measured impedance bandwidth (BW) of 440 MHz and a peak realized gain of 17.3 dBi at X band and a BW of 785 MHz and peak gain of 16.5 dBi at Ku band. The structure is compact, lightweight, offers high gain with high polarization purity at both the frequencies making it suitable for SFO based imaging radar."

However, their immense computational complexity poses significant challenges in resource consumption, inference latency, and data privacy for traditional cloud-centric deployments. Edge artificial intelligence (Edge-AI) offers promising LLMs deployment solutions by leveraging distributed resources at the network edge. However, existing approaches struggle to adapt to dynamic workloads and efficiently utilize heterogeneous resources in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) environments.

Firstly, we formulate a collaboration deployment optimization problem to minimize inference latency and resource usage under heterogeneous resource and user requirements for latency and accuracy constraints, which is NP-hard. Secondly, to solve this, we develop a dynamic batch fusion optimization algorithm that optimizes the batch size of inference by utilizing the parallel processing power of computing units to balance the latency and resource usage. A block-aware partition optimization algorithm based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is proposed for efficient transformer block allocation, integrating mobility awareness for optimal partitioning across dynamic network environments. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of DyBAP over other benchmarks, reducing inference latency by 17.94% and saving 11.12% in memory resource consumption compared to the end-edge-cloud collaboration approaches."

To address this issue, the field of Misinformation Detection (MD), which focuses on the automated identification of online misinformation, has gained significant traction among researchers. In our study, we introduce an innovative plugand- play augmentation technique for MD, termed DEtecting Misinformation by Uncovering Commonsense Conflict (DEMUC). Our approach is grounded in previous psychological research that suggests that fake content often contains commonsense. Accordingly, we develop commonsense expressions for articles to highlight potential conflicts between the inferred commonsense triplets and the established ones derived from reliable commonsense reasoning tools. According to the used tools, we induce two variants DEMUC-KLM using the knowledge language model COMET and DEMUC-LLM using the large language models. These generated expressions are then applied as augmentations to each article, enabling any MD method to be trained on these augmented datasets. Additionally, we have manually compiled a new dataset CoMis, which consists exclusively of fake articles characterized by commonsense conflicts. By integrating DEMUC with various existing MD frameworks and evaluating them on four public benchmark datasets and CoMis, our empirical findings show that both DEMUC-KLM and DEMUC-LLM consistently and significantly outperform current MD baselines, while also generating precise commonsense expressions."

However, the barrier surface charges distort the electric field distribution, leading to the difficulty of estimating the breakdown voltage. This study proposes a method to estimate the equivalent surface charge density under different gas pressures and analyzes the influence of equivalent surface charge on the electric field distribution. The equivalent surface charge not only reduces the electric field strength near the rod electrode, but also enhances the field strength between the barrier and the ground electrode. The effect of equivalent surface charge on the electric field is associated with the position of barrier and the gas pressure. Moreover, the accuracy of the streamer criterion for the breakdown voltage estimation is analyzed. when the influence of equivalent surface charges on the electric field is considered, the calculated breakdown voltage agrees well with the experimental result, indicating the accuracy of the proposed method. The results show that the selection of the breakdown path has a significant influence on the breakdown voltage estimation at high pressures."

Moreover, compared to works using a 16-bit SRAM to store timestamps, the ISC analog array can reduce power consumption by three orders of magnitude. In real computer vision (CV) tasks, we applied the spatial-temporal correlation filter (STCF) for denoise, and 3D-ISC achieved almost equivalent accuracy compared to the digital implementation using high precision timestamps. As for the image classification, time-surface constructed by 3D-ISC is used as the input of GoogleNet, achieving 99% on N-MNIST, 85% on N-Caltech101, 78% on CIFAR10-DVS, and 97% on DVS128 Gesture, comparable with state-of-the-art results on each dataset. Additionally, the 3D-ISC method is also applied to image reconstruction using the DAVIS240C dataset, achieving the highest average SSIM (0.62) among three methods.

The basic idea is to introduce a product-to-one constraint at both the view and attribute levels, enabling adaptive and balanced weight assignment without introducing extra parameters. Two weighting strategies are developed: (i) vector-form weighting, which assigns global importance to views and attributes, and (ii) matrix-form weighting, which further captures cluster-specific relevance. Moreover, both Euclidean and non-Euclidean (exponential transformation) distance measures are incorporated, yielding four algorithmic variants: PDW-MFC-V, PDW-MFC-M, PDW-MAFC-V, and PDW-MAFC-M. Extensive experiments on nine real-world datasets show that our algorithms outperform thirteen related algorithms across multiple metrics. These results confirm that dual-granularity weighting effectively models the relative importance of views and attributes, while the non-Euclidean distance improves robustness to noise. Overall, the proposed framework offers a flexible, parameter-free, and robust solution for multi-view clustering, providing fine-grained interpretability and stable performance across diverse datasets."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a quantum annealing (QA)-based auto-calibration method that efficiently estimates calibration parameters of array antennas. Gain and phase errors in individual array elements hinder the accuracy of direction of arrival (DOA) estimation. In large-scale antenna arrays, such as AESA and space surveillance radar systems, auto-calibration is time-prohibitive due to the need to optimize an extremely large number of calibration parameters. The core approach of this paper is to transform the auto-calibration task into a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model that can be solved by quantum annealing. This is achieved by first encoding the gain and phase errors into a binary format. A Factorization Machine (FM) then learns the relationship between these binary errors and their resulting performance cost, mapping out the problem's cost surface. The resulting QUBO can be directly solved using the D-Wave quantum annealing hardware for fast and effective optimization. Simulation results of auto-calibration based on MUSIC algorithm showed improvement in DOA accuracy by 0.01 to 0.3 degrees and sidelobe suppression by 1 to 17 dB. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, real-world radar measurements were performed, and its calibration performance was evaluated. In addition, applicability to other DOA estimation methods such as Capon was investigated. The proposed approach significantly reduces calibration time while maintaining high estimation performance, demonstrating its potential for practical deployment in large scale radar systems."

    "abstract": "With the advancement of virtual reality (VR) technology, researchers have explored its application in various domains, including medical education for college students. However, systematic investigations into the specific effects of VR interaction modalities on learning outcomes remain limited. This study investigates the VR-based learning process using the modified Cognitive Affective Model of Immersive Learning (CAMIL), with the objective of exploring the impact of different interaction modalities on college students’ learning of medical theoretical knowledge. A five-level interaction complexity design (no interaction, click, rotate, drag, assemble) was used to randomly assign 173 students into groups for a virtual anatomy experiment with HTC Vive devices. ANOVA was utilized to examine the influence of interactions on variables of interest, while SEM was applied to assess the predicted learning process. The key findings are as follows: (1) Different interaction modalities significantly impact the acquisition of theoretical medical knowledge, though the positive effect of interaction complexity on learning outcomes may be subject to certain constraints. (2) Interaction complexity positively and significantly influences physical presence, agency, and intrinsic motivation, which in turn enhance learning engagement and knowledge acquisition through these mediators. (3) The direct effect of physical presence on learning engagement is considerably stronger than that of the embodied learning pathway. Based on these insights, this paper offers recommendations for optimizing VR teaching design by aligning interaction modalities with learning objectives, enhancing physical presence, and leveraging the motivational drive of intrinsic factors. These contributions provide a robust scientific foundation for refining and implementing virtual teaching practices."

    "abstract": "Seeing clearly with high resolution is a foundation of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which has been proven to be vital for visual perception and reasoning. Existing works usually employ a straightforward resolution upscaling method, where the image consists of global and local branches, with the latter being the sliced image patches but resized to the same resolution as the former. This means that higher resolution requires more local patches, resulting in exorbitant computational expenses, and meanwhile, the dominance of local image tokens may diminish the global context. In this paper, we dive into the problems and propose a new framework as well as an elaborate optimization strategy. Specifically, we extract contextual information from the global view using a mixture of adapters, based on the observation that different adapters excel at different tasks. With regard to local patches, learnable query embeddings are introduced to reduce image tokens, the important tokens most relevant to the user question will be further selected by a similarity-based selector. Our empirical results demonstrate a ‘less is more’ pattern, where <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">utilizing fewer but more informative local image tokens leads to improved performance</i>. Besides, a significant challenge lies in the training strategy, as simultaneous end-to-end training of the global mining block and local compression block does not yield optimal results. We thus advocate for an alternating training way, ensuring balanced learning between global and local aspects. Finally, we also introduce a challenging dataset with high requirements for image detail, enhancing the training of the local compression layer.

As Tor scales and usage patterns evolve, default strategies such as bandwidth-weighted random selection and persistent guard nodes face increasing performance limitations. This study presents a comparative evaluation of five path selection strategies: Random, Guard, Congestion-Aware, and two Geographic approaches (Diversity Driven and Latency-Optimized), herein referred to as Geo-Latency and Geo-Diversity, using a high-fidelity simulation model inspired by TorPS (Tor Path Simulator). Experiments were conducted across five network scales, simulating 37,500 circuits under realistic relay conditions. Results show that Geographic (Latency-Optimized) consistently achieved the lowest latency $(40.0 \\mathrm{~ms})$ and highest efficiency, while Congestion-Aware strategies delivered the best throughput, outperforming the baseline by up to $\\mathbf{4 2 \\%}$. Guard nodes maintained stable routing but exhibited latency increases under larger networks. No single method proved optimal across all scenarios, but each revealed clear strengths for specific use cases. These findings demonstrate that targeted path selection can significantly improve Tor’s performance without compromising anonymity, providing guidance for optimizing circuit construction in future development and deployments."

    "abstract": "In IoT-based systems, languages like the Uniform Description Language (UDL) have been used to formally describe the features and functionalities of IoT objects. With the integration of social networking concepts into IoT and the emergence of the Social Internet of Things (SIoT), there is now a growing need to specify how objects can become social. Currently, setting up an object’s initial social profile consists only of specifying which social relationships to establish and is often done through predefined rules, which limits both automation and scalability. To address this challenge, we introduce a Uniform Description Language for Social IoT Objects (UDL-SIoT) to support the integration of IoT devices into SIoT platforms. The UDLSIoT provides a structured way to specify the characteristics of IoT devices, including functional, technical, social, quality of service, and security aspects, and use them to create their social profiles. Additionally, we propose to automate the social profile generation by integrating a Deep Learning (DL)-based social profile generator. This generator creates a social profile for objects, that join the network for the first time, based on their features and predicts potential social connections. We evaluate the proposed DL-based social relationship prediction model using a real SIoT dataset. The results show that our generator can predict the social relationships with an accuracy of 92%. The predicted relationships can support advanced tasks such as automating the specification of socialization rules to enable IoT objects to autonomously establish social relationships."

This paper proposes FL-PSO, a hybrid strategy combining Federated Learning (FL) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for resource management in fog-cloud computing environments. FL-PSO is applied to EV charging stations and benchmarked against standard PSO, Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO). Evaluation is conducted using Quality of Service (QoS) metrics, including latency, energy consumption, and load balancing. Results show that FL-PSO achieves a fitness value of 0.1489, reduced energy consumption (0.2644 W), and improved load balancing (4.29), consistently outperforming baseline methods under both fixed weights and optimal QoS trade-offs. By leveraging the synergy between FL and PSO, FL-PSO provides a scalable and intelligent solution for distributed fog-cloud systems supporting smart EV charging infrastructures."

    "abstract": "The field of dental radiology presents potential for progress in Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA). However, the lack of clinically expert-annotated panoramic Xray datasets continues to hinder progress in this field. This paper introduces the new DENT_VQA, a publicly available dataset that addresses this gap and assists in the establishment of sophisticated dental MedVQA solutions. DENT_VQA is a collection of 1,327 panoramic dental X-ray images and over 12,000 question-answer (QA) pairs arranged into five diagnostic themes: Dentition and Tooth Status, Restorative Treatments, Prosthetic Devices, Maxillofacial Pathology, and Orthodontic and Surgical Devices. Our key contribution in this paper lies in the methodological framework for building DENT_VQA, which integrates ethical data acquisition, resolution normalization, expert-driven QA formulation, and a multi-phase annotation refinement. In addition, we position DENT_VQA within the existing research landscape and compare it to other dental imaging datasets, while emphasizing its singular focus on question-guided clinical reasoning. Future work will address the possibility of extending the dataset to cover pediatric cases and incorporating multilingual QA pairs to improve accessibility and global usability."

    "abstract": "Compared with generic object detection, remote sensing image small object detection typically encounters problems such as information loss, noise characteristic interference, and disturbance of the bounding box. Different from the con ventional method of bounding box regression, we propose a self-learning feature point network (SFPNet) for small object detection, which can captures the geometric information of the object in arbitrary directions as well as enhance the representation of small objects by leveraging feature points. Specifically, a feature points orientation transformation module is proposed to accurately obtain classification and localization information. To improve the learning ability of weak sample objects, a positive and negative sample evaluation and balancing strategy is proposed. Additionally, we introduce a self-learning method of feature points under spatial constraints, which enhances the self-refinement and object expression ability of the feature points while eliminating false alarms. To enhances the training of hard-to-distinguish samples, we propose online feature point hard example mining. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets (including AI-TOD, SODA-A, and DOTA v2) show that the proposed method achieves more than 1.3% improvement in small object detection accuracy at different scales."

Furthermore, the delay induced by symbol discarding is modeled as a stochastic delay system, yielding closed-form expressions for loop stability constraint, equivalent noise transfer, and convergent condition. Based on these results, we propose a global design criterion by jointly optimizes the selection threshold and loop filter parameters. Both theoretical derivations and simulation results show that the proposed algorithm and optimization strategy can lower the 64-quadrature amplitude modulation (64-QAM) stabilizing threshold by over 8 dB and achieve SNR gain exceeding 0.4 dB."

When subjected to a magnetic field, the CeYIG layer exhibits anisotropic optical behavior, explained by a permittivity tensor with nonzero off-diagonal components, thereby inducing magneto-optical (MO) activity. The magnetization is oriented along the z-axis, normal to the sensor surface. Notably, the proposed design achieves an extraordinary transverse spin-dependent shift (SDS) of approximately 237.93 μm with the external orbital angular momentum (EOAM) based centroid shift of 0.508 μm at resonance angle. This enhancement has enabled the MOSPR sensor to use as an ultra-sensitive PSHE-based magnetometer, with a maximal sensitivity of 11258.36 μm/RIU at a refractive index (RI) of 1.1 for detecting minute RI variations in the sensing medium. The proposed MOSPR sensor, performance enhanced by the integration of CeYIG and graphene with PSHE, demonstrates the importance of this sensor for next-generation MO sensing devices."

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of cloud, edge, and Internet of Things environments has increased both the scale and complexity of modern cyber-attacks. Conventional detection systems that operate effectively under stationary conditions often degrade when attacker behaviour or underlying data distributions change. This work introduces the Agentic Intelligence Self-Adaptive Framework (AISAF), a unified and self-adjusting threat detection model designed for heterogeneous computing environments. AISAF employs a hybrid CNN, LSTM, and Transformer backbone to capture spatial, temporal, and contextual dependencies in network traffic. Concept drift is detected through lightweight behavioural monitoring that tracks latent-space deviations and prediction-confidence variations in streaming data. When meaningful drift is detected, an agentic meta-optimization controller selectively updates only the affected submodules, reducing retraining cost while preventing catastrophic forgetting. An attention-based explanation layer provides feature-level interpretability that remains consistent during adaptation, supporting transparent and auditable threat reasoning. AISAF is evaluated on six benchmark datasets spanning financial, network, and IoT domains: PaySim, IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection, CICIDS2018, UNSW-NB15, CICIDS2017, and BoT-IoT. Experimental results show consistent improvements in adaptability, robustness, and drift recovery compared with classical machine learning, deep learning, and adaptive baselines. AISAF achieves reliable cross-domain generalization and maintains transparent decision behaviour throughout the adaptation process, highlighting its potential as a practical step toward autonomous and interpretable cybersecurity systems."

    "abstract": "Building energy prediction plays a crucial role in reducing energy wastage and ensuring the storage of sufficient sustainable energy for future use. However, existing building energy prediction models exhibit low accuracy, and their applicability is typically limited to specific use cases. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel hybrid model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) for building energy prediction. The proposed hybrid model captures spatial patterns and features in the data using CNN. Furthermore, it captures temporal dependencies and long-term relationships by using BiLSTM. This paper improves energy prediction accuracy by integrating occupancy count as an additional input into the proposed hybrid model. This also improves the practical applicability of the proposed energy prediction model. The performance of the proposed hybrid model is extensively and rigorously validated against various evaluation metrics, including prediction accuracy, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE). The simulation results show that the proposed model outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches. The model provides improved accuracy and enables stakeholders to optimize energy usage and enhance the overall energy efficiency in buildings."

However, conventional FL frameworks typically assume feature independence and utilize uniform aggregation, treating client updates equally without accounting for feature significance. These assumptions limit effectiveness when input features are strongly correlated and device data distributions vary, reducing model generalization and predictive performance. This paper introduces Correlated Feature-Aware Weighted Federated Learning (CFAW-FL), addressing feature interdependencies by identifying and grouping correlated features across clients. CFAW-FL employs a feature-weighted aggregation strategy, prioritizing updates based on predictive relevance, thereby preserving cross-feature dynamics. Evaluated on various datasets, CFAW-FL achieves up to 20.6% reduction in log loss and 29% faster convergence compared to FedAvg, FedProx,q-FedAvg, and HeteroFL, demonstrating improved performance on heterogeneous, feature-structured data in decentralized settings."

    "abstract": "With the increasing penetration of wind power generation into power grids, regional wind power forecasting errors tend to accumulate due to the clustering of wind farms, potentially affecting power dispatch. This concern can be eliminated by effectively cooperating the processes of large-scale mode simulation and data assimilation of real measurements. To address this concern, a mode-measurement-cooperation framework is proposed. In this, an adaptive Fourier operator is developed to extract partial differential features from mode data, followed by a dense-sparse convolution to fuse simulated modes with measurements from multiple wind farms. Last, to accommodate the interaction between centralized server and multiple decentralized wind farms, federated split learning is adopted as the core interaction mechanism, which jointly ensured the information interaction and privacy preservation. The proposed framework is validated based on practical data from 156 wind farms in a provincial region. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, the mode-measurement-cooperated mechanism is observed to increase the structure similarity index measure of wind vector image by 4.348% and reduce the normalized mean absolute error of regional wind power forecasting by 4.071%. In addition, the advantages of the proposed framework on the privacy preservation and mutual computational friendship also confirmed the practical significance of the proposed framework."

    "abstract": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a serious neurodegenerative disorder worldwide with devastating consequences for cognitive function and quality of life. Early and accurate diagnosis of AD is important for effective clinical intervention and management. Existing artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic models for AD are generally black-box systems, which diminishes their transparency and clinical acceptability. This issue is a major obstacle to integrating AI technologies into healthcare systems, where interpretability and clarity in decision-making are critical factors for gaining the trust of medical professionals. Based on these challenges, we propose an explainable ensemble framework for the early diagnosis of AD using structured clinical data from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our model integrates state-of-the-art ensemble classifiers-random forest, LightGBM, stacking, and voting ensembles-with SHAP (Shapley additive explanations) and fuzzy SHAP (FSHAP) to provide transparent feature attributions. We preprocess ADNI’s 180,799 records, which include 15 clinical and biomarker features, by handling missing values (through deletion or imputation), applying synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) for class balancing, encoding categorical variables, and correcting outliers. Among the evaluated models, the voting ensemble achieved the highest test accuracy ($98.6 \\%$) along with robust precision and recall scores (approximately $98 \\%$). SHAP analysis identified cognitive and neuropsychiatric scores, such as Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) Total, Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ), Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPIQ), and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). FSHAP further quantified the confidence levels associated with each feature’s contribution, demonstrating that LightGBM models assign stronger and more definitive importance to certain features (e.g., Global CDR, FAQ), whereas ensemble averaging produces more conservative attributions under uncertainty."

We review the detailed investigations into the current research landscape related to digital twins, examining their use across these different fields, and comparing their applications, challenges, and potentials. In the realm of smart cities, creating a digital replica of the city infrastructure could significantly enhance urban planning, city management, and disaster response. Applying the digital twin technology within the smart city would surely bring its unique challenges and opportunities and meet the increasing requirements of city development. Additionally, as a platform for modeling and simulations in the manufacturing industry, digital twin creates virtual copies of these physical entities. By doing so, the digital twin application collects and analyzes unexpected data in manufacturing scenarios which eventually provides better decision making and increases productivity. In the VR/AR industry, the potential of digital twins reveals that this technology could be used for remote working environments, predictive health diagnostics, and personalized treatment plans for the healthcare domain. Although promising, digital twin technology also faces considerable challenges such as the complexities of data communication and accumulation, the dearth of data for training ML models, the need for massive processing power to support high fidelity twins, the high demand for interdisciplinary collaboration, and the absence of standardized development methodologies and validation measures. This paper, however, focuses on the positive aspects and benefits of digital twin technology."

This paper investigates how to develop credit risk classification models that balance between accuracy and explainability, promoting transparency and confidence for financial decision makers. To achieve this, we propose a twophase explainable credit classification approach. The first phase uses neuro-fuzzy modeling to learn predictive models from data in the form of IF-THEN rules. The second phase introduces a pruning technique to reduce the number of generated rules by removing redundant or less important ones. Experiments conducted on two real credit risk datasets demonstrate that the proposed method maintains high predictive accuracy while enhancing explainability."

    "abstract": "Change captioning is a task that describes changes in image pairs using natural language. This task is more complex than single-image captioning as it requires a comprehensive understanding of each image and the ability to recognize and describe the semantic changes in image pairs. The key challenge lies in making the network generate an accurate and stable change representation under the interference of viewpoint shift. In this paper, we propose a cross-view and multi-step interaction network to generate robust change representation to resist pseudo-change. Specifically, in the intra-image representation learning stage, a cross-view interaction encoder is designed to enhance internal relationships by cross-referencing in image pairs. In the change feature learning stage, a multi-step change perceptron is employed to capture the change semantics from coarse to fine progressively. Then, a fusion module dynamically combines them as a fine-grained change representation. Besides, we propose a backward representation reconstruction module that facilitates the capture of semantic changes, thus improving the quality of captions in a self-supervised manner. Extensive experiments have shown that the method effectively captures real semantic changes under the interference of viewpoint shift and achieves state-of-the-art performance on five public datasets.

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Transformers (VLTs) have achieved remarkable success, but their computational costs pose a challenge due to the large number of input tokens and extensive model parameters. Existing VLT compression methods primarily rely on single-modality-based token pruning or coarse-grained weight pruning techniques. However, these methods face significant obstacles, such as ignoring the critical alignment of different modalities and lacking the flexibility to dynamically compress each layer for token pruning, exhibiting inevitable performance degradation due to coarse-grained weight pruning, and struggling with the simultaneous compression of both input tokens and model parameters. To address those limitations, we propose MADTP++, a novel approach that integrates custom-made token and weight pruning processes into a unified framework, achieving superior compression in both parameter counts and computational costs. Specifically, for the token pruning process, we introduce the Multi-modality Alignment Guidance (MAG) module and the Dynamic Token Pruning (DTP) module to align semantic features across different modalities and guide the dynamic elimination of redundant tokens based on different input instances. For the weight pruning process, we propose a Hardware-aware Weight Pruning (HWP) module that leverages the Sparse Tensor Cores across diverse hardware setups to enable fine-grained parameter pruning within VLTs. To further unify token and weight pruning, we also propose a Cooperative Optimization Training Strategy that automatically assigns the required reduction in GFLOPs and Params to each branch before pruning and employs Knowledge Distillation Constraints to facilitate joint optimization of both pruning dimensions. Extensive experiments conducted on various VLT models and datasets demonstrate that MADTP++ can significantly reduce model parameters and computational costs while maintaining competitive performance.

However, considering the complexity of parameters and the tradeoff between multiple objectives, it is a challenging process to achieve high BV and area efficiency simultaneously in typical termination structures like field-limit ring (FLR). To address the problem, this paper proposes a novel and efficient termination design optimization method based on physically characterized variables. With the utilization of auxiliary parameter γ specified multiple objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm, a 110 V improvement in BV and more than 26% reduction in termination area has been achieved respectively. Importantly, the design scheme provided by this method demonstrates superiority over the dataset utilized during training. The results are validated by TCAD simulation, and we also successfully predicted the performance gain of the actual manufactured devices. Therefore, this paper offers a potential solution approach for multi-objective optimization problems. With the diverse distribution of Pareto solutions, this method proves broad applicability in the design of power devices involving multi-objective optimization."

    "abstract": "Low-order frequency response models for power systems have a decades-long history in optimization and control problems such as unit commitment, economic dispatch, and wide-area control. With a few exceptions, these models are built upon the Newtonian mechanics of synchronous generators, assuming that the frequency dynamics across a system are approximately homogeneous, and assume the dynamics of nodal voltages for most operating conditions are negligible, and thus are not directly computed at all buses. As a result, the use of system frequency models results in the systematic underestimation of frequency minimum nadir and maximum RoCoF, and provides no insight into the reactive power-voltage dynamics. This paper proposes a low-order model of both frequency and voltage response in grid-forming inverter-dominated power systems. The proposed model accounts for spatial-temporal variations in frequency and voltage behavior across a system and as a result, demonstrates the heterogeneity of frequency response in future renewable power systems. Electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations are used to validate the utility, accuracy, and computational efficiency of these models, setting the basis for them to serve as fast, scalable alternatives to EMT simulation, especially when dealing with very large-scale systems, for both planning and operational studies."

However, the intrinsic spatial-spectral details in hyperspectral images are hard to be completely represented on insufficient data solely utilizing the hierarchical learning manner in most Mamba structures, which results in the degradation of restoration quality on inherent fine-grain textures. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a Wavelet-Enhanced Spatial-Spectral Prior Guided Mamba Network (WESSP-Mamba) for HSI-SR, which leverages wavelet-enhanced spatial-spectral priors to refine detail recovery with cross-layer embedment. Specifically, this model strengthens multiscale spatial correlations with a Wavelet transform and produces spectral responses with a spectral attention mechanism, which adaptively highlights specific bands to acquire an instructive spatial-spectral joint prior. The learnable prior is then injected into the hierarchical deep features from the backbone network—built upon a Shuffle-ReShuffle Mamba (SRM) module—through a spatial selection mechanism, thereby contributing to the impressive representation capability. Extensive experiments on three representative datasets show that the WESSP-Mamba model achieves superior HSI-SR performance to other deep learning approaches in terms of quantitative and qualitative metrics. Especially, the peak signal-to-noise ratio of WESSP-Mamba exceeds that of the second-best method by 0.0608dB, 0.0520dB, 0.0443dB on the Chikusei, Houston and PaviaC datasets at the ×4 scale factor, respectively."

    "abstract": "Multilevel inverters (MLIs) are widely adopted in high power density systems for their efficiency and waveform quality. Conventional capacitor-based MLIs, however, face persistent challenges such as voltage imbalance and device stress induced by neutral currents. To address these limitations, the neutral-point-less H-type (NPL.H) inverter has been introduced, eliminating the static neutral point altogether. Unlike conventional designs, the NPL.H achieves its multilevel outputs through impedance-based voltage division rather than stacked capacitors, thereby offering a fundamentally different mechanism of voltage generation. Since voltage generation relies on the load impedance, the resulting waveforms exhibit inherent sensitivity to load balance. This paper develops an analytical framework for understanding multilevel voltage generation in NPL.H inverters and examines how load imbalance influences voltage symmetry and reliability. Theoretical derivations establish line-to-line voltage levels and neutral point dynamics for each switching state, demonstrating consistent production of half the dc-link voltage via impedance division in the load. An equivalent impedance model is further employed to quantify imbalance effects, introducing a scaling factor that predicts voltage behavior under asymmetric conditions. Simulation and experimental validations confirm the analysis, showing that eliminating the neutral point and accommodating up to 12% load imbalance only cause brief voltage overshoot before stabilizing at expected levels."

    "abstract": "The proliferation of resource-constrained devices in Internet of Things (IoT) environments has amplified the demand for scalable, secure, and efficient cryptographic services. While Encryption-as-a-Service (EaaS) models enable offloading cryptographic tasks to trusted infrastructure, critical challenges remain regarding path integrity, trust management, and resilience to adversarial threats in multi-domain networks. This paper introduces EaaS/PIN, a unified framework that combines cryptographically verifiable path integrity, user-centric trust scoring, collaborative threat intelligence, and machine learning-driven path selection across distributed Autonomous Systems (ASs). The framework integrates: (i) a novel anonymity protocol to conceal complete routes from intermediary ASs, (ii) lightweight, customizable encryption suitable for IoT and edge environments, (iii) real-time, AI-based path recommendation leveraging dynamic trust and performance metrics, and (iv) a blockchain-inspired audit mechanism for tamper-evident reporting and accountability. Comprehensive mathematical modeling, algorithms, and a detailed case study focused on secure data transmission in a multi-AS smart city network demonstrate that EaaS/PIN significantly enhances routing security, reduces latency, and ensures transparent and verifiable operations even under adversarial conditions. Experimental results confirm robust detection of path manipulation and compromised ASs, as well as measurable performance gains over baseline solutions. The proposed framework paves the way for scalable, user-aware, and resilient cryptographic services in next-generation heterogeneous network infrastructures."

    "abstract": "This paper studies the simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (Active STAR-RIS) assisted cell-free massive MIMO multiple-input multiple-output system with a low-resolution analog-to-digital converter (ADC). An additive quantization noise model (AQNM) is investigated to capture the effect of the low-resolution ADC. Closed-form expressions for linear minimum mean square error channel estimation is derived. Furthermore, we derive the uplink spectral efficiency (SE) in closed form under maximum ratio combined receiver filter. Based on this analytical framework, we undertake a quantitative exploration of how various system parameters influence the uplink SE. Moreover, a detailed trade-off analysis is conducted to evaluate the deployment of supplementary access points (APs) in comparison to the integration of additional RISs. In order to enhance the precision of channel estimation, this paper develops a normalized mean square error optimization framework that minimizes errors across all UEs. This approach simultaneously reduces the pilot transmit power and mitigates pilot contamination during the uplink pilot training phase, utilizing a successive convex approximation method."

    "abstract": "Last-mile delivery route prediction is a critical task in intelligent logistics; however, traditional optimization methods and standalone deep learning models encounter significant challenges in terms of scalability, adaptability, and long-term sequence prediction. To address these issues, we propose DiffRoute, an integrated framework that combines Graph Attention Networks (GAT) for spatial modeling and iTransformer for temporal sequence processing. Our framework introduces delivery-specific adaptations, including Area of Interest (AOI) feature integration, dynamic route masking, and Gumbel-Softmax based differentiable path selection, enabling end-to-end optimization under discrete routing constraints. In addition, a frequent pattern attention module retrieves and aggregates historical trajectories to enhance performance in data-sparse scenarios. Experiments on a large-scale LaDe dataset demonstrate that DiffRoute consistently outperforms traditional heuristics, machine learning baselines, and deep learning models, achieving superior accuracy across the Hit Rate at 3 (HR@3), Kendall Rank Correlation (KRC), Location Shift Distance (LSD), and Euclidean Distance (ED) metrics. On the LaDe Shanghai dataset, DiffRoute achieves HR@3 = 74.32% and KRC = 76.23. On the LaDe Chongqing dataset reaching HR@3 = 75.21% and KRC = 77.56, In both Shanghai and Chongqing, DiffRoute achieves lower LSD and ED values than all baseline methods. Ablation studies further confirm the indispensable contributions of each module, whereas visualization analyses highlight the model’s interpretability and robustness. These results validated the effectiveness of DiffRoute as a model for route planning in current urban logistics."

    "abstract": "As the world becomes more connected through smart devices and the Internet of Things (IoT), managing how tasks are scheduled and executed across cloud and edge environments has become increasingly complex. The need to efficiently allocate resources, such as virtual machines (VMs), while keeping energy consumption low is critical for both performance and sustainability in such distributed systems. Recently, the integration of Federated Learning (FL) with energy-aware scheduling approaches is drawing attention as a means to address these challenges. FL empowers collaborative intelligence across edge and cloud nodes without centralizing sensitive data, thereby enhancing privacy and responsiveness. When combined with energy-aware schedulers, FL makes it possible to dynamically assign tasks and virtual machines on real-time assessments of resource availability and energy constraints, taking into account the diverse capabilities and limitations of participating devices and networks. This synergy enables the development of intelligent scheduling mechanisms that balance computation loads, optimize communication, and prolong the operational lifespans of edge devices, all while adapting to continuously changing system conditions. This research demonstrates that FL-based, energy-aware schedulers for VM allocation can significantly reduce task delays, conserve energy, and enhance overall service quality in heterogeneous edge-cloud. This work proposed an enhanced Federated Learning based Energy-Aware Scheduling (FL-EAS), which reduces latency as well as conserves energy while meeting the SLA rate. This work achieved a total of 95.17% SLA success rate. In terms of accuracy of the federated learning model convergence, this work achieved 99.91%."

    "abstract": "Accurate detection of surface defects on railway tracks is critical for safe railway operation. Most existing models rely solely on Red–Green–Blue (RGB) images, limiting their ability to capture structural information. Incorporating depth features provides richer spatial cues, significantly improving detection accuracy. However, current Red–Green–Blue and Depth (RGB-D) dual-stream models suffer from high computational complexity and hardware dependencies, making them impractical for real-world deployment. To address these limitations, we propose DAHNet, an asymmetric knowledge distillation model with a teacher–student architecture. DAHNet-T serves as the teacher network, taking RGB-D inputs and integrating a cross-modal attention feature enhancement (CAFE) module to capture contextual information, along with a depth feature interaction block (DFIB) for efficient cross-modal fusion. DAHNet-S is the student network, a lightweight single-stream RGB model employing depthwise separable convolutions to reduce computation. We introduce a multi-level distillation strategy with dynamic temperature scaling to balance coarse-grained and fine-grained knowledge transfer, while incorporating contrastive learning and structural loss to improve pixel-level accuracy. Extensive experiments on the NEU RSDDS-AUG dataset demonstrate that our distilled model DAHNet-KD outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Compared to DAHNet-T, the number of parameters is reduced from 87.72 MParams to 13.97 MParams, and the computational cost decreases from 19.79 GFLOPs to 5.41 GFLOPs. The proposed model achieves superior performance across various evaluation metrics and also generalizes well on other public datasets. Therefore, the model provides a lightweight and high-accuracy solution for deployment on mobile devices in real-world industrial scenarios."

Our method leverages the autoencoder’s ability to model the intrinsic spectral patterns of pure honey, enabling the detection of subtle anomalies introduced by adulterants. Through a rigorous binary classification task, our system achieves a high F1-score, demonstrating both accuracy and robustness. In addition, we provide an indepth analysis of reconstruction quality and error distributions, highlighting the capacity of the model for interpretable and reliable fraud detection. The proposed methodology offers a scalable and data-efficient solution with broad applicability to food authentication, paving the way for future deployment in real-time quality assurance systems."

This study targets a pressing security concern in GNNs by addressing the risk of data exposure through Membership Inference Attacks (MIA). We propose a novel, model agnostic defense framework based on Diffusion based Posterior Smoothing (DPS), which enhances the privacy of node level predictions by perturbing class probabilities through a learned diffusion denoising process. Unlike prior methods, DPS maintains the predictive utility of the GNN while significantly reducing the information leakage exploited by MIA adversaries. Empirical evaluations across diverse datasets and GNN architectures confirm that DPS provides robust protection against inference attacks with minimal compromise to node classification accuracy."

    "abstract": "Under global climate change and human intervention, an increased frequency of alternating drought and flood events exists, making such extreme conditions seemingly the new normal. These frequent events result in greater variability in terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA) (i.e., nonstationary behavior). In this study, we introduce a novel and straightforward metric, i.e., the standard deviation of TWSA (STD<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">TWSA</sub>), to detect regions with nonstationary in TWSA and gain insight into the impact of global change on regional TWSA. TWSA estimates from the Center for Space Research (CSR) Mascon are used to calculate STD<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">TWSA</sub> and estimated in a rolling window approach, and the results are compared with STD in precipitation anomalies (PA) and temperature anomalies (TA). Our results reveal that 63.8% of global land areas show significant prevalence of increasing TWSA variability with nonstationary, while only 3.5% exhibit a decrease. Among the 40 large basins analyzed, 11 show significant upward trends in STD<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">TWSA</sub>, with only one basin showing a significant decline from 2002 to 2022. In 34 of these basins, precipitation accounts for over 50% of TWSA variability, suggesting that variabilities in precipitation anomalies can be used to model and explain the nonstationary behavior of TWSA in these regions. Additionally, in 3 of the remaining 6 basins, we observed significant correlations between TWSA and PA variability at five-year window. Furthermore, WGHM-modeled STD<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">TWSA</sub> estimates align with the STD<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">TWSA</sub> from CSR and show consistent trends in most basins. By linking precipitation-driven dynamics to TWSA variability, this study demonstrates the utility of STD<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">TWSA</sub> as a practical tool for identifying regions vulnerable to hydrological extremes.

Secondly, we derive the spectral efficiency (SE) of this indoor UDN and numerically analyze the effect of IR-RIS position on it to obtain the optimal IR-RIS position. Finally, we compare the indoor UDN SE obtained with IR-RIS and signal-enhancing RIS. The results show that IR-RIS outperforms signal-enhancing RIS in terms of SE enhancement under strong reflective-path interference scenarios, which highlights its superiority in interference management and potential for deployments in next-generation UDNs."

    "abstract": "Remote sensing image captioning is the task of automatically generating descriptive texts for remotely sensed scenes and objects. A common shortcoming of existing methods is the inadequate consideration of object size, which often leads to captions that either omit size information or provide imprecise size descriptions. To overcome this deficiency, we develop a novel framework composed of three modules: (a) an object confirmation and relative size estimation module, (b) a graph construction and graph convolution module, and (c) a caption generation module. Our framework comprehensively characterizes object size to generate more quantitatively informative captions. Furthermore, we introduce a new evaluation metric, SizeNum-Meteor, designed to explicitly evaluate the correctness of object count and relative size information in generated captions. This provides a more comprehensive assessment, as standard metrics typically neglect the evaluation of object size. In addition, we construct extended benchmarks by enriching existing datasets with explicit annotations of object count and relative size. Extensive experiments on three existing benchmark datasets (i.e., UCM, Sydney, and RSICD) and the benchmarks we construct (i.e., UCM-N-S, Sydney-N-S, and RSICD-N-S) demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance on both standard metrics and the proposed SizeNum-Meteor."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive review of the recent advancements in active distribution network expansion planning, focusing on the integration of active network management technologies and services. The transition from passive to active distribution networks is driven by the proliferation of distributed energy resources such as renewable and non-renewable distributed generation, energy storage systems, and demand response, which necessitate new planning and operational paradigms. The active distribution network expansion planning models must account for the stochastic and dynamic nature of distributed energy resources, requiring multi-objective, multi-stage, and hierarchical optimization approaches. The paper analyzes over 50 articles published since 2014, categorizing them based on planning horizons, distributed energy resources integration, solution methods, uncertainty handling techniques, and reliability metrics. Active network management technologies such as dynamic thermal rating, reactive power control, and coordinated voltage control are explored in depth. The review highlights how these technologies enable more flexible and cost-effective grid expansion by accommodating more distributed energy resources and reducing infrastructure investment needs but also reveals recurring gaps related to multi-actor coordination, service-based flexibility procurement, and the omission of active network management implementation costs. This work serves as a vital resource for researchers and utility planners in selecting appropriate active network management strategies and optimization techniques for active distribution networks."

    "abstract": "Sea state estimation (SSE) is critical to the safety of maritime transport and the reliability of autonomous ships. The frequency of different sea states varies significantly, leading to uneven data distribution. Existing deep learning methods for SSE typically focus on feature extraction, often using simple splicing and fusion, which can result in cross-domain incoherence and degrade model performance. Addressing sea state classification imbalance is often done through distance-based classifiers (e.g., prototype classifiers), but these can be less sensitive to minority classes, and using few prototypes for a class limits the expression of intra-class variations. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Temporal Spectral Cross Fusion Network (TSCFNet), which extracts temporal and spectral features. These are integrated via an innovative temporal spectral cross fusion module to maximize their complementary advantages. Additionally, we introduce a multi-fusion loss function, including temporal, spectral, and fusion losses, to optimize features across different dimensions. This approach improves the performance for minority classes and captures intra-class differences more effectively, solving the problem of category imbalance. Experimental results show that TSCFNet significantly outperforms baseline methods on two imbalanced sea state datasets and multiple multivariate spatio-temporal datasets."

    "abstract": "Films are key instruments of soft power, culturally influencing globally without coercion, as exemplified by Hollywood’s post-war dominance. However, digitalization has disrupted this dynamic. Traditional data sources no longer accurately reflect the current state of international film trade, which now primarily occurs online. Another challenge is the rise of video streaming, reshaping consumption patterns and undermining the role of theatrical releases. To address these shifts and analyze the evolution of film trade under digital disruption and global competition, we have built a novel dataset on international film trade by compiling cross-border theatrical data from Box Office Mojo and IMDb, covering the period from 2000 to 2021. Applying Social Network Analysis and Gravity models to examine bilateral film trade flows, we investigate their evolution and highlight the transformative impact of streaming and the COVID-19 pandemic. The SNA reveals a highly connected and regionally clustered trade network, with an increasing number of countries integrating into global markets until the pandemic shock. Yet after 2014, we observe a persistent decline in the theatrical consumption of imported films, coinciding with the global expansion of Netflix and other streaming services. Gravity estimates confirm the model’s structural predictions and show diminishing geographic and religious barriers, alongside a rising importance of language proximity as more countries with varied languages begin producing and exporting films. These patterns suggest greater global diversification of film influence. At the same time, the rising relative cost of international versus domestic trade indicates the emergence of government regulations."

However, detecting novel classes with existing methods often requires time-consuming model retraining. Moreover, the detection performance of new models for base classes may decrease. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a new few-shot object detection model, which can efficiently detect the novel classes introduced without fine-tuning the model. This model enables simultaneous detection of both novel and base classes, effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting. The model incorporates a base class detector, augmented with an additional contrastive branch to extract class representation information. This decouples object localization and classification, leading to a marked improvement in the model’s generalization performance for novel classes. In addition, we investigate the effectiveness of self-supervised and supervised contrastive losses for class-specific encodings in our framework."

    "abstract": "As vehicle automation levels rise, future automated driving systems can enable drivers to engage in nondriving-related tasks (NDRTs). However, drivers remain responsible for driving safety. In the case of an automated vehicle failure, a driver must disengage from their NDRTs and take control of the vehicle. When fully engaged in NDRTs during Level 3 automation, NDRTs can compete for the resources for driving tasks, thereby depriving cognitive and physical readiness. This study investigated how compromised driver readiness affected takeover performance in situations with varying urgency levels. A simulated driving experiment was conducted with 32 participants in four states of readiness deprivation created through NDRT assignment, and two time budget levels were applied to represent multiple urgency scenarios. First, subjective ratings on readiness deprivation showed that depriving drivers of one form of readiness (i.e., cognitive or physical) adversely affected the other. Furthermore, retaining cognitive readiness may provide greater self-assessed utility. The NDRTs with similar interaction attributes generate comparable readiness deprivation ratings, offering a systematic way to evaluate their impact on takeover. Then, the impact of readiness deprivation on takeover performance varied significantly based on time budgets. With ample time, depriving drivers of physical or full readiness increased takeover time. However, these delayed actions, combined with stable lateral control, suggested a safe takeover strategy aimed at readiness recovery. Conversely, limited time hindered this recovery. Drivers performed takeovers despite impaired readiness, resulting in quicker but often abrupt post-takeover lateral movements. Notably, takeover actions were initiated once both cognitive and physical readiness were achieved, regardless of the time budget."

A centralized trajectory planning problem is first formulated to optimize merging efficiency and safety. To eliminate reliance on a central controller, a distributed solution is developed using ADMM algorithm based on V2X communication, enabling CAVs to collaboratively compute trajectories in parallel by leveraging their onboard computing power. Building on this, a multi-vehicle model predictive control (MPC) problem is proposed to enhance system stability under strict constraints. To solve it efficiently, a Distributed Cooperative Iterative MPC (DCIMPC) method is introduced, which decomposes and reformulates the problem for real-time distributed execution across CAVs. Together, these methods form a mobile edge computing-driven control framework. Simulations and experiments demonstrate significant improvements in computational efficiency and system performance, highlighting the potential of mobile computing in cooperative CAV control."

To tackle this typical inverse problem, state-of-the-art RME methods rely on handcrafted or data-driven structural information of radio maps. However, the former often struggles to model complex radio frequency (RF) environments and the latter requires excessive trainingߞmaking it hard to quickly adapt to <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in situ</i> sensing tasks. This work presents an RME approach based on <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">plug-and-play</i> (PnP) denoising, a technique from computational imaging. The idea is to leverage the observation that the denoising operations of signals like natural images and radio maps are similarߞdespite the nontrivial differences of the signals themselves. Hence, sophisticated denoisers designed for or learned from natural images can be directly employed to assist RME, avoiding using radio map data for training. Unlike conventional PnP methods that operate directly in the data domain, the proposed method exploits the classical spatio-spectral decomposition model of radio maps and proposes an ADMM algorithm that denoises in the latent factor that only represents the spatial domain. This design significantly improves computational efficiency and enhances noise robustness. Theoretical aspects, e.g., recoverability of the complete radio map and convergence of the ADMM algorithm are analyzed. Synthetic and real data experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."

Existing methods often lack experimental validation in realistic sea trials. To overcome these problems, we propose an adaptive robust line-of-sight model predictive control (ARLOS-MPC) scheme integrated with dual-mode artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization. Our approach enhances robustness against kinematic discrepancies and hydrodynamic disturbances under operational constraints. Key innovations include an adaptive Line-of-Sight (LOS) method employing sliding mode concepts with a speed-dependent lookahead distance, a dual-mode predictive control algorithm that incorporates path geometry and environmental disturbances via curvature change rates and dynamic weights, and a collaborative mechanism coupling step size and prediction horizon for synergistic global-local search. Empirical validation through simulations and sea trials under varied conditions shows that ARLOS-MPC reduces path following errors, accelerates convergence, improves robustness, and enhances adaptability, outperforming existing methods in computational efficiency and error reduction."

To address these challenges, we present the Dual Attention Network for MultiObjective Proximal Policy Optimization (DANMO-PPO) model, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework that formulates the FJSP as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Our model employs actor-critic networks with a dual-attention mechanism to prioritize scheduling actions based on operational and machinelevel features.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) that extracts data knowledge while protecting the privacy of multiple clients has achieved remarkable results in distributed privacy-preserving IoT systems, including smart traffic flow monitoring, smart grid load balancing, and so on. Since most data collected from edge devices are unlabeled, unsupervised Federated Clustering (FC) is becoming increasingly popular for exploring pattern knowledge from complex distributed data. However, due to the lack of label guidance, the common Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) issue of clients have greatly challenged FC by posing the following problems: How to fuse pattern knowledge (i.e., cluster distribution) from Non-IID clients; How are the cluster distributions among clients related; and How does this relationship connect with the global knowledge fusion? In this paper, a more tricky but overlooked phenomenon in Non-IID is revealed, which bottlenecks the clustering performance of the existing FC approaches. That is, different clients could fragment a cluster, and accordingly, a more generalized Non-IID concept, i.e., Non-ICD (Non-Independent Completely Distributed), is derived. To tackle the above FC challenges, a new framework named GOLD (Global Oriented Local Distribution Learning) is proposed. GOLD first finely explores the potential incomplete local cluster distributions of clients, then uploads the distribution summarization to the server for global fusion, and finally performs local cluster enhancement under the guidance of the global distribution. Extensive experiments, including significance tests, ablation studies, scalability evaluations, qualitative results, etc., have been conducted to show the superiority of GOLD."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates intelligent decision-making and resource allocation for self-powered sensors with the age of information (AOI) orientation in high-speed railway (HSR) communication networks. The sensors innovatively access the network via non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), thereby alleviating the train’s burden in terms of both energy and communication resources. For the sensors’ energy management and data offloading, we formulate a resource allocation problem aimed at maximizing the data offloading volume within a single base station (BS) while ensuring the average AOI requirement. As a complex cumulative reward problem, directly applying deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for solution is neither elegant nor efficient. Therefore, we propose a convex constrained soft actorcritic (CCSAC) scheme, decomposing the optimization problem into long-term and short-term subproblems. Specifically, at the long-term problem, a DRL-based policy is used to make intelligent decisions on energy variations. In each time slot, the energy variation derived from DRL serves as input to a convex optimization model that determines the optimal resources allocation for that slot. In the simulation section, we compare multiple baseline algorithms and conduct extensive tests under various conditions, including different train speeds, sensor positions, numbers of sensors, and channel estimation error. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the algorithm, and indicate the important trade-off between the volume of data transmission and AOI in HSR scenarios."

This study presents a reproducible peer-to-peer energy trading system that integrates a network-constrained market with permissioned blockchain settlement. The market solves a convex welfare program with linearized power-flow limits and recovers nodal prices from dual variables to match bids and offers and determine clear quantities. Settlement uses Hyperledger Fabric via the Gateway API, including proposal endorsement, ordering, validation, and commit notifications. Meter evidence is hashed and, when necessary, stored with private data collections. A co-simulation harness links MATLAB/Simulink and MATPOWER for feeder dynamics and price formation with chaincode and client logic for settlement. Three case studies are evaluated: an urban microgrid, a suburban microgrid, and a mobile electric-vehicle swarm. An Ethereum testnet serves as a public-chain baseline. In the testbed, a tuned Fabric configuration sustained approximately 1.6 to 1.7 thousand transactions per second with 99th-percentile submit-to-commit latency near one second and full deadline compliance at a one-second clearing cadence. Energy delivery accuracy remained tight, Multi-Version Concurrency Control conflicts were low, and dynamic nodal prices reduced EV charging cost relative to a flat tariff while signaling congestion through predictable rent patterns. The contribution is a deployable blueprint that connects network economics to verifiable settlement, with an open repository, benchmarking artefacts, and practical targets for endorsement width, block size, and timeouts, and clear pathways to field trials, stochastic and robust clearing, zero-knowledge meter proofs, and city-scale deployment."

However, the calculation of magnetic noise inside a single-ended open magnetic shielding cylinder (MSC) lacks an accurate magnetic noise model. This paper analyzes and reconstructs the magnetic noise model (R-MN model) based on the variable-parameter magnetic loss separation model to address this issue. By incorporating appropriate penalty terms into the objective function, the variable-parameter magnetic loss separation model achieves high-precision loss separation utilizing the Artificial Hummingbird Algorithm. Compared with the conventional magnetic noise calculation method, the proposed R-MN model can reduce the root mean square error of noise prediction by 96.8%. The permalloy-nanocrystalline MSC composite structure designed based on the R-MN-model reduces the intrinsic average magnetic noise of the conventional MSC within the frequency range of 1-40 Hz from 11.77 fT/Hz¹ᐟ² to 4.41 fT/Hz¹ᐟ². This study provides theoretical foundations and technical support for designing low-noise, large-scale, and asymmetrically structured magnetic shielding devices."

    "abstract": "Throughput values are closer to the required values of some current wireless systems, and free-space optics (FSO) has several promising applications in scenarios where high bandwidth demand necessitates a low-cost electronic warfare (EW) strategy. The influence of atmospheric turbulence, weather variability, and pointing errors results in severe impairment. Conventional adaptive modulation schemes (most of which are rule-based or based on shallow learning) may not adapt well to variable and nonlinear channel conditions. In this paper, we introduce a new adaptive modulation scheme that uses a mix of deep learning techniques, including CNNs, LSTM units, and an attention mechanism, to classify real time modulation schemes in free-space-optical (FSO) communication networks. The model captures the spatiotemporal features of received optical signals and dynamically depicts modulation formats based on the channel states. Simulation results demonstrate a classification accuracy performance of 96.3%, a Bit Error Rate (BER) reduction rate exceeding 30% compared to the fixed scheme, and a maximum average spectral efficiency gain of 45% even under the worst scenarios. Furthermore, with an adaptation latency of ~48ms, the proposed system enables real-time service in dynamic and mobile environments. The investigation on the attention maps also demonstrates the explainability and multi-reasoning properties of our model. This hybrid architecture is a scalable and reconfigurable paradigm for the future optical wireless communications systems deployed in harsh conditions such as UAV channels, smart environments including cities, and inter-satellite communication links."

However, most existing approaches treat sarcasm as a single phenomenon and ignore the linguistic distinction between illocutionary, embedded, and propositional sarcasm, each of which relies on different contextual and emotional cues. In this work, we propose a type-aware multimodal framework that explicitly models these three sarcasm types by training dedicated representations for each and combining them within a unified architecture. To encourage the learning of emotionally informative features, we incorporate explicit and implicit emotion prediction as auxiliary regularization tasks in a multitask learning setting. Experiments on the multimodal sarcasm dataset MUStARD++ show that our system achieves an F1 score of 82.65% in sarcasm detection. These results demonstrate that type-specific modeling improves multimodal sarcasm detection."

    "abstract": "Delayed treatment of infantile retinal disease can reduce its effectiveness and may cause severe and irreversible damage. Automated diagnosis of infant retinal diseases faces challenges including subtle early lesions, diverse clinical phenotypes, imaging variations, and imbalanced data. To address these, which cannot be well addressed by existing general foundation models, we propose structure-aware bidirectional proxy interaction network (SABPI-Net) in a universal learning framework. SABPI-Net incorporates a high-frequency mapping branch, and employs a proposed proxy interaction attention module to enable effective interaction between its trunk feature encoding branch and the high-frequency mapping branch, thereby facilitating enhanced perception of retinal detail structures. Domain-agnostic embedding space self-matching, guided by a memory-bank low-frequency component replacement strategy, promotes domain-invariant learning and consistent model performance under diverse image styles. Finally, the tail-aware feature fusion strategy for fine-tuning further enhances the model’s diagnostic sensitivity to tailed diseases. In this study, three classification tasks related to infant retinal diseases are implemented on the largest clinical infant retina dataset to date, covering 19 infant retinal diseases or normal conditions. SABPI-Net achieves superior performance compared to 13 SOTA methods, with 95.32% accuracy on mainstream clinical tasks, 73.58% on ROP five-stage classification, and 84.25% on multi-disease classification, representing improvements of 1.57%, 1.88%, and 4.71% respectively over the best competing methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of SABPI-Net in diagnosing infant retinal diseases."

    "abstract": "The 2-D smoothing (TDS) algorithm is a powerful tool for smoothing and filtering 2-D sequences, serving a crucial role in tasks such as image processing and filtering. Despite its significance, the theoretical properties of the TDS algorithm have not been thoroughly explored in the current literature. In this article, we present a comprehensive analysis of the TDS algorithm, elucidating its mathematical properties and proposing innovative models for its application in image processing. First, we provide an equivalent description of the TDS algorithm and demonstrate that the trend sequence makes the loss function reach the global minimum. Regarding the convergence of the TDS algorithm, we demonstrate the convergence of both trend and fluctuation sequences. Specifically, as the global smoothing parameter tends to infinity, both sequences converge to a deterministic sequence that is independent of the global smoothing parameter. In this case, the TDS algorithm becomes equivalent to computing the trend sequence via the least squares method (LSM). Subsequently, we reveal the smoothing mechanism of the TDS algorithm, which attenuates the energy of the original sequence in the transform domain. Furthermore, we show that the forward transform kernel of the TDS algorithm is a separable orthogonal transform. In addition, we explore the intrinsic relationship between the trend and fluctuation sequences. Notably, an insightful result is that the fluctuation sequence is the trend sequence of the sequence obtained by applying the characteristic lag operator polynomial to the original sequence. Building on these insights, we propose several application scenarios and models for the TDS algorithm in image processing, such as image smoothing, high-frequency extraction, edge detection, and enhancement. To validate the effectiveness of the TDS algorithm, we present numerical simulations and image processing experiments, which demonstrate the correctness of the proposed theoretical framework and the superior performance of TDS in 2-D filtering tasks. This work lays a solid theoretical foundation for the practical application of the TDS algorithm, offering novel methodologies and insights for image processing, 2-D filtering, wireless communication, and computer vision."

To address this issue, this work formulates a problem to maximize energy efficiency (EE) subject to constraints on transmit power, common rate, and sensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Given the non-convex nature of the optimization problem, the generalized Rayleigh quotient is employed to optimize echo beamforming, while the successive convex approximation (SCA) method with penalty terms are designed to jointly optimize active beamforming and common rate. Finally, the numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate the superiority of the RSMA-assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system in terms of EE."

Meanwhile, Air bubbles may occur as a typical defect in power transformer oil under the effect of thermal stress or the local electrical field. These bubbles are subject to exposure to a high electric field, and this will in turn influence the pre-breakdown phenomena. To evaluate the impact of bubble on streamer propagation, based on electro-hydrodynamic model, a numerical model of natural ester insulating oil with air bubbles is constructed by introducing plasma chemical reaction into the model. The model takes into account the ionization process of gas molecules inside bubbles, laying the foundation for studying bubble-triggered streamer discharges. In addition, Finite element method was used to simulate the streamer discharge in natural ester insulating oil containing bubbles, and the influence of bubble size on the streamer branching behavior was analyzed. Simulating results show that the streamer propagation is dependent on the bubble size, especially the interface contact position between the bubble and the natural ester insulating oil."

    "abstract": "Box-free model watermarking has gained significant attention in deep neural network (DNN) intellectual property protection due to its model-agnostic nature and its ability to flexibly manage high-entropy image outputs from generative models. Typically operating in a black-box manner, it employs an encoder-decoder framework for watermark embedding and extraction. While existing research has focused primarily on the encoders for the robustness to resist various attacks, the decoders have been largely overlooked, leading to attacks against the watermark. In this paper, we identify one such attack against the decoder, where query responses are utilized to obtain backpropagated gradients to train a watermark remover. To address this issue, we propose Decoder Gradient Shields (DGSs), a family of defense mechanisms, including DGS at the output (DGS-O), at the input (DGS-I), and in the layers (DGS-L) of the decoder, with a closed-form solution for DGS-O and provable performance for all DGS. Leveraging the joint design of reorienting and rescaling of the gradients from watermark channel gradient leaking queries, the proposed DGSs effectively prevent the watermark remover from achieving training convergence to the desired low-loss value, while preserving image quality of the decoder output. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DGSs in diverse application scenarios. Our experimental results on deraining and image generation tasks with the state-of-the-art box-free watermarking show that our DGSs achieve a defense success rate of 100% under all settings."

    "abstract": "Radar signal deinterleaving is a critical task in radar signal reconnaissance. Existing methods face challenges in effectively incorporating high-dimensional parameters such as the correlation parameter into end-to-end neural networks. This paper proposes a method termed “progressive correlation-integrated deinterleaving” (PCID), which is capable of processing a 133-dimensional input comprising both conventional pulse descriptor word (PDW) parameters and high-dimensional correlation parameters. PCID first constructs a correlation matrix by measuring the similarity between each pulse and its temporal neighbors, thereby introducing correlation information that captures coherent processing interval (CPI) patterns into the network. To address the high dimensionality of the correlation matrix, we decompose it into short-range and long-range components, and progressively integrate them into different stages of a convolutional baseline, aligned with its expanding receptive fields. In addition, instead of direct concatenation or addition, we introduce correlation-guided feature transformation blocks, which adaptively modulate PDW-based features using correlation-based context. Experimental results demonstrate that PCID outperforms both traditional approaches and other deep learning-based methods in deinterleaving performance, and simultaneously maintains competitive computational efficiency."

However, existing information granule-based methods suffer from multiple limitations, including the loss of scale information and the neglect of nonlinear trends and magnitude information, which compromise prediction quality. To address these issues, this article proposes an information granule-based time series prediction method by synergizing multiscale and multitype information granulations. Firstly, an adaptive multiscale sequence generation method is designed to generate the multiscale subsequences, which provide the multiscale views of time series. Then, the dual-mode granulation mechanism integrating magnitude-type and trend-type information granulations is proposed to comprehensively exploit linear trends, non-linear trends, and magnitude information of time series. Thirdly, the cross-scale information granule fusion is designed to model the inherent interrelationships between multiscale information granules, which can promote the collaboration across different-scale information granules. Finally, multitype information granules are synergized to perform prediction, and the prediction process also benefits from the fused multiscale information. Experiments on small, medium, and large size time series datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods."

Although traditional node-classification-based anomaly detection techniques can be applied to this task, these approaches often exhibit two key limitations: (1) insufficient consideration of asset fluctuations, resulting in unsatisfactory accuracy; and (2) scalability challenges, making them unsuitable for large-scale financial graphs. To address these issues, we propose RiskGuard, a novel framework for account risk detection that integrates auxiliary asset prediction and gradient-based sampling. First, we introduce an auxiliary asset prediction paradigm to capture the critical influence of asset fluctuations on account risk. Rather than solely predicting account risk, our unified model employs a <underline xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">T</u>emporal-<underline xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">A</u>ttention <underline xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Net</u> (TANet) to jointly predict asset fluctuations and account risk. This auxiliary task enables the model to learn fluctuation-aware asset representations, significantly enhancing prediction accuracy. To overcome scalability challenges, we design GLUE, an online graph sampler leveraging gradient entropy. GLUE  dynamically adjusts sampling weights based on model gradients and graph structure, prioritizing high-entropy nodes in the neighborhood for improved efficiency. Extensive experiments on five financial datasets demonstrate that RiskGuard  outperforms existing techniques in accuracy while achieving high efficiency in processing large financial graphs."

Our results reveal distinct neural signatures associated with higher prompt engineering literacy, including increased functional connectivity in brain regions such as the left middle temporal gyrus and the left frontal pole, as well as altered powerfrequency dynamics in key cognitive networks. These findings offer initial insights into the neurobiological basis of prompt engineering proficiency. We discuss the implications of these neurocognitive markers in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. If not detected promptly, it can lead to serious or even fatal consequences. Traditionally, epileptic seizure detection relies on brain signals such as electroencephalograms (EEGs). While effective, EEG acquisition typically requires non-invasive scalp-mounted electrodes, which limit patient mobility and necessitate a controlled clinical environment. In contrast, electrocardiograms (ECGs) present a promising alternative due to their ease of acquisition, portability, and compatibility with wearable devices. Leveraging ECG signals-either independently or in combination with brain signals offers significant potential for real-time, continuous monitoring, which is critical for timely intervention. This paper investigates the synchrony between the ECG-based model and the EEG-based model, aiming to study the feasibility of using ECG as an alternative method for seizure detection. Using Bland Altman analysis, the results indicate that although EEG provides higher discriminative power, ECG yields promising and comparable performance, highlighting its potential for wearable seizure monitoring. The results are statistically significant according to the t-test."

Concretely, we utilize a Dynamic IoU-Centric Slicing-based Data Augmentation (DICSA) strategy to prioritize high-IoU regions during training. The strategy effectively eliminates redundant background information and significantly accelerates model convergence. Additionally, the Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa) encodes bounding box annotations into semantic embedding, which are fused with image features via a transformer to generate multimodal representations for small object recognition. The knowledge distillation is utilized to transfer capabilities from the multimodal teacher model to a lightweight multimodal student model, reducing parameter scale and improving inference speed. During fine-tuning of the single-modal student model, the transformer encoder is frozen, and a lightweight feature pyramid integrated with Pixel-Shuffle and hierarchical detection heads is incorporated, ensuring robust performance even without textual input. Experimental results compared with other methods demonstrate the effectiveness and advancement of MDADet, achieving 81.07% mAP on DOTA 1.0, 86.76% on VEDAI, 73.55% on DIOR and 97.61% classification accuracy on NWPU VHR-10, with a model size of only 37.8M parameters."

    "abstract": "The growing demand for compact and reliable renewable energy systems has intensified research into Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generators (PMSGs) for low-speed applications. This study presents the integration and experimental validation of an S-shaped Interior Embedded Double Stator Generator (S-shaped IEDSG) combined with a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) controller and a Battery Management System (BMS). A comparative experimental investigation was conducted using three coil configurations, namely inner stator, outer stator, and double stator, to evaluate their charging thresholds, current outputs, and charging durations under different operating speeds. The inner stator produced the highest peak charging power of 263 W but required a higher operating speed of 650 rpm to begin charging. The outer stator started charging at a lower speed of 150 rpm but exhibited lower current and longer charging time exceeding 500 minutes. The double stator configuration demonstrated balanced performance by combining early charging initiation, sustained high power output of about 250 W, and shorter total charging time of less than 400 minutes. These findings confirm that integrating the S-shaped IEDSG with the MPPT controller and BMS enhances charging performance and stability, establishing its potential as a compact and reliable solution for small-scale renewable energy systems such as pico-hydro and wind power generation."

    "abstract": "Active distribution networks (ADNs) exhibit characteristics such as topological flexibility and bidirectional power flow, which distinguish them from traditional distribution networks (DNs). These intrinsic characteristics present significant challenges to traditional single-ended protection schemes deployed in conventional DNs. Boundary protection, which is based on the coordination between the relay on one side of the line and the boundary element at the opposite terminal, can achieve rapid fault detection across the entire line utilizing exclusively local information, thereby offering a promising solution for addressing the protection challenges in ADNs. In this paper, a method for constructing a resonant-type boundary element (RBE) is proposed, based on the analysis of the performance of various boundary element types. Furthermore, the fault characteristics for internal and external faults are analyzed. Within the specified blocking frequency band (BFB) of the RBE, the voltage during an internal fault exhibits significantly higher magnitudes compared to those during external faults. Based on this distinction, a voltage energy criterion incorporating fault phase angle correction is subsequently proposed. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed protection method, in conjunction with the designed RBE, can accurately and rapidly distinguish internal and external faults."

Experimental results validate continuous frequency tuning from 1.85 to 2.44 GHz. Over this tuning range, the system generates an average output power of approximately 120 MW, corresponding to an average efficiency of 22%. A notable achievement is the realized polarization tunability of radiated mode without the use of a separate polarizer. Furthermore, the total weight of the entire HPM system is constrained to below 30 kg, which significantly enhances the mobility and flexibility for diverse applications."

The modified Π-shaped stubs on the microstrip feedlines generate the radiation null on the left side of the passband, while the MTS generates the radiation null on the right side of the passband. Thus, the proposed DPFA realizes an out-of-band suppression level of more than 23 dB and a wide out-of-band suppression up to 2.2<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">f</i><sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>. Without employing differential feeding, the proposed DPFA attains isolation levels greater than 32 dB and cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) above 25 dB, thereby ensuring robust polarization diversity performance. Furthermore, the antenna offers a wide impedance bandwidth (IBW) of 20.41% (3.30–4.05 GHz), covering n78 spectrum band.

    "abstract": "To address the challenges of ensuring communication security for legitimate users in the presence of eavesdroppers and the limited detection performance for extended targets in an Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) system, this paper proposes a secure waveform design method for a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) ISAC system, under a stochastic Target Impulse Response (TIR) model. Firstly, To prevent confidential information in ISAC systems from being intercepted by unauthorized users, transmit waveforms and artificial noise(AN) are designed to maximize the sum secrecy rate of all communication users while ensuring individual user quality of service. Secondly, recognizing that accurate TIR information is unavailable in the practical detection environment, the stochastic TIR model is established under the assumption that prior errors follow a complex Gaussian distribution, and the robust detection probability of the extended target under the stochastic TIR is employed as a constraint to ensure the system’s detection performance. To solve this non-convex mixed max-min fractional programming(FP) problem, the Decomposition-Based Large Deviation Inequality (DBLDI) is adopted to convert the robust detection probability constraint into a convex constraint. By incorporating quadratic transform, inverse quadratic transform, and Lagrangian Dual Transform, a FP solution approach is developed to convert the mixed max-min FP problem into a convex problem. Finally, semidefinite optimization and alternating optimization methods are employed to iteratively optimize the transmit waveform, AN, and the receive filter. Additionally, the convergence and complexity analysis of the proposed method are provided. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can guarantee the communication security of multiple legitimate users in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. Meanwhile, it can also meet the stable detection requirements of extended targets, and the solution speed is nearly twice higher compared with the BTI method."

This study investigates the packaging performance of a VCSEL array integrated onto silicon interposers using flip-chip bonding with Au bumps under various bonding conditions. Emphasis is placed on the effects of bump flattening and alignment accuracy on bonding quality and overall device performance. Au bumps with flattened surfaces and optimized misalignment were analyzed through SEM imaging, luminescence testing, and L-I-V (Light–Current–Voltage) characterization. Results show that flattening Au bumps and a small misalignment between the two Au bumps significantly improve surface planarity and enhance both electrical and optical performance. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulations are also conducted to compare with experimental results and provide further insight into stress distribution and structural behavior. The findings underscore the importance of bump flattening and precise alignment in ensuring mechanical reliability and achieving optimal performance in VCSEL-based optical interconnects for next-generation CPO systems."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of low-rank tensor learning, where only a few of training samples are observed and the underlying tensor has a low-rank structure. The existing methods are based on the sum of nuclear norms of unfolding matrices of a tensor, which may be suboptimal. In order to explore the low-rankness of the underlying tensor effectively, we propose a nonconvex model based on transformed tensor nuclear norm for low-rank tensor learning. Specifically, a family of nonconvex functions are employed onto the singular values of all frontal slices of a tensor in the transformed domain to characterize the low-rankness of the underlying tensor. An error bound between the stationary point of the nonconvex model and the underlying tensor is established under restricted strong convexity on the loss function (such as least squares loss and logistic regression) and suitable regularity conditions on the nonconvex penalty function. By reformulating the nonconvex function into the difference of two convex functions, a proximal majorization-minimization (PMM) algorithm is designed to solve the resulting model. Then the global convergence and convergence rate of PMM are established under very mild conditions. Numerical experiments are conducted on tensor completion and binary classification to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over other state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) aims to identify the spatio-temporal changes of land cover, providing critical support for multi-disciplinary applications (e.g., environmental monitoring, disaster assessment, and climate change studies). Existing methods focus either on extracting features from localized patches, or pursue processing entire images holistically, which leads to the cross temporal feature matching deviation and exhibiting sensitivity to radiometric and geometric noise. Following the above issues, we propose a dual-module collaboration guided hierarchical adaptive aggregation framework, namely HA2F, which consists of dynamic hierarchical feature calibration module (DHFCM) and noise-adaptive feature refinement module (NAFRM). The former dynamically fuses adjacent-level features through perceptual feature selection, suppressing irrelevant discrepancies to address multi-temporal feature alignment deviations. The NAFRM utilizes the dual feature selection mechanism to highlight the change sensitive regions and generate spatial masks, suppressing the interference of irrelevant regions or shadows. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed HA2F, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD datasets, surpassing existing comparative methods in terms of both precision metrics and computational efficiency. In addition, ablation experiments show that DHFCM and NAFRM are effective."

Our platform features modular, multi-degree-of-freedom pneumatic displays, where different signal types – such as pressure, frequency, and contact area – can be activated or combined using fluidic logic circuits. These circuits simplify control by reducing reliance on specialized electronics and enabling coordinated actuation of multiple haptic elements through a compact set of inputs. Our approach allows rapid reconfiguration of haptic signal rendering through hardware-level logic switching, without rewriting code. Personalization of the haptic interface is achieved through the combination of modular hardware and software-driven signal selection. To determine which display configurations will be most effective, we model haptic communication as a signal transmission problem, where an agent must convey latent information to the user. We formulate the optimization problem to identify the haptic hardware setup that maximizes the information transfer between the intended message and the user's interpretation, accounting for individual differences in sensitivity, preferences, and perceptual salience. We evaluate this framework through user studies where participants interact with reconfigurable displays under different signal combinations. Our findings support the role of modularity and personalization in creating multimodal haptic interfaces and advance the development of reconfigurable systems that adapt with users in dynamic human-machine interaction contexts."

    "abstract": "The proliferation of low-cost, portable sensors has made wearable human activity recognition (HAR) a cornerstone for real-time health monitoring and behavior analysis. However, deploying accurate yet lightweight deep learning models on resource-constrained wearable devices poses a significant challenge for on-device activity recognition. While channel pruning is a common solution to accelerate deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), existing works often require specialized implementations or pre-trained models, which potentially degrade performance by simply removing an entire channel, limiting their ability to handle complex multimodal sensor inputs. Moreover, lightweight CNN design, particularly the heavy use of 1×1 convolution layers for channel squeezing, remain inefficient for sensor-based HAR, which consume resources without expanding the receptive field due to their pointwise nature. To address these issues, we propose a novel dynamic channel sampling module, Select-and-Fuse (SaF), specifically designed for sensor-based HAR. SaF divides channels into subsets and performs a dynamic, input-dependent selection from them, with the picking decision being made per-time-step based on the input sensor signal activations, allowing for fine-grained feature adaptation to multi-modal sensor signals. While integrated into compact backbones, SaF significantly reduces model size and inference latency while maintaining high accuracy. Extensive evaluations on public UCI-HAR, OPPORTUNITY, WISDM, and UniMiB-SHAR benchmarks confirm a favorable performance-cost trade-off. Crucially, we measure actual inference latency on a Raspberry Pi, proving its practicality for resource-constrained HAR applications. Code will be released."

    "abstract": "An electromagnetic actuator driven by a power electronics converter is a mature technology in industry. However, it faces reliability issues due to the failure of power electronics devices in the drive. Post-failure system often retains a substantial amount of kinetic energy, necessitating the implementation of online diagnosis and fault-tolerant control, especially in high-speed rotating machinery and critical non-interruptible applications. Typically, the recovery of regular motor drives after a failure involves two methods: hardware backup and model-based current reallocation. However, for actuators with ferromagnetic targets, there is inherent fault-tolerant potential that offers greater flexibility, stronger robustness. These ferromagnetic targets are driven by Maxwell force, independent of the current direction. The physical nature of Maxwell force in macro and micro scopes have been explored in this article. Notably, the characteristics of power electronics legs can accommodate different current directions. Leveraging this consistent symmetry between Maxwell force and legs, we use switched reluctance machine (SRM), which generates tangential forces, and active magnetic bearing (AMB), which generates radial suspension forces, as examples to analyze the strategy. Moreover, its universality helps to be applied to various power electronics topologies and aligns well with existing control framework. The proposed method fully exploits the fault tolerance potential, significantly enhancing system reliability."

    "abstract": "Named Data Networking (NDN) is an evolution of IP networks with an architecture based on content names and centered around the consumer. It leverages inherent features such as in-network caching and Interest aggregation to optimize resource utilization. As NDN is increasingly applied in diverse domains, such as vehicular networks (VANETs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and e-health, support for Quality of Service (QoS) becomes critical to ensure the timely and prioritized delivery of Data, especially for real-time and mission-critical applications. However, conventional QoS mechanisms designed for IP networks are unsuitable for NDN due to fundamental differences in architecture: IP is session-based and end-to-end, whereas NDN is distributed, opportunistic, and content-oriented. To address this gap, we propose FQS-NDN, a novel Frequency-based QoS Strategy for NDN that prioritizes Interest and Data packets based on their generation and reception frequency. Our approach extends the default NDN forwarding behavior by introducing dynamic prioritization mechanisms that improve responsiveness and reduce latency in real-time scenarios. Preliminary evaluations with the ndnSIM simulator demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in improving service differentiation and forwarding efficiency."

Subsequently, a modified Dijkstra’s algorithm computes optimal routing paths, incorporating a multi-objective optimization that considers QoS parameters such as security (0.2), delay (0.2), energy (0.15), and packet loss (0.15), etc. Experimental simulations on a $\\mathbf{2 5}$-node MANET testbed substantiated the approach’s efficacy. Results indicate that SecureMANET successfully bypasses attack-compromised network segments while maintaining acceptable performance (average delay: 31.61 ms, average hop count: 1.5). Comparative analysis demonstrates that our algorithm reduces security threats by up to 50% with minimal degradation in network efficiency. The framework’s modular design offers flexibility across diverse MANET deployments, positioning SecureMANET as a promising solution for securing resource-constrained wireless networks."

    "abstract": "With the growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in sensitive sectors such as healthcare and finance, protecting user privacy during data processing has become paramount. One promising approach is Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), which offers a viable solution by allowing computations to be performed directly on encrypted data, thus safeguarding sensitive information. In this study, we investigate the practical application of the Cheon Kim Kim Song (CKKS) FHE scheme to perform inference with various machine learning models for heart disease detection. We evaluated five models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and a simple Neural Network, across multiple heart disease datasets. Our analysis compares their performance on both standard (plain-text) and encrypted data, using metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results demonstrate that encrypted models deliver predictive accuracy comparable to their standard counterparts, confirming the viability of privacypreserving inference with FHE despite the expected increase in computational time. Furthermore, our findings highlight up to $100 \\%$ consistency between the predictions made on encrypted and plain-text inputs."

    "abstract": "Accurate numerical simulation of the viscoelastic wave equation is essential for studying anelastic seismic wave propagation and underpins both migration and full-waveform inversion techniques. Free surfaces introduce complex wave phenomena that must be properly represented in seismic modeling. We propose a hybrid scheme that combines a subdomain Chebyshev spectral method with finite-difference discretization in a curvilinear coordinate system. Local Chebyshev transforms and global spline interpolations enable the grid conforms exactly to the free surface and subsurface interfaces. Spatial derivatives are evaluated using Chebyshev points in the horizontal direction and finite-difference stencils in the vertical direction. The viscoelastic effect introduced by Generalized Maxwell Body can be calculated by recursive convolution method and the free surface boundary condition is realized by non-central finite difference scheme in the framework of the hybrid numerical method. For absorbing boundary, a Q-factor reduction scheme is improved to complement generalized stiffness reduction method of the viscoelastic media in the time domain. The proposed approach retains the high accuracy of spectral methods while permitting straightforward finite-difference treatment of the free-surface boundary condition. Numerical experiments on both homogeneous and heterogeneous models confirm the correctness and robustness of the proposed method."

Here, we propose <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">YODA</i> (You Only Denoise once – or Average), a 2.5D diffusion-based framework for medical image translation (MIT).

To mitigate this, we draw and average multiple samples, akin to physical signal averaging.

We additionally propose regression sampling <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">YODA</i>, which retains the initial DM prediction and omits iterative refinement to produce noise-free images in a single step.

This paper investigates an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled FAS for multi-target wireless sensing in low-altitude wireless consumer networks (LAWCNs) for achieving the low-altitude economy (LAE) missions. We formulate an optimization problem aimed at minimizing the average Cramér–Rao bound (CRB) for multiple target estimations. To tackle this non-convex problem, an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed, which jointly optimizes the UAV trajectory, the antenna position of the transmit fluid antennas (FAs) and the receive FAs, and the transmit beamforming at the UAV. Simulation results demonstrate significant performance improvements in estimation accuracy and sensing reliability compared to conventional schemes, e.g., the fixed position antenna scheme. The proposed system achieves enhanced sensing performance through adaptive trajectory design and beamforming, alongside effective interference suppression via the flexible FAS antenna repositioning, underscoring its practical potential for precision sensing in the UAV-enabled LAWCNs."

    "abstract": "Accurately identifying the root causes of alarm floods is essential for safe and efficient operations of industrial processes. While similarity analysis methods have been developed for analyzing and clustering alarm floods, they are insufficient to pinpoint root causes. Thus, recent studies have attempted to train classification models to identify alarm flood root causes usually based on substantial amounts of labeled training data, which is impractical and costly in real-world scenarios. Accordingly, this article proposes a semisupervised method named alarm dual-graph fusion-based manifold regularization for root-cause identification (RCI) of industrial alarm floods, which can achieve improved performance by utilizing both limited labeled alarm flood sequences and substantial unlabeled sequences. The contributions are as follows: first, a local sequence alignment-based graph construction method is proposed to construct an undirected graph for historical alarm flood sequences; second, a modified manifold regularization method based on dual-graph Laplacian fusion is developed for semisupervised alarm flood RCI modeling; third, an online RCI strategy is devised for recognition of root causes of incoming alarm flood sequences. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by a case study with alarm data generated by the public vinyl acetate monomer process simulation model."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a fixed-time synchronized reinforcement learning-based control (pFxT-SRLC) framework for spacecraft attitude systems that simultaneously addresses four critical challenges: predetermined convergence time guarantees, synchronized multi-axis coordination, energy optimization, and practical constraint handling. Our integrated framework combines a fixed-time super-twisting observer with adaptive switching strategy, a practical fixed-time synchronized controller with singularity avoidance, and an actor-critic reinforcement learning structure for near-optimal energy performance. The proposed method ensures all state variables converge to desired neighborhoods simultaneously within predetermined time bounds independent of initial conditions, while the constrained learning algorithm maintains stability throughout the optimization process. A second-order command filter handles input saturation constraints and reduces control chattering for practical implementation. Theoretical analysis proves fixed-time synchronized stability with explicit convergence time bounds, and establishes energy optimality through Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman approximation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed pFxT-SRLC achieves comparable tracking accuracy to conventional fixed-time methods while reducing energy consumption and generating significantly smoother control signals."

The primary challenges lie in handling intermittent neighboring state information caused by event-triggered communication. To address this limitation, a smooth auxiliary function is designed to ensure a smooth transition to the triggered value within each triggering interval by updating the maximum state rate. The first-order distributed estimator incorporating the smooth function is directly applied to the backstepping framework for rotational dynamics, guaranteeing the differentiability of the virtual control law. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, the proposed estimator features a lower order and exhibits stronger adaptability to track leader UAV's speed and attitude angles that are either aperiodic or non-zero constant. Additionally, a sign-independent compensation mechanism enhances control accuracy. The proposed method is validated through semi-physical simulation."

    "abstract": "Understanding the impact of environmental disturbances on radar micro-Doppler signatures is critical for the reliable detection, classification, and tracking of small aerial targets such as quadcopters. In real-world operations, wind-induced motion is inevitable and can distort the ideal micro-Doppler signatures typically generated through simulations, as collecting high-quality real-world radar returns is often challenging due to logistical and safety constraints. This study investigates the influence of wind-like perturbations on the radar return from a hovering quadcopter by modeling its translational velocity as an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic process—a physically plausible representation of temporally correlated wind-induced drift. Through comparative analysis of clean (ideal hovering) and wind-induced (non-ideal) cases, we observe significant deviations in spectral characteristics, including energy broadening and raised spectral floors in the power spectral density (PSD), degradation of harmonic structures in scalograms and in persistence spectrums, and increased spectral centroid and spectral spread fluctuations over time. These findings demonstrate that even moderate wind-induced drift can introduce ambiguity in signature-based drone classification systems. By providing a controlled yet realistic simulation framework for wind effects, this work offers key insights into the design of robust radar-based drone monitoring systems intended for deployment in complex, real-world environments."

    "abstract": "Optimizing a fractional form over the unimodular vector set arises in radar waveform design, various active sensing scenarios and communication applications, which is usually NP-hard. In this paper, an optimization framework is proposed, which guarantees that the objective function converges to the strict local optimum. It employs the Dinkelbach's method and semidefinite programming (SDP) to convert a fractional objective function into a quadratic one, and deal with various nonconvex constraints, respectively. The iterative rank minimization is then introduced to force the rank of SDP variable to be zero, so that the original problem is split into a series of solvable subproblems with polynomial-time complexity. The optimization procedure is applied to joint design of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) waveform and receive filter. The formulation is established by taking the mutual information (MI) between range profile and target scattering characteristics as the objective, subject to high resolution, low sidelobe level, and unimodular constraints. The resultant MI maximization problem is boiled down to fractional unimodular optimization with a complicated mathematical structure. Based on a cyclic maximizer, it is decomposed into a series of subproblems, followed by application of the proposed optimization framework to customize the solving procedure. Finally, numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework."

    "abstract": "Estimation of direction-of-arrival (DOA) is a fundamental problem in array signal processing. The uniform circular array (UCA) is a highly useful array geometry for DOA estimation, especially in electronic warfare (EW), as it possesses useful properties such as complete 360° azimuth coverage and DOA estimation accuracy that is almost invariant with azimuth unlike linear array (LA). In addition, it is well suited for physical installation on complex platforms such as aircraft, ship, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Given the inherent sparsity of the DOA parameter in the azimuth domain, the last decade has seen significant research applying compressed sensing and sparse signal recovery with sparse array geometries. The difference co-array of virtual sensors of the physical array is dense; hence, sparse arrays can provide more accurate DOA estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel sparse array geometry called a concentric coprime uniform circular array (CCUCA) and perform azimuth DOA estimation by employing sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) with the difference co-array. This antenna array geometry is well suited for installation on complex platforms used for surveillance in EW compared to a nested sparse circular array (NSCA). The results of numerical experiments demonstrate the performance of the proposed technique. We also present the design of a novel passive frequency-independent CCUCA simulator, which can be realized using radio-frequency (RF) power dividers and delay lines. This can be used for generating multiple RF signals with appropriate phases for laboratory testing of the DOA estimation system realized using phase-coherent, multichannel RF and digital signal processing (DSP) hardware."

    "abstract": "Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) is a radiological imaging technique used for diagnosing and assessing neurological disorders, including Parkinson’s disease. However, direct SPECT imaging requires the injection of radioactive drugs, posing risks of radiation exposure and allergic reactions associated with invasive procedures. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called the 3D-Cycle Conversion Network. Its aim is to extract 3D MRI features captured by MRI sensors and convert them into synthesized SPECT images, enabling the detection of differences in dopamine neuron activity. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first group to effectively synthesize SPECT while preserving important diagnostic features. Inspired by CycleGAN, this architecture uses a cyclic transformation approach to maintain fundamental medical features and includes specifically designed reconstruction modules for 3D image synthesis. During training, a specially designed loss function guides our framework to enhance the accuracy of SPECT image generation. In experimental results, our framework outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations."

It integrates finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs) using weighted voting, with each model specializing in a specific resume segment to boost accuracy. Building on MLAR [1], MSLEF introduces a segmentaware architecture that leverages field-specific weighting tailored to each resume part, effectively overcoming the limitations of single-model systems by adapting to diverse formats and structures. The framework incorporates Gemini-2.5-Flash LLM as a high-level aggregator for complex sections and utilizes Gemma 9B, LLaMA 3.1 8B, and Phi-4 14B. MSLEF achieves significant improvements in Exact Match (EM), F1 score, BLEU, ROUGE, and Recruitment Similarity (RS) metrics, outperforming the best single model by up to +7 % in RS. Its segment-aware design enhances generalization across varied resume layouts, making it highly adaptable to real-world hiring scenarios while ensuring precise and reliable candidate representation."

To leverage MADRL in building intelligent, resilient, and adaptive IoT systems, this review systematically explores the application of MADRL in IoT, categorizing contributions by application domains, learning architectures, and coordination strategies. We analyze how MADRL enables scalable resource allocation, routing optimization, energy efficiency, and fault detection in complex IoT ecosystems.

With the advancement of machine learning technologies, there is an increasing need for effective autonomous sign language translation systems. However, existing research has often neglected user comfort and accessibility, leading to a limited presence of practical autonomous sign language translation devices in the market. This paper presents the leading design and application difficulties involved with translating lab-tested sign language translation systems into real products and offers potential solutions. Our proposed system architecture is modeled using SysML in yEd, capturing the overall system’s functionality and interaction. Additionally, we test quantized MobileNet CNN models and the OpenFace toolkit and benchmark their performance to popular computer vision solutions in the context of portable sign language translation devices. We aim to create a blueprint for complete portable end-to-end sign language translation systems in the future that can transition into real-life products, as a product that successfully addresses user comfort, pricing, and translation accuracy could substantially improve the lives of millions of deaf and mute users around the world."

However, provenance analysis examines multiple assets collectively, tracing their histories through pairwise relationships. This approach is beneficial in identifying traces of manipulation and understanding the evolution of digital content. In this research, we apply provenance analysis to detect and track malicious users engaged in collusion attacks by analyzing their fingerprinting codes. Specifically, the correlations we consider are not generic media content similarities, but rather statistical and structural relationships between the embedded fingerprinting codes of different multimedia assets. By quantifying these correlations, our method can reliably identify individuals responsible for generating unauthorized copies and distinguish between different collusion strategies. Furthermore, it allows us to classify and estimate the specific type of collusion attack employed, providing deeper insights into the strategies used by attackers, thereby aiding in the development of more robust countermeasures and enhancing the resilience of multimedia security systems."

Training fine-tuned LLMs specifically tuned for recruitment tasks. The proposed framework addresses the limitations of generic LLMs by creating a synthetic dataset that uses a standardized JSON format. This helps ensure consistency and scalability. In addition to the synthetic data set, the resumes were parsed using DeepSeek, a high-parameter LLM. The resumes were parsed into the same structured JSON format and placed in the training set. This will help improve data diversity and realism. Through experimentation, we demonstrate significant improvements in performance metrics, such as exact match, F1 score, BLEU score, ROUGE score, and overall similarity compared to base models and other state-of-the-art LLMs. In particular, the fine-tuned Phi-4 model achieved the highest F1 score of $90.62 \\%$, indicating exceptional precision and recall in recruitment tasks.

This paper presents a session-based detection framework integrating SMOTE-IPF oversampling and XGBoost classification to address temporal context limitations and class imbalance in insider threat datasets. To mitigate the extreme class imbalance characteristic of insider threat datasets, the framework integrates SMOTE-IPF, an advanced oversampling technique that maintains minority class structure while reducing overfitting. The model, trained with a GPU-accelerated XGBoost classifier, achieves notable performance improvements: $50 \\%$ recall for threat instances at the F1-optimal threshold, 99.995 % accuracy for normal activity, and only four false positives. An ROC-AUC of 0.9429 and an F1score of 0.5263 demonstrate the model’s effectiveness in balancing precision and recall. These results indicate the proposed approach can enhance threat identification while maintaining operational feasibility in high-stakes security environments."

    "abstract": "Phishing emails pose a persistent and increasingly sophisticated threat, undermining email security through deceptive tactics designed to exploit both semantic and structural vulnerabilities. Traditional detection methods, often based on isolated analysis of email content or embedded URLs, fail to comprehensively address these evolving attacks. In this paper, we propose a dual-path phishing detection framework that integrates transformer-based natural language processing (NLP) with classical machine learning to jointly analyze email text and embedded URLs. Our approach leverages the complementary strengths of semantic analysis using fine-tuned transformer architectures (e.g., DistilBERT) and structural link analysis via character-level TFIDF vectorization paired with classical classifiers (e.g., Random Forest). Empirical evaluation on representative email and URL datasets demonstrates that this combined approach significantly improves detection accuracy. Specifically, the DistilBERT model achieves a near-optimal balance between accuracy and computational efficiency for textual phishing detection, while Random Forest notably outperforms other classical classifiers in identifying malicious URLs. The modular design allows flexibility for standalone deployment or ensemble integration, facilitating realworld adoption. Collectively, our results highlight the efficacy and practical value of this dual-path approach, establishing a scalable, accurate, and interpretable solution capable of enhancing email security against contemporary phishing threats."

    "abstract": "Recent research has shown that the unrolling network is an effective and efficient method for suppressing interrupted sampling repeater jamming (ISRJ). However, in practice, variability in jamming location and duty cycle often prevents most unrolling networks from achieving satisfactory ISRJ suppression performance. To address this challenge, this article introduces complex-valued fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm network (CV-FISTA-Net), a complex-valued unrolling network inspired by the FISTA method. CV-FISTA-Net replaces the conventional soft-thresholding operator with a complex-valued convolutional neural network (CV-CNN) and a residual learning approach. This enhances training efficiency, signal denoising, and reconstruction fidelity. Furthermore, a random projection augmentation strategy is introduced to diversify the training set, bolstering the network's robustness against variations in ISRJ location and duty cycle. To improve generalization, a transfer learning technique is integrated, ensuring strong jamming suppression performance even with limited training data or under changing conditions, such as varying signal-to-noise ratios. Leveraging the computational efficiency of CV-FISTA-Net, we also propose an effective strategy for joint ISRJ suppression and inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging. Experiments on both simulated and real-measured data validate that CV-FISTA-Net achieves precise and robust ISRJ suppression amidst dynamic changes in jamming location and duty cycle."

The system features a reconfigurable, roof rack-mounted, ventilated log-periodic antenna (DRV-LPA), providing full 360° azimuthal coverage around the vehicle. Beamforming is implemented on the forward (north) and backward (south) sides, with three LTE and three WiFi antennas per side, enabling dynamic directional control of beams. The DRV-LPA electronically steers its beam from 0° to ±30°, based on electric field theory, and is validated through full-wave electromagnetic simulations. System performance was evaluated with two setups: anechoic chamber measurements and field trials in regional Australia. The system supports three beam configurations θ₁ = 0°, θ₂ = ±30°, and θ₃ = +30°, 0°, -30° adapted to communication needs and vehicle orientation. A compact wireless router integrated with the switching module manages continuous data exchange with a remote base station, ensuring stable connectivity and optimized bandwidth. The switching module dynamically activates the appropriate beam based on the vehicle's position relative to the base station. Simulated and measured results show strong agreement in beam direction, gain, VSWR, and overall performance within the roof rack. Field trials confirm the system's robustness and effectiveness in real-world vehicular scenarios, offering a cost-effective, scalable solution for improving vehicle-based connectivity, enabling precision agriculture, and strengthening rural mobility infrastructure."

Many existing approaches to recognizing emotions from speech rely heavily on Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), which capture short-term spectral features but insufficiently represent prosody, long-term dynamics, and tonal nuances that are critical for accurate classification. This study presents an interpretable and computationally efficient framework for recognizing emotions from speech by employing a compact set of fourteen spectral and prosodic acoustic features, including pitch, shimmer, jitter, loudness, harmonic-to-noise ratio (HNR), and measures of temporal variation. Using tree-based ensemble methods, the proposed system achieved its best performance with the XGBoost classifier, reaching an accuracy of 96.79% on the Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS). Statistical validation using the Kruskal–Wallis test and effect size analysis revealed that HNR, mean pitch, and shimmer were the most discriminative predictors of emotional state, thereby providing transparency into the classification process. The system also demonstrated real-time capability with inference times between 201 and 231 milliseconds, confirming that accurate, efficient, and interpretable speech emotion recognition can be achieved without relying solely on deep learning models."

Three key failure scenarios are examined: a loss-of-flow accident (LOFA), a loss-of coolant accident (LOCA) and a loss-of-vacuum accident (LOVA). For each of the accidents, the phenomenology leading to the cable cooling deterioration is first discussed and the qualitative or quantitative evolution of the thermal-hydraulic transient in an unprotected situation is presented. The diagnostics most suited to detect the accident are then identified. This work, the first of its kind, suggests instrumentation to detect the occurrence of the different scenarios to protect the investment associated with the future hybrid power cables. The analysis shows that the loss of flow is easy to detect and the operators can reduce the cable power without any loss of LH<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>. The LOCA is more severe, as it requires fast detection that could be achieved using optic fibers, whereas overpressures and opening of relief valves are difficult to avoid especially for large ruptures. The LOVA is the most severe among the accidents investigated here, as it is difficult to detect without optic fibers."

    "abstract": "Object instance segmentation is a key prerequisite for service robots to perform daily chores in unstructured environments. Traditional supervised learning-based segmentation solutions rely on massive annotated datasets, which are impractical for the wide variety of objects in real-world scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel zero-shot instance segmentation approach (TransZSIS) that enables precise instance segmentation without relying on external semantic embeddings or auxiliary information to address the unseen object instance segmentation (UOIS) problem. First, the RGB and depth images are segmented into irregular patches based on a super-pixel segmentation algorithm to generate a unified segmentation map, and then the comprehensive feature vectors of each patch is extracted and paired. Further, a Transformer-based architecture is introduced to capture the correlation between different patch-pair and the intrinsic characteristics of each patch-pair. To predict patch-pair relationships, TransZSIS uses a four-layer fully connected neural network (FCNN) to classify the transformer-encoded features and refine them with a graph-based processing tactic to achieve object instance segmentation. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that TransZSIS achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art baseline methods. Also, we implement real experiments to verify that our solution can achieve robot grasping by segmenting unseen objects."

Vision-guided editing models, in particular, offer more precise and flexible control over fine-grained garment attributes. However, existing methods are limited to coarse-grained edits and fail to achieve attribute-level manipulation, thereby restricting the flexibility and composability required in fashion customization. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Vision-Guided Fashion Fine-Grained Attribute Editing (VFFAE) framework, which leverages visual references to achieve customized editing of both style and structure in fine-grained garment regions. The VFFAE framework involves three key components: (1) a text-driven fashion fine-grained attribute segmenter that incorporates garment keypoints as spatial priors and applies deformable attention to enhance spatial perception, with CLIP-based multimodal alignment for accurate segmentation; (2) a clothing attribute disentanglement module based on orthogonal subspace projection of CLIP embeddings, enabling zero-shot explicit separation of style and structure attributes; and (3) a conditional diffusion pipeline that leverages disentangled representations of segmented regions to fine-tune a pretrained Stable Diffusion model under classifier-free guidance, enabling controllable attribute editing. Experiments on multiple public datasets show that VFFAE surpasses state-of-the-art methods, and ablation analyses confirm the effectiveness of its segmentation and disentanglement modules, establishing it as a practical solution for high-fidelity attribute-level fashion customization."

    "abstract": "The frame rates of most 3D LIDAR sensors used in intelligent vehicles are substantially lower than current cameras installed in the same vehicle. This research suggests using a mono camera to virtually enhance the frame rate of LIDARs, allowing the more frequent monitoring of dynamic objects in the surroundings that move quickly. As a first step, dynamic object candidates are identified and tracked in the camera frames. Following that, the LIDAR measurement points of these items are found by clustering in the frustums of 2D bounding boxes. Projecting these to the camera and tracking them to the next camera frame can be used to create 3D-2D correspondences between different timesteps. These correspondences between the last LIDAR frame and the actual camera frame are used to solve the PnP (Perspective-n-Point) problem. Finally, the estimated transformations are applied to the previously measured points to generate virtual measurements. With the proposed estimation, if the ego movement is known, not just static object position can be determined at timesteps where camera measurement is available, but positions of dynamic objects as well. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on large public datasets in terms of accuracy and similarity to real measurements."

    "abstract": "Arbitrary-scale video super-resolution (VSR) aims to enhance video resolution at continuous scales and has attracted increasing attention in recent years. However, existing methods typically rely on fixed degradation modes, such as bicubic downsampling, which often fail to handle the complex degradations of real-world videos. Current real-world datasets only cover limited scales (e.g., ×2, ×4) and are insufficient to capture the diverse degradations required for arbitrary-scale VSR. To address this, we present RealArbVSR, the first real-world VSR dataset with both integer and decimal scale factors, providing a wider range of degradation levels. Moreover, to generate continuous degradations beyond the collected scales, we propose the Continuous Degradation Generation Network (CDGN), which synthesizes realistic LR videos with arbitrary degradations. Specifically, we design a Scale-aware Degradation Module (SDM) to adaptively learn scale-specific degradations and an Implicit Filter Module (IFM) that represents spatial-temporal features as a continuous feature domain for arbitrary-scale LR frame generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CDGN trained on RealArbVSR produces high-fidelity LR videos with arbitrary degradations and significantly enhances the performance of VSR models in real-world scenarios. The RealArbVSR dataset and source code will be publicly released for further research."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces an efficient and dual-mode approach to wirelessly charge supercapacitors, as DC power suppliers for IoT devices, via Huygens rectenna. A novel voltage-dependent S-parameter analysis method is developed to maximize the far-field wireless power transfer (WPT) efficiency in supercapacitor-loaded Huygens rectenna systems. Thanks to the high-Q feature of Huygens rectenna, two charging modes, i.e., rapid and float, are realized by simply switching the operating frequency. Moreover, an innovative deep learning-assisted modeling method for supercapacitor is developed to accurately predict the charging time under different input RF powers. Operating within the 915MHz ISM band (902 to 928 MHz), the entire rectenna system is electrically small with the size of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ka</i> = 0.98. Experiment results show the highest average charging efficiency of 50.4% in the rapid charging mode at 904 MHz. Moreover, the frequency switching charging approach eliminates the need for additional charging management circuitry and effectively prevents the overcharging of supercapacitor under float mode. The developed method is further validated through a practical IoT sensor system. The system charges a 0.1 F supercapacitor in 433.2 seconds from 10 dBm input power, enabling over 3,400 seconds of operation. Experiment results demonstrate its viability for sustainable and continuous power supply."

Traditional detection methods, including laboratory physical and chemical testing and centralized machine learning, face several limitations such as high cost, latency, limited accessibility, and privacy concerns. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel, modular and scalable federated learning framework tailored for food fraud detection. The system employs an autoencoder to compress data into a lower-dimensional space and reconstruct it, enabling efficient representation learning and anomaly detection. Unlike conventional methods, the framework ensures data privacy by keeping data local while collaboratively training models across distributed, heterogeneous datasets. It also extends beyond binary classification to capture complex, realworld adulteration patterns. The results demonstrate significant improvements of our federated model against various baselines, achieving more than $30 \\%$ higher precision and more than $40 \\%$ higher recall, thus improving accuracy, robustness, and scalability for food adulteration detection."

This study introduces thermal-gyro fusion, a novel sensor fusion approach that integrates ultra-low-resolution thermal imaging with gyroscope readings for rotational odometry. Unlike RGB cameras, thermal imaging is invariant to lighting conditions and, when fused with gyroscopic data, mitigates drift-a common limitation of inertial sensors. We first develop a multimodal data acquisition system to collect synchronized thermal and gyroscope data, along with rotational speed labels, across diverse environments. Subsequently, we design and train a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that fuses both modalities for rotational speed estimation. Our analysis demonstrates that thermal-gyro fusion enables a significant reduction in thermal camera resolution without significantly compromising accuracy, thereby improving computational efficiency and memory utilization. These advantages make our approach well-suited for realtime deployment in resource-constrained robotic systems. Finally, to facilitate further research, we publicly release our dataset as supplementary material."

With recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs), there is growing potential to automate this process. In this study, first, we explore the use of a committee of LLMs (GPT-4omini, Gemini-1.5-flash, and DeepSeek-R1) to generate annotations for Italian social media content. Then, the quality of LLM-generated labels is evaluated by following a teacher-student approach, where we trained a smaller student model (phi3.5-miniinstruct) on them and testing its performance against a humanlabeled dataset. The results indicate that fine-tuning the student model over LLM-generated labels, with careful dataset balancing and hyperparameter tuning, can yield a significant improvement over the baseline (approximately $17 \\%$ improvement), suggesting that committee-based LLM annotation can provide high-quality labels. Therefore, this work shows the proposed approach can be a reliable and scalable alternative to manual labeling by properly addressing challenges like class imbalance to be sure about the fairness and accuracy of the fine-tuned models."

While its integration with traditional two-stage Knowledge Distillation (KD) has been extensively explored, combining DA with online Self-Knowledge Distillation (SD) often leads to suboptimal performance due to the absence of a reliable teacher model. To address this limitation, we propose the Improved Clean-Sample-Guided Self-Distillation (ICSD) framework. Unlike previous SD approaches that generate unstable or noisy teacher predictions under strong augmentations, ICSD leverages clean samples as teachers to provide consistent and semantically aligned supervision for their augmented counterparts. The proposed method is compatible with both label-preserving and label-mixing augmentations and can be extended to generative augmentation strategies. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CINIC-10, and Tiny ImageNet-200 datasets demonstrate that ICSD reduces the top-1 classification error by 1.0–1.6% compared with existing SD methods. Moreover, integrating ICSD with GAN-based augmentation yields an additional 0.2–0.5% improvement on more challenging datasets. These results confirm that ICSD enhances teacher-student consistency and improves robustness against diverse augmentation perturbations."

    "abstract": "Next generation cellular deployments are expected to exploit the 6–24 GHz frequency range 3 (FR3) and extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) to enable ultra-high data rates and reliability. However, the significantly enlarged antenna apertures and higher carrier frequencies make the far-field and spatial stationarity assumptions in the existing 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) channel models no longer valid, giving rise to new features such as near-field propagation and spatial non-stationarity (SNS). Despite extensive prior research, incorporating these new features within the standardized channel modeling framework remains an open issue. To address this, this paper presents a channel modeling framework for XL-MIMO systems that incorporates both near-field and SNS features, adopted by 3GPP. For the near-field propagation feature, the framework models the distances from the base station (BS) and user equipment to the spherical-wave sources associated with clusters. These distances are used to characterize element-wise variations of path parameters, such as nonlinear changes in phase and angle. To capture the effect of SNS at the BS side, a stochastic-based approach is proposed to model SNS caused by incomplete scattering, by establishing power attenuation factors from visibility probability and visibility region to characterize antenna element-wise path power variation. In addition, a physical blocker-based approach is introduced to model SNS effects caused by partial blockage. The near-field and SNS channel modeling approaches are validated against ray-tracing simulations. Finally, a simulation framework for near-field and SNS is developed based on the existing 3GPP channel model. Performance evaluations demonstrate that the near-field model captures higher channel capacity potential compablack to the far-field model. Coupling loss results indicate that SNS leads to more pronounced propagation fading relative to the spatial stationary model."

Those features distinguish ML-based TMS from social networks, static IoT, and Social IoT. This survey proposes a novel three-layer ML-based TMS framework for CAVs in the vehicle-road-cloud integration system, comprising a trust data layer, a trust calculation layer, and a trust incentive layer. A six-dimensional taxonomy of objectives is proposed. Furthermore, the principles of ML methods for each module in each layer are analyzed.

To achieve this, we propose the DPE-Aware User Association and Resource Allocation (DAUR) algorithm, a tailored optimization framework for blockchain-enabled Metaverse wireless communication systems characterized by joint computing and communication resource constraints. The DAUR algorithm transforms the nonconvex problem of maximizing the sum of DPE ratios into a solvable convex optimization problem. It alternates the optimization of key variables, including user association, work offloading ratios, task-specific computing resource distribution, bandwidth allocation, user power usage ratios, and server computing resource allocation ratios. Our extensive numerical results demonstrate the DAUR algorithm's effectiveness in DPE."

    "abstract": "Activities of daily living (ADL) identification with wearables has significant implications in healthy lifestyle management and offers an important sensor-based supervised learning research benchmark. Most ADL studies use single-modality (i.e., single sensor type like smartwatch only or earbuds only) data while multi-sensor data fusion studies using early-stage fusion of modalities from multi-sensors and multi-devices are emerging. To improve classification performance and model interpretability, leveraging early-stage fusion, late-stage fusion and individual modalities, we introduced novel modality-aware dynamic fusion (MAD-Fusion) models for multi-sensor data-fusion-based ADL identification. Based on early-stage fusion, we incorporated conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification, uncertainty late-stage fusion for cross-modality interpretability, and multi-modal strength-aware classification module. Trained on 36 independent subjects and tested on 4 independent subjects from Samsung ADL dataset with multi-sensor (accelerometers and gyroscopes) and multi-device (earbuds and smartwatch), MAD-Fusion not only achieved the state-of-the-art classification performance (accuracy: 0.9504, F1-score: 0.9142), but also enabled better interpretability of contributions and uncertainties from different modalities. The additional contribution of each building block is validated systematically. Furthermore, we validated MAD-Fusion’s superior performance on two public datasets in multi-sensor single-device settings (UCI-HAR and USC-HAD datasets). On all three datasets, MAD-Fusion manifested statistically significantly superiority comparing against baselines of single-modality, early-stage fusion and late-stage fusion (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i> < 0.001). To conclude, the novel MAD-Fusion models improve the classification performance, uncertainty quantification and interpretability for the ADL identification and can be applied to broader supervised learning areas requiring high performance, rigorous uncertainty quantification and model interpretability."

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) holds significant promise for enabling automatic modulation classification (AMC) across distributed wireless Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems while preserving data privacy. Yet, its deployment in real-world scenarios is hindered by two fundamental limitations: the inability to generalize across non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) clients without sacrificing personalization, and the lack of fast, data-efficient local adaptation mechanisms under non-IID, resource-constrained conditions. In this work, we present FedPML, a novel federated prototype-based meta-learning framework that directly addresses these challenges through a unified and scalable approach. FedPML leverages a lightweight Reptile-based meta-optimization strategy and class-level prototypes to jointly optimize for cross-client consistency and local task adaptability. This design enables rapid personalization with minimal data and computation, while preserving global knowledge alignment across heterogeneous clients. Extensive experiments on standard AMC benchmarks under a wide range of IID and non-IID conditions show that FedPML consistently outperforms strong FL baselines, achieving higher accuracy, faster convergence, and reduced communication overhead. The results demonstrate that FedPML is a powerful and practical solution for realizing resilient, low-latency AMC in decentralized IoT networks."

Reference lines drawn from the bobbin to the outer turns enabled direct visualization of azimuthal movement under varying winding tensions. Compared to theoretical predictions based on stiffness, REBCO coils showed displacements up to six times larger, while stainless steel coils aligned well with expected values. During thermal cycling, only REBCO coils wound at lower tension without full insulation exhibited measurable displacement near the inner turn after the first cooldown."

    "abstract": "Wet electrodes with conductive gel are widely applied as the gold standard for recording EEG signals due to their low impedance between the scalp and the electrode. However, their extensive preparation time before data collection and the required cleaning afterward make them impractical for real-world Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications. Recent advancements in semi-dry electrodes, which use a minimal amount of conductive material and achieve a comparable signal-to-noise quality to wet electrodes, present an alternative approach for continuous EEG monitoring when comparing to dry electrodes. Our prior study introduced a potential solution for overcoming challenges related to hair-layer penetration and dose control through 3D-printed, watermill-shaped EEG electrodes. Based on those promising results, this study prototypes three designs of watermill-shaped EEG electrodes and refines the fabrication process to scale production and accommodate diverse hairstyles in real-world scenarios. Eight different wig styles which were made of either human or synthetic hair were tested in offline experiments to evaluate hair-layer penetration performance and gel-applying application efficiency. In the real-world experiment, 15 participants with varying hairstyles were recruited in neurophysiological experiments. Statistical analysis revealed that the watermill electrodes consumed significantly less gel than wet electrodes (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p&lt;0.001</i>), with the star electrode requiring the fewest mean rolls to achieve target impedance (1.94 rolls). The results demonstrate that the watermill-shaped electrode effectively works across different hairstyles, ensuring consistent hair-layer penetration and controlled application of conductive material. These findings establish the proposed electrode as a viable semi-dry solution for real-world BCI applications."

    "abstract": "With the widespread application of federated learning in healthcare scenarios, ensuring performance fairness of disease diagnosis models across different medical institutions (clients) has attracted increasing attention. However, accurately evaluating whether models achieve this goal is equally critical yet faces numerous challenges: on one hand, each client can only evaluate the global model based on its own limited private data, which easily leads to performance estimation bias; on the other hand, due to data privacy constraints, clients cannot know the model's performance at other institutions, making it difficult to determine whether the global model truly achieves cross-client performance fairness. To address this, this paper proposes the <sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Fed4Fed</small> federated evaluation framework, which can more accurately evaluate the global model's performance in actual deployment while protecting data privacy by combining private data from multiple clients, and rigorously infer model performance fairness based on statistical hypothesis testing. Specifically, <sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Fed4Fed</small> draws inspiration from federated learning principles to collaboratively utilize multi-party private data while protecting data privacy. Second, it innovatively introduces Bootstrap methods and statistical inference strategies to construct and analyze the statistical distribution of model performance, reducing the randomness of performance evaluation. Third, based on statistical homogeneity testing theory, two fairness testing methods are designed to provide theoretical guarantees for evaluating performance fairness. Finally, experiments on synthetic datasets as well as four types of multi-modal real datasets including CIFAR-10, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and SST demonstrate that: <sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Fed4Fed</small> effectively overcomes the limitations of existing evaluation methods, with a fairness misjudgment rate below 5%, an average confidence interval coverage rate of 94.28% for performance, and robust performance across different degrees of non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) scenarios."

    "abstract": "Urban mobility is on the cusp of transformation with the emergence of shared, connected, and cooperative automated vehicles. Yet, for them to be accepted by customers, trust in their punctuality is vital. Many pilot initiatives operate without a fixed schedule, enhancing the importance of reliable arrival time (AT) predictions. This study presents an AT prediction system for automated shuttles, utilizing separate models for dwell and running time predictions, validated on real-world data from six cities. Alongside established methods such as XGBoost, we explore the benefits of leveraging spatial correlations using graph neural networks (GNN). To accurately handle the case of a shuttle bypassing a stop, we propose a hierarchical model combining a random forest classifier and a GNN. The results for the final AT prediction are promising, showing low errors even when predicting several stops ahead. Yet, no single model emerges as universally superior, and we provide insights into the characteristics of pilot sites that influence the model selection process and prediction performance. Finally, we identify dwell time prediction as the key determinant in overall AT prediction accuracy when automated shuttles are deployed in low-traffic areas or under regulatory speed limits. Our meta-analysis across six pilot sites in different cities provides insights into the current state of autonomous public transport prediction models and paves the way for more data-informed decision-making as the field advances."

The proposed approach enables secure, direct mutual authentication between drones without intermediaries. Cryptographic accumulators compress the entire drone identity database into a single element, significantly reducing storage demands on individual drones. The proposed scheme achieves superior communication efficiency compared to existing PUF-based post-quantum protocols for drones. Formal security verification using ProVerif confirms the robustness of the proposed scheme."

Users frequently post symptoms on social media and online health platforms, creating a huge repository of medical data that can be leveraged for disease classification. Large language models (LLMs) such as LLAMA3 and GPT-3.5, along with transformer-based models like BERT, have demonstrated strong capabilities in processing complex medical text. In this study, we evaluate three Arabic medical text preprocessing methods such as summarization, refinement, and Named Entity Recognition (NER) before applying finetuned Arabic transformer models (CAMeLBERT, AraBERT, and AsafayaBERT). To enhance robustness, we adopt a majority voting ensemble that combines predictions from original and preprocessed text representations. This approach achieved the best classification accuracy of 80.56%, thus showing its effectiveness in leveraging various text representations and model predictions to improve the understanding of medical texts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that integrates LLM-based preprocessing with fine-tuned Arabic transformer models and ensemble learning for disease classification in Arabic social telehealth data."

Our approach employs a state-of-the-art zero-shot tracker (SAMURAI) to generate bounding boxes of the target object in each frame. These cropped regions are then fed into a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based segmentation model trained to segment the object within the bounding box. By isolating the object from distracting background content and similar instances, our model eliminates ambiguity, simplifies the segmentation task, and requires no temporal memory to maintain object consistency. VOST is evaluated using three benchmark datasets, DAVIS16, DAVIS17, and SegTrackV2, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, VOST reaches an $\\mathcal{M}$ score of 92.6 on DAVIS16, 88.9 on DAVIS17, and an $\\mathcal{F}$-score of 0.929 on SegTrackV2, outperforming all previous methods. Additionally, VOST achieves a real-time inference speed of 20.6 FPS, offering an efficient and scalable solution for practical VOS applications. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the segmentation-by-tracking paradigm and its potential as a competitive alternative to memory-based approaches."

This approach improves the modeling of irrigation demand based on variables such as crop stage, soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. Compared to baseline models such as LSTM, BiLSTM, PSO-LSTM, and SSA-LSTM, the proposed model demonstrates improved predictive accuracy, enhanced precision, and significantly greater training efficiency per epoch.

A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained on a curated dataset of fire and non fire images with diverse environmental conditions. Performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, demonstrating that the dual resolution approach improves fire precision to 0.96 while reducing false positives, achieving an overall accuracy of 83 percent. An energy analysis shows that the selective two stage model achieves 64.4 percent lower energy consumption compared to continuous high resolution imaging, extending UAV endurance.

The quick transportation of the patient and the synchronization with the target hospital help save lives and avoid complications during the route. While traditional emergency routing systems typically prioritize shortest path algorithms, they often overlook an important dimension in today’s connected world: the stability of mobile communication throughout the transit process. In this paper, we propose a smart, urgency-sensitive emergency routing approach in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) environments, which selects emergency routes depending on both the travel time and the communication quality constraints. Our solution integrates real-time network metrics such as signal strength and latency measurements into the route decision-making process, ensuring uninterrupted data transmission between moving emergency vehicles and hospital systems. Optimization is based on the Reference-Point-Based NSGA-II genetic algorithm and compared to the classical routing process. Results demonstrate that our approach favors slightly longer but better-connected routes, significantly improving the reliability of patient data streaming during emergency situations, and is computationally feasible for real-time EMS deployment."

This paper proposes a lightweight and secure messaging protocol tailored for IoT environments, inspired by the Kerberos authentication framework. While Kerberos is a well-established solution for authentication and access control in distributed systems, its protocol complexity and resource requirements render it unsuitable for direct application in IoT settings. The proposed protocol addresses these limitations by ensuring confidentiality, mutual authentication, and message integrity using symmetric encryption and a ticketbased access control mechanism adapted from Kerberos. Unlike earlier approaches that depend on intermediary proxies, our design eliminates the proxy and enables direct session key distribution between IoT devices and service providers through a centralized Kerberized Authentication Server (AS). A formal security analysis under the Dolev-Yao model using the AVISPA tool demonstrates the protocol’s resistance to replay attacks, impersonation, and privacy breaches. The results underscore the practicality of adapting Kerberos for resource-constrained IoT environments while preserving strong security guarantees and maintaining low computational overhead."

We study how such randomness undermines the stability and automation of red-team attacks. First, we map where variability arises along the data, training, and deployment phases, embed it as a fourth dimension in a unified threat model, and measure its effect with three model-similarity metrics. Building on these observations, we introduce a concise five-level variability scale ($\\rho$) that links the degree of randomness to the feasibility of scripted, semi-automated, or human-driven exploits. The experiments indeed show exploit transferability dropping as randomness increases; however, “modest increases in $\\rho$ “ causing sharp drops is mostly true in higher-dimensional or multi-class settings. The proposed model, metrics, and scale give red teams a principled basis for planning, quantifying, and adapting attacks against continually evolving AI pipelines."

    "abstract": "In segmented dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) systems, the presence of cross-coupling mutual inductance (MI) leads to the generation of induced circulating current (ICC) in the inactive rails (IAR), resulting in power loss, magnetic field leakage, increased inverter capacity, and reduced efficiency. To address this problem, a parameter configuration method based on resonance tuning coefficient λ is proposed. This method effectively suppresses ICC, reduces inverter capacity, and improves system efficiency. Additionally, it is found that the abnormal drop in inverter current during λ tuning is caused by multiple resonance points at the inverter input impedance. For scenarios involving multiple power supply rails (PSRs), it is revealed that under conventional parameter configuration method (CPCM), the ICC exhibits hyperbolic-sine-type damped diffusion behavior. Building on this, a general circuit analysis model is proposed for different operating modes of PSR, with circuit parameters summarized and a design flowchart provided. Finally, a 12-meter DWPT platform is built to validate the proposed method, achieving maximum output power of 63.39 kW and system efficiency of 94.15%."

    "abstract": "The swift, secure transmission of data, especially sensitive data, such as that acquired from high-resolution image sensors, is a major focus of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Current strategies do not strike a balance between security and efficiency, causing messages to be lost and/or processing to be delayed to an unacceptable level. We present a new quantum-inspired quantum walk (Q-IQW) encryption protocol. The Q-IQW protocol is used to implement the first blockchain for the safe transfer of data between IIoT devices. For the first time, quantum hash functions based on Q-IQW are used to link blocks in a chain instead of traditional hash functions. The main contributions of the protocol are the efficient data transfer between IIoT nodes and the ability to fully control their data. This work focuses on simulating the protocol to understand the theoretical and empirical performance of the protocol. The results show that in terms of entropy of 7.99 and unified average changing intensity (UACI) of 33.56%, the protocol is very robust as evidenced by 99.58% number of pixel change rate (NPCR), and low correlation, i.e., the protocol exhibits very high security. Further, the protocol is reliable in that it can perfectly recover images under high distortion, for example, a 50% data occlusion in the encrypted images. These outcomes underscore the dependability, utility, and efficiency of the protocol in protecting IIoT information to make it a viable remedy for maintaining the integrity of the information during transfer and storage."

    "abstract": "Although accurate head pose estimation is critical for natural human-computer interaction, it remains challenging due to occlusion, extreme poses, illumination conditions, and data ambiguity issues. To address these challenges, a novel morphology aware Transformer framework (MHPE) is proposed, which can learn morphological relationships during facial rotation. The methodology is based on two key findings: cross-region geometric dependencies and angle-specific morphodynamic representations. The proposed framework incorporates two key components: adversarial feature generation, which generates robust rotation representations by adaptive multi-scale feature interaction; and morphology relationship inference, which establishes long-range dependencies between facial features through a cross-modal attention mechanism that incorporates morphological priors. Extensive evaluations on three demanding benchmarks (BIWI, AFLW2000, and 300W-LP) demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly in demanding scenarios. The Python implementation will be available on request to facilitate reproducibility."

    "abstract": "Data-driven semantic segmentation models often generalize poorly to unseen adverse weather conditions due to significant domain shifts and the lack of labeled data in the target domain. While recent unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approaches attempt to mitigate this gap through adversarial alignment or self-training, they typically treat domain discrepancy as a holistic shift, leading to suboptimal adaptation under diverse and complex weather conditions. We propose a Dual-Path Domain Bridging with Atmospheric Correction (DPAC) framework that disentangles style-related and weather-related discrepancies via two complementary teacher models. First, a reference domain is introduced to decompose the source–target gap, and the teacher models are trained using dual-path mixed data to mitigate discrepancies caused by style variation and weather degradation. Then, an atmospheric correction module is integrated into the weather-path teacher to restore degraded target images and improve feature-level alignment. Lastly, a student model is optimized under the alternating supervision of both teachers, enabling robust knowledge integration and enhanced generalization. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach. DPAC achieves significant performance gains of 5.1% on the Cityscapes to ACDC task, 6.1% on Cityscapes to Foggy Driving, and 5.3% on Cityscapes to Foggy Zurich over a strong baseline, validating the effectiveness of the dual-path domain bridging strategy in complex multi-weather scenarios."

    "abstract": "The lesions of tuberculosis (TB) in X-ray images are highly complex, exhibiting a variety of sizes, shapes, and structural variations. Single-scale features are insufficient to fully represent this diversity and complexity, thereby limiting the effectiveness of TB detection. As a result, multi-scale feature fusion has become a widely explored approach in the field of TB detection. However, current multi-scale feature fusion methods still have several limitations. First, the weight allocation in existing methods typically remains at the feature level without extending to local features and channels. This limitation prevents the model from precisely controlling the significance of local features and channels, resulting in coarse feature representations. Second, current methods neglect the contextual information between features at different levels, which further undermines the consistency of the fused features and leads to a lack of semantic coherence. To address the aforementioned issues, this study proposes TB-FusionNet, a multi-scale feature fusion algorithm based on channel and spatial cross-attention mechanisms, for tuberculosis classification. The algorithm first calculates the similarity between local features at different levels to precisely select low-level detail features that are closely related to high-level semantic features, thereby generating a more hierarchical feature representation. Next, the algorithm computes the dependencies between feature channels at different levels, allowing low-level channel features to be appropriately enhanced or suppressed under the guidance of high-level channels, effectively improving the semantic consistency between cross-level features. Through these operations, the model can dynamically adjust the weight distribution of local features and channels according to task requirements, thereby more flexibly adapting to the challenges of complex tasks. Experiments were conducted on the Shenzhen, Montgomery and HSAAS datasets in this study. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches, validating its effectiveness and robustness."

    "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of vision impairment worldwide, necessitating early detection to prevent irreversible blindness. Manual screening processes are time-consuming and constrained by resource limitations, emphasizing the need for automated and efficient diagnostic systems. Deep learning models have delivered notable results, but further refinement is still possible. In this work, we provide an advanced ensemble deep learning framework for automated DR screening, leveraging the Choquet fuzzy integral to aggregate the outputs of multiple state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs), including DenseNet121, Xception, and InceptionResNetV2. These pretrained models are fine-tuned on retinal fundus images to extract complementary features, which are then dynamically combined using the Choquet fuzzy integral, thereby improving predictive accuracy and robustness. Our model was trained and evaluated on a comprehensive real-world dataset, outperforming conventional deep learning and traditional machine learning baselines in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Experiments demonstrated the model’s resilience to dataset variability and its strong generalization capabilities. The proposed approach attained an average recall of 84.09 %, a precision of 83.09 %, an F1-score of 82.96 %, and an accuracy of 84.09 %. These findings substantiate the potential of ensemble learning techniques in advancing the effectiveness of automated DR screening systems."

    "abstract": "With the extensive growth and expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) network, the number of sensing devices is increasing rapidly. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology is an essential element of the Internet of Things (IoT). It plays a crucial role in various fields such as healthcare systems and medical industry. For example, an RFID system can support healthcare in various ways, including patient tracking, medical asset management, emergency preparedness, etc. Although an RFID system has too many advantages in improving healthcare systems, it continues to encounter security and privacy issues regarding the confidentiality of data shared among the system’s entities. To solve these issues, several mechanisms for RFID authentication and key management have been suggested to protect data and ensure secure access to healthcare systems. Recently, Wang et al. developed a lightweight RFID authentication for Smart Medical Systems. They asserted that the proposed protocol can withstand many attacks while keeping implementation cost low. This research paper focuses on this proposed protocol and its security vulnerabilities. We first analyzed the existing protocol, and we identified its shortcomings and vulnerabilities to various threats. The analysis shows that Wang et al. protocol fails to provide mutual authentication, to provide Tag verification, and to select the corresponding Tag to authenticate. Next, We introduced a revised scheme aimed at improving system security and resolving the detected vulnerabilities, thereby providing a stronger and more reliable solution."

We aggregated multiple publicly available datasets into a unified, balanced dataset, followed by rigorous preprocessing to enhance data quality. Structural URL features-including length, subdomain count, HTTPS presence, digit and special character ratios-were systematically extracted. The model uses DistilBERT transformer embeddings to turn the URLs into semantic representations. Experiments are done using XGBoost, LSTM, and fine-tuned DistilBERT. Results show that the DistilBERT model has an accuracy of $97.4 \\%$, which is better than traditional ensemble methods and recurrent neural networks. Merging the structure of data with its meaning gave better results, proving that transformer-based approaches are valuable for cybersecurity."

Since clinical evidence shows that men and women may respond differently to medications, this study developed an AI-based system to incorporate gender-specific data into clinical decision-making. A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline was implemented to analyze a curated dataset of 20 scientific articles using three distinct Large Language Models (LLMs): kronos483/Llama-3.2-3B-PubMed, deepseek-v2, and mistral-small-3.2. The evaluation revealed distinct trade-offs between the models. Mistral-small-3.2 achieved the highest average F 1 score, while deepseek-v2 delivered the highest average Precision but failed to assign gender-sensitivity scores. The performance of Llama-3.2 was comparable to Mistral’s, but its responses occasionally included faulty information. The findings confirm that this RAG-based approach could be a feasible method for generating promising, gender-sensitive clinical insights, demonstrating a path toward more equitable and personalized AI-supported healthcare."

    "abstract": "Plant disease detection is one of the most important topics of precision agriculture that aims to protect and boost crop yields. Commonly, intelligent systems based on Convolutional Neural Networks are employed to identify various plant diseases by analyzing images of leaves. For more complex scenarios, such as images captured directly from agricultural fields, advanced deep learning models incorporating attention mechanisms and bottleneck layers are preferred. In this context, the MaxViT model has demonstrated exceptional performance, thanks to its specialized architecture that integrates Mobile Inverted Bottleneck Convolutions along with both block and grid attention mechanisms. Presently, we propose an enhanced version of the MaxViT by incorporating texture features. Specifically, we apply a Gabor filter to the output of the stem convolution block, and the averaged filtered image is then added to the input of the MaxViT block in order to introduce additional texture information. We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets of tomato leaf diseases. The first, PlantVillage, contains laboratory-prepared leaf images, while the second, extracted from the PlantWild dataset, includes images captured in wild. Experimental results show that the proposed Gabor-MaxViT model achieves up to a $2.98 \\%$ performance improvement over the basic MaxViT and surpasses several state-of-the-art systems."

Traditional SSL methods typically rely on pseudo-labeling coupled with consistency learning to exploit unlabeled data; however, performance is critically dependent on the quality of the pseudo-labels. To address this issue, we propose a novel pseudo-label learning framework for RSCD that introduces an error information adversarial constraint to enhance consistency learning. This constraint explicitly maximizes the discrepancy between unlabeled data and the downstream task while minimizing the divergence for labeled data, thereby dynamically correcting suboptimal pseudo-labels through adversarial error feedback. Building on this constraint, we further develop a<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> Multi-View Joint Consistency Learning (MV-JCL)</i> strategy to refine pseudo-label predictions. By aggregating perturbed data from multiple randomized complementary views, MV-JCL significantly enhances the model’s generalization capability. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our method. Under the 5% labeled data setting, it achieves performance gains of 3.83%, 1.97%, and 1.85% on the LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and cross-dataset, respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches. These results not only demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, but also establish it as a promising solution for label-efficient change detection in remote sensing applications."

Compact, efficient modulators with wide bandwidths and high extinction ratios must be designed at the component level for application in mid- and long-haul transceivers. This work presents the design of electro-optic modulators on thin-film lithium niobate capable of addressing this burgeoning data requirement. Slow-wave enhancement of the effective modulation length has not yet shown potential for commercialization due to velocity or index mismatch between the optical carrier field and the RF-modulation signal. This work addresses this deficiency by designing slow-wave-matched electrodes and optical waveguides with corrugated gratings to achieve a modulator with a 1.25 V DC half-wave voltage, while maintaining greater than 100 GHz of bandwidth. This result provides the opportunity for seamless integration with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor electronics without the use of power-hungry RF preamplifiers for mid- and long-haul fiber-optic communications."

    "abstract": "Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETs) face significant challenges in maintaining reliable peer-to-peer (P2P) communication due to high node mobility, dynamic network topologies, and uncertain link quality, which collectively degrade throughput, energy efficiency, and fairness. To address this problem, this paper proposes a Smell Agent Optimization-based Peer-to-Peer Selection (SAO-P2PS) algorithm designed to optimize peer selection under realistic channel uncertainties. The methodology uses a bio-inspired SAO framework that dynamically adapts to fluctuating link conditions by modeling peer selection as a multi-objective optimization problem, simultaneously maximizing throughput and energy efficiency while ensuring equitable resource distribution using fairness index. The algorithm incorporates uncertain link quality estimates directly into its utility function, enabling robust decision-making in highly dynamic environments. Simulation results show that SAO-P2PS significantly outperforms conventional Random Selection and Nearest-Neighbor Selection methods, achieving 25-35% higher throughput, 40-60% better energy efficiency, and maintaining fairness indices above 0.6 across varying link quality conditions. The proposed algorithm exhibits rapid convergence within 20-30 iterations and maintains stable performance despite UAV mobility and channel fluctuations. The significance of these findings lies in providing a computationally efficient, adaptive solution for real-time FANET applications where reliable P2P communication is critical for mission success. This research establishes SAO-P2PS as a foundation for intelligent peer selection strategies in next-generation aerial networks, with potential applications in disaster response, surveillance, and autonomous swarm operations in 5G-and-beyond communication ecosystems."

The issue of data collection IoT devices is becoming increasingly urgent due to utilizing their rapid increase. When developing a Smart City system, it is imperative to consider the multitude of devices for data collection. The primary motivation behind this research is the growing need for server-portable and adaptable data acquisition systems that can meet the demands of modern Smart City environments. The purpose of the proposed solution is to provide a flexible, portable, and cost-effective framework for integrating heterogeneous IoT data sources, enabling efficient environmental monitoring and decision-making. It is crucial to anticipate future scaling or transferring the server side of the framework to a new hardware platform. This study presents an innovative approach for collecting data from heterogeneous sources to enhance efficiency and portability, applicable to various industrial sectors pursuing Industry 4.0 standards. The proposed framework was validated using a microservices-oriented architecture that leveraged containerization technology to create server-portable frameworks. This study demonstrates a versatile and server-portable solution for acquiring weather data, transforming, storing, visualizing, notifying and providing valuable insights for informed decision-making. The proposed framework was evaluated using multiple weather stations, including a custom-developed station and several commercial models, to assess its versatility and portability in data collection using different communication protocols. The evaluation also included the correction of measured values using statistical methods and machine learning techniques, which made it possible to increase data accuracy by compensating for systematic errors based on RMSE and MAE validation."

This study introduces a multimodal AI framework that evaluates feature-level (early) and decision-level (late) fusion strategies. Sensor data are organized into electrical (currents, voltages, power) and mechanical (torque, speed) modalities, enabling both modality-specific learning and cross-modal analysis via early and late fusion. This paper makes several key contributions. First, it introduces the proposed Adaptive Polynomial Kolmogorov–Arnold Network (AdaptPolyKAN) model for multi-class fault classification in wind energy conversion systems (WECS). Second, it develops a robust preprocessing pipeline that integrates wavelet denoising and Z-score normalization to enhance the quality and consistency of multimodal sensor data. Third, it provides a comprehensive comparison between AdaptPolyKAN and six other machine learning models Neural Networks (NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) highlighting the benefits brought by the proposed preprocessing and fusion procedures. Fourth, it presents an in-depth analysis of early and late fusion strategies, offering practical insights into their effectiveness for WECS fault diagnosis. Experimental results demonstrate that early and late fusion significantly enhance classification accuracy and robustness compared to single-modality or single-classifier approaches. The proposed AdaptPolyKAN framework achieves near-perfect accuracy (99.99% with early fusion) while remaining computationally efficient, making it suitable for real-time condition monitoring and predictive maintenance."

    "abstract": "Surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors enable wireless and passive measurement in harsh environments and are commonly deployed in a spatial distribution to improve performance. However, current sequential interrogation used in distributed sensing introduces errors due to asynchronous multi-signal acquisition and processing. Synchronous excitation and echo signal frequency acquisition on multiple SAW resonators (synchronous sensing) can avoid this error and improve sensing efficiency. Nevertheless, practical implementation of SAW synchronous sensing remains unavailable currently. Aiming at this challenge, this paper proposes a systematic synchronous frequency estimation technology and achieves high-precision synchronous SAW sensing. First, through derivation of the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for sensor signals, we establish range guidelines for key parameters about synchronous sensing scheme (working frequency interval of SAW resonators, signal length). This step ensures optimal resource allocation (excitation bandwidth, sampling length) to enhance frequency estimation accuracy and measurement precision. Subsequently, a high-performance multi-frequency estimation algorithm is proposed. It combines the proposed adaptive step-size subspace iterative reconstruction algorithm with the improved weighted root-MUSIC algorithm. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate our algorithm achieves the CRLB-approaching estimation (within 2dB of MSE), ensuring the feasibility of the CRLB-derived guidelines. Finally, high-precision synchronous differential SAW pressure sensing is achieved and our frequency estimation algorithm outperforms conventional algorithms facing the real sensor signals (with estimation variance of 0.18kHz<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>). Our work establishes a foundation for the practical application of SAW synchronous sensing technology and will advance the development of SAW distributed sensing arrays."

We extend this formulation to an ISAC scenario by incorporating minimum signal-to-noise ratio constraints as communication design criteria, only requiring statistical channel state information knowledge at base station. Furthermore, we propose a method to avoid the burdensome EVD evaluations in certain iterations, reducing the computation time by up to six times in a massive MIMO setting."

    "abstract": "Modern software-defined networks, such as Open Radio Access Network (O–RAN) systems, rely on artificial intelligence (AI)-powered applications running on controllers interfaced with the radio access network. To ensure that these AI applications operate reliably at runtime, they must be properly calibrated before deployment. A promising and theoretically grounded approach to calibration is conformal prediction (CP), which enhances any AI model by transforming it into a provably reliable set predictor that provides error bars for estimates and decisions. CP requires calibration data that matches the distribution of the environment encountered during runtime. However, in practical scenarios, network controllers often have access only to data collected under different contexts – such as varying traffic patterns and network conditions – leading to a mismatch between the calibration and runtime distributions. This paper introduces a novel methodology to address this calibration-test distribution shift. The approach leverages meta-learning to develop a zero-shot estimator of distribution shifts, relying solely on contextual information. The proposed method, called meta-learned contextdependent weighted conformal prediction (ML-WCP), enables effective calibration of AI applications without requiring data from the current context. Additionally, it can incorporate data from multiple contexts to further enhance calibration reliability."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed deep learning framework that does not require collecting raw data from clients and performs specific tasks through distributed devices. Due to the heterogeneity caused by different data distributions between clients, clients tend to shift towards the local optimal solution during local iterative training and generate specific local models. Merging specific local models may deviate from the global optimal solution. This phenomenon will hinder the performance of the global model. Parameter regularization solves the problem of offset of the local optimal solution by restricting the update direction of the local model. Research on efficient parameter tuning and sparse federated learning has found that it is not necessary for the client to update all parameters in the global model during each round of training.Therefore, in this work, we first designed a novel sparse federated learning method: Fed<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">l</i><sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1/2</sub>, which can alleviate the degradation of FL performance by only updating some parameters in each training round.

In this context, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based allocation method for 6G V2X (Vehicle-toEverything) networks. Connected vehicles continuously generate sensitive data (location, trajectories, speed), whose centralized collection for DRL training poses significant risks including data breaches, GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) noncompliance (due to challenging anonymization requirements), and user distrust of personal data collection systems. To balance performance with privacy preservation, we introduce a hybrid DRL-FL (Federated Learning) architecture that addresses 6G vehicular network challenges while ensuring data confidentiality. Our approach reduces base station energy consumption while ensuring rigorous user privacy protection."

While knowledge distillation enables smaller student models to approximate the performance of larger teacher models, existing methods frequently encounter significant trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, uncertain predictions from teacher models can negatively impact the student’s learning process. In this paper, we introduce CAKD, a novel approach that optimizes the training of student models by selectively emphasizing the teacher model’s most reliable predictions using confidence scores. By integrating entropybased confidence weighting into the distillation loss, CAKD effectively prioritizes high-confidence samples, resulting in improved performance and efficiency. Our experiments on text summarization (using a BART-based model on the CNN/DM dataset) and chatbot tasks (using Llamabased model on the DailyDialog and PersonaChat datasets) demonstrate that CAKD achieves significant performance gains over larger teacher models, with improvements of 10.53, 2.1 and 0.38 ROUGE-L points respectively."

This paper targets conventional backpropagation algorithm, and addresses privacy preservation under constrained client-side environments and high-accuracy requirement in the context of pervasive health monitoring. It proposes an enhanced privacy-preserving remote training solution based on homomorphic encryption and reversible obfuscation under a non-colluding two-server architecture. The proposed solution can effectively protect sensitive client information from the serverside, with no leakage from gradients or weights during training, while none of the model parameters are revealed to the client. Moreover, the introduced fully reversible obfuscations do not alter training computations, and maintain low computational and communication overhead."
