    "abstract": "Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has been traditionally formulated as a single-image retrieval task. Using multiple views offers clear advantages, yet this setting remains relatively underexplored and existing methods often struggle to generalize across diverse environments. In this work we introduce UniPR-3D, the first VPR architecture that effectively integrates information from multiple views. UniPR-3D builds on a VGGT backbone capable of encoding multi-view 3D representations, which we adapt by designing feature aggregators and fine-tune for the place recognition task. To construct our descriptor, we jointly leverage the 3D tokens and intermediate 2D tokens produced by VGGT. Based on their distinct characteristics, we design dedicated aggregation modules for 2D and 3D features, allowing our descriptor to capture fine-grained texture cues while also reasoning across viewpoints. To further enhance generalization, we incorporate both single- and multi-frame aggregation schemes, along with a variable-length sequence retrieval strategy. Our experiments show that UniPR-3D sets a new state of the art, outperforming both single- and multi-view baselines and highlighting the effectiveness of geometry-grounded tokens for VPR. Our code and models will be made publicly available on Github https://github.com/dtc111111/UniPR-3D."

We introduce the classical reservoir approach, a low cost variational ansatz tailored to near-term hardware, requiring only nearest-neighbor interactions on a machine with square-lattice connectivity. Unlike traditional methods built from the classically efficient Hartree Fock theory, our ansatz operates in localized molecular orbitals to study previously unexplored regions of the variational parameter space. Numerical benchmarks demonstrate chemical accuracy across diverse systems and bond lengths; notably, significantly reduced circuit depths are attainable when relaxed error thresholds (e.g., tens of E_h) are permissible. We benchmark the method on hydrogen chains, N_2, O_2, CO, BeH_2, and H_2O, the latter corresponding to an effective 24 qubit calculation."

    "abstract": "Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) enables data-driven understanding of factor associations with response variables, yet communicating XAI outputs to laypersons remains challenging, hindering trust in AI-based predictions. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for translating technical explanations into accessible narratives, yet the integration of agentic AI, where LLMs operate as autonomous agents through iterative refinement, with XAI remains unexplored. This study proposes an agentic XAI framework combining SHAP-based explainability with multimodal LLM-driven iterative refinement to generate progressively enhanced explanations. As a use case, we tested this framework as an agricultural recommendation system using rice yield data from 26 fields in Japan. The Agentic XAI initially provided a SHAP result and explored how to improve the explanation through additional analysis iteratively across 11 refinement rounds (Rounds 0-10). Explanations were evaluated by human experts (crop scientists) (n=12) and LLMs (n=14) against seven metrics: Specificity, Clarity, Conciseness, Practicality, Contextual Relevance, Cost Consideration, and Crop Science Credibility. Both evaluator groups confirmed that the framework successfully enhanced recommendation quality with an average score increase of 30-33% from Round 0, peaking at Rounds 3-4. However, excessive refinement showed a substantial drop in recommendation quality, indicating a bias-variance trade-off where early rounds lacked explanation depth (bias) while excessive iteration introduced verbosity and ungrounded abstraction (variance), as revealed by metric-specific analysis. These findings suggest that strategic early stopping (regularization) is needed for optimizing practical utility, challenging assumptions about monotonic improvement and providing evidence-based design principles for agentic XAI systems."

    "abstract": "Grasping is one of the most fundamental challenging capabilities in robotic manipulation, especially in unstructured, cluttered, and semantically diverse environments. Recent researches have increasingly explored language-guided manipulation, where robots not only perceive the scene but also interpret task-relevant natural language instructions. However, existing language-conditioned grasping methods typically rely on shallow fusion strategies, leading to limited semantic grounding and weak alignment between linguistic intent and visual grasp reasoning.In this work, we propose Language-Guided Grasp Detection (LGGD) with a coarse-to-fine learning paradigm for robotic manipulation. LGGD leverages CLIP-based visual and textual embeddings within a hierarchical cross-modal fusion pipeline, progressively injecting linguistic cues into the visual feature reconstruction process. This design enables fine-grained visual-semantic alignment and improves the feasibility of the predicted grasps with respect to task instructions. In addition, we introduce a language-conditioned dynamic convolution head (LDCH) that mixes multiple convolution experts based on sentence-level features, enabling instruction-adaptive coarse mask and grasp predictions. A final refinement module further enhances grasp consistency and robustness in complex scenes.Experiments on the OCID-VLG and Grasp-Anything++ datasets show that LGGD surpasses existing language-guided grasping methods, exhibiting strong generalization to unseen objects and diverse language queries. Moreover, deployment on a real robotic platform demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our approach in executing accurate, instruction-conditioned grasp actions. The code will be released publicly upon acceptance."

    "abstract": "In computational pathology, understanding and generation have evolved along disparate paths: advanced understanding models already exhibit diagnostic-level competence, whereas generative models largely simulate pixels. Progress remains hindered by three coupled factors: the scarcity of large, high-quality image-text corpora; the lack of precise, fine-grained semantic control, which forces reliance on non-semantic cues; and terminological heterogeneity, where diverse phrasings for the same diagnostic concept impede reliable text conditioning. We introduce UniPath, a semantics-driven pathology image generation framework that leverages mature diagnostic understanding to enable controllable generation. UniPath implements Multi-Stream Control: a Raw-Text stream; a High-Level Semantics stream that uses learnable queries to a frozen pathology MLLM to distill paraphrase-robust Diagnostic Semantic Tokens and to expand prompts into diagnosis-aware attribute bundles; and a Prototype stream that affords component-level morphological control via a prototype bank. On the data front, we curate a 2.65M image-text corpus and a finely annotated, high-quality 68K subset to alleviate data scarcity. For a comprehensive assessment, we establish a four-tier evaluation hierarchy tailored to pathology. Extensive experiments demonstrate UniPath's SOTA performance, including a Patho-FID of 80.9 (51% better than the second-best) and fine-grained semantic control achieving 98.7% of the real-image. The meticulously curated datasets, complete source code, and pre-trained model weights developed in this study will be made openly accessible to the public."

    "abstract": "Object pose tracking is one of the pivotal technologies in multimedia, attracting ever-growing attention in recent years. Existing methods employing traditional cameras encounter numerous challenges such as motion blur, sensor noise, partial occlusion, and changing lighting conditions. The emerging bio-inspired sensors, particularly event cameras, possess advantages such as high dynamic range and low latency, which hold the potential to address the aforementioned challenges. In this work, we present an optical flow-guided 6DoF object pose tracking method with an event camera. A 2D-3D hybrid feature extraction strategy is firstly utilized to detect corners and edges from events and object models, which characterizes object motion precisely. Then, we search for the optical flow of corners by maximizing the event-associated probability within a spatio-temporal window, and establish the correlation between corners and edges guided by optical flow. Furthermore, by minimizing the distances between corners and edges, the 6DoF object pose is iteratively optimized to achieve continuous pose tracking. Experimental results of both simulated and real events demonstrate that our methods outperform event-based state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness."

The proposed synthesis of controllers subject to such a constraint leverages the strict contraction of lifted Riccati operators under uniform controllability and observability. The main approximation result establishes a sufficient number of preview steps for the performance loss to remain below any set tolerance, relative to the baseline gain bound of the associated infinite-preview controller. Aspects of the main result are explored in the context of a numerical example."

To address the NP-hard nature of the rank minimization problem, the nuclear norm is commonly used as a convex and computationally tractable surrogate for the rank function. However, this approach often yields suboptimal solutions due to the excessive shrinkage of singular values. In this letter, we propose a novel reweighted logarithmic norm as a more effective nonconvex surrogate, which provides a closer approximation than many existing alternatives. We efficiently solve the resulting optimization problem by employing the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Experimental results on image inpainting demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art LRMC approaches, both in terms of visual quality and quantitative metrics."

    "abstract": "Healthcare AI needs large, diverse datasets, yet strict privacy and governance constraints prevent raw data sharing across institutions. Federated learning (FL) mitigates this by training where data reside and exchanging only model updates, but practical deployments still face two core risks: (1) privacy leakage via gradients or updates (membership inference, gradient inversion) and (2) trust in the aggregator, a single point of failure that can drop, alter, or inject contributions undetected. We present zkFL-Health, an architecture that combines FL with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to deliver privacy-preserving, verifiably correct collaborative training for medical AI. Clients locally train and commit their updates; the aggregator operates within a TEE to compute the global update and produces a succinct ZK proof (via Halo2/Nova) that it used exactly the committed inputs and the correct aggregation rule, without revealing any client update to the host. Verifier nodes validate the proof and record cryptographic commitments on-chain, providing an immutable audit trail and removing the need to trust any single party. We outline system and threat models tailored to healthcare, the zkFL-Health protocol, security/privacy guarantees, and a performance evaluation plan spanning accuracy, privacy risk, latency, and cost. This framework enables multi-institutional medical AI with strong confidentiality, integrity, and auditability, key properties for clinical adoption and regulatory compliance."

    "abstract": "Algorithms based on non-unitary evolution have attracted much interest for ground state preparation on quantum computers. One recently proposed method makes use of ancilla qubits and controlled unitary operators to implement weak measurements related to imaginary-time evolution. In this work we specialize and extend this approach to the setting of combinatorial optimization. We first generalize the algorithm from exact to approximate optimization, taking advantage of several properties unique to classical problems. In particular we show how to select parameters such that the success probability of each measurement step is bounded away from $1/2$. We then show how to adapt our paradigm to the setting of constrained optimization for a number of important classes of hard problem constraints. For this we compare and contrast both penalty-based and feasibility-preserving approaches, elucidating the significant advantages of the latter approach. Our approach is general and may be applied to easy-to-prepare initial states as a standalone algorithm, or deployed as a quantum postprocessing stage to improve performance of a given parameterized quantum circuit. We then propose a more sophisticated variant of our algorithm that adaptively applies a mixing operator or not, based on the measurement outcomes seen so far, as to speeds up the algorithm and helps the system evolution avoid slowing down or getting stuck suboptimally. In particular, we show that mixing operators from the quantum alternating operator ansatz can be imported directly, both for the necessary eigenstate scrambling operator and for initial state preparation, and discuss quantum resource tradeoffs."

In contrast, humans can quickly regulate grasping force by touch, even without visual cues. Inspired by this ability, we aim to enable robotic hands to rapidly explore objects and learn tactile-driven grasping force control under motion and limited sensing. We propose a physics-informed energy abstraction that models the object as a virtual energy container. The inconsistency between the fingers' applied power and the object's retained energy provides a physically grounded signal for inferring slip-aware stability. Building on this abstraction, we employ model-based learning and planning to efficiently model energy dynamics from tactile sensing and perform real-time grasping force optimization. Experiments in both simulation and hardware demonstrate that our method can learn grasping force control from scratch within minutes, effectively reduce slippage, and extend grasp duration across diverse motion-object pairs, all without relying on external sensing or prior object knowledge."

Similarly to what happens to the velocity fluctuations, for the fluctuating scalar field Kolmogorov scale-by-scale equilibrium is achieved asymptotically around a length scale $r_{min}$, which is located below the inertial range. The lengthscale $r_{min}$ and the ratio between the inter-scale transfer and dissipation rates at $r_{min}$ vary following power laws of the Prandtl number, with exponents determined by matched asymptotics based on the hypothesis of homogeneous two-point physics in non-homogeneous turbulence. The interscale transfer rates of turbulent kinetic energy and passive scalar variance are globally similar but show evident differences when their aligned/anti-aligned contributions are considered."

Here, we theoretically propose and numerically demonstrate a magneto-optical skyrmion platform enabling full polarization control of cavity eigenmodes. We reveal the correspondence between the near-field wavefunctions of degenerate dipoles and far-field polarization. By applying multidirectional magnetic fields to magneto-optical photonic crystals, we achieve any complex superposition of orthogonal eigenmodes, thereby realizing arbitrary far-field polarization. This mapping manifests as a skyrmion with a topological charge of 2, guaranteeing coverage of the entire Poincaré sphere. Our theoretical model shows excellent agreement with full-wave simulations. Furthermore, we realize bound states in the continuum (BICs) with dynamically tunable polarization textures and demonstrate high-performance polarization-selective emission and transmission. This work establishes a topological paradigm for precise polarization shaping, offering new avenues for advanced optical communication and sensing."

The PHIBP's architecture, grounded in the concept of absolute abundance, systematically borrows statistical strength from related regions and circumvents the known sensitivities of relative-rate methods to zero counts. Through a series of experiments on infectious disease data, we show that this principled approach provides a robust foundation for generating coherent predictive distributions and for the effective use of comparative measures such as alpha and beta diversity.

    "abstract": "Multi-view inverse rendering aims to recover geometry, materials, and illumination consistently across multiple viewpoints. When applied to multi-view images, existing single-view approaches often ignore cross-view relationships, leading to inconsistent results. In contrast, multi-view optimization methods rely on slow differentiable rendering and per-scene refinement, making them computationally expensive and hard to scale. To address these limitations, we introduce a feed-forward multi-view inverse rendering framework that directly predicts spatially varying albedo, metallic, roughness, diffuse shading, and surface normals from sequences of RGB images. By alternating attention across views, our model captures both intra-view long-range lighting interactions and inter-view material consistency, enabling coherent scene-level reasoning within a single forward pass. Due to the scarcity of real-world training data, models trained on existing synthetic datasets often struggle to generalize to real-world scenes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a consistency-based finetuning strategy that leverages unlabeled real-world videos to enhance both multi-view coherence and robustness under in-the-wild conditions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of multi-view consistency, material and normal estimation quality, and generalization to real-world imagery."

In this work, we investigate how the allocation of supervision across different segments (P, CoT, A) affects student performance. Our analysis shows that selective knowledge distillation over only the CoT tokens can be effective when the prompt and answer information is encompassed by it. Building on this insight, we establish a truncation protocol to quantify computation-quality tradeoffs as a function of sequence length. We observe that training on only the first $50\\%$ of tokens of every training sequence can retain, on average, $\\approx94\\%$ of full-sequence performance on math benchmarks while reducing training time, memory usage, and FLOPs by about $50\\%$ each.

In this paper, we explore the integration of agentic AI into QoE-aware network slicing for IIoT. We first review the network slicing management architecture, QoE metrics for IIoT applications, and the challenges of dynamically managing heterogeneous network slices, while highlighting the motivations and advantages of adopting agentic AI. We then present the workflow of agentic AI-based slicing management, illustrating the full lifecycle of AI agents from processing slice requests to constructing slice instances and performing dynamic adjustments. Furthermore, we propose an LLM-empowered agentic AI approach for slicing management, which integrates a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module for semantic intent inference, a DRL-based orchestrator for slicing configuration, and an incremental memory mechanism for continual learning and adaptation. Through a case study on heterogeneous slice management, we demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms other baselines in balancing latency, reliability, and cost, and achieves up to a 19% improvement in slice availability ratio."

The adopted geometry is the same as that of the IMPACT model (Ogawa et al. in prep.), consisting of a clumpy torus defined by Nenkova et al.

We discuss the dependence of the X-ray spectrum on geometrical parameters in comparison with the conventional torus-only model (XCLUMPY). As an example, we have simultaneously applied the IMPACTX and IMPACT models to the X-ray and infrared spectra of the nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 4388, and have found a solution that can well reproduce both spectra.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in generative modeling have demonstrated strong promise for high-quality point cloud upsampling. In this work, we present PUFM++, an enhanced flow-matching framework for reconstructing dense and accurate point clouds from sparse, noisy, and partial observations. PUFM++ improves flow matching along three key axes: (i) geometric fidelity, (ii) robustness to imperfect input, and (iii) consistency with downstream surface-based tasks. We introduce a two-stage flow-matching strategy that first learns a direct, straight-path flow from sparse inputs to dense targets, and then refines it using noise-perturbed samples to approximate the terminal marginal distribution better. To accelerate and stabilize inference, we propose a data-driven adaptive time scheduler that improves sampling efficiency based on interpolation behavior. We further impose on-manifold constraints during sampling to ensure that generated points remain aligned with the underlying surface. Finally, we incorporate a recurrent interface network~(RIN) to strengthen hierarchical feature interactions and boost reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world scans show that PUFM++ sets a new state of the art in point cloud upsampling, delivering superior visual fidelity and quantitative accuracy across a wide range of tasks.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates a low-altitude integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system that leverages cooperative rotatable active and passive arrays. We consider a downlink scenario where a base station (BS) with an active rotatable array serves multiple communication users and senses low-altitude targets, assisted by a rotatable reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). A rotation-aware geometry-based multipath model is developed to capture the impact of three-dimensional (3D) array orientations on both steering vectors and direction-dependent element gains. On this basis, we formulate a new optimization problem that maximizes the downlink sum rate subject to a transmit power budget, RIS unit-modulus constraints, mechanical rotation limits, and a sensing beampattern mean-squared-error (MSE) constraint. To address the resulting highly non-convex problem, we propose a penalty-based alternating-optimization (AO) framework that alternately updates the BS precoder, RIS phase shifts, and BS/RIS array rotation angles. The three blocks are efficiently handled via a convex optimization method based on quadratic-transform (QT) and majorization-minorization (MM), Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) on the unit-modulus manifold, and projected gradient descent (PGD) with Barzilai-Borwein step sizes, respectively. Numerical results in low-altitude geometries demonstrate that the proposed jointly rotatable BS-RIS architecture achieves significant sum-rate gains over fixed or partially rotatable baselines while guaranteeing sensing requirements, especially with directional antennas and in interference-limited regimes."

However, the reliability of these systems is critically undermined by their vulnerability to prompt injection attacks, where attackers deliberately input deceptive instructions into LLMs. Traditional defenses, based on static filters and rigid rules, are insufficient to address the semantic complexity of these new attacks. We argue that a paradigm shift is needed -- from passive filtering to active protection and autonomous reasoning. We introduce AegisAgent, an autonomous agent system designed to ensure the security of LLM-driven HAR systems. Instead of merely blocking threats, AegisAgent functions as a cognitive guardian. It autonomously perceives potential semantic inconsistencies, reasons about the user's true intent by consulting a dynamic memory of past interactions, and acts by generating and executing a multi-step verification and repair plan. We implement AegisAgent as a lightweight, full-stack prototype and conduct a systematic evaluation on 15 common attacks with five state-of-the-art LLM-based HAR systems on three public datasets. Results show it reduces attack success rate by 30\\% on average while incurring only 78.6 ms of latency overhead on a GPU workstation. Our work makes the first step towards building secure and trustworthy LLM-driven HAR systems."

Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) act as low-power programmable apertures that redirect energy without the cost and power consumption of fully active arrays. We develop a deployment-first, operations-aware view of RIS-enabled satellite networking that treats RIS as both satellite/terminal antennas and inter-satellite or space-ground relays. We show that system-level gains are governed by two unifying mechanisms: connectivity restoration via virtual line-of-sight links that preserve connectivity under blockage and mobility, and angular selectivity that reshapes interference to enlarge spectrum reuse. We further discuss practical operation under high mobility, highlighting Delay-Doppler channel acquisition, predictive beam tracking, and control designs that budget overhead and latency, and summarize hardware considerations for reliable operation in space. Finally, we outline forward-looking opportunities in the generative artificial intelligence paradigm, multifunctional RIS architectures, ubiquitous satellite integrated sensing and communication, and sustainable satellite Internet-of-Things."

Our work is motivated by research related to the $[a,b]$-factors and fractional $[a,b]$-factors, and explores their generalizations: $(a,b,k)$-critical graphs and fractional $(a,b,k)$-critical graphs. A graph $G$ is called an $(a,b,k)$-critical (a fractional $(a,b,k)$-critical) graph if after deleting any $k$ vertices of $G$ the remaining graph of $G$ has an $[a,b]$-factor (a fractional $[a,b]$-factor).

Among the factors required for autonomous decision-making in mobility, positional awareness of the vehicle itself is the most critical. Accordingly, extensive research has been conducted on defense mechanisms against GPS spoofing attacks, which threaten AVs by disrupting position recognition. Among these, detection methods based on internal IMU sensors are regarded as some of the most effective. In this paper, we propose a spoofing attack system designed to neutralize IMU sensor-based detection. First, we present an attack modeling approach for bypassing such detection. Then, based on EKF sensor fusion, we experimentally analyze both the impact of GPS spoofing values on the internal target system and how our proposed methodology reduces anomaly detection within the target system. To this end, this paper proposes an attack model that performs GPS spoofing by stealing internal dynamic state information using an external IMU sensor, and the experimental results demonstrate that attack values can be injected without being detected."

    "abstract": "The accelerating digitization of economic activity has made information a dominant driver of market expectations, coordination, and systemic risk. Yet contemporary monetary systems remain anchored in architectures designed for material scarcity, institutional authority, or cryptographic constraint, leaving them increasingly misaligned with information-driven economies. This conceptual paper proposes Information-Backed Currency (IBC) as a monetary framework in which verified, high-integrity information functions as the primary source of value creation and monetary stability. Drawing on insights from econophysics, information theory, and cognitive economics, the paper advances the proposition that economic value emerges when information measurably reduces uncertainty within complex systems. Building on this premise, the study develops an architectural model in which currency issuance is linked to quantified entropy reduction achieved through multi-path information verification, reproducibility assessment, and contextual validation. An ethical governance layer, termed the Dharma Protocol, is introduced to ensure that only socially stabilizing, non-manipulative information qualifies as currency-backing input. The proposed IBC architecture comprises four interdependent layers: information ingestion, verification and validation, ethical oversight, and monetization through a Verification Value Unit tied to uncertainty reduction. While the framework is intentionally conceptual and non-empirical, it offers a coherent blueprint for re-imagining monetary governance in an era characterized by information abundance, cognitive constraints, and systemic fragility."

Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have significantly automated data science workflows, but a fundamental question persists: Can these agentic AI systems truly match the performance of human data scientists who routinely leverage domain-specific knowledge? We explore this question by designing a prediction task where a crucial latent variable is hidden in relevant image data instead of tabular features. As a result, agentic AI that generates generic codes for modeling tabular data cannot perform well, while human experts could identify the important hidden variable using domain knowledge. We demonstrate this idea with a synthetic dataset for property insurance. Our experiments show that agentic AI that relies on generic analytics workflow falls short of methods that use domain-specific insights. This highlights a key limitation of the current agentic AI for data science and underscores the need for future research to develop agentic AI systems that can better recognize and incorporate domain knowledge."

We propose RepoNavigator, an LLM agent equipped with a single execution-aware tool-jumping to the definition of an invoked symbol. This unified design reflects the actual flow of code execution while simplifying tool manipulation. RepoNavigator is trained end-to-end via Reinforcement Learning (RL) directly from a pretrained model, without any closed-source distillation. Experiments demonstrate that RL-trained RepoNavigator achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the 7B model outperforming 14B baselines, the 14B model surpassing 32B competitors, and even the 32B model exceeding closed-source models such as Claude-3.7. These results confirm that integrating a single, structurally grounded tool with RL training provides an efficient and scalable solution for repository-level issue localization."

For both detector types, pseudo-data are generated under realistic assumptions regarding neutrino flux, detector response, and background levels. Oscillation analyses are performed to estimate detector sensitivity, incorporating both statistical and systematic uncertainties. The results indicate that the OLS detector, owing to its superior position resolution, achieves leading sensitivity across a wide range of oscillation parameters, even under conservative experimental conditions. These findings underscore the potential of OLS technology as a highly effective approach for future sterile neutrino searches."

We conducted two comprehensive experiments (N = 1,038) examining how occupational contexts and stereotype activation shape robotic agent choices across construction, healthcare, educational, and athletic domains. Participants made selections from artificial agents that varied systematically in skin tone and anthropomorphic characteristics. Our study revealed distinct context-dependent patterns. Healthcare and educational scenarios demonstrated strong favoritism toward lighter-skinned artificial agents, while construction and athletic contexts showed greater acceptance of darker-toned alternatives. Participant race was associated with systematic differences in selection patterns across professional domains. The second experiment demonstrated that exposure to human professionals from specific racial backgrounds systematically shifted later robotic agent preferences in stereotype-consistent directions. These findings show that occupational biases and color-based discrimination transfer directly from human-human to human-robot evaluation contexts. The results highlight mechanisms through which robotic deployment may unintentionally perpetuate existing social inequalities."

Current hallucination detection methods based on uncertainty estimation and external knowledge retrieval suffer from the limitation that they still produce erroneous content at high confidence levels and rely heavily on retrieval efficiency and knowledge coverage. In contrast, probe methods that leverage the model's hidden-layer states offer real-time and lightweight advantages. However, traditional linear probes struggle to capture nonlinear structures in deep semantic spaces.To overcome these limitations, we propose a neural network-based framework for token-level hallucination detection. By freezing language model parameters, we employ lightweight MLP probes to perform nonlinear modeling of high-level hidden states. A multi-objective joint loss function is designed to enhance detection stability and semantic disambiguity. Additionally, we establish a layer position-probe performance response model, using Bayesian optimization to automatically search for optimal probe insertion layers and achieve superior training results.Experimental results on LongFact, HealthBench, and TriviaQA demonstrate that MLP probes significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, recall, and detection capability under low false-positive conditions."

Ionisation electrons were drifted to the liquid surface and extracted into the vapour, where they produced VUV electroluminescence. A time-resolved photon-counting technique was used to obtain the scintillation spectrum in the liquid, which exhibited a peak wavelength of $177.1\\pm0.1_\\mathrm{stat} \\pm0.1_\\mathrm{sys}\\,\\textrm{nm}$ and a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of $11.3\\pm0.2_\\mathrm{stat} \\pm0.0_\\mathrm{sys}\\,\\textrm{nm}$. The data were also used to obtain distinct singlet and triplet emission models, with the singlet emission peaking $1.8\\pm0.3_{\\mathrm{stat}}\\pm 0.3_{\\mathrm{sys}}\\,\\textrm{nm}$ shorter than the triplet. The gas electroluminescence spectrum was obtained simultaneously, while under conditions of thermal equilibrium.

Validated across heterogeneous SaaS portfolios, the method consistently outperforms static tiers and uniform uplifts by reallocating price moves toward segments with higher willingness-to-pay while protecting price-sensitive cohorts. The system is designed for real-time recalibration via modular APIs and includes model explainability for governance and compliance. Managerially, the framework functions as a strategy playbook that clarifies when to shift from flat to dynamic pricing, how to align pricing with CLV and MRR targets, and how to embed ethical guardrails, enabling durable growth without eroding customer trust."

Existing methods for this alignment task rely on abundant satellites unavailable in GNSS-degraded environments, or use local optimization methods which cannot guarantee the optimality of a solution. This work introduces a globally optimal solver that transforms raw pseudo-range or Doppler measurements into a convexly relaxed problem. The proposed method is certifiable, meaning it can numerically verify the correctness of the result, filling a gap where existing local optimizers fail. We first formulate the original frame alignment problem as a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) problem and relax the QCQP problem to a concave Lagrangian dual problem that provides a lower cost bound for the original problem. Then we perform relaxation tightness and observability analysis to derive criteria for certifiable optimality of the solution. Finally, simulation and real world experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method. The experiments show that our method provides certifiably optimal solutions even with only 2 satellites with Doppler measurements and 2D vehicle motion, while the traditional velocity-based VOBA method and the advanced GVINS alignment technique may fail or converge to local optima without notice.

This paper introduces a novel approach to evaluate the effectiveness of LLM embeddings in the context of inherent geometric properties. We investigate the structural properties of these embeddings through three complementary metrics $δ$-hyperbolicity, Ultrametricity, and Neighbor Joining. $δ$-hyperbolicity, a measure derived from geometric group theory, quantifies how much a metric space deviates from being a tree-like structure. In contrast, ultrametricity characterizes strictly hierarchical structures where distances obey a strong triangle inequality. While Neighbor Joining quantifies how tree-like the distance relationships are, it does so specifically with respect to the tree reconstructed by the Neighbor Joining algorithm. By analyzing the embeddings generated by LLMs using these metrics, we uncover to what extent the embedding space reflects an underlying hierarchical or tree-like organization. Our findings reveal that LLM embeddings exhibit varying degrees of hyperbolicity and ultrametricity, which correlate with their performance in the underlying machine learning tasks."

Unlike task-specific techniques that primarily focus on consolidating inter-modal information, general image fusion needs to address a wide range of tasks while improving performance without increasing complexity. To achieve this, we propose SMC-Mamba, a Self-supervised Multiplex Consensus Mamba framework for general image fusion. Specifically, the Modality-Agnostic Feature Enhancement (MAFE) module preserves fine details through adaptive gating and enhances global representations via spatial-channel and frequency-rotational scanning. The Multiplex Consensus Cross-modal Mamba (MCCM) module enables dynamic collaboration among experts, reaching a consensus to efficiently integrate complementary information from multiple modalities. The cross-modal scanning within MCCM further strengthens feature interactions across modalities, facilitating seamless integration of critical information from both sources. Additionally, we introduce a Bi-level Self-supervised Contrastive Learning Loss (BSCL), which preserves high-frequency information without increasing computational overhead while simultaneously boosting performance in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) image fusion algorithms in tasks such as infrared-visible, medical, multi-focus, and multi-exposure fusion, as well as downstream visual tasks."

By combining energy-curvature diagnostics on periodic $N=24$ clusters with a refined characterization based on order parameters and correlation functions for open chains up to $N=144$, we establish a comprehensive phase diagram in the $φ$--$D_z$ plane. We identify four magnetically ordered phases -- FM-$z$, FM-$xy$, Néel-$z$, and a two-sublattice collinear LLRR2 state -- as well as magnetically disordered/critical regimes including Néel-$xy$, LLRR1, and two Kitaev spin-liquid (KSL) regions. A topological Haldane phase also emerges near the Heisenberg limit. Our results provide evidence that both AFM- and FM-KSL regimes acquire finite parameter widths in the spin-1 model, while the Haldane phase is fragile against Kitaev-type anisotropy, particularly for $D_z<0$. Increasing (decreasing) $D_z$ suppresses (enhances) magnetic order and expands (shrinks) the KSL and other magnetically disordered sectors. Also, at $D_z=0$, we identify an exactly solvable point at $φ=\\tan^{-1}(-2)$, which enforces a first-order transition between Néel-$z$ and LLRR2. We further contrast these findings with the spin-$1/2$ KH chain and with the spin-1 honeycomb KH model, highlighting the distinct roles of dimensionality and SIA in Kitaev-type magnets."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates a model-free solution to the stochastic linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problem for linear discrete-time systems with both multiplicative and additive noises. We formulate the stochastic LQR problem as a nonconvex optimization problem and rigorously analyze its dual problem structure. By exploiting the inherent convexity of the dual problem and analyzing Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions with respect to optimality in convex optimization, we establish an explicit relationship between the optimal point of the dual problem and the parameters of the associated Q-function. This theoretical insight, combined with the technique of the matrix direct sum, makes it possible to develop a novel model-free sample-efficient, non-iterative semidefinite programming algorithm that directly estimates optimal control gain without requiring an initial stabilizing controller, or noises measurability. The robustness of the model-free SDP method to errors is investigated. Our approach provides a new optimization-theoretic framework for understanding Q-learning algorithms while advancing the theoretical foundations of reinforcement learning in stochastic optimal control. Numerical validation on a pulse-width modulated inverter system demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness, particularly in achieving a single-step non-iterative solution without hyper-parameter tuning."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "Purpose: This paper explores gender differences in two distinct forms of risk aversion -- Payoff Risk Aversion (PaRA) and Price Risk Aversion (PrRA) -- in order to provide a more nuanced understanding of how men and women respond to different types of economic uncertainty. Design/methodology/approach: The study employs a laboratory experiment using Multiple-Choice-List (MCL) risk-elicitation tasks based on both Direct Utility Function (DUF) and Indirect Utility Function (IUF) frameworks. These tasks present stochastic payoffs and stochastic prices, respectively. The analysis uses statistical hypothesis testing to compare gender-specific responses across three experimental designs. Findings: The key results of the study indicate that women typically exhibit higher degrees of PaRA than men, which is a consistent finding with the mainstream literature. However, remarkably, the results from all the three indirect MCL designs show that women typically exhibit lower degrees of PrRA than men, and this result is robust across different MCL designs. The paper also introduces an 'irrationality gap' as the difference between PaRA and PrRA and explores the size of the irrationality gap within either gender group, finding it larger and statistically significant for men, while smaller and statistically insignificant for women. Originality/value: This study is the first to distinguish between PaRA and PrRA in a gender comparison, using experimentally validated methods. It provides new behavioral insights into the nature of gender-specific risk preferences and introduces the irrationality gap as a novel concept with implications for understanding financial decision-making and the design of gender-sensitive economic policies."

    "abstract": "Due to their inherent flexibility and autonomous operation, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to provide real-time biomedical edge computing service for wireless body area network (WBAN) users. In this paper, considering the time-varying task criticality characteristics of diverse WBAN users and the dual mobility between WBAN users and UAV, we investigate the dynamic task offloading and UAV flight trajectory optimization problem to minimize the weighted average task completion time of all the WBAN users, under the constraint of UAV energy consumption. To tackle the problem, an embodied AI-enhanced IoMT edge computing framework is established. Specifically, we propose a novel hierarchical multi-scale Transformer-based user trajectory prediction model based on the users' historical trajectory traces captured by the embodied AI agent (i.e., UAV). Afterwards, a prediction-enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm that integrates predicted users' mobility information is designed for intelligently optimizing UAV flight trajectory and task offloading decisions. Real-word movement traces and simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods in comparison with the existing benchmarks."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and the growing demand for their applications, efficient compression of the image inputs has become increasingly important. Existing VLMs predominantly digest and understand high-bitrate compressed images, while their ability to interpret low-bitrate compressed images has yet to be explored by far. In this paper, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the ability of VLM against compressed images, varying existing widely used image codecs and diverse set of tasks, encompassing over one million compressed images in our benchmark. Next, we analyse the source of performance gap, by categorising the gap from a) the information loss during compression and b) generalisation failure of VLM. We visualize these gaps with concrete examples and identify that for compressed images, only the generalization gap can be mitigated. Finally, we propose a universal VLM adaptor to enhance model performance on images compressed by existing codecs. Consequently, we demonstrate that a single adaptor can improve VLM performance across images with varying codecs and bitrates by 10%-30%. We believe that our benchmark and enhancement method provide valuable insights and contribute toward bridging the gap between VLMs and compressed images."

First, we implement a heterogeneous GNN with attention-based message passing, establishing a strong neural baseline. Second, we propose FlowKANet in which Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks replace standard MLP layers, reducing trainable parameters while maintaining competitive predictive performance. FlowKANet integrates KAMP-Attn (Kolmogorov-Arnold Message Passing with Attention), embedding KAN operators directly into message-passing and attention computation. Finally, we distill the model into symbolic surrogate models using block-wise regression, producing closed-form equations that eliminate trainable weights while preserving graph-structured dependencies. The results show that KAN layers provide a favorable trade-off between efficiency and accuracy and that symbolic surrogates emphasize the potential for lightweight deployment and enhanced transparency."

    "abstract": "Autonomous agents powered by LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are proficient consumers of digital content but remain unidirectional, a limitation we term epistemic asymmetry. This isolation leads to redundant reasoning and stagnates collective intelligence. Current self-reflection frameworks remain largely heuristic and private, lacking a probabilistic foundation to quantify certainty or justify external interaction.To bridge this gap, we propose a formal probabilistic framework that provides agents with a non-altruistic motive for bidirectional knowledge exchange. We model an agent's belief in a proposition using a Beta-Bernoulli distribution with a forgetting factor ($γ$). This allows us to isolate epistemic uncertainty as the variance of belief, establishing a dual drive for interaction: A homeostatic motive: The need to maintain certainty against the temporal decay introduced by $γ$. An optimal learning strategy: Targeting points of maximum ambiguity ($\\mathbb{E}[θ]=0.5$) to maximize information gain. Under this framework, public contribution is reframed as optimal active learning: sharing solutions to elicit feedback is the most efficient method for an agent to reduce its own uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce epistemic caching, which leverages the forgetting factor to dynamically prioritize resources for the active head of non-stationary knowledge distributions. Finally, we demonstrate how these accumulated belief states serve as verifiable reward signals for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and high-quality data filters for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Simulation results validate that this uncertainty-driven strategy significantly outperforms random baselines in heterogeneous (Zipfian) environments, maintaining high adaptability to concept drift."

While most existing studies focus on downlink and single-cell designs, the modeling and analysis of uplink RSMA under large-scale deployments remain largely unexplored. On the basis of stochastic geometry (SG), this paper introduces a unified analytical framework that integrates finite modulation and coding scheme (MCS)-based rate adaptation. This framework jointly captures spatial interference coupling and discrete rate behavior to bridge theoretical tractability and practical realism. Within this framework, we derive tractable expressions for the conditional received rate (CRR), its spatial average, and higher-order statistics via the meta distribution, thereby quantifying both the mean and user-specific rate performance. Results show that the proposed unified framework not only generalizes existing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) analyses but also provides new insights into how discrete rate adaptation reshapes interference dynamics and fairness in dense RSMA-enabled networks."

For real-valued G-additive functions (additive in the greedy G-digits), we establish an Erdős-Wintner-type theorem: convergence of two canonical series (a first-moment series and a quadratic digit-energy series) is necessary and sufficient for the existence of a limiting distribution along initial segments of the integers. In that case, the limiting characteristic function admits an explicit infinite-product factorization whose local factors depend only on the underlying digit system. We also indicate conditional extensions of this two-series criterion to Ostrowski numeration systems with bounded partial quotients and to Parry $β$-expansions with Pisot-Vijayaraghavan base $β$."

Among multipartite entangled states, Dicke states $|D_n^k\\rangle$ are distinguished by their permutation symmetry, which provides robustness against particle loss and enables applications for quantum communication and computation. Although Dicke states have been realized in various platforms, most optical implementations rely on postselection, which destroys the state upon detection and prevents its further use. A heralded optical scheme is therefore highly desirable. Here, we present a linear-optical heralded scheme for generating arbitrary Dicke states $|D_n^k\\rangle$ with $3n+k$ photons through the framework of the linear quantum graph (LQG) picture. By mapping the scheme design into the graph-finding problem, and exploiting the permutation symmetry of Dicke states, we overcome the structural complexity that has hindered previous approaches. Our results provide a resource-efficient pathway toward practical heralded preparation of Dicke states for quantum technologies."

Super and Ultra models are trained with NVFP4 and incorporate LatentMoE, a novel approach that improves model quality. The two larger models also include MTP layers for faster text generation.

Nano, the smallest model, outperforms comparable models in accuracy while remaining extremely cost-efficient for inference. Super is optimized for collaborative agents and high-volume workloads such as IT ticket automation. Ultra, the largest model, provides state-of-the-art accuracy and reasoning performance.

Using this dataset, we frame the construction year prediction task as ordinal regression and introduce popularity-aware interval accuracy metrics to quantify this bias. Our resulting benchmark of 30+ models, including our YearCLIP model, confirms that VLMs excel on popular, memorized items but struggle significantly with unrecognized subjects, exposing a critical flaw in their reasoning capabilities.

    "abstract": "Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), a vision foundation model has significantly advanced in prompt-driven video object segmentation, yet their practical deployment remains limited by the high computational and memory cost of processing dense visual tokens across time. The SAM2 pipelines typically propagate all visual tokens produced by the image encoder through downstream temporal reasoning modules, regardless of their relevance to the target object, resulting in reduced scalability due to quadratic memory attention overhead. In this work, we introduce a text-guided token pruning framework that improves inference efficiency by selectively reducing token density prior to temporal propagation, without modifying the underlying segmentation architecture. Operating after visual encoding and before memory based propagation, our method ranks tokens using a lightweight routing mechanism that integrates local visual context, semantic relevance derived from object-centric textual descriptions (either user-provided or automatically generated), and uncertainty cues that help preserve ambiguous or boundary critical regions. By retaining only the most informative tokens for downstream processing, the proposed approach reduces redundant computation while maintaining segmentation fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging video segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that post-encoder token pruning provides a practical and effective pathway to efficient, prompt-aware video segmentation, achieving up to 42.50 percent faster inference and 37.41 percent lower GPU memory usage compared to the unpruned baseline SAM2, while preserving competitive J and F performance. These results highlight the potential of early token selection to improve the scalability of transformer-based video segmentation systems for real-time and resource-constrained applications."

    "abstract": "Gravitational waves provide a unique window into gravity, cosmology, and high-energy physics, enabling the exploration of fundamental phenomena across a wide range of scales. This review presents a coherent and pedagogical framework that bridges foundational theory with observational frontiers. We begin by developing the theory of gravitational radiation within linearized general relativity, deriving gravitational waves as solutions to the linearized Einstein equations and clarifying their physical interpretation, polarization states, and key properties. We then deepen the discussion through a geometric perspective, tracing the connection between gravitational radiation and the algebraic structure of the Weyl tensor and its role in defining energy and angular momentum in asymptotically flat spacetimes. Extending beyond flat backgrounds, we examine gravitational waves in an expanding universe, following their evolution across cosmological epochs and their generation during inflation. Within this setting, we discuss adiabatic modes and consistency relations that reveal universal properties of long-wavelength perturbations, and derive the inflationary spectrum of vacuum gravitational waves together with their contribution to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. We also survey the main observational strategies for detecting gravitational waves across a broad frequency range, including cosmic microwave background polarization, pulsar timing arrays, ground- and space-based laser interferometers, and resonant cavity detectors. We then discuss the astrophysical and cosmological mechanisms responsible for generating gravitational radiation. We conclude by summarizing the current status of the field and outlining promising directions for future theoretical and observational developments."

    "abstract": "Minimizing PDE-residual losses is a common strategy to promote physical consistency in neural operators. However, standard formulations often lack variational correctness, meaning that small residuals do not guarantee small solution errors due to the use of non-compliant norms or ad hoc penalty terms for boundary conditions. This work develops a variationally correct operator learning framework by constructing first-order system least-squares (FOSLS) objectives whose values are provably equivalent to the solution error in PDE-induced norms. We demonstrate this framework on stationary diffusion and linear elasticity, incorporating mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions via variational lifts to preserve norm equivalence without inconsistent penalties. To ensure the function space conformity required by the FOSLS loss, we propose a Reduced Basis Neural Operator (RBNO). The RBNO predicts coefficients for a pre-computed, conforming reduced basis, thereby ensuring variational stability by design while enabling efficient training. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis that bounds the total error by the sum of finite element discretization bias, reduced basis truncation error, neural network approximation error, and statistical estimation errors arising from finite sampling and optimization. Numerical benchmarks validate these theoretical bounds and demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior accuracy in PDE-compliant norms compared to standard baselines, while the residual loss serves as a reliable, computable a posteriori error estimator."

    "abstract": "As hyperscale and co-located data centers scale, the electric grid sees an increase in large, voltage-sensitive IT loads with these data center plant size ranging between 500 MW to 2 GW. A sudden loss of these loads as they switch to onsite UPS during grid voltage excursion events causes a grid frequency rise from generation and load imbalance, and a voltage rise because less power is flowing through the network. This paper proposes and theoretically demonstrates the use of high voltage circuit breaker operated braking resistors at data center transmission substations as an effective strategy in enhancing grid resilience under such large load loss scenarios. We developed a test bed to illustrate the dynamic behavior of the system with resistive braking on a gigawatt scale data center load cluster connected to a 345 kV network. The braking resistor(s), which in the case of inverter rich system comes in a multi-stage configuration, are connected or disconnected via high-speed circuit breaker(s). Results show that insertion for 0.25 to 0.85 seconds sufficiently reduce rate of change of frequency and provides time for primary governor response and capacitor switching to restore steady state. Sensitivity across different synchronous machines and inverter-based resource mix are tested and confirms robustness. We conclude circuit breaker controlled resistive braking is a practical means to enhance Bulk Electric System (BES) resilience for gigawatt scale data centers. The approach integrates with protection, needs no generator changes, and can be scaled with cluster size or growth of the data center facility load."

    "abstract": "Modern surgical systems increasingly rely on intelligent scene understanding to provide timely situational awareness for enhanced intra-operative safety. Within this pipeline, surgical scene segmentation plays a central role in accurately perceiving operative events. Although recent deep learning models, particularly large-scale foundation models, achieve remarkable segmentation accuracy, their substantial computational demands and power consumption hinder real-time deployment in resource-constrained surgical environments. To address this limitation, we explore the emerging SNN as a promising paradigm for highly efficient surgical intelligence. However, their performance is still constrained by the scarcity of labeled surgical data and the inherently sparse nature of surgical video representations. To this end, we propose \\textit{SpikeSurgSeg}, the first spike-driven video Transformer framework tailored for surgical scene segmentation with real-time potential on non-GPU platforms. To address the limited availability of surgical annotations, we introduce a surgical-scene masked autoencoding pretraining strategy for SNNs that enables robust spatiotemporal representation learning via layer-wise tube masking. Building on this pretrained backbone, we further adopt a lightweight spike-driven segmentation head that produces temporally consistent predictions while preserving the low-latency characteristics of SNNs. Extensive experiments on EndoVis18 and our in-house SurgBleed dataset demonstrate that SpikeSurgSeg achieves mIoU comparable to SOTA ANN-based models while reducing inference latency by at least $8\\times$. Notably, it delivers over $20\\times$ acceleration relative to most foundation-model baselines, underscoring its potential for time-critical surgical scene segmentation."

The nonclassical area quantifier rooted in homodyne tomography, allows us to assess the nonclassical nature of the vdPo's state directly from the tomogram without requiring full state reconstruction or the Wigner function negativity. Within a well-defined parameter regime of drive strength and detuning, both $δ$ and $g^{(2)}(0)$ exhibit pronounced signatures of synchronization that complements the phase coherence between the drive and the vdPo. We derive an analytical expression for the steady-state density matrix and the corresponding tomogram of the system, valid for arbitrary strengths of the harmonic drive. Analysis of the quantum tomogram uncovers clear phase-locking behavior, enabling the identification of the synchronization region (Arnold tongue) directly in terms of experimentally measurable quantities. Furthermore, the behaviour of $g^{(2)}(0)$ provides a statistical perspective that reinforces the tomographic signatures of QS. By analyzing the interplay between these metrics, we can gain more profound insights into the underlying mechanisms that govern QS in such systems."

    "abstract": "Poorly transparent barriers (e.g., reinforced walls, shielding panels, metallic or high-contrast dielectrics) strongly reflect incident radiation, limiting wireless power transfer (WPT) unless the barrier is structurally modified to support a narrowband transparency window. Here we introduce a barrier-agnostic alternative based on coherent scattering control: a phase-locked auxiliary wave is launched from the receiver side with an amplitude and phase chosen from the measured complex scattering parameters of the barrier. In a two-port (single-channel-per-side) description, we derive closed-form conditions for (i) canceling back-reflection toward the transmitter and (ii) maximizing the net extracted power at the receiver side. In the lossless limit these conditions imply unit transmitter-to-receiver efficiency (all transmitter power is routed to the receiver side) even when the barrier is nearly opaque under one-sided illumination. We validate the concept using (1) an analytically solvable high-index Fabry--Pérot slab and (2) a numerically simulated perforated PEC metasurface exhibiting vanishing one-sided transmission; in both cases, coherent assistance yields near-unity transmission and large enhancement factors. We further analyze dissipative barriers using a receiver-side energy-balance metric, showing that substantial net delivery can persist well into the lossy regime. The approach is closely related to coherent perfect absorption and time-reversal ideas in wave physics, but targets \\emph{reflectionless delivery through barriers} without modifying the obstacle itself."

    "abstract": "This paper provides a rigorous derivation and analysis of accelerated optimization algorithms through the lens of High-Resolution Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). While classical Nesterov acceleration is well-understood via asymptotic vanishing damping, the dynamics of Anderson Acceleration (AA) remain less transparent. This work makes significant theoretical contributions to AA by bridging discrete acceleration algorithms with continuous dynamical systems, while also providing practical algorithmic innovations. Our work addresses fundamental questions about the physical nature of Anderson Acceleration that have remained unanswered since its introduction in 1965. Firstly, we prove that AA can be exactly rewritten as an adaptive momentum method and, in the high-resolution limit, converges to a second-order ODE with Variable Effective Mass. Through a Lyapunov energy analysis, we reveal the specific instability mechanism of standard AA: unchecked growth in effective mass acts as negative damping, physically injecting energy into the system and violating dissipation constraints. Conversely, high-resolution analysis identifies an implicit Hessian-driven damping term that provides stabilization in stiff regimes. Leveraging these dynamical insights, we then propose Energy-Guarded Anderson Acceleration (EG-AA), an algorithm that acts as an inertial governor to enforce thermodynamic consistency. Morevoer, our convergence analysis, formulated via the Acceleration Gain Factor, proves that EG-AA improves upon gradient descent by maximizing the geometric contraction of the linear subspace projection while actively suppressing nonlinear approximation errors. Theoretical bounds confirm that EG-AA is no worse than standard AA, and numerical experiments demonstrate strictly improved convergence stability and rates in ill-conditioned convex composite problems compared to standard Anderson mixing."

Specifically, the optimal path measure is shown to admit an explicit density relative to a reference diffusion, generalizing the classical Schrödinger system. For the pure Schrödinger case, i.e., when the transport cost is zero, we further characterize the flow of time marginals of the optimal bridge, recovering known results in the entropic setting and providing new descriptions for non-entropic divergences including the chi-divergence."

However, its practical realization is often hindered by prohibitive costs and complex real-world constraints. Although emerging video generation models offer a virtual alternative, existing approaches typically rely on naive clip concatenation, which frequently fails to maintain visual smoothness and temporal coherence. In this paper, we introduce DreaMontage, a comprehensive framework designed for arbitrary frame-guided generation, capable of synthesizing seamless, expressive, and long-duration one-shot videos from diverse user-provided inputs. To achieve this, we address the challenge through three primary dimensions. (i) We integrate a lightweight intermediate-conditioning mechanism into the DiT architecture. By employing an Adaptive Tuning strategy that effectively leverages base training data, we unlock robust arbitrary-frame control capabilities. (ii) To enhance visual fidelity and cinematic expressiveness, we curate a high-quality dataset and implement a Visual Expression SFT stage. In addressing critical issues such as subject motion rationality and transition smoothness, we apply a Tailored DPO scheme, which significantly improves the success rate and usability of the generated content. (iii) To facilitate the production of extended sequences, we design a Segment-wise Auto-Regressive (SAR) inference strategy that operates in a memory-efficient manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves visually striking and seamlessly coherent one-shot effects while maintaining computational efficiency, empowering users to transform fragmented visual materials into vivid, cohesive one-shot cinematic experiences."

It accounts for both the decrease and increase of the relaxation time with growing dipolar coupling, a long-standing problem in nanoparticle magnetism, as classical phenomenological models fail to elucidate this transition. This result also offers an innovative interpretation of the cut-off temperature, $T_{cut-off}$, as a spin glass transition under the Tsallis distribution framework within the context of Néel-Brown's relaxation theory, thereby contributing to ongoing scientific discussions regarding this phenomenon."

However, collecting demonstration datasets is costly: it often requires access to robots and needs sustained effort in a tedious, long process. These factors limit the scale of data available for training policies. We aim to address this scalability challenge by involving a broader audience in a gamified data collection experience that is both accessible and motivating. Specifically, we develop a gamified remote teleoperation platform, RoboCade, to engage general users in collecting data that is beneficial for downstream policy training. To do this, we embed gamification strategies into the design of the system interface and data collection tasks. In the system interface, we include components such as visual feedback, sound effects, goal visualizations, progress bars, leaderboards, and badges. We additionally propose principles for constructing gamified tasks that have overlapping structure with useful downstream target tasks. We instantiate RoboCade on three manipulation tasks -- including spatial arrangement, scanning, and insertion. To illustrate the viability of gamified robot data collection, we collect a demonstration dataset through our platform, and show that co-training robot policies with this data can improve success rate on non-gamified target tasks (+16-56%). Further, we conduct a user study to validate that novice users find the gamified platform significantly more enjoyable than a standard non-gamified platform (+24%). These results highlight the promise of gamified data collection as a scalable, accessible, and engaging method for collecting demonstration data."

In the present work, neutron-rich $^{14}$C and $^{16}$C ion beams at 27.5 MeV/nucleon were used to bombard carbon and polyethylene (CD$_{2}$)$_{n}$ targets. Energy and angular distributions of the produced fragments were measured. Background events originating from the carbon content in (CD$_{2}$)$_{n}$ target were efficiently excluded using an extended $E-P$ plot method. Experimental results are systematically analyzed by using HIPSE-SIMON dynamic model. The comparison reveals that, for the carbon target, the HIPSE-SIMON calculation overestimates the yields of the beam-velocity component for fragments near the projectile and also the energy phase space for fragments far away from the projectile, suggesting fine tuning of the overall interaction profile adopted in the model. In contrast, for reactions with the deuteron target, the model calculation can reasonably reproduce the experimental data. The implication of the fragmentation mechanism to the validity of the invariant mass method, as frequently used to reconstruct the clustering resonant structures in light nuclei, is also discussed."

By explicitly constructing reduced density matrices for (mock) nucleon, pion, and anti-nucleon subsystems from light-front wave functions, we compute key entanglement witnesses, including von Neumann entropy, mutual information, and linear entropy, in both quenched (no sea pairs) and unquenched frameworks. We find that the entanglement entropy is closely related to the Shannon entropy of the transverse momentum dependent distribution, establishing a link between quantum information and parton structure. In contrast, the unquenched theory reveals genuinely non-classical correlations: the entanglement entropy cannot be reduced to any Shannon entropy of normalized parton distributions, demonstrating that the full hadronic wave function encodes quantum information beyond classical probabilities. Our findings highlight the role of entanglement as a fundamental probe of non-perturbative dynamics in relativistic quantum field theory and lay the groundwork for extending these concepts to QCD and future collider phenomenology."

PhononBench reveals a widespread limitation of current generative models in ensuring dynamical stability: the average dynamical-stability rate across all generated structures is only 25.83%, with the top-performing model, MatterGen, reaching just 41.0%. Further case studies show that in property-targeted generation-illustrated here by band-gap conditioning with MatterGen--the dynamical-stability rate remains as low as 23.5% even at the optimal band-gap condition of 0.5 eV. In space-group-controlled generation, higher-symmetry crystals exhibit better stability (e.g., cubic systems achieve rates up to 49.2%), yet the average stability across all controlled generations is still only 34.4%. An important additional outcome of this study is the identification of 28,119 crystal structures that are phonon-stable across the entire Brillouin zone, providing a substantial pool of reliable candidates for future materials exploration. By establishing the first large-scale dynamical-stability benchmark, this work systematically highlights the current limitations of crystal generation models and offers essential evaluation criteria and guidance for their future development toward the design and discovery of physically viable materials.

Runtime safety guardrails, which intercept hazardous actions during task execution, offer a promising solution due to their flexibility. However, existing defenses often rely on static rule filters or prompt-level control, which struggle to address implicit risks arising in dynamic, temporally dependent, and context-rich environments. To address this, we propose RoboSafe, a hybrid reasoning runtime safeguard for embodied agents through executable predicate-based safety logic. RoboSafe integrates two complementary reasoning processes on a Hybrid Long-Short Safety Memory. We first propose a Backward Reflective Reasoning module that continuously revisits recent trajectories in short-term memory to infer temporal safety predicates and proactively triggers replanning when violations are detected. We then propose a Forward Predictive Reasoning module that anticipates upcoming risks by generating context-aware safety predicates from the long-term safety memory and the agent's multimodal observations. Together, these components form an adaptive, verifiable safety logic that is both interpretable and executable as code. Extensive experiments across multiple agents demonstrate that RoboSafe substantially reduces hazardous actions (-36.8% risk occurrence) compared with leading baselines, while maintaining near-original task performance. Real-world evaluations on physical robotic arms further confirm its practicality. Code will be released upon acceptance."

Our architecture employs two complementary components: 1) An Encoder-Decoder Attractor (EDA) network that automatically infers both the source count and corresponding acoustic clues for SS, and 2) A multi-modal fusion network that precisely interprets diverse user-provided clues (acoustic, semantic, or visual) for TSE. Through joint training with cross-task consistency constraints, we establish a unified latent space that bridges both paradigms. During inference, the system adaptively operates in either fully autonomous SS mode or clue-driven TSE mode. Experiments demonstrate remarkable performance in both tasks, with notable improvements of 1.4 dB SDR improvement in SS compared to baseline and 86\\% TSE accuracy."

The waveform modification is derived by incorporating the scalar charge correcting the fluxes and orbital trajectories of the secondary. Our results indicate that, under suitable parameter configurations, the influence of the scalar charge on EMRIs waveform in such environments can be distinguished from that in vacuum spacetime. For the EMRIs signal modified by the astrophysical environments, the future space-borne detector can determine the relative error of scalar charge constrained by LISA at the level of $\\sim0.1$, providing a preliminary prediction of detecting scalar charge in the beyond-vacuum spacetime."

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel quantum optimization paradigm: the Fixed-Parameter-Count Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (FPC-QAOA). It is a scalable variational framework that maintains a constant number of trainable parameters regardless of the number of qubits, Hamiltonian complexity, or circuit depth. By separating schedule function optimization from circuit digitization, FPC-QAOA enables accurate schedule approximations with minimal parameters while supporting arbitrarily deep digitized adiabatic evolutions, constrained only by NISQ hardware capabilities. This separation allows depth to scale without expanding the classical search space, mitigating overparameterization and optimization challenges typical of deep QAOA circuits, such as barren plateaus-like behaviors. We benchmark FPC-QAOA on random MaxCut instances and the Tail Assignment Problem, achieving performance comparable to or better than standard QAOA with nearly constant classical effort and significantly fewer quantum circuit evaluations. Experiments on the IBM Kingston superconducting processor with up to 50 qubits confirm robustness and hardware efficiency under realistic noise. These results position FPC-QAOA as a practical and scalable paradigm for variational quantum optimization on near-term quantum devices."

    "abstract": "Few-shot image generation aims to effectively adapt a source generative model to a target domain using very few training images. Most existing approaches introduce consistency constraints-typically through instance-level or distribution-level loss functions-to directly align the distribution patterns of source and target domains within their respective latent spaces. However, these strategies often fall short: overly strict constraints can amplify the negative effects of the domain gap, leading to distorted or uninformative content, while overly relaxed constraints may fail to leverage the source domain effectively. This limitation primarily stems from the inherent discrepancy in the underlying distribution structures of the source and target domains. The scarcity of target samples further compounds this issue by hindering accurate estimation of the target domain's distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose Equivariant Feature Rotation (EFR), a novel adaptation strategy that aligns source and target domains at two complementary levels within a self-rotated proxy feature space. Specifically, we perform adaptive rotations within a parameterized Lie Group to transform both source and target features into an equivariant proxy space, where alignment is conducted. These learnable rotation matrices serve to bridge the domain gap by preserving intra-domain structural information without distortion, while the alignment optimization facilitates effective knowledge transfer from the source to the target domain. Comprehensive experiments on a variety of commonly used datasets demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the generative performance within the targeted domain."

U-GEPSVM extends the GEPSVM framework by incorporating Universum constraints through a ratio-based objective function, while IU-GEPSVM enhances stability through a weighted difference-based formulation that provides independent control over class separation and Universum alignment. The models are evaluated on the Bonn University EEG dataset across two binary classification tasks: (O vs S)-healthy (eyes closed) vs seizure, and (Z vs S)-healthy (eyes open) vs seizure.

BALLAST selects from a discrete set of timeout \"arms\" using efficient linear contextual bandits (LinUCB variants), and augments learning with safe exploration to cap risk during unstable periods. We evaluate BALLAST on a reproducible discrete-event simulation with long-tail delay, loss, correlated bursts, node heterogeneity, and partition/recovery turbulence.

By analyzing the box and triangle loop diagrams with nonrelativistic effective field theory power counting rule, we demonstrate that box diagrams dominate these dipion transitions processes. Branching ratios are calculated as functions of the mixing angle $θ$, which parameterizes the neutral and charged meson compositions of the $X(3872)$.

In the SIMS, the photon index decreases from 2.1 to 1.7, indicating spectral hardening. The power density spectra (PDS) suggest the presence of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the HIMS and SIMS. The QPO frequency evolves from 0.1 Hz to 0.2 Hz in the HIMS, and further to 5.7 Hz in the SIMS. We also observe a decrease in QPO frequency from 5.7 Hz to 4.5 Hz during the SIMS. We discuss the evolution of the QPO, fractional root mean square (rms) amplitude, and time-lag spectra. We discover that variations in disc normalization, disc temperature, and coronal heating rate can reproduce the observed rms and lag spectra with a time delay between them."

Notably, prior work has demonstrated that security is often overlooked, exposing that LLMs are prone to generating code with security vulnerabilities. These insights were enabled by specialized benchmarks, crafted through significant manual effort by security experts. However, relying on manually-crafted benchmarks is insufficient in the long term, because benchmarks (i) naturally end up contaminating training data, (ii) must extend to new tasks to provide a more complete picture, and (iii) must increase in difficulty to challenge more capable LLMs. In this work, we address these challenges and present AutoBaxBuilder, a framework that generates tasks and tests for code security benchmarking from scratch. We introduce a robust pipeline with fine-grained plausibility checks, leveraging the code understanding capabilities of LLMs to construct functionality tests and end-to-end security-probing exploits. To confirm the quality of the generated benchmark, we conduct both a qualitative analysis and perform quantitative experiments, comparing it against tasks constructed by human experts. We use AutoBaxBuilder to construct entirely new tasks and release them to the public as AutoBaxBench, together with a thorough evaluation of the security capabilities of LLMs on these tasks. We find that a new task can be generated in under 2 hours, costing less than USD 10."

However, many such systems are not ideal for asteroseismology due to uncertainties in mass transfer with close companions and the challenges of dynamically measuring all components' physical properties. The triple system DG~Leo, comprising an inner binary and a distant $δ$ Scuti star, is an ideal target due to its well-separated pulsator. By combining new \\textit{TESS} photometry with archival spectroscopy, our dynamical analysis shows that the system's three components share similar masses, radii, and luminosities within errors, occupying coincident Hertzsprung--Russell diagram positions, indicative of coeval evolution. By fitting seven observed $δ$ Scuti frequencies through asteroseismic modeling with dynamically constrained theoretical grids, we simultaneously trace the pulsating star's evolution and constrain the triple system's evolutionary stage, with the derived fundamental parameters showing consistency with the dynamical solutions. Our analysis reveals that all three components of DG~Leo are in the post-main-sequence phase, with a system age of $0.7664^{+0.1402}_{-0.1258}$~Gyr. Additionally, the $δ$ Scuti component shows multiple non-radial modes with significant mixed-character frequencies, providing precise constraints on its convective core extent ($R_{\\mathrm{cz}}/R = 0.0562^{+0.0137}_{-0.0021}$)."

We introduce \\textbf{ClarifyMT-Bench}, a benchmark for multi-turn clarification grounded in a five-dimensional ambiguity taxonomy and a set of six behaviorally diverse simulated user personas. Through a hybrid LLM-human pipeline, we construct 6,120 multi-turn dialogues capturing diverse ambiguity sources and interaction patterns. Evaluating ten representative LLMs uncovers a consistent under-clarification bias: LLMs tend to answer prematurely, and performance degrades as dialogue depth increases. To mitigate this, we propose \\textbf{ClarifyAgent}, an agentic approach that decomposes clarification into perception, forecasting, tracking, and planning, substantially improving robustness across ambiguity conditions. ClarifyMT-Bench establishes a reproducible foundation for studying when LLMs should ask, when they should answer, and how to navigate ambiguity in real-world human-LLM interactions."

    "abstract": "Traffic classification on programmable data plane holds great promise for line-rate processing, with methods evolving from per-packet to flow-level analysis for higher accuracy. However, a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency persists. Statistical feature-based methods align with hardware constraints but often exhibit limited accuracy, while online deep learning methods using packet sequential features achieve superior accuracy but require substantial computational resources. This paper presents Synecdoche, the first traffic classification framework that successfully deploys packet sequential features on a programmable data plane via pattern matching, achieving both high accuracy and efficiency. Our key insight is that discriminative information concentrates in short sub-sequences--termed Key Segments--that serve as compact traffic features for efficient data plane matching. Synecdoche employs an \"offline discovery, online matching\" paradigm: deep learning models automatically discover Key Segment patterns offline, which are then compiled into optimized table entries for direct data plane matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate Synecdoche's superior accuracy, improving F1-scores by up to 26.4% against statistical methods and 18.3% against online deep learning methods, while reducing latency by 13.0% and achieving 79.2% reduction in SRAM usage.

Our analysis demonstrates the circumvention of reliable safety mechanisms through emotional framing, progressive revelation, and academic justification techniques. Notably, reasoning-enabled configurations amplified rather than mitigated the effectiveness of exploitation, increasing factual precision while failing to interrogate the underlying intent. The exception was Claude Opus 4.1, which prioritized intent detection over information provision in some use cases.

    "abstract": "MuJoCo is a powerful and efficient physics simulator widely used in robotics. One common way it is applied in practice is through Model Predictive Control (MPC), which uses repeated rollouts of the simulator to optimize future actions and generate responsive control policies in real time. To make this process more accessible, the open source library MuJoCo MPC (MJPC) provides ready-to-use MPC algorithms and implementations built directly on top of the MuJoCo simulator. However, MJPC relies on finite differencing (FD) to compute derivatives through the underlying MuJoCo simulator, which is often a key bottleneck that can make it prohibitively costly for time-sensitive tasks, especially in high-DOF systems or complex scenes. In this paper, we introduce the use of Web of Affine Spaces (WASP) derivatives within MJPC as a drop-in replacement for FD. WASP is a recently developed approach for efficiently computing sequences of accurate derivative approximations. By reusing information from prior, related derivative calculations, WASP accelerates and stabilizes the computation of new derivatives, making it especially well suited for MPC's iterative, fine-grained updates over time. We evaluate WASP across a diverse suite of MJPC tasks spanning multiple robot embodiments. Our results suggest that WASP derivatives are particularly effective in MJPC: it integrates seamlessly across tasks, delivers consistently robust performance, and achieves up to a 2$\\mathsf{x}$ speedup compared to an FD backend when used with derivative-based planners, such as iLQG. In addition, WASP-based MPC outperforms MJPC's stochastic sampling-based planners on our evaluation tasks, offering both greater efficiency and reliability. To support adoption and future research, we release an open-source implementation of MJPC with WASP derivatives fully integrated."

The method builds a shared encoding structure to represent diverse monitoring indicators in a unified manner and employs a state fusion mechanism to capture trend changes and local disturbances across different time scales. A cross-task structural propagation module is introduced to model potential dependencies among nodes, enabling the model to understand complex structural patterns formed by resource contention, link interactions, and changes in service topology. To enhance adaptability to non-stationary behaviors, the framework incorporates a dynamic adjustment mechanism that automatically regulates internal feature flows according to system state changes, ensuring stable predictions in the presence of sudden load shifts, topology drift, and resource jitter. The experimental evaluation compares multiple models across various metrics and verifies the effectiveness of the framework through analyses of hyperparameter sensitivity, environmental sensitivity, and data sensitivity. The results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance on several error metrics and provides more accurate representations of future states under different operating conditions. Overall, the unified forecasting framework offers reliable predictive capability for high-dimensional, multi-task, and strongly dynamic environments in cloud native systems and provides essential technical support for intelligent backend management."

In our previous work arXiv:2505.03664, this issue was resolved by employing the rigid D6-branes on the $\\mathbb{T}^6/(\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2^\\prime)$ orientifold with discrete torsion, where fractional cycles eliminate all adjoint scalars. In this paper, we construct new three-family flux models in the Type IIB setup on $\\mathbb{T}^6/(\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2)$, T-dual to the Type IIA rigid D6-brane construction with discrete torsion, by introducing the quantized background $G_3$ flux that stabilizes the closed-string complex structure moduli and axio-dilaton. The resulting Pati-Salam gauge symmetry can be spontaneously broken down to the Standard Model via a supersymmetry-preserving Higgs mechanism. All the consistency conditions, including $\\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry, RR tadpole cancellation, and K-theory constraints, are satisfied. We present the complete particle spectra for these models and discuss how exotic states dynamically decouple through strong dynamics in the hidden sector."

However, their effectiveness has not been fully explained, and they require a long period of time for inference. This paper presents a novel multi-task model that utilizes non-causal attention to capture the entire table structure, and a parallel inference algorithm for faster cell content inference.

Such measurements serve as important benchmarks for nuclear physics calculations and can also be used to characterize background in astroparticle physics experiments.

This was done by comparing the experimental spectral shape with the estimates from various phenomenological models. The $^{87}$Rb source was embedded directly within the detector material of a new Rb$_2$ZrCl$_6$ crystal scintillator; the data taking was performed deep underground at Gran Sasso National Laboratory. The obtained experimental half-life value for the studied process is T$_{1/2} = 5.08(13) \\times$ 10$^{10}$ yr; while a $g_{\\rm A}$ value in the range 0.4 to 0.6 is obtained when accounting for uncertainties and depending on the model adopted as discussed in detail in the text."

We prove an if-and-only-if characterization: when (i) methods observe only the aggregate outcome (aggregate-only observation) and (ii) evaluation depends only on the submitted artifact and not on the algorithm's identity or provenance (algorithm-blind evaluation), swapping humans for personas is just panel change from the method's point of view, indistinguishable from changing the evaluation population (e.g., New York to Jakarta). Furthermore, we move from validity to usefulness: we define an information-theoretic discriminability of the induced aggregate channel and show that making persona benchmarking as decision-relevant as a field experiment is fundamentally a sample-size question, yielding explicit bounds on the number of independent persona evaluations required to reliably distinguish meaningfully different methods at a chosen resolution."

However, discovering materials with intrinsically high spin Hall conductivity (SHC) is hindered by the vast chemical space and expensive nature of conventional experimental and first-principles methods. In this work, we employ an active learning framework to accelerate the discovery of high-SHC 2D materials. Machine learning (ML) models were trained on SHC values computed from density functional theory calculations, incorporating the Kubo formalism via tight-binding Hamiltonians constructed from maximally localized Wannier functions, with explicit treatment of spin-orbit coupling. Starting from random but chemically diverse 24 2D systems, the dataset was expanded to 41 cases (from an overall pool of around 2000 materials) over three active learning loops using an expected improvement acquisition strategy. The ML technique successfully identified several high SHC candidates with the best candidate exhibiting a SHC of 271.52 (hbar/e) Ohm^-1, nearly 23 times higher than the top performer in the initial round. Beyond candidate discovery, several features such as orbital symmetry near the Fermi energy, types of atomic species, material composition, covalent radii, and electronegativity of constituent atoms were found to play critical role in shaping the spin Hall response in 2D systems. The data generated is made publicly available to facilitate further advances in 2D spintronics."

We present quantum mechanical $j_z$-conserving coupled-states calculations of state-resolved cross sections for H/D--CO$_2$ collisions at energies up to 5~eV, benchmarked to within 7\\% of close-coupling results. Scattering is strongly forward-peaked, yielding momentum-transfer cross sections substantially smaller than commonly assumed: mass-scaling from O/C--CO$_2$ systems overestimates H--CO$_2$ total cross sections by factors of 30--45, while existing empirical fits underestimate the low-energy regime by up to $\\sim$45\\%. Isotopic substitution (H/D) produces energy-dependent differences of up to 35\\% at $E<0.1$~eV, invalidating uniform scaling approaches for D/H fractionation. Maxwellian-averaged rate coefficients derived from our cross sections are significantly smaller than mass-scaled values, implying reduced H--CO$_2$ energy transfer efficiency. In atmospheric escape modelling, these revisions can shift Martian exobase altitudes by 10--20~km, leading to order-unity changes in thermal escape rates, and have implications for hydrogen loss in early CO$_2$-dominated planetary atmospheres.

However, one of the bottlenecks of these models is slow sampling due to the delay before the onset of trajectory bifurcation, at which point substantial reconstruction begins. This issue degrades generation quality, especially in the early stages. Our primary objective is to mitigate bifurcation-related issues by preprocessing the training data to enhance reconstruction quality, particularly for small-scale network architectures. Specifically, we propose applying Gaussianization preprocessing to the training data to make the target distribution more closely resemble an independent Gaussian distribution, which serves as the initial density of the reconstruction process. This preprocessing step simplifies the model's task of learning the target distribution, thereby improving generation quality even in the early stages of reconstruction with small networks. The proposed method is, in principle, applicable to a broad range of generative tasks, enabling more stable and efficient sampling processes."

Analyzing hypergraph properties such as triad counts is essential, as hypergraphs can reveal intricate group interaction patterns that conventional graphs fail to capture. In real-world scenarios, these networks are often large and dynamic, introducing significant computational challenges. Due to the absence of specialized software packages and data structures, the analysis of large dynamic hypergraphs remains largely unexplored. Motivated by this gap, we propose ESCHER, a GPU-centric parallel data structure for Efficient and Scalable Hypergraph Evolution Representation, designed to manage large scale hypergraph dynamics efficiently. We also design a hypergraph triad-count update framework that minimizes redundant computation while fully leveraging the capabilities of ESCHER for dynamic operations. We validate the efficacy of our approach across multiple categories of hypergraph triad counting, including hyperedge-based, incident-vertex-based, and temporal triads. Empirical results on both large real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving speedups of up to 104.5x, 473.7x, and 112.5x for hyperedge-based, incident-vertex-based, and temporal triad types, respectively."

In this work, we present a practical method to extract dielectric properties of STE multilayers using the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM). By comparing the THz pulse calculated using the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) with the experimentally measured pulse transmitted through the sample, we can extract the dielectric properties of STEs, enhancing THz-TDS analysis and facilitating STE design and optimization. This method avoids constructing complex transfer functions, accommodates diverse sample geometries, and is designed to be accessible, with a publicly available codebase, making it a useful tool for STE research."

Specifically, a sufficient quantity of normal samples is amassed to train a diffusion model capable of generating normal X-ray images. This pre-trained diffusion model is subsequently utilized to inpaint the head lesions present in the diseased X-rays, thereby preserving the tail classes as augmented training data. Additionally, we propose the integration of a Large Language Model Knowledge Guidance (LKG) module alongside a Progressive Incremental Learning (PIL) strategy to stabilize the inpainting fine-tuning process.

The state-of-the-art method, Ring-Attention, suffers from scalability limitations due to its excessive communication traffic. This paper proposes a new distributed attention algorithm, Mesh-Attention, by rethinking the design space of distributed attention with a new matrix-based model. Our method assigns a two-dimensional tile -- rather than one-dimensional row or column -- of computation blocks to each GPU to achieve higher efficiency through lower communication-computation (CommCom) ratio. The general approach covers Ring-Attention as a special case, and allows the tuning of CommCom ratio with different tile shapes. Importantly, we propose a greedy algorithm that can efficiently search the scheduling space within the tile with restrictions that ensure efficient communication among GPUs. The theoretical analysis shows that Mesh-Attention leads to a much lower communication complexity and exhibits good scalability comparing to other current algorithms. Our extensive experiment results show that Mesh-Attention can achieve up to 3.4x speedup (2.9x on average) and reduce the communication volume by up to 85.4% (79.0% on average) on 256 GPUs. Our scalability results further demonstrate that Mesh-Attention sustains superior performance as the system scales, substantially reducing overhead in large-scale deployments. The results convincingly confirm the advantage of Mesh-Attention."

Distinctively, we show the predictability of prices and availability in a spot instance market, the power of prediction in enabling cost-efficient scheduling and its sensitivity to estimation errors. An integer programming problem is formulated to capture the use of mixed instances under both the price and availability dynamics. We propose an online allocation algorithm with prediction based on the committed horizon control approach that leverages a \\emph{commitment level} to enforce the partial sequence of decisions. When this prediction becomes inaccurate, we further present a complementary online algorithm without predictions. An online policy selection algorithm is developed that learns the best policy from a pool constructed by varying the parameters of both algorithms. We prove that the prediction-based algorithm achieves tighter performance bounds as prediction error decreases, while the policy selection algorithm possesses a regret bound of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T})$. Experimental results demonstrate that our online framework can adaptively select the best policy under varying spot market dynamics and prediction quality, consistently outperforming baselines and improving utility by up to 54.8\\%."

We release an open-source, multi-fidelity aerodynamic dataset for double-delta wings, comprising 2448 flow snapshots across 272 geometries evaluated at angles of attack from 11 (degree) to 19 (degree) at Ma=0.3 using both Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) and Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solvers. The geometries are generated using a nested Saltelli sampling scheme to support future dataset expansion and variance-based sensitivity analysis. Using this dataset, we conduct a preliminary empirical scaling study of the MF-VortexNet surrogate by constructing six training datasets with sizes ranging from 40 to 1280 snapshots and training models with 0.1 to 2.4 million parameters under a fixed training budget. We find that the test error decreases with data size with a power-law exponent of -0.6122, indicating efficient data utilization. Based on this scaling law, we estimate that the optimal sampling density is approximately eight samples per dimension in a d-dimensional design space. The results also suggest improved data utilization efficiency for larger surrogate models, implying a potential trade-off between dataset generation cost and model training budget."

    "abstract": "The layered van der Waals (vdW) ferroelectric CuInP2S6 (CIPS) exhibits unique cation hopping-driven phenomena that bring about unconventional properties with intriguing mechanisms and hold promises for advanced applications in nanoelectronics. However, an explicit analysis of its lattice dynamics and vibrational symmetries, pivotal for understanding the material's peculiar ferroelectric and ferroionic behaviors, remains incomplete. Here, we employ angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy in concert with first-principles calculations to systematically unravel the anisotropic lattice vibrations of CIPS single crystals. By analyzing the polarization-dependent Raman intensities, we determine the symmetry assignments and Raman tensors of all major vibrational modes, revealing good agreement with theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of Raman spectroscopy as a sensitive and non-invasive probe for structural and ferroelectric order evolution, by examining temperature-driven phase transitions and thickness-dependent polarization suppression in CIPS. Our findings establish a foundational framework for correlating lattice dynamics with functional properties in CIPS and provide a methodological blueprint for studying other vdW ferroelectrics."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a framewrok for analyzing how the welfare effects of policy interventions are distributed across individuals when those effects are unobserved. Rather than focusing solely on average outcomes, the approach uses readily available information on average welfare responses to uncover meaningful patterns in how gains and losses are distributed across different populations. The framework is built around the concept of superquantile and applies to a broad class of models with unobserved individual heterogeneity. It enables policymakers to identify which groups are most adversely affected by a policy and to evaluate trade-offs between efficiency and equity. We illustrate the approach in three widely studied economic settings: price changes and compensated variation, treatment allocation with self-selection, and the cost-benefit analysis of social programs. In this latter application, we show how standard tools from the marginal treatment effect and generalized Roy model literature are useful for implementing our bounds for both the overall population and for individuals who participate in the program."

However, there is still a lack of comprehensive reviews on the integration of SemCom into RAN. Motivated by this, we systematically explore recent advancements in Semantic RAN (SemRAN). We begin by introducing the fundamentals of RAN and SemCom, identifying the limitations of conventional RAN, and outlining the overall architecture of SemRAN. Subsequently, we review representative techniques of SemRAN across physical layer, data link layer, network layer, and security plane. Furthermore, we envision future services and applications enabled by SemRAN, alongside its current standardization progress. Finally, we conclude by identifying critical research challenges and outlining forward-looking directions to guide subsequent investigations in this burgeoning field."

Traditional supervised models leverage explicit 3D geometry but exhibit limited generalization, owing to the scarcity of 3D vision-language datasets and the limited reasoning capabilities compared to modern vision-language models (VLMs). We propose PanoGrounder, a generalizable 3DVG framework that couples multi-modal panoramic representation with pretrained 2D VLMs for strong vision-language reasoning. Panoramic renderings, augmented with 3D semantic and geometric features, serve as an intermediate representation between 2D and 3D, and offer two major benefits: (i) they can be directly fed to VLMs with minimal adaptation and (ii) they retain long-range object-to-object relations thanks to their 360-degree field of view. We devise a three-stage pipeline that places a compact set of panoramic viewpoints considering the scene layout and geometry, grounds a text query on each panoramic rendering with a VLM, and fuses per-view predictions into a single 3D bounding box via lifting. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on ScanRefer and Nr3D, and demonstrates superior generalization to unseen 3D datasets and text rephrasings."

Early detection and diagnosis of pulmonary nodules are essential for improving patient survival rates. Although previous research has integrated multimodal and multi-temporal information, outperforming single modality and single time point, the fusion methods are limited to inefficient vector concatenation and simple mutual attention, highlighting the need for more effective multimodal information fusion. To address these challenges, we introduce a Dual-Graph Spatiotemporal Attention Network, which leverages temporal variations and multimodal data to enhance the accuracy of predictions. Our methodology involves developing a Global-Local Feature Encoder to better capture the local, global, and fused characteristics of pulmonary nodules. Additionally, a Dual-Graph Construction method organizes multimodal features into inter-modal and intra-modal graphs. Furthermore, a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Graph Fusion Module is introduced to refine feature integration. We also compiled a novel multimodal dataset named the NLST-cmst dataset as a comprehensive source of support for related research. Our extensive experiments, conducted on both the NLST-cmst and curated CSTL-derived datasets, demonstrate that our DGSAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classifying pulmonary nodules with exceptional computational efficiency."

However, the complex wing motion and high-Reynolds-number (Re $\\approx$$10^5$) flow dynamics challenge conventional expectations of avian flight aerodynamics, rendering this mechanism elusive. Analyzing 578 stationary take-offs from seven geese (\\textit{Anser cygnoides}) and applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we reveal that the complex wing kinematics collapse onto a low-dimensional manifold dominated by two synergies: a Stroke Synergy responsible for fundamental rhythmic stroke, and a Morphing Synergy governing spanwise geometry. This modular control strategy orchestrates a stereotyped wing kinematics featuring an accelerated translational downstroke and a rapid tip-reversal upstroke. By integrating wing kinematic analysis with the mass distribution of the geese, we quantified the aerodynamic forces and found that entirely positive lift and thrust are generated throughout the motion cycle. The enhanced aerodynamic performance of geese takeoff results from three principal mechanisms. During the downstroke, significant lift generated from wing acceleration is predicted by the quasi-steady framework. Flow visualization reveals that wake capture further enhances the lift generation in downstroke by orienting the position of wake vortices. During the upstroke, the distal wing performs a rapid pitching motion and generates a substantial thrust, the vertical component of which contributes significantly to weight support."

Nanoflares analyzed in this study were generated self-consistently via prescribed photospheric motions in a 3D multi-strand simulation of a subset of active region magnetic flux. Energies and durations were quantified using three distinct methods. In this study, we investigated the correlation between nanoflare energies (E) and delays ($τ_D$) using two non-parametric, rank-based statistical tests. Across all methods, results consistently show little to no correlation. This is further supported by the distribution of the exponent $α$ in the assumed relation $E \\propto τ_D^α$, which peaks near zero, and by broad delay distributions within fixed energy bins. These findings are irrespective of whether delays are correlated with the energy of the preceding or subsequent event. They also hold for a subset of high-energy nanoflares. The absence of correlation suggests that nanoflare onset is not solely determined by a critical value of magnetic stress and may involve triggering by other events, perhaps related to a locally complex topology."

Unlike conventional pipelines, NeRV360 integrates viewport extraction into decoding and introduces a spatial-temporal affine transform module for conditional decoding based on viewpoint and time. Experiments on 6K-resolution videos show that NeRV360 achieves a 7-fold reduction in memory consumption and a 2.5-fold increase in decoding speed compared to HNeRV, a representative prior work, while delivering better image quality in terms of objective metrics."

    "abstract": "The increasing use of machine learning in safety-critical domains amplifies the risk of adversarial threats, especially data poisoning attacks that corrupt training data to degrade performance or induce unsafe behavior. Most existing defenses lack formal guarantees or rely on restrictive assumptions about the model class, attack type, extent of poisoning, or point-wise certification, limiting their practical reliability. This paper introduces a principled formal robustness certification framework that models gradient-based training as a discrete-time dynamical system (dt-DS) and formulates poisoning robustness as a formal safety verification problem. By adapting the concept of barrier certificates (BCs) from control theory, we introduce sufficient conditions to certify a robust radius ensuring that the terminal model remains safe under worst-case ${\\ell}_p$-norm based poisoning. To make this practical, we parameterize BCs as neural networks trained on finite sets of poisoned trajectories. We further derive probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds by solving a scenario convex program (SCP), which yields a confidence lower bound on the certified robustness radius generalizing beyond the training set. Importantly, our framework also extends to certification against test-time attacks, making it the first unified framework to provide formal guarantees in both training and test-time attack settings. Experiments on MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10 show that our approach certifies non-trivial perturbation budgets while being model-agnostic and requiring no prior knowledge of the attack or contamination level."

However, the accuracy of measurement data can be degraded if strong magnetic materials are present or magnetic field changes occur near the MCG system. With the widespread use of implants, the number of patients with metallic implants is increasing, but there is a lack of in-depth research on the potential impact of implant materials on the results of the MCG examination. This study aims to analyze the effect of implant materials on MCG measurements and establish relevant criteria. In this study, a 96-channel MCG system employing Superconducting Quantum Interference Device sensors, specifically first-order gradiometers based on the Double Relaxation Oscillation SQUID method, and a Magnetically Shielded Room were utilized. Ti6Al4V ELI was selected as the representative implant material sample. Experiments were conducted under extreme conditions, where a sample significantly larger than an actual implant was placed as close as possible to the sensors. As a result, when the implant material was at the minimum distance to the sensor, the noise increase was approximately 0.7 fT/$\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$, which satisfies the sensitivity criteria for MCG. Furthermore, since these results were obtained under severely adverse conditions designed to maximize the noise impact, it is anticipated that the effect would be even more negligible in actual clinical settings. In conclusion, it was confirmed that common implant materials have little to no effect on MCG measurements. However, as the experiments were not conducted with the material inserted into the human body, unlike actual clinical environments, the generation of magnetic fields due to micromotion has not been verified, thus requiring further experimentation."

    "abstract": "Reasoning benchmarks such as the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) and ARC-AGI are widely used to assess progress in artificial intelligence and are often interpreted as probes of core, so-called ``fluid'' reasoning abilities. Despite their apparent simplicity for humans, these tasks remain challenging for frontier vision-language models (VLMs), a gap commonly attributed to deficiencies in machine reasoning. We challenge this interpretation and hypothesize that the gap arises primarily from limitations in visual perception rather than from shortcomings in inductive reasoning. To verify this hypothesis, we introduce a two-stage experimental pipeline that explicitly separates perception and reasoning. In the perception stage, each image is independently converted into a natural-language description, while in the reasoning stage a model induces and applies rules using these descriptions. This design prevents leakage of cross-image inductive signals and isolates reasoning from perception bottlenecks. Across three ARC-style datasets, Mini-ARC, ACRE, and Bongard-LOGO, we show that the perception capability is the dominant factor underlying the observed performance gap by comparing the two-stage pipeline with against standard end-to-end one-stage evaluation. Manual inspection of reasoning traces in the VLM outputs further reveals that approximately 80 percent of model failures stem from perception errors. Together, these results demonstrate that ARC-style benchmarks conflate perceptual and reasoning challenges and that observed performance gaps may overstate deficiencies in machine reasoning. Our findings underscore the need for evaluation protocols that disentangle perception from reasoning when assessing progress in machine intelligence."

To emphasize relative comparisons and gain statistical power, we propose the all-pairs paired method, which applies the paired analysis to all pairs of LLMs and measures all the noise components based on millions of question-level predictions across many evals and settings. These measurements revealed clear patterns. First, each eval exhibits a characteristic and highly predictable total noise level across all model pairs. Second, paired prediction noise typically exceeds paired data noise, which means reducing prediction noise by averaging can significantly increase statistical power. These findings enable practitioners to assess significance without custom testing and to detect much smaller effects in controlled experiments."

By treating alleles as first-class objects and selecting optimal encodings based on carrier distribution, H1 achieves near-optimal storage across both common and rare variants. We further introduce H2, a path-centric dual representation derived from the same underlying allele-haplotype incidence information that restores explicit haplotype ordering while remaining exactly equivalent in information content. Using real human genome data, we show that this representation yields substantial compression gains, particularly for structural variants, while remaining equivalent in information content to pangenome graphs. H1 provides a unified, population-aware foundation for scalable pangenome analysis and downstream applications such as rare-variant interpretation and drug discovery."

We show that, under an appropriate nonlinear small-gain condition, the overall interconnected system inherits the FxT-ISS property. In this sense, the proposed result complements existing Lyapunov-based smallgain theorems for asymptotic and finite-time stability, and enables a systematic analysis of interconnection structures exhibiting fixed-time stability. To illustrate the applicability of the theory, we study feedback-based optimization problems with time-varying cost functions, and Nash-equilibrium seeking for noncooperative games with nonlinear dynamical plants in the loop.

This paper presents a novel, end-to-end computational framework that bridges the gap between patient-specific transcriptomics and de novo drug discovery. By analyzing bulk RNA sequencing data from the TCGA-LAML cohort, the study utilized Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to prioritize 20 high-value biomarkers, including metabolic transporters like HK3 and immune-modulatory receptors such as SIGLEC9. The physical structures of these targets were modeled using AlphaFold3, and druggable hotspots were quantitatively mapped via the DOGSiteScorer engine. Then developed a novel, reaction-first evolutionary metaheuristic algorithm as well as multi-objective optimization programming that assembles novel ligands from fragment libraries, guided by spatial alignment to these identified hotspots. The generative model produced structurally unique chemical entities with a strong bias toward drug-like space, as evidenced by QED scores peaking between 0.5 and 0.7. Validation through ADMET profiling and SwissDock molecular docking identified high-confidence candidates, such as Ligand L1, which achieved a binding free energy of -6.571 kcal/mol against the A08A96 biomarker.

    "abstract": "Model merging has emerged as a lightweight alternative to joint multi-task learning (MTL), yet the generalization properties of merged models remain largely unexplored. Establishing such theoretical guarantees is non-trivial, as the merging process typically forbids access to the original training data and involves combining fine-tuned models trained on fundamentally heterogeneous data distributions. Without a principled understanding of these dynamics, current methods often rely on heuristics to approximate the optimal combination of parameters. This dependence is most critical in coefficient scaling, the weighting factors that modulate the magnitude of each fine-tuned model's contribution to the shared parameter. However, without a principled objective to guide their selection, these methods lead to brittle performance and are highly sensitive to scaling initialization. We address this gap by (i) establishing a novel flatness-aware PAC-Bayes generalization bound specifically for the model merging setting. This analysis introduces a \"cross-task heterogeneity\" term that formally captures the mismatch between diverse fine-tuned model priors and the target multi-task distributions. Guided by this theoretical insight, (ii) we frame model merging as multi-teacher knowledge distillation on scarce, unlabeled data. We formally demonstrate that minimizing the student-teacher Kullback-Leibler divergence directly tightens the upper bound on the merged model's excess risk. Guided by the flatness-aware bound derived, (iii) we operationalize this objective via SAMerging, a method that employs Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) to find flat minima. Empirically, SAMerging establishes a new state of the art across vision and NLP benchmarks, achieving remarkable performance. The code is available at https://github.com/arshandalili/SAMerging."

Whilst core companions may not exist in general, they always exist for $ω$-categorical theories. We show that many model-theoretic properties, such as stability, NIP, simplicity, and NSOP, are preserved by moving to the core companion of a theory. On the other hand, we show that the classes of theories of structures interpretable over $({\\mathbb N};=)$ and over $({\\mathbb Q};<)$ are both not closed under taking core companions. The first class is contained in the class of theories of $ω$-stable first-order reducts of finitely homogeneous relational structures, which was studied by Lachlan in the 80's.

However, recent experimental investigations reveal complex substrate-dependent behavior that affects their lubricating capabilities. This computational study employs density functional theory calculations to quantify the adhesion energy of both pristine and oxidized phosphorene monolayers on various metallic substrates (aluminum, copper, iron, and chromium) and their corresponding oxides ($\\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$, $\\mathrm{Cu_2O}$, $\\mathrm{Fe_2O_3}$, and $\\mathrm{Cr_2O_3}$), correlating these fundamental interactions with experimentally observed tribological performance. Results demonstrate that oxidized phosphorene exhibits greater stability than its pristine counterpart and shows higher adhesion to all substrates, attributed to favorable interactions between oxygen non-bonding states and substrate empty states. Adhesion is systematically more favorable on pristine metals than on their corresponding oxides, with chromium and iron showing particularly strong interactions due to partially filled 3d orbitals. This result is consistent with the coefficient of friction decrease observed in tribological experiments after scratching the substrate, thus removing the outermost oxide layer. Charge redistribution and electronic structure analyses reveal system-dependent interfacial bonding characteristics, with some configurations inducing metallic character in phosphorene. These findings provide fundamental insights into substrate-dependent black phosphorus lubricating properties, highlighting the key role of layer-substrate adhesion."

This allows us to construct sufficiently many non-ordinary regular de Rham points whose modularity is guaranteed by the recent progress on the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture.

To allow for nonlinear dynamic control under this constraint, a method for representing a state-space system model as an auto-regressive model with exogenous inputs (ARX model) is proposed. With the input as well as the output of the plant encrypted and transmitted to the controller, the reformulated ARX form can compute each output using only a finite number of operations, from its several previous inputs and outputs. Existence of a stable observer for the controller is a key condition for the proposed representation. The representation replaces the controller with an observer form and applies a method similar to finite-impulse-response approximation. It is verified that the approximation error and its effect can be made arbitrarily small by an appropriate choice of a parameter, under stability of the observer and the closed-loop system. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

To successfully complete tasks, the LLM must be grounded in the environment in which the robot operates. One solution is to use a scene graph that contains all the necessary information. Modern methods rely on prebuilt scene graphs and assume that all task-relevant information is available at the start of planning. However, these approaches do not account for changes in the environment that may occur between the graph construction and the task execution. We propose LookPlanGraph - a method that leverages a scene graph composed of static assets and object priors. During plan execution, LookPlanGraph continuously updates the graph with relevant objects, either by verifying existing priors or discovering new entities. This is achieved by processing the agents egocentric camera view using a Vision Language Model. We conducted experiments with changed object positions VirtualHome and OmniGibson simulated environments, demonstrating that LookPlanGraph outperforms methods based on predefined static scene graphs. To demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach, we also conducted experiments in a real-world setting. Additionally, we introduce the GraSIF (Graph Scenes for Instruction Following) dataset with automated validation framework, comprising 514 tasks drawn from SayPlan Office, BEHAVIOR-1K, and VirtualHome RobotHow.

    "abstract": "Tactile sensing is crucial for robotic hands to achieve human-level dexterous manipulation, especially in scenarios with visual occlusion. However, its application is often hindered by the difficulty of collecting large-scale real-world robotic tactile data. In this study, we propose to collect low-cost human manipulation data using haptic gloves for tactile-based robotic policy learning. The misalignment between human and robotic tactile data makes it challenging to transfer policies learned from human data to robots. To bridge this gap, we propose UniTacHand, a unified representation to align robotic tactile information captured by dexterous hands with human hand touch obtained from gloves. First, we project tactile signals from both human hands and robotic hands onto a morphologically consistent 2D surface space of the MANO hand model. This unification standardizes the heterogeneous data structures and inherently embeds the tactile signals with spatial context. Then, we introduce a contrastive learning method to align them into a unified latent space, trained on only 10 minutes of paired data from our data collection system. Our approach enables zero-shot tactile-based policy transfer from humans to a real robot, generalizing to objects unseen in the pre-training data. We also demonstrate that co-training on mixed data, including both human and robotic demonstrations via UniTacHand, yields better performance and data efficiency compared with using only robotic data. UniTacHand paves a path toward general, scalable, and data-efficient learning for tactile-based dexterous hands."

    "abstract": "While Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have made significant progress, they remain largely text-centric, relying on language as their core reasoning modality. As a result, they are limited in their ability to handle reasoning tasks that are predominantly visual. Recent approaches have sought to address this by supervising intermediate visual steps with helper images, depth maps, or image crops. However, these strategies impose restrictive priors on what \"useful\" visual abstractions look like, add heavy annotation costs, and struggle to generalize across tasks. To address this critical limitation, we propose a task-agnostic mechanism that trains LMMs to discover and use visual reasoning tokens without explicit supervision. These tokens attend globally and re-encode the image in a task-adaptive way, enabling the model to extract relevant visual information without hand-crafted supervision. Our approach outperforms direct fine-tuning and achieves state-of-the-art results on a diverse range of vision-centric tasks -- including those where intermediate abstractions are hard to specify -- while also generalizing to multi-task instruction tuning."

However, existing ZSON methods often struggle in realistic and cluttered environments, particularly when the scene contains heavy occlusions, unknown risks, or dynamically moving target objects. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{Schrödinger's Navigator}, a navigation framework inspired by Schrödinger's thought experiment on uncertainty. The framework treats unobserved space as a set of plausible future worlds and reasons over them before acting. Conditioned on egocentric visual inputs and three candidate trajectories, a trajectory-conditioned 3D world model imagines future observations along each path. This enables the agent to see beyond occlusions and anticipate risks in unseen regions without requiring extra detours or dense global mapping. The imagined 3D observations are fused into the navigation map and used to update a value map. These updates guide the policy toward trajectories that avoid occlusions, reduce exposure to uncertain space, and better track moving targets. Experiments on a Go2 quadruped robot across three challenging scenarios, including severe static occlusions, unknown risks, and dynamically moving targets, show that Schrödinger's Navigator consistently outperforms strong ZSON baselines in self-localization, object localization, and overall Success Rate in occlusion-heavy environments. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of trajectory-conditioned 3D imagination in enabling robust zero-shot object navigation."

    "abstract": "This paper presents an elastic tube-based model predictive control (MPC) framework for unknown discrete-time linear systems subject to disturbances. Unlike most existing elastic tube-based MPC methods, we do not assume perfect knowledge of the system model or disturbance realizations bounds. Instead, a conservative zonotopic disturbance set is initialized and iteratively refined using data and prior knowledge: data are used to identify matrix zonotope model sets for the system dynamics, while prior physical knowledge is employed to discard models and disturbances inconsistent with known constraints. This process yields constrained matrix zonotopes representing disturbance realizations and dynamics that enable a principled fusion of offline information with limited online data, improving MPC feasibility and performance. The proposed design leverages closed-loop system characterization to learn and refine control gains that maintain a small tube size. By separating open-loop model mismatch from closed-loop effects in the error dynamics, the method avoids dependence on the size of the state and input operating regions, thereby reducing conservatism. An adaptive co-design of the tube and ancillary feedback ensures $λ$-contractive zonotopic tubes, guaranteeing robust positive invariance, improved feasibility margins, and enhanced disturbance tolerance. We establish recursive feasibility conditions and introduce a polyhedral Lyapunov candidate for the error tube, proving exponential stability of the closed-loop error dynamics under the adaptive tube-gain updates. Simulations demonstrate improved robustness, enlarged feasibility regions, and safe closed-loop performance using only a small amount of online data."

A central difficulty in such large-scale systems with all-microwave gates and, therefore, strong static couplings, is suppressing parasitic interactions that extend beyond nearest neighbors to include next-nearest elements. We address this issue by introducing several design strategies: the frequency allocation of both qubits and couplers, the localization of coupler wavefunctions, and a differential oscillator that suppresses residual long-range interactions. In addition, the architecture natively supports fast $\\sim70$~ns CZZ gates -- three-qubit operations composed of two CZ gates sharing a common qubit -- which reduce the incoherent error by $\\sim 35\\%$ compared to performing the corresponding CZs sequentially.

GADI is a framework that can represent many existing Alternating-Direction Implicit (ADI) methods. These methods are a class of linear solvers based on a splitting of $A$ such that the solution of the original linear system can be decomposed into the successive computation of easy-to-solve structured subsystems. Our proposed mixed precision scheme for GADI solves these subsystems in low precision to reduce the overall execution time while computing the residual and solution update in high precision to enable the solution to converge to high accuracy. We develop a rounding error analysis of mixed precision GADI that establishes the rates of convergence of the forward and backward errors to certain limiting accuracies. Our analysis also highlights the conditions on the splitting matrices under which mixed precision GADI is guaranteed to converge for a given set of precisions. We then discuss a systematic and robust strategy for selecting the GADI regularization parameter $α$, whose adjustment is critical for performance. Specifically, our proposed strategy makes use of a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model trained on a dataset of low-dimensional problems to initialize $α$. Finally, we proceed to a performance analysis of mixed precision GADI on an NVIDIA A100 GPU to validate our approach. Using low precision (Bfloat16 or FP32) to solve the subsystems, we obtain speedups of $2.6\\times$, $1.7\\times$, and $3.1\\times$ over a full double precision GADI implementation on large-scale 2D, 3D convection-diffusion and complex reaction-diffusion problems (up to $1.3\\times 10^{8}$ unknowns), respectively."

The main result of this paper, is that differential functors between the structure category $\\mathbb N^\\bullet$ and a tangent category $\\mathbb X$ are equivalent to differential bundles in $\\mathbb X$. We obtain this result by showing that evaluating a differential functor on the generating object $\\mathbb N^1$ of the structure category $\\mathbb N^\\bullet$ produces a differential bundle in a functorial way.

In this work, we develop and validate a practical framework for extracting thermodynamic properties of materials using such hardware. As a test case, we consider nitrogen-doped graphene. Starting from Density Functional Theory (DFT) formation energies, we map the material energetics onto a Rydberg-atom Hamiltonian suitable for quantum annealing by fitting an on-site term and distance-dependent pair interactions. The Hamiltonian derived from DFT cannot be implemented directly on current QuEra devices, as the largest energy scale accessible on the hardware is two orders of magnitude smaller than the target two-body interaction in the material. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a rescaling strategy based on a single parameter, $α_v$, which ensures that the Boltzmann weights sampled by the hardware correspond exactly to those of the material at an effective temperature $T' = α_vT$, where $T$ is the device sampling temperature. This rescaling also establishes a direct correspondence between the global laser detuning $Δ_g$ and the grand-canonical chemical potential $Δμ$. We validate the method on a 28-site graphene nanoflake using exhaustive enumeration, and on a larger 78-site system where Monte Carlo sampling confirms preferential sampling of low-energy configurations."

The key novelty is to use modal logic to capture a declarative, high-level representation of essential system properties -- the logical essence of the algorithm -- while abstracting away from transitions of an abstract machine that implements it. It is like the difference between specifying code in a functional or logic programming language, versus specifying code in an imperative one. A logical axiomatisation in the style we propose provides a precise, compact, human-readable specification that abstractly captures essential system properties, while eliding low-level implementation details; it is more precise than a natural language description, yet more abstract than source code or a logical specification thereof. This creates new opportunities for reasoning about correctness, resilience, and failure, and could serve as a foundation for human- and machine verification efforts, design improvements, and even alternative protocol implementations."

However, existing methods typically rely on unaligned image and text encoders, which necessitate complex interaction modules for multimodal fusion. While CLIP provides a pre-aligned multimodal feature space, its direct application to medical imaging is limited by three main issues: insufficient preservation of fine-grained anatomical structures, inadequate modeling of complex clinical descriptions, and domain-specific semantic misalignment. To tackle these challenges, we propose TGC-Net, a CLIP-based framework focusing on parameter-efficient, task-specific adaptations. Specifically, it incorporates a Semantic-Structural Synergy Encoder (SSE) that augments CLIP's ViT with a CNN branch for multi-scale structural refinement, a Domain-Augmented Text Encoder (DATE) that injects large-language-model-derived medical knowledge, and a Vision-Language Calibration Module (VLCM) that refines cross-modal correspondence in a unified feature space. Experiments on five datasets across chest X-ray and thoracic CT modalities demonstrate that TGC-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with substantially fewer trainable parameters, including notable Dice gains on challenging benchmarks."

Though great success has been achieved by VLMs in various fields, in this work, we ask whether the existing VLMs can act as domain experts, accurately answering marine questions, which require significant domain expertise and address special domain challenges/requirements. To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and explore the boundary of existing VLMs, we construct the first large-scale marine VLM dataset and benchmark called MarineEval, with 2,000 image-based question-answering pairs. During our dataset construction, we ensure the diversity and coverage of the constructed data: 7 task dimensions and 20 capacity dimensions. The domain requirements are specially integrated into the data construction and further verified by the corresponding marine domain experts. We comprehensively benchmark 17 existing VLMs on our MarineEval and also investigate the limitations of existing models in answering marine research questions. The experimental results reveal that existing VLMs cannot effectively answer the domain-specific questions, and there is still a large room for further performance improvements.

    "abstract": "A shortcoming of black-box supervised learning models is their lack of interpretability or transparency. To facilitate interpretation, post-hoc global variable importance measures (VIMs) are widely used to assign to each predictor or input variable a numerical score that represents the extent to which that predictor impacts the fitted model's response predictions across the training data. It is well known that the most common existing VIMs, namely marginal Shapley and marginal permutation-based methods, can produce unreliable results if the predictors are highly correlated, because they require extrapolation of the response at predictor values that fall far outside the training data. Conditional versions of Shapley and permutation VIMs avoid or reduce the extrapolation but can substantially deflate the importance of correlated predictors. For the related goal of visualizing the effects of each predictor when strong predictor correlation is present, accumulated local effects (ALE) plots were recently introduced and have been widely adopted. This paper presents a new VIM approach based on ALE concepts that avoids both the extrapolation and the VIM deflation problems when predictors are correlated. We contrast, both theoretically and numerically, ALE VIMs with Shapley and permutation VIMs. Our results indicate that ALE VIMs produce similar variable importance rankings as Shapley and permutation VIMs when predictor correlations are mild and more reliable rankings when correlations are strong. An additional advantage is that ALE VIMs are far less computationally expensive."

For AGNRs with $R_1$-type unit cells, the ES numbers under a longitudinal electric field follow the relations $N = N_{A(B)} \\times 6 + 1$ and $N = N_{A(B)} \\times 6 + 3$, whereas $R_2$-type unit cells exhibit $(N_{A(B)} + 1)$ ESs. The subscripts $A$ and $B$ denote the chirality types of the ESs. The Stark effect lifts ES degeneracy and enables clear spectral separation between ESs and IFs. Using a real-space bulk boundary perturbation approach, we show that opposite-chirality states hybridize through junction-site perturbations and may shift out of the bulk gap. The number and chirality of IFs in symmetric AGNRHs are determined by the difference between the ESs of the outer and central segments, $N_O$ and $N_C$, according to $N_{IF,β} = |N_{O,B(A)} - N_{C,A(B)}|$, where $β$ labels the chirality. Depending on whether $N_O > N_C$ or $N_C > N_O$, the resulting IFs acquire B- or A-chirality, respectively. Calculated transmission spectra ${\\cal T}_{GNR}(\\varepsilon)$ reveal that AGNRHs host a topological double quantum dot (TDQD) when IFs originate from the ESs of the central AGNR segment. Using an Anderson model with effective intra-dot and inter-dot Coulomb interactions, we derive an analytical expression for the tunneling current through the TDQD via a closed-form transmission coefficient. Thermoelectric analysis shows that TDQDs yield enhanced nonlinear power output in the electron-dilute and hole-dilute charge states, with Coulomb blockade suppressing thermal current but not thermal voltage."

    "abstract": "Transformers are increasingly adopted for modeling and forecasting time-series, yet their internal mechanisms remain poorly understood from a dynamical systems perspective. In contrast to classical autoregressive and state-space models, which benefit from well-established theoretical foundations, Transformer architectures are typically treated as black boxes. This gap becomes particularly relevant as attention-based models are considered for general-purpose or zero-shot forecasting across diverse dynamical regimes. In this work, we do not propose a new forecasting model, but instead investigate the representational capabilities and limitations of single-layer Transformers when applied to dynamical data. Building on a dynamical systems perspective we interpret causal self-attention as a linear, history-dependent recurrence and analyze how it processes temporal information. Through a series of linear and nonlinear case studies, we identify distinct operational regimes. For linear systems, we show that the convexity constraint imposed by softmax attention fundamentally restricts the class of dynamics that can be represented, leading to oversmoothing in oscillatory settings. For nonlinear systems under partial observability, attention instead acts as an adaptive delay-embedding mechanism, enabling effective state reconstruction when sufficient temporal context and latent dimensionality are available. These results help bridge empirical observations with classical dynamical systems theory, providing insight into when and why Transformers succeed or fail as models of dynamical systems."

To address these issues, we suggest a different approach: utilizing semi-supervised learning techniques, which leverage both labeled and unlabeled data, to improve the performance on the safety task. We analyze the improvements that these techniques can offer for both prompts given to Large Language Models and the responses to those requests. Moreover, since augmentation is the central part of semi-supervised algorithms, we demonstrate the importance of using task-specific augmentations, which significantly increase the performance when compared to general-purpose augmentation techniques."

With the emergence of high-fidelity and efficient representations such as 3D Gaussians, recent works have pushed toward ultra-detailed head avatars. Existing approaches typically fall into two categories: rule-based analytic rigging or neural network-based deformation fields. While effective in constrained settings, both approaches often fail to generalize to unseen expressions and poses, particularly in extreme reenactment scenarios. Other methods constrain Gaussians to the global texel space of 3DMMs to reduce rendering complexity. However, these texel-based avatars tend to underutilize the underlying mesh structure. They apply minimal analytic deformation and rely heavily on neural regressors and heuristic regularization in UV space, which weakens geometric consistency and limits extrapolation to complex, out-of-distribution deformations. To address these limitations, we introduce TexAvatars, a hybrid avatar representation that combines the explicit geometric grounding of analytic rigging with the spatial continuity of texel space. Our approach predicts local geometric attributes in UV space via CNNs, but drives 3D deformation through mesh-aware Jacobians, enabling smooth and semantically meaningful transitions across triangle boundaries. This hybrid design separates semantic modeling from geometric control, resulting in improved generalization, interpretability, and stability. Furthermore, TexAvatars captures fine-grained expression effects, including muscle-induced wrinkles, glabellar lines, and realistic mouth cavity geometry, with high fidelity. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under extreme pose and expression variations, demonstrating strong generalization in challenging head reenactment settings."

Operating at a center wavelength of 3427.43 nm, the system utilizes a differential detection strategy to enable precise, calibration-free measurements of unburned methane ($\\mathrm{CH_{4}}$) concentrations in a McKenna burner. The experimental results demonstrate a detection limit of 1.1 ppm for a 1 m path length and effectively resolve spatial concentration gradients across the combustion region. Furthermore, the system's high temporal resolution allowed for the identification of dynamic combustion instabilities, including self-sustained pulsations and fuel leakage under fuel-lean conditions.

Existing methods for handling left truncation mostly rely on the (quasi-)independence assumption or the weaker conditional (quasi-)independence assumption which assumes that conditional on observed covariates, the left truncation time and the event time are independent on the observed region. In practice, however, our analysis of the Honolulu Asia Aging Study (HAAS) suggests that the conditional quasi-independence assumption may fail because measured covariates often serve only as imperfect proxies for the underlying mechanisms, such as latent health status, that induce dependence between truncation and event times. To address this gap, we propose a proximal weighting identification framework that admits the dependence-inducing factors may not be fully observed. We then construct an estimator based on the framework and study its asymptotic properties. We examine the finite sample performance of the proposed estimator by comprehensive simulations, and apply it to analyzing the cognitive impairment-free survival probabilities using data from the Honolulu Asia Aging Study."

Furthermore, we validate these theoretical findings on real-world unconditional and text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the same representation structures emerge in deep generative models with significant practical implications.

However, neural network-based diagnostic models are subject to hallucinations and can produce erroneous predictions, posing a risk of misdiagnosis and inaccurate clinical decisions. To address this challenge, here we present an autonomous uncertainty quantification technique developed for POC diagnostics. As our testbed, we used a paper-based, computational vertical flow assay (xVFA) platform developed for rapid POC diagnosis of Lyme disease, the most prevalent tick-borne disease globally. The xVFA platform integrates a disposable paper-based assay, a handheld optical reader and a neural network-based inference algorithm, providing rapid and cost-effective Lyme disease diagnostics in under 20 min using only 20 uL of patient serum. By incorporating a Monte Carlo dropout (MCDO)-based uncertainty quantification approach into the diagnostics pipeline, we identified and excluded erroneous predictions with high uncertainty, significantly improving the sensitivity and reliability of the xVFA in an autonomous manner, without access to the ground truth diagnostic information of patients. Blinded testing using new patient samples demonstrated an increase in diagnostic sensitivity from 88.2% to 95.7%, indicating the effectiveness of MCDO-based uncertainty quantification in enhancing the robustness of neural network-driven computational POC sensing systems."

Standard tile encoder-based pipelines, which extract embeddings of tiles stripped from their context, fail to model the rich slide-level information essential for both local and global tasks. Furthermore, different tile-encoders excel at different downstream tasks. Therefore, a unified model is needed to contextualize embeddings derived from ''any'' tile-level foundation model. TICON addresses this need with a single, shared encoder, pretrained using a masked modeling objective to simultaneously unify and contextualize representations from diverse tile-level pathology foundation models. Our experiments demonstrate that TICON-contextualized embeddings significantly improve performance across many different tasks, establishing new state-of-the-art results on tile-level benchmarks (i.e., HEST-Bench, THUNDER, CATCH) and slide-level benchmarks (i.e., Patho-Bench).

The holographic tEE is realized through extremal surfaces consisting of spacelike and timelike branches that encode its real and imaginary components, respectively. In the BTZ black hole, these surfaces extend into the interior of the black hole and reproduce the field-theoretic results. The analysis is further generalized to higher-dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild black holes, where the characteristics of tEE are obtained with increasing size of the boundary subsystem. Besides, we also show that the boundary subsystem length diverges at a dimension-dependent critical turning point. Notably, this critical point moves closer to the black hole horizon as the dimensionality of the bulk increases. For large subsystem lengths, the finite part of the tEE displays a characteristic volume-plus-area structure, with a real volume term and a complex coefficient of the area term approaching constant values at large dimensions. Besides, we also study the monotonicity of a new quantity, timelike entanglement density, which offers insights into a timelike area theorem in specific limits. Subsequently, we investigate the near-horizon dynamics in various black hole backgrounds, where the spacelike and timelike surfaces exhibit exponential growth of the form $e^{\\frac{2π}β Δt}$ with inverse black hole temperature $β$."

    "abstract": "Charge-$4e$ superconductors are phases where quartets of electrons condense in the absence of Cooper pairing condensation. They exhibit distinctive signatures including fractional flux quantization and anomalous Josephson effects, and are actively being explored in strongly correlated systems, such as moiré materials. In this work we develop a general framework for \\emph{topological} charge-$2ne$ superconductors based on both wavefunction and field theory approaches. In particular, we generate topological charge-$2ne$ superconductors from charge-$2e$ ingredients, and by breaking the charge $U(1)$ symmetry in certain classes of quantum Hall states. Via bulk-edge correspondence, we further construct the corresponding edge conformal field theory and bulk topological quantum field theory for topological charge-$2ne$ superconductors that suggests fermionic nonabelian topological orders. Our results provide a unified low energy description of the topological charge-$2ne$ superconductivity, offer a concrete platform for studying symmetry breaking and enrichment in interacting topological phases of matter, and have direct implications for experimental probes such as quasiparticle interferometry."

    "abstract": "In this study, we present a novel automatic piano reduction method with semi-supervised machine learning. Piano reduction is an important music transformation process, which helps musicians and composers as a musical sketch for performances and analysis. The automation of such is a highly challenging research problem but could bring huge conveniences as manually doing a piano reduction takes a lot of time and effort. While supervised machine learning is often a useful tool for learning input-output mappings, it is difficult to obtain a large quantity of labelled data. We aim to solve this problem by utilizing semi-supervised learning, so that the abundant available data in classical music can be leveraged to perform the task with little or no labelling effort. In this regard, we formulate a two-step approach of music simplification followed by harmonization. We further propose and implement two possible solutions making use of an existing machine learning framework -- MidiBERT. We show that our solutions can output practical and realistic samples with an accurate reduction that needs only small adjustments in post-processing. Our study forms the groundwork for the use of semi-supervised learning in automatic piano reduction, where future researchers can take reference to produce more state-of-the-art results."

    "abstract": "Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on shapes underpins many shape analysis and engineering tasks; yet, prevailing PDE solvers operate on polygonal/triangle meshes while modern 3D assets increasingly live as neural representations. This mismatch leaves no suitable method to solve surface PDEs directly within the neural domain, forcing explicit mesh extraction or per-instance residual training, preventing end-to-end workflows. We present a novel, mesh-free formulation that learns a local update operator conditioned on neural (local) shape attributes, enabling surface PDEs to be solved directly where the (neural) data lives. The operator integrates naturally with prevalent neural surface representations, is trained once on a single representative shape, and generalizes across shape and topology variations, enabling accurate, fast inference without explicit meshing or per-instance optimization while preserving differentiability. Across analytic benchmarks (heat equation and Poisson solve on sphere) and real neural assets across different representations, our method slightly outperforms CPM while remaining reasonably close to FEM, and, to our knowledge, delivers the first end-to-end pipeline that solves surface PDEs on both neural and classical surface representations. Code will be released on acceptance."

In order to carry out our procedure we prove several new results concerning the global geometry of the leaves of the center-unstable foliation of an Anosov flow. We show that the universal covers of the center-unstable leaves are Gromov hyperbolic in the induced Riemannian metric and their relative Gromov boundaries canonically identify with the unstable leaves within in such a way that the Hamenstädt metrics on these leaves correspond to visual metrics on the relative Gromov boundary. These center-unstable leaves are then uniformized according to a technique inspired by methods of Bonk-Heinonen-Koskela which, in addition to its utility in the construction itself, also leads to rich analytic properties for these uniformized leaves such as supporting a Poincaré inequality. As a corollary we obtain that the fundamental group of a closed Riemannian manifold with Anosov geodesic flow must be Gromov hyperbolic."

    "abstract": "This work systematically investigates the performance of FORCE--$α$ numerical fluxes within an arbitrary high order semidiscrete finite volume (FV) framework for hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). Such numerical fluxes have been recently introduced by Toro, Saggiorato, Tokareva, and Hidalgo (Journal of Computational Physics, 416, 2020), and constitute a family of centred fluxes obtained from a suitable modification of First--Order Centred (FORCE) numerical fluxes. In contrast with upwind fluxes, such as Rusanov, Harten--Lax--van Leer (HLL) or the exact Riemann solver (RS) numerical flux, centred ones do not consider in any way the structure of the Riemann problem at cell interfaces. Adopting centred numerical fluxes leads to a high level of flexibility of the resulting numerical schemes, for example in the context of complicated hyperbolic systems, for which RSs may be impossible to construct or computationally expensive. The baseline framework adopted in this investigation is a FV semidiscrete approach with Weighted Essentially Non--Oscillatory (WENO) spatial reconstruction and Deferred Correction (DeC) time discretization, and results are reported up to order 7. Previous investigations involving the same framework have established that increasing the order of accuracy tends to decrease the differences in the results obtained through different numerical fluxes. The goal of this paper is to show that the employment of FORCE--$α$ numerical fluxes within such a framework is a competitive alternative to the adoption of more classical upwind fluxes. The hyperbolic system considered for this investigation is the ideal Euler equations in one and two space dimensions."

We establish the Chevalley-Weil formula for pluricanonical representations of a curve with a finite group action and a decomposition theorem for pluricanonical systems of abelian covers. These tools allow an explicit study of geometric properties of $X$, such as base loci and the birationality of pluricanonical maps. For threefolds isogenous to a product, we prove that the 4-canonical map is birational for $p_g \\ge 5$ and construct an example attaining the maximal canonical degree for this class of threefolds. In this example, the canonical map is the normalization of its image, which admits isolated non-normal singularities. Computational classifications also reveal threefolds where the bicanonical map fails to be birational, even in the absence of genus-2 fibrations. This illustrates an interesting phenomenon similar to the non-standard case for surfaces."

The simulations have been performed within the ASTRA+STRAHL framework, using FACIT and TGLF-SAT2 to predict, respectively, neoclassical and turbulent core transport, while a neural network trained on EPED simulations has been employed to calculate the pedestal height and width self-consistently. A benchmark with previous simulations at constant impurity fraction has been provided for three H-modes, spanning different plasma current and magnetic field values. For a scenario, additional simulations have been performed to account for uncertainties in the modeling assumptions. The predictions are nearly insensitive to changes in the top of pedestal W concentrations. Varying the Ar pedestal concentration has shown a small effect on the impurity peaking and nearly constant fusion gain values, due to multiple effects on pedestal pressure, main ion dilution and density peaking. The inclusion of rotation in ASTRA simulations has shown minimal impact on confinement and impurity transport predictions. An exploratory study has been provided with a first set of simulations treating D and T separately, experiencing a maximum fusion power at 55-45% DT fuel composition, and an asymmetric distribution with respect to the D concentration. All the results, including sensitivity scans of toroidal velocity and ion temperature and density gradients, highlighted that turbulent impurity transport prevails on the neoclassical component, aligning with previous ITER predictions, and suggesting that next generation devices like SPARC, operating at low collisionality, will experience low W accumulation."

We demonstrate a sub-GHz double-layer wire metasurface formed by two identical wire grids separated by a gap G, with in-plane rotation angle as the sole tuning parameter. One-port, loop-coupled S11 measurements supported by full-wave simulations reveal twist-driven hybridization of the dominant resonant manifold. For small G, the lower hybrid resonance redshifts continuously from 409 MHz to 210 MHz (2:1 tuning), enabling compact, twist-programmable resonant surfaces. Simulations further show that twisting imprints moire-like magnetic near-field super-modulations. From resonance frequencies, linewidths, and normal-mode splitting extracted from the complex response, we obtain normalized coupling up to g = 0.43 with cooperativity exceeding unity over broad angular ranges, meeting the resolved-splitting criterion. The rapid collapse of tunability at larger G confirms the near-field origin of the interaction."

    "abstract": "Controllability is a fundamental requirement in video synthesis, where accurate alignment with conditioning signals is essential. Existing classifier-free guidance methods typically achieve conditioning indirectly by modeling the joint distribution of data and conditions, which often results in limited controllability over the specified conditions. Classifier-based guidance enforces conditions through an external classifier, but the model may exploit this mechanism to raise the classifier score without genuinely satisfying the intended condition, resulting in adversarial artifacts and limited effective controllability. In this paper, we propose Attention-Conditional Diffusion (ACD), a novel framework for direct conditional control in video diffusion models via attention supervision. By aligning the model's attention maps with external control signals, ACD achieves better controllability. To support this, we introduce a sparse 3D-aware object layout as an efficient conditioning signal, along with a dedicated Layout ControlNet and an automated annotation pipeline for scalable layout integration. Extensive experiments on benchmark video generation datasets demonstrate that ACD delivers superior alignment with conditioning inputs while preserving temporal coherence and visual fidelity, establishing an effective paradigm for conditional video synthesis."

    "abstract": "Reliable anomaly detection in brain MRI remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated abnormal cases and the frequent absence of key imaging modalities in real clinical workflows. Existing single-class or multi-class anomaly detection (AD) models typically rely on fixed modality configurations, require repetitive training, or fail to generalize to unseen modality combinations, limiting their clinical scalability. In this work, we present a unified Any-Modality AD framework that performs robust anomaly detection and localization under arbitrary MRI modality availability. The framework integrates a dual-pathway DINOv2 encoder with a feature distribution alignment mechanism that statistically aligns incomplete-modality features with full-modality representations, enabling stable inference even with severe modality dropout. To further enhance semantic consistency, we introduce an Intrinsic Normal Prototypes (INPs) extractor and an INP-guided decoder that reconstruct only normal anatomical patterns while naturally amplifying abnormal deviations. Through randomized modality masking and indirect feature completion during training, the model learns to adapt to all modality configurations without re-training. Extensive experiments on BraTS2018, MU-Glioma-Post, and Pretreat-MetsToBrain-Masks demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art industrial and medical AD baselines across 7 modality combinations, achieving superior generalization. This study establishes a scalable paradigm for multimodal medical AD under real-world, imperfect modality conditions. Our source code is available at https://github.com/wuchangw/AnyAD."

To address these challenges, we introduce ReaSeq, a reasoning-enhanced framework that leverages world knowledge in Large Language Models to address both limitations through explicit and implicit reasoning. Specifically, ReaSeq employs explicit Chain-of-Thought reasoning via multi-agent collaboration to distill structured product knowledge into semantically enriched item representations, and latent reasoning via Diffusion Large Language Models to infer plausible beyond-log behaviors. Deployed on Taobao's ranking system serving hundreds of millions of users, ReaSeq achieves substantial gains: >6.0% in IPV and CTR, >2.9% in Orders, and >2.5% in GMV, validating the effectiveness of world-knowledge-enhanced reasoning over purely log-driven approaches."

Existing RIS weight optimization algorithms typically rely on accurate theoretical radiation models.

In this report, a residual learning network-assisted simulated annealing (ResNet-SA) framework is proposed to address this mismatch without requiring explicit knowledge of the distorted electric field. By learning the residual difference between the theoretical and true antenna gains, a neural network (NN) is embedded in a heuristic optimization algorithm to find the optimal weight vector. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves improved null depth in the true radiation pattern as compared with conventional methods that optimize weights based solely on the theoretical model, validating the effectiveness of the ResNet-SA algorithm for reflector antenna systems with approximate knowledge of the pattern."

This paper describes the first PLC-centric lateral movement technique that relies exclusively on the native functionality of the victim environment. This OT-specific form of `living off the land' is herein distinguished as `living off the plant' (LOTP). The described technique also facilitates escape from IP networks onto legacy serial networks via dual-homed PLCs. Furthermore, this technique is covert, leveraging common network communication functions that are challenging to detect.

Existing jailbreaking research primarily focuses on general attack scenarios against LLMs, with limited exploration of malicious code generation as a jailbreak target. To address this gap, we propose SPELL, a comprehensive testing framework specifically designed to evaluate the weakness of security alignment in malicious code generation. Our framework employs a time-division selection strategy that systematically constructs jailbreaking prompts by intelligently combining sentences from a prior knowledge dataset, balancing exploration of novel attack patterns with exploitation of successful techniques. Extensive evaluation across three advanced code models (GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5, and Qwen2.5-Coder) demonstrates SPELL's effectiveness, achieving attack success rates of 83.75%, 19.38%, and 68.12% respectively across eight malicious code categories. The generated prompts successfully produce malicious code in real-world AI development tools such as Cursor, with outputs confirmed as malicious by state-of-the-art detection systems at rates exceeding 73%. These findings reveal significant security gaps in current LLM implementations and provide valuable insights for improving AI safety alignment in code generation applications."

All these states involve superpositions of multiples of $p$ photons. We compare states in ordinary ($p=2$) multiplets and higher-order ones ($p>2$) in the most relevant cases, showing that ordinary squeezed multiplets and higher-order ones share some important similarities, as well as some differences. Finally, we present analytical expressions for phase-space distributions (Wigner and characteristic functions) representing ordinary squeezed multiplets. We use this to show that some squeezed multiplets are highly sensitive to perturbations in all phase-space directions, making them interesting for metrological applications."

Traditional tethered sensor configurations often restrict joint movement and introduce mechanical noises. This study proposes a wireless embedded balance system designed to maintain stability on uneven surfaces. The system utilizes a custom-designed foot unit integrated with four load cells and an ESP32-C3 microcontroller to estimate the Center of Pressure (CoP) in real time. The CoP data were transmitted wirelessly to the main controller to minimize the wiring complexity of the 29-DoF VI-ROSE humanoid robot. A PID control strategy is implemented to adjust the torso, hip, and ankle roll joints based on CoP feedback. Experimental characterization demonstrated high sensor precision with an average measurement error of 14.8 g. Furthermore, the proposed control system achieved a 100% success rate in maintaining balance during single-leg lifting tasks at a 3-degree inclination with optimized PID parameters (Kp=0.10, Kd=0.005). These results validate the efficacy of wireless CoP feedback in enhancing the postural stability of humanoid robots, without compromising their mechanical flexibility."

    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate how the choice of initial vector potential and plasma parameters influences the development of accretion columns and jet formation in magnetized accretion flows. Using general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we explore two different configurations of the vector potential $A_φ$ and three plasma beta values $β$ = 50, 100, 500. We analyze how variations in the poloidal magnetic field strength and plasma magnetization affect magnetic flux accumulation near the black hole and the subsequent growth of the accretion column. Our results highlight the dependence of jet launching efficiency and accretion dynamics on the initial magnetic field topology and plasma beta, offering insight into the conditions that favor magnetically arrested disk or standard and normal evolution states."

    "abstract": "Human infants, with only a few hundred hours of speech exposure, acquire basic units of new languages, highlighting a striking efficiency gap compared to the data-hungry self-supervised speech models. To address this gap, this paper introduces SpidR-Adapt for rapid adaptation to new languages using minimal unlabeled data. We cast such low-resource speech representation learning as a meta-learning problem and construct a multi-task adaptive pre-training (MAdaPT) protocol which formulates the adaptation process as a bi-level optimization framework. To enable scalable meta-training under this framework, we propose a novel heuristic solution, first-order bi-level optimization (FOBLO), avoiding heavy computation costs. Finally, we stabilize meta-training by using a robust initialization through interleaved supervision which alternates self-supervised and supervised objectives. Empirically, SpidR-Adapt achieves rapid gains in phonemic discriminability (ABX) and spoken language modeling (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC), improving over in-domain language models after training on less than 1h of target-language audio, over $100\\times$ more data-efficient than standard training. These findings highlight a practical, architecture-agnostic path toward biologically inspired, data-efficient representations. We open-source the training code and model checkpoints at https://github.com/facebookresearch/spidr-adapt."

However, scaling to large-scale processors hosting hundreds of qubits faces a severe input/output (I/O) bottleneck, as the dense cable arrays impose prohibitive constraints on physical footprint, thermal load, wiring complexity, and cost. Here we demonstrate a complete optical I/O architecture for superconducting quantum circuits, in which all control and readout signals are transmitted exclusively via optical photons. Employing a broadband traveling-wave Brillouin microwave-to-optical transducer, we achieve simultaneous frequency-multiplexed optical readout of two qubits. Combined with fiber-integrated photodiode arrays for control signal delivery, this closed-loop optical I/O introduces no measurable degradation to qubit coherence times, with an optically driven single-qubit gate fidelity showing only a 0.19% reduction relative to standard microwave operation. These results establish optical interconnects as a viable path toward large-scale superconducting quantum processors, and open the possibility of networking multiple superconducting quantum computers housed in separate dilution refrigerators through a centralized room-temperature control infrastructure."

We present a bio-inspired 3D flocking algorithm in which each drone interacts only with a minimal set of influential neighbors, relying solely on local alignment and attraction cues. By systematically tuning these two interaction gains, we map a phase diagram revealing sharp transitions between swarming and schooling, as well as a critical region where susceptibility, polarization fluctuations, and reorganization capacity peak. Outdoor experiments with a swarm of ten drones, combined with simulations using a calibrated flight-dynamics model, show that operating near this transition enhances responsiveness to external disturbances. When confronted with an intruder, the swarm performs rapid collective turns, transient expansions, and reliably recovers high alignment within seconds. These results demonstrate that minimal local-interaction rules are sufficient to generate multiple collective phases and that simple gain modulation offers an efficient mechanism to adjust stability, flexibility, and resilience in drone swarms."

Deep learning reconstruction methods are a promising alternative to classical analytical and iterative reconstruction methods, but applying such methods to CBCT is often difficult due to the lack of ground truth data, memory limitations and the need for fast inference at clinically-relevant resolutions. In this work we propose LIRE++, an end-to-end rotationally-equivariant multiscale learned invertible primal-dual scheme for fast and memory-efficient CBCT reconstruction. Memory optimizations and multiscale reconstruction allow for fast training and inference, while rotational equivariance improves parameter efficiency. LIRE++ was trained on simulated projection data from a fast quasi-Monte Carlo CBCT projection simulator that we developed as well. Evaluated on synthetic data, LIRE++ gave an average improvement of 1 dB in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio over alternative deep learning baselines. On real clinical data, LIRE++ improved the average Mean Absolute Error between the reconstruction and the corresponding planning CT by 10 Hounsfield Units with respect to current proprietary state-of-the-art hybrid deep-learning/iterative method."

Particular emphasis is placed on Heusler systems in which half-metallic ferromagnetism and spin-gapless semiconductor state are realized. Although these compounds are crystallographically rather \"ordinary\", peculiarities of their electronic structure and magnetic state lead to unconventional kinetic and magnetic properties. Their magnetic and transport characteristics are highly sensitive to external stimuli, and changes in alloy composition or external parameters can induce transitions between the states considered. This tunability provides further opportunities for controlling the electronic and magnetic properties of Heusler alloys and for exploiting them in applications such as spintronics and micro- and nanoelectronics."

The microscopic model involves a variable viscosity tensor, a non-conservative source term in the Cahn--Hilliard equation, and mixed boundary conditions: no-slip on the outer boundary and Navier slip with zero tangential stress on the surfaces of the solid inclusions. The capillarity strength $λ^\\varepsilon>0$ depends on the microscopic scale $\\varepsilon>0$. The analysis consists of two main parts. First, for each fixed $\\varepsilon>0$, we prove the existence of a weak solution on a finite time interval $(0,T)$ and derive a priori estimates that are uniform with respect to $\\varepsilon$ (and $λ^\\varepsilon$). Second, we perform the periodic homogenization for the perforated setting, a limit $\\varepsilon\\to0$. Depending on the limit value $λ$ of the capillarity strength $λ^\\varepsilon$, we obtain two distinct effective models: (i) in the vanishing capillarity regime $λ=0$, the limit system is of Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard type, with no macroscopic convection or advection; (ii) in the balanced regime $λ\\in(0,+\\infty)$, we derive a Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system with nonlinear convection and advective transport of the phase field at the macroscopic scale.

Here, we investigate polarons in insulating single-layer MnBr$_2$ grown by molecular beam epitaxy on three different substrates, namely graphene on Ir(110), graphene on Ir(111), and Au(111). The number densities and species of polarons observed vary strongly as a function of the substrate. For MnBr$_2$ grown on Ir(110) the largest number of polaron species is observed, namely four, of which three show clear similarities with the species observed for CoCl$_2$ on graphite. Polarons in single-layer MnBr$_2$ are observed up to 300K. They can be created, converted, and moved by the STM tip when a tunneling current flows at a proper bias voltage. For graphene on Ir(110) as a substrate, mobile polarons in MnBr$_2$ are guided through the periodic potential imposed from the super-moiré resulting from the interaction of MnBr$_2$ with graphene and Ir(110). Our findings indicate that modeling of polarons in such single-layer insulators in contact with a conducting substrate requires to take the substrate explicitly into account."

Most importantly, we show that the lattice shrinking rules obey the fusion--shrinking consistency relations predicted by twisted $BF$ field theory, providing solid evidence for the validity of field-theoretical principles developed over the past years. In particular, we compute the full set of excitations, fusion, and shrinking data at the microscopic lattice level and verify exact agreement between the microscopic $\\mathbb{D}_4$ quantum double lattice model and the continuum $BF$ field theory with an $AAB$ twist and $(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$ gauge group, thereby placing the latter field theory, originally discovered in 2018 in connection with Borromean-ring braiding, on a solid microscopic footing. Our results bridge continuum topological field theory and exactly solvable lattice models, elevate fusion--shrinking consistency from a continuum field-theoretical principle to a genuine topological phenomenon defined at the microscopic lattice scale, and provide a concrete microscopic foundation for experimentally engineering higher-dimensional non-Abelian topological orders in controllable quantum simulators, such as trapped-ion systems."

The critical gap must also exist in a person's mind and hence, together with the perceived gap, is a latent variable. Finally, it is also proposed that the critical gap is influenced by various exogenous variables such as subject and opposing vehicle types, and perceived waiting time. Mathematical models that (i) incorporate systematic and random distortions during the perception process and (ii) account for the effect of the various influencing variables are developed. The parameters of these models are estimated for two different gap acceptance data sets using the maximum likelihood technique. The data is collected as part of this study. The estimated parameters throw valuable insights into how these influencing variables affect the critical gap. The results corroborate the initial predictions on the nature of influence these variables must exert and give strength to the gap acceptance decision-making construct proposed here. This work also proposes a methodology to estimate a measurable/observable world emulator of the latent variable critical gap. The use of the emulator critical gap provides improved estimates of derived quantities like the average waiting time of subject vehicles. Finally, studies are also conducted to show that the number of rejected gaps can work as a reasonable surrogate for the influencing variable, waiting time."

This generalisation furnishes a principled approach to structure learning under a plausible set of generative models or hypotheses. In active inference, policies - i.e., combinations of actions - are selected based on their expected free energy, which comprises expected information gain and value. Information gain corresponds to the KL divergence between predictive posteriors with, and without, the consequences of action. Posteriors over models can be evaluated quickly and efficiently using Bayesian Model Reduction, based upon accumulated posterior beliefs about model parameters. The ensuing information gain can then be used to select actions that disambiguate among alternative models, in the spirit of optimal experimental design. We illustrate this kind of active selection or reasoning using partially observed discrete models; namely, a 'three-ball' paradigm used previously to describe artificial insight and 'aha moments' via (synthetic) introspection or sleep. We focus on the sample efficiency afforded by seeking outcomes that resolve the greatest uncertainty about the world model, under which outcomes are generated."

They are both APX-hard in general graphs. However, this hardness does not carry over to the planar setting, which is not well understood, except for very small values of k. One main obstacle in using standard decomposition techniques for planar graphs, like Baker's technique and extensions thereof, is that connectivity requirements are global (rather than local) properties that are not captured by existing frameworks. We present a novel, and arguably clean, decomposition technique for such classical connectivity problems on planar graphs. This technique immediately implies PTASs for the problems of finding a smallest k-edge-connected or k-vertex-connected spanning subgraph of a planar graph for arbitrary k. By leveraging structural results for minimally k-edge-connected graphs, we further obtain a PTAS for planar k-connectivity augmentation for any constant k. We complement this with an NP-hardness result, showing that our results are essentially optimal."

We present, to our knowledge, the first evaluation of an LLM-based medication safety review system on real NHS primary care data, with detailed characterisation of key failure behaviours across varying levels of clinical complexity. In a retrospective study using a population-scale EHR spanning 2,125,549 adults in NHS Cheshire and Merseyside, we strategically sampled patients to capture a broad range of clinical complexity and medication safety risk, yielding 277 patients after data-quality exclusions. An expert clinician reviewed these patients and graded system-identified issues and proposed interventions. Our primary LLM system showed strong performance in recognising when a clinical issue is present (sensitivity 100\\% [95\\% CI 98.2--100], specificity 83.1\\% [95\\% CI 72.7--90.1]), yet correctly identified all issues and interventions in only 46.9\\% [95\\% CI 41.1--52.8] of patients. Failure analysis reveals that, in this setting, the dominant failure mechanism is contextual reasoning rather than missing medication knowledge, with five primary patterns: overconfidence in uncertainty, applying standard guidelines without adjusting for patient context, misunderstanding how healthcare is delivered in practice, factual errors, and process blindness. These patterns persisted across patient complexity and demographic strata, and across a range of state-of-the-art models and configurations. We provide 45 detailed vignettes that comprehensively cover all identified failure cases. This work highlights shortcomings that must be addressed before LLM-based clinical AI can be safely deployed. It also begs larger-scale, prospective evaluations and deeper study of LLM behaviours in clinical contexts."

In this paper, we present a simple yet effective model architecture termed STLDM, a diffusion-based model that learns the latent representation from end to end alongside both the Variational Autoencoder and the conditioning network. STLDM decomposes this task into two stages: a deterministic forecasting stage handled by the conditioning network, and an enhancement stage performed by the latent diffusion model. Experimental results on multiple radar datasets demonstrate that STLDM achieves superior performance compared to the state of the art, while also improving inference efficiency.

Building on a new fundamental theorem of asset pricing and a superhedging duality in this setting, we introduce a notion of bubble based on a novel definition of the fundamental price, and analyze their types and characterization. We show that two distinct types of bubbles arise, depending on the maturity structure of the asset. For assets with bounded maturity and no dividend payments, the $G$-supermartingale property of prices provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of bubbles. In contrast, when maturity is unbounded, the infi-supermartingale property yields a necessary condition, while the $G$-supermartingale property remains sufficient. Moreover, there is no bubble under a strengthened no dominance condition. As applications, we examine price bubbles for several standard contingent claims. We show that put-call parity generally fails for fundamental prices, whereas it holds for market prices under no dominance assumption. Furthermore, we establish bounds for the fundamental and market prices of American call options in terms of the corresponding European call prices, adjusted by the associated bubble components."

However, increasing an interior vertex to a tree reduces the value of corresponding Neumann eigenvalues. As a consequence of this result, we provide an upper bound for the second Neumann eigenvalue and a lower bound for the largest Neumann eigenvalue on trees. Then, we obtain a sharp upper bound for the second Neumann eigenvalue on paths in terms of its diameter, and as an application, we show that the second Neumann eigenvalue cannot be bounded below by a positive real number on the family of paths. We also prove that under a diameter constraint on trees, the largest Neumann eigenvalue cannot be bounded from above. Finally, we obtain a lower bound for the second Neumann eigenvalue on graphs."

    "abstract": "Controlled and multi-controlled quantum gates, whose action on a target qubit depends on the state of multiple control qubits, represent a fundamental logical building block for complex quantum algorithms. We propose a scheme for realizing this class of gates based on non-Abelian holonomies in modulated photonic waveguide networks. Our approach relies on linear photonic cicuits formed by two star networks coupled via a two-path circuit. A star network with M peripheral waveguides coupled to a single central site, or M-pod, naturally generalizes the tripod structure used in non-Abelian Thouless pumping and stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP). In the present work, we first analyze the minimal case of two connected tripods and design adiabatic driving loops that implement single-qubit, CNOT, and SWAP gates. We then show how extending the approach to larger M-pod structures enables the realization of multiply controlled operations, which we exemplify by designing Toffoli and the OR gate on two coupled pentapods. Finally, we demonstrate that networks of connected tripods can implement the Deutsch quantum query algorithm."

To address this limitation, we present T2AV-Compass, a unified benchmark for comprehensive evaluation of T2AV systems, consisting of 500 diverse and complex prompts constructed via a taxonomy-driven pipeline to ensure semantic richness and physical plausibility. Besides, T2AV-Compass introduces a dual-level evaluation framework that integrates objective signal-level metrics for video quality, audio quality, and cross-modal alignment with a subjective MLLM-as-a-Judge protocol for instruction following and realism assessment. Extensive evaluation of 11 representative T2AVsystems reveals that even the strongest models fall substantially short of human-level realism and cross-modal consistency, with persistent failures in audio realism, fine-grained synchronization, instruction following, etc. These results indicate significant improvement room for future models and highlight the value of T2AV-Compass as a challenging and diagnostic testbed for advancing text-to-audio-video generation."

In this work, we study a lightweight 2-degree-of-freedom (DoF) arm mounted on a quadrotor via a differential mechanism, capable of full six-DoF end-effector pose control. While the minimal design enables simplicity and reduced payload, it also introduces challenges such as underactuation and sensitivity to external disturbances, including manipulation of heavy loads and pushing tasks. To address these, we employ reinforcement learning, training a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent in simulation to generate feedforward commands for quadrotor acceleration and body rates, along with joint angle targets. These commands are tracked by an incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) attitude controller and a PID joint controller, respectively. Flight experiments demonstrate centimeter-level position accuracy and degree-level orientation precision, with robust performance under external force disturbances. The results highlight the potential of learning-based control strategies for enabling contact-rich aerial manipulation using simple, lightweight platforms."

In this paper, we propose a Dyna-Style Reinforcement Learning control framework that integrates Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) with Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) reinforcement learning. SINDy is used to identify a data-driven model of the system, capturing its key dynamics without requiring an explicit physical model. This identified model is used to generate synthetic rollouts that are periodically injected into the reinforcement learning replay buffer during training on the real environment, enabling efficient policy learning with limited data available. By leveraging this hybrid approach, we mitigate the sample inefficiency of traditional model-free reinforcement learning methods while ensuring accurate control of nonlinear systems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework, we apply it to a bi-rotor system as a case study, evaluating its performance in stabilization and trajectory tracking. The results show that our SINDy-TD3 approach achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to direct reinforcement learning techniques, highlighting the potential of combining data-driven modeling with reinforcement learning for complex dynamical systems."

Our simulations successfully produce slowly rotating WNE stars and determine optimal parameters for both mechanisms ($A \\ge 10$ for internal gravity waves (IGWs), $α= 0.01$ for revised Tayler instability (TSF)).

Raman measurements were performed from 5 to 300 K to probe phonon dynamics across multiple structural and magnetic phase transitions. Our analysis reveals pronounced thermal hysteresis in phonon self-energy parameters and dynamic Raman susceptibility, confirming the first-order nature of the antipolar transition near TC1 ~ 145 K and a second-order transition near TC2 ~ 190 K. Low-frequency modes associated with Cu+ and Cr3+ ions exhibit softening and anomalous linewidth behaviour, in particular phonon mode P2 (~ 37 cm-1) showing non-monotonic temperature dependence and intensity enhancement near 60 K suggesting persistent off-centre Cu+ dynamics in the quasi-antipolar phase. The coexistence and coupling of soft phonon modes and central peaks indicate a crossover from displacive to order-disorder type transition mechanisms. Additionally, phonon anomalies below the Néel temperature (TN ~ 32 K) reflect spin-phonon coupling, linking lattice vibrations to long-range magnetic correlations. Our findings provide critical insight into the lattice instabilities, symmetry evolution, and quasiparticle interactions in CuCrP2S6, offering a deeper understanding of phase transition dynamics in two-dimensional multiferroic systems and guiding future design of magnetoelectric and spintronic devices."

This surge highlights the need to understand the nuances of student-AI interactions, especially those rare yet crucial. However, automated coding may struggle to capture these rare codes due to imbalanced data, while human coding remains time-consuming and labour-intensive. The current study examined the potential of large language models (LLMs) to approximate or replace humans in deductive, theory-driven coding, while also exploring how human-AI collaboration might support such coding tasks at scale. We compared the coding performance of small transformer classifiers (e.g., BERT) and LLMs in two datasets, with particular attention to imbalanced head-tail distributions in dialogue codes. Our results showed that LLMs did not outperform BERT-based models and exhibited systematic errors and biases in deductive coding tasks. We designed and evaluated a human-AI collaborative workflow that improved coding efficiency while maintaining coding reliability. Our findings reveal both the limitations of LLMs -- especially their difficulties with semantic similarity and theoretical interpretations and the indispensable role of human judgment -- while demonstrating the practical promise of human-AI collaborative workflows for coding."

Notably, the leading coefficients are merely required to be sufficiently small in BMO, which is strictly weaker than the VMO condition. In the complex setting, the well-posedness of this problem was recently investigated in [W. Kim, M. Vestberg, Existence, uniqueness and regularity for elliptic $p$-Laplace systems with complex coefficients,arXiv:2503.18932], where the authors established a strong accretivity condition on the leading coefficients, and this structural condition allows them to derive Schauder-type estimates for weak solutions. In our study, it has already been observed that gaining existence and uniqueness of weak solutions is possible under a natural and less restrictive assumption on the complex-valued coefficients. Following this direction, we prove a global Caderón-Zygmund-type estimate for weak solutions, from which the Morrey-space regularity follows as a consequence. This paper is a contribution to the better understanding of solution behavior and may be viewed as part of a series of works aimed at extending regularity theory in the complex-valued setting."

With a literature review of related works covering various data types and applications, we identify features of medical visualization and visual analysis research and formulate our model thereafter. Compared to previous design study process models, our new model emphasizes: distinguishing between different stakeholders and target users before initiating specific designs, distinguishing design stages according to analytic logic or cognitive habits, and classifying task types as inferential or descriptive, and further hypothesis-based or hypothesis-free based on whether they involve multiple subgroups. In addition, our model refines previous models according to the characteristics of medical problems and provides referable guidance for each step. These improvements make the visualization design targeted, generalizable, and operational, which can adapt to the complexity and diversity of medical problems. We apply this model to guide the design of a visual analysis method and reanalyze three medical visualization-related works. These examples suggest that the new process model can provide a systematic theoretical framework and practical guidance for interdisciplinary medical visualization research. We give recommendations that future researchers can refer to, report on reflections on the model, and delineate it from existing models."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for automated code generation, yet their apparent successes often mask a tension between pretraining objectives and alignment choices. While pretraining encourages models to exploit all available signals to maximize success, alignment, whether through fine-tuning or prompting, may restrict their use. This conflict is especially salient in agentic AI settings, for instance when an agent has access to unit tests that, although intended for validation, act as strong contextual signals that can be leveraged regardless of explicit prohibitions. In this paper, we investigate how LLMs adapt their code generation strategies when exposed to test cases under different prompting conditions. Using the BigCodeBench (Hard) dataset, we design five prompting conditions that manipulate test visibility and impose explicit or implicit restrictions on their use. We evaluate five LLMs (four open-source and one closed-source) across correctness, code similarity, program size, and code churn, and analyze cross-model consistency to identify recurring adaptation strategies. Our results show that test visibility dramatically alters performance, correctness nearly doubles for some models, while explicit restrictions or partial exposure only partially mitigate this effect. Beyond raw performance, we identify four recurring adaptation strategies, with test-driven refinement emerging as the most frequent. These results highlight how LLMs adapt their behavior when exposed to contextual signals that conflict with explicit instructions, providing useful insight into how models reconcile pretraining objectives with alignment constraints."

This perspective suggests the possibility of a more general minimax theorem from which a wide array of game-theoretic results would follow. After developing a new framing of game-theoretic probability via gamble spaces, we prove such a theorem for finite time. Applying this minimax theorem to games derived from existing measure-theoretic statements, we prove several existing and novel game-theoretic statements.

Phys. 163, 174109 (2025)] for low-rank tensor compression, to enable a formally $O(N^3)$-scaling $GW$ algorithm. By integrating BTD with an imaginary-time $GW$ formalism and introducing a real space screening strategy for the polarizability, we achieve an observed scaling of approximately $O(N^2)$ in test systems. Key parameters of the algorithm are optimized on the S66 dataset using the JADE algorithm, ensuring a balanced compromise between accuracy and efficiency. Our BTD-based random phase approximation also exhibits $O(N^2)$ scaling, and eigenvalue-self-consistent $GW$ calculations become feasible for systems with over 3000 basis functions. This work establishes BTD as an efficient and scalable approach for large-scale $GW$ calculations in molecular systems."

However, no efficient defense framework exists to protect such videos against 3D-field TFG methods. While image-based defenses could apply per-frame 2D perturbations, they incur prohibitive computational costs, severe video quality degradation, failing to disrupt 3D information for video protection. To address this, we propose a novel and efficient video defense framework against 3D-field TFG methods, which protects portrait video by perturbing the 3D information acquisition process while maintain high-fidelity video quality. Specifically, our method introduces: (1) a similarity-guided parameter sharing mechanism for computational efficiency, and (2) a multi-scale dual-domain attention module to jointly optimize spatial-frequency perturbations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework exhibits strong defense capability and achieves a 47x acceleration over the fastest baseline while maintaining high fidelity. Moreover, it remains robust against scaling operations and state-of-the-art purification attacks, and the effectiveness of our design choices is further validated through ablation studies.

Yet, current onboard GNSS processing is largely standalone and often insufficient for high-precision applications, while centralized fusion is challenging due to computational bottlenecks and the lack of in-orbit infrastructure. In this work, we report a decentralized GNSS network over large-scale LEO constellations, where each satellite processes its own measurements while exchanging compact information with neighboring nodes to enable precise orbit and time determination. We model the moving constellation as a dynamic graph and tailor a momentum-accelerated gradient tracking (GT) method to ensure steady convergence despite topology changes. Numerical simulations with constellations containing hundreds of satellites show that the proposed method matches the accuracy of an ideal centralized benchmark, while substantially reducing communication burdens. Ultimately, this framework supports the development of autonomous and self-organizing space systems, enabling high-precision navigation with reduced dependence on continuous ground contact."

Primarily using static scoring, current evaluation methods are fundamentally limited. They struggle to determine the proper mix ratio across diverse benchmarks, and critically, they fail to capture a model's dynamic competitive fitness or its vulnerability when confronted with sequential, high-stakes tasks. To address this, we introduce the novel Competitive Swiss-System Dynamics (CSD) framework. CSD simulates a multi-round, sequential contest where models are dynamically paired across a curated sequence of benchmarks based on their accumulated win-loss record. And Monte Carlo Simulation ($N=100,000$ iterations) is used to approximate the statistically robust Expected Win Score ($E[S_m]$), which eliminates the noise of random pairing and early-round luck. Furthermore, we implement a Failure Sensitivity Analysis by parameterizing the per-round elimination quantity ($T_k$), which allows us to profile models based on their risk appetite--distinguishing between robust generalists and aggressive specialists. We demonstrate that CSD provides a more nuanced and context-aware ranking than traditional aggregate scoring and static pairwise models, representing a vital step towards risk-informed, next-generation LLM evaluation."

The framework is implemented in a modular multi-agent architecture, which has specific agents (budgeting, nutrition, price monitoring, and health personalization). These agents share the knowledge base and use the substitution graph to ensure that the nutritional quality is maintained at a minimum cost. Simulations with a representative Saudi household case study show a steady 12-18\\% reduction in costs relative to a static weekly menu, nutrient adequacy of over 95\\% and high performance with price changes of 20-30%. The findings indicate that the framework can locally combine affordability with nutritional adequacy and provide a viable avenue of capacity-building towards sustainable and fair diet planning in line with Sustainable Development Goals on Zero Hunger and Good Health."

    "abstract": "Autonomous Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems have emerged as a promising paradigm for facilitating cross-application and cross-organization collaborations. These autonomous agents often operate in trustless environments, where centralized coordination faces significant challenges, such as the inability to ensure transparent contribution measurement and equitable incentive distribution. While blockchain is frequently proposed as a decentralized coordination platform, it inherently introduces high on-chain computation costs and risks exposing sensitive execution information of the agents. Consequently, the core challenge lies in enabling auditable task execution and fair incentive distribution for autonomous LLM agents in trustless environments, while simultaneously preserving their strategic privacy and minimizing on-chain costs. To address this challenge, we propose DAO-Agent, a novel framework that integrates three key technical innovations: (1) an on-chain decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance mechanism for transparent coordination and immutable logging; (2) a ZKP mechanism approach that enables Shapley-based contribution measurement off-chain, and (3) a hybrid on-chain/off-chain architecture that verifies ZKP-validated contribution measurements on-chain with minimal computational overhead. We implement DAO-Agent and conduct end-to-end experiments using a crypto trading task as a case study. Experimental results demonstrate that DAO-Agent achieves up to 99.9% reduction in verification gas costs compared to naive on-chain alternatives, with constant-time verification complexity that remains stable as coalition size increases, thereby establishing a scalable foundation for agent coordination in decentralized environments."

    "abstract": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced task-solving capabilities in natural language processing with large language models. Unlike standard prompting, CoT encourages the model to generate intermediate reasoning steps, non-answer tokens, that help guide the model toward more accurate final outputs. These intermediate steps enable more complex reasoning processes such as error correction, memory management, future planning, and self-reflection. However, applying CoT to non-natural language domains, such as protein and RNA language models, is not yet possible, primarily due to the limited expressiveness of their token spaces (e.g., amino acid tokens). In this work, we propose and define the concept of language expressiveness: the ability of a given language, using its tokens and grammar, to encode information. We show that the limited expressiveness of protein language severely restricts the applicability of CoT-style reasoning. To overcome this, we introduce reflection pretraining, for the first time in a biological sequence model, which enables the model to engage in intermediate reasoning through the generation of auxiliary \"thinking tokens\" beyond simple answer tokens. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our augmented token set significantly enhances biological language expressiveness, thereby improving the overall reasoning capacity of the model. Experimentally, our pretraining approach teaches protein models to self-correct and leads to substantial performance gains compared to standard pretraining."

While current graph-based methods offer an efficient, structured approach by abstracting the environment into a topological map and simplifying the action space to waypoint selection, they lag behind methods based on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in leveraging large-scale data and advanced training paradigms. In this paper, we try to bridge this gap by introducing ETP-R1, a framework that applies the paradigm of scaling up data and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to a graph-based VLN-CE model. To build a strong foundation, we first construct a high-quality, large-scale pretraining dataset using the Gemini API. This dataset consists of diverse, low-hallucination instructions for topological trajectories, providing rich supervision for our graph-based policy to map language to topological paths. This foundation is further strengthened by unifying data from both R2R and RxR tasks for joint pretraining. Building on this, we introduce a three-stage training paradigm, which culminates in the first application of closed-loop, online RFT to a graph-based VLN-CE model, powered by the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is highly effective, establishing new state-of-the-art performance across all major metrics on both the R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks.

    "abstract": "The rapid progress of generative models has intensified the need for reliable and robust detection under real-world conditions. However, existing detectors often overfit to generator-specific artifacts and remain highly sensitive to real-world degradations. As generative architectures evolve and images undergo multi-round cross-platform sharing and post-processing (chain degradations), these artifact cues become obsolete and harder to detect. To address this, we propose Real-centric Envelope Modeling (REM), a new paradigm that shifts detection from learning generator artifacts to modeling the robust distribution of real images. REM introduces feature-level perturbations in self-reconstruction to generate near-real samples, and employs an envelope estimator with cross-domain consistency to learn a boundary enclosing the real image manifold. We further build RealChain, a comprehensive benchmark covering both open-source and commercial generators with simulated real-world degradation. Across eight benchmark evaluations, REM achieves an average improvement of 7.5% over state-of-the-art methods, and notably maintains exceptional generalization on the severely degraded RealChain benchmark, establishing a solid foundation for synthetic image detection under real-world conditions. The code and the RealChain benchmark will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper."

Visual programming addresses this by decomposing problems into steps calling specialized tools, yet existing methods rely on either fixed toolsets or speculative tool induction before solving problems, resulting in suboptimal programs and poor utilization of induced tools. We present Transductive Visual Programming (TVP), a novel framework that builds new tools from its own experience rather than speculation. TVP first solves problems using basic tools while accumulating experiential solutions into an Example Library, then abstracts recurring patterns from these programs into reusable higher-level tools for an evolving Tool Library. This allows TVP to tackle new problems with increasingly powerful tools learned from experience. On Omni3D-Bench, TVP achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming GPT-4o by 22% and the previous best visual programming system by 11%. Our transductively learned tools are used 5x more frequently as core program dependency than inductively created ones, demonstrating more effective tool discovery and reuse. The evolved tools also show strong generalization to unseen spatial tasks, achieving superior performance on benchmarks from SpatialScore-Hard collection without any testset-specific modification. Our work establishes experience-driven transductive tool creation as a powerful paradigm for building self-evolving visual programming agents that effectively tackle challenging spatial reasoning tasks.

    "abstract": "Multiple cellular processes are triggered when the concentration of a regulatory protein reaches a critical threshold. Previous analyses have characterized timing statistics for single-gene systems. However, many biological timers are based on cascades of genes that activate each other sequentially. Here, we develop an analytical framework to describe the timing precision of such cascades using a burst-dilution hybrid stochastic model. We first revisit the single-gene case and recover the known result of an optimal activation threshold that minimizes first-passage-time (FPT) variability. Extending this concept to two-gene cascades, we identify three distinct optimization regimes determined by the ratio of intrinsic noise levels and the protein dilution rate, defining when coupling improves or worsens timing precision compared to a single-gene strategy. Generalizing to cascades of arbitrary gene length, we obtain a simple mathematical condition that determines when a new gene in the cascade can decrease the timing noise based on its intrinsic noise and protein dilution rate. In the specific case of a cascade of identical genes, our analytical results predict suppression of FPT noise with increasing cascade length and the existence of a mean time that decreases relative timing fluctuations. Together, these results define the intrinsic limits of timekeeping precision in gene regulatory cascades and provide a minimal analytical framework to explore timing control in biological systems."

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in computer vision have successfully extended Open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) to the 3D domain by leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS). Despite this progress, efficiently rendering the high-dimensional features required for open-vocabulary queries poses a significant challenge. Existing methods employ codebooks or feature compression, causing information loss, thereby degrading segmentation quality. To address this limitation, we introduce Quantile Rendering (Q-Render), a novel rendering strategy for 3D Gaussians that efficiently handles high-dimensional features while maintaining high fidelity. Unlike conventional volume rendering, which densely samples all 3D Gaussians intersecting each ray, Q-Render sparsely samples only those with dominant influence along the ray. By integrating Q-Render into a generalizable 3D neural network, we also propose Gaussian Splatting Network (GS-Net), which predicts Gaussian features in a generalizable manner. Extensive experiments on ScanNet and LeRF demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while enabling real-time rendering with an approximate ~43.7x speedup on 512-D feature maps.

The framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, a dataset is created comprising problem-agnostic graph features and hardness classifications of problem instances. Machine-learning-based classification algorithms are trained to map graph features to hardness categories. In the second stage, the framework explains the predictions using an association rule mining algorithm. Additionally, machine-learning-based regression models are trained to predict algorithmic computation times. The GCO-HPIF framework was applied to a dataset of 3287 maximum clique problem instances compiled from the COLLAB, IMDB, and TWITTER graph datasets using five state-of-the-art algorithms, namely three exact branch-and-bound-based algorithms (Gurobi, CliSAT, and MOMC) and two graph-neural-network-based algorithms (EGN and HGS). The framework demonstrated excellent performance in predicting instance hardness, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.9921, a minority-class F1 score of 0.878, and an ROC-AUC score of 0.9083 using only three graph features. The best association rule found by the FP-Growth algorithm for explaining the hardness predictions had a support of 0.8829 for hard instances and an overall accuracy of 87.64 percent, underscoring the framework's usefulness for both prediction and explanation. Furthermore, the best-performing regression model for predicting computation times achieved a percentage RMSE of 5.12 and an R2 value of 0.991."

    "abstract": "The conventional functional form of the Constant-Elasticity-of-Substitution (CES) production function is a general production function nesting a number of other forms of production functions. Examples of such functions include Leontief, Cobb-Douglas, and linear production functions. Nevertheless, the conventional form of the CES production specification is still restrictive in multiple aspects. One example is the fact that the marginal effect of increasing input use always has to be to increase the variability of output quantity by the conventional construction of this function. This paper proposes a generalized variant of the CES production function that allows for various input effects on the probability distribution of output. Failure to allow for this possible input-output risk structure is indeed one of the limitations of the conventional form of the CES production function. This limitation may result in false inferences about input-driven output risk. In light of this, the present paper proposes a solution to this problem. First, it is shown that the familiar CES formulation suffers from very restrictive structural assumptions regarding risk considerations, and that such restrictions may lead to biased and inefficient estimates of production quantity and production risk. Following the general theme of Just and Pope's approach, a CES-based production-function specification that overcomes this shortcoming of the original CES production function is introduced, and a three-stage Nonlinear Least-Squares (NLS) estimation procedure for the estimation of the proposed functional form is presented. To illustrate the proposed approaches in this paper, two empirical applications in irrigation and fertilizer response using the famous Hexem-Heady experimental dataset are provided. Finally, implications for modeling input-driven production risks are discussed."

However,realizing such dynamics in artificial materials, particularly under low-energy stimuli, remains a fundamental challenge.Here we harness and amplify them to construct a strongly dipolar-coupled network of SmCo5 macrospins at wafer scale, which can exhibit intrinsic interaction-driven collective dynamics in response to voltage pulses. The network combines three essential ingredients,i.e.strong dipolar coupling enabled by large single-domain macrospin, giant voltage control of coercivity over nearly 1000-fold, the largest reported to date, and a disordered network topology with frustrated Ising-like energy landscape. When stimulated by 1 V pulses, the network enters a regime where interaction-driven magnetic behaviors emerge, including spontaneous demagnetization, greatly enhanced magnetization modulation, reversible freeze and resume evolution and stochastic convergence toward low-energy magnetic configurations. All these behaviors are completely absent at the single-nanomagnet level. Furthermore, by constructing micromagnetic models of the strongly dipolar-coupled macrospin networks calibrated to experiments, we show that the resulting nonlinear, high-dimensional collective dynamics, which are characteristic of strongly-interacting systems, can enable accurate chaotic Mackey-Glass prediction and multiclass drone-signal classification. Our work establishes the voltage-responsive strongly-coupled SmCo5 network as a mesoscopic platform for probing emergent magnetic dynamics previously inaccessible under ambient conditions.It also suggests a fundamental distinct route towards scalable,low-voltage computing, one rooted in native physical interaction-driven collective dynamics at the network level."

Since the problem only involves discrete variables, i.e., vertex-constrained positions, integer-constrained angles, and the number of cones, we alternately optimize these three types of variables to achieve tractable convergence. Central to high efficiency is an explicit construction algorithm that reduces the optimization problem scale to be slightly greater than the number of integer variables for determining the optimal angles with fixed positions and numbers, even for high-genus surfaces. In addition, we derive a new derivative formula that allows us to move the cones, effectively reducing distortion until convergence. Combined with other strategies, including repositioning and adding cones to decrease distortion, adaptively selecting a constrained number of integer variables for efficient optimization, and pairing cones to reduce the number, we quickly achieve a favorable tradeoff between the number of cones and the parameterization distortion. We demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of our cones by using them to generate rotationally seamless and low-distortion parameterizations on a massive test data set. Our method demonstrates an order-of-magnitude speedup (30$\\times$ faster on average) compared to state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining comparable cone numbers and parameterization distortion."

Mainstream solutions typically rely on explicit modality alignment strategies; however, this paradigm heavily depends on constructing large-scale paired datasets for pre-training. To address this, grounded in the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, we explore the potential of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) in bridging modality gaps. Recognizing the suboptimal performance of existing generic Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods that operate within the weight space, particularly on limited-capacity models, we shift the optimization perspective to the feature space and propose a novel PEFT strategy termed Domain Representation Injection (DRI). Specifically, while keeping the VFM fully frozen to maximize the preservation of general knowledge, we design a lightweight, learnable Offset Encoder to extract domain-specific representations rich in modality and identity attributes from raw inputs. Guided by the contextual information of intermediate features at different layers, a Modulator adaptively transforms these representations. Subsequently, they are injected into the intermediate layers via additive fusion, dynamically reshaping the feature distribution to adapt to the downstream task without altering the VFM's pre-trained weights. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance with minimal trainable parameters. For instance, on the HOSS-ReID dataset, we attain 57.9\\% and 60.5\\% mAP using only 1.54M and 7.05M parameters, respectively. The code is available at https://github.com/TingfengXian/DRI."

Here, we present an exact and general proof of this statement based on probability current decompositions of mutual information rates between molecular abundances. This suggests that variability in cellular components is necessary for cellular control and that fluctuating components do not necessarily generate cellular \"noise\" but may correspond to control molecules that are involved in removing \"noise\" from other cellular components."

This paper presents a decision-focused learning (DFL) framework that addresses the computational-accuracy trade-off in UPHES day-ahead scheduling. The proposed methodology employs neural networks to predict penalty weights that guide recursive linearization, transforming the intractable MINLP into a sequence of convex quadratic programs trained end-to-end via differentiable optimization layers. Case studies across 19 representative Belgian electricity market scenarios demonstrate that the DFL framework effectively navigates the trade-off between solution quality and computation time. As a refinement tool, the framework improves profit by 1.1% over piecewise MIQP baselines. Alternatively, as a real-time scheduler initialized with linear approximations, it achieves a 300-fold speedup (3.87s vs 1205.79s) while maintaining profitability within 3.6% of the piecewise MIQP benchmark.

    "abstract": "A central challenge for scalable quantum networks is the realization of coherent interfaces between stationary qubits and telecom-band photonic qubits for long-distance entanglement distribution. Semiconductor quantum dots emitting at telecom wavelengths present a promising spin-photon platform, and a precise understanding of the properties of the confined spin is crucial for optimizing its interplay with the photonic qubit. Here, we simultaneously benchmark the electron and hole g-factors and coherence properties of a droplet epitaxy QD, solely from time and polarization resolved photon correlations. These measurements identify the hole as the preferable qubit for spin-photon entanglement in quantum network nodes. We then perform full state tomography of the confined hole ground state to reveal subtle anisotropies in the spin precession, providing essential diagnostics for minimizing phase errors critical for deterministic multiphoton entanglement generation."

In addition to the tidal deformability, the quasinormal modes excited in a neutron star are also an important property for extracting information about the neutron star interior, adopting gravitational wave asteroseismology. In this study, we especially focus on the magnetic tidal deformability, which acts on the gravitational waveform from a neutron star binary merger as a higher-order effect than the electric tidal deformability, and derive the universal relations expressing the quasinormal modes, such as the fundamental ($f$-), 1st pressure ($p_1$-), and 1st spacetime ($w_1$-) modes, as a function of the magnetic tidal deformability. The universal relations derived in this study exhibit accuracy more or less comparable to those of the electric tidal deformability."

    "abstract": "To address the issues of weak correlation between multi-view features, low recognition accuracy of small-scale targets, and insufficient robustness in complex scenarios in underground pipeline detection using 3D GPR, this paper proposes a 3D pipeline intelligent detection framework. First, based on a B/C/D-Scan three-view joint analysis strategy, a three-dimensional pipeline three-view feature evaluation method is established by cross-validating forward simulation results obtained using FDTD methods with actual measurement data. Second, the DCO-YOLO framework is proposed, which integrates DySample, CGLU, and OutlookAttention cross-dimensional correlation mechanisms into the original YOLOv11 algorithm, significantly improving the small-scale pipeline edge feature extraction capability. Furthermore, a 3D-DIoU spatial feature matching algorithm is proposed, which integrates three-dimensional geometric constraints and center distance penalty terms to achieve automated association of multi-view annotations. The three-view fusion strategy resolves inherent ambiguities in single-view detection. Experiments based on real urban underground pipeline data show that the proposed method achieves accuracy, recall, and mean average precision of 96.2%, 93.3%, and 96.7%, respectively, in complex multi-pipeline scenarios, which are 2.0%, 2.1%, and 0.9% higher than the baseline model. Ablation experiments validated the synergistic optimization effect of the dynamic feature enhancement module and Grad-CAM++ heatmap visualization demonstrated that the improved model significantly enhanced its ability to focus on pipeline geometric features. This study integrates deep learning optimization strategies with the physical characteristics of 3D GPR, offering an efficient and reliable novel technical framework for the intelligent recognition and localization of underground pipelines."

The nematic and magnetic phases are strongly intertwined under applied pressure in FeSe, however, the additional isoelectronic substitution of sulphur offers an elegant way to separate them. Here we report the detailed evolution of the electronic and superconducting behaviour of FeSe$_{0.96}$S$_{0.04}$ under applied pressure via longitudinal magnetoresistance studies up to 15T. At intermediate pressures, inside the nematic phase, the resistivity displays an upturn in zero magnetic field, which is significantly enhanced in the magnetic field, suggesting the stabilization of a spin-density wave phase, which competes with superconductivity. At higher pressures, beyond the nematic phase boundaries, the resistivity no longer displays any clear anomalies in the zero magnetic field, but an external magnetic field induces significant upturns in resistivity reflecting a field-induced order, where superconductivity and magnetic anomalies are enhanced in tandem. This study highlights the essential role of high magnetic fields in stabilizing different electronic phases and revealing a complex interplay between magnetism and superconductivity tuned by applied pressure in FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$."

Recent advances in large language models and neural avatars provide new opportunities for interactive learning, yet existing systems typically lack lecture awareness, rely on cloud-based services, or fail to integrate retrieval and avatar-delivered explanations in a unified, privacy-preserving pipeline. We present ALIVE, an Avatar-Lecture Interactive Video Engine that transforms passive lecture viewing into a dynamic, real-time learning experience. ALIVE operates fully on local hardware and integrates (1) Avatar-delivered lecture generated through ASR transcription, LLM refinement, and neural talking-head synthesis; (2) A content-aware retrieval mechanism that combines semantic similarity with timestamp alignment to surface contextually relevant lecture segments; and (3) Real-time multimodal interaction, enabling students to pause the lecture, ask questions through text or voice, and receive grounded explanations either as text or as avatar-delivered responses. To maintain responsiveness, ALIVE employs lightweight embedding models, FAISS-based retrieval, and segmented avatar synthesis with progressive preloading. We demonstrate the system on a complete medical imaging course, evaluate its retrieval accuracy, latency characteristics, and user experience, and show that ALIVE provides accurate, content-aware, and engaging real-time support. ALIVE illustrates how multimodal AI-when combined with content-aware retrieval and local deployment-can significantly enhance the pedagogical value of recorded lectures, offering an extensible pathway toward next-generation interactive learning environments."

We find nontrivial dependencies of these statistical quantities on the characteristic magnetic field correlation length, the propagation distance, and the axion mass. Moreover, we find that nontrivial polarizations emerge even if the photons are initially unpolarized, that the variances of these observables become suppressed in specific frequency regions, and that a peak structure arises in the expectation value of the circular polarization in the presence of statistically helical magnetic fields.

Our goal is to measure the systematic uncertainties caused by the assumed geometry, with a focus on key parameters such as the black hole spin and the inclination of the inner accretion disk. We find that the disk-like corona gives a fit that is statistically similar to the broken power-law and lamppost models, but it leads to more physically reasonable results, such as a lower inclination angle of about $30^{\\circ}$. By using a variable disk density model, we measure the disk density to be $n_{\\rm e}\\approx10^{20}$\\,cm$^{-3}$, which is similar to earlier results. While the extended corona model infers a wider allowed parameter space for black hole spin and the inner radius of the disk-shaped coronal region, this reflects the additional physical freedom of the model. Even so, the disk-like corona remains a strong and physically well-motivated candidate for explaining the X-ray emission from Cyg~X-1."

We develop a hybrid numerical framework to signify nonperturbative effects on the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background sourced by primordial curvature perturbations, focusing on the acoustic channel (fluid motions). Fully general-relativistic, spherically symmetric simulations are used to extract nonperturbative sound-shell profiles from isolated curvature peaks; these profiles are then embedded into three-dimensional lattice evolutions of relativistic hydrodynamics coupled to transverse-traceless metric perturbations to compute the acoustic GW spectra. The acoustic signal has a peak frequency determined by the comoving shell thickness, and its amplitude is extremely sensitive to the mean comoving separation of peaks, scaling approximately as $R_{*c}^{-7}$. We find a robust causal low-frequency tail $\\propto k^{3}$, and the nonlinear hydrodynamic interactions can enhance the ultraviolet power. Comparing with SIGWs computed perturbatively from the same real-space configuration, we show that acoustic GWs can be amplified by an order of magnitude and display a peak shifted to a lower frequency in the large-amplitude regime. These results highlight the importance of nonperturbative effects for accurate predictions of stochastic GW signals induced from primordial curvature perturbations."

The proposed approach adopts a two-stage generation pipeline: a coarse global structure is first synthesized and then refined to produce detailed, high-quality geometry. To support reliable 3D generation, we develop a comprehensive data processing pipeline that includes a novel watertight processing method and high-quality data filtering. This pipeline improves the geometric quality of publicly available 3D datasets by removing low-quality samples, filling holes, and thickening thin structures, while preserving fine-grained geometric details. To enable fine-grained geometry refinement, we decouple spatial localization from geometric detail synthesis in the diffusion process. We achieve this by performing voxel-based refinement at fixed spatial locations, where voxel queries derived from coarse geometry provide explicit positional anchors encoded via RoPE, allowing the diffusion model to focus on synthesizing local geometric details within a reduced, structured solution space. Our model is trained exclusively on publicly available 3D datasets, achieving strong geometric quality despite limited training resources. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UltraShape 1.0 performs competitively with existing open-source methods in both data processing quality and geometry generation. All code and trained models will be released to support future research."

On 1080p benchmarks, our primary HiStream model (i+ii) achieves state-of-the-art visual quality while demonstrating up to 76.2x faster denoising compared to the Wan2.1 baseline and negligible quality loss. Our faster variant, HiStream+, applies all three optimizations (i+ii+iii), achieving a 107.5x acceleration over the baseline, offering a compelling trade-off between speed and quality, thereby making high-resolution video generation both practical and scalable."

We are the first to formalize this issue, attributing the variability in output quality to the cumulative predictive uncertainty along a generative path. To quantify this uncertainty, we introduce Denoising Entropy, a computable metric that serves as an internal signal for evaluating generative process. Leveraging this metric, we propose two algorithms designed to optimize the decoding path: a post-hoc selection method and a real-time guidance strategy. Experiments demonstrate that our entropy-guided methods significantly improve generation quality, consistently boosting accuracy on challenging reasoning, planning, and code benchmarks. Our work establishes Denoising Entropy as a principled tool for understanding and controlling generation, effectively turning the uncertainty in MDMs from a liability into a key advantage for discovering high-quality solutions."

These results prompt the question of the orbifold regularity of noncollapsed limits of Einstein manifolds off a codimension 5 set in arbitrary dimension. The proofs rely on a new result of independent interest: all spherical and hyperbolic 4-orbifolds are isolated among Einstein 4-orbifolds in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense.

In the first one, the distribution of the entanglement spectrum levels is similar to the one describing the ground-state entanglement spectrum in Conformal Field Theories. In the second scenario, the lower levels of the entanglement spectrum are highly degenerate and their distribution is given by a series of Dirac deltas.

    "abstract": "Analysing the dynamics of phase-changing liquid films is essential for enhancing the performance of thermal management systems. Still, direct simulation of the full governing equations is computationally expensive. To circumvent this limitation, I derived a weighted-integral boundary-layer (WIBL) model under long-wave assumptions, weak evaporation, and strong surface tension, also accounting for variable substrate heating. In the linear regime, the WIBL reproduces growth rates and the cutoff wavenumber of unstable modes with significantly higher accuracy than commonly used Benney-type models for Re<40, as compared to the Orr-Sommerfeld equations. The linear analysis further reveals a threshold separating streamwise- and spanwise-dominated instabilities in hanging films, arising from the competition between Kapitza and Rayleigh-Taylor mechanisms; the WIBL predicts this threshold accurately for small Re and inclination angles. In the nonlinear regime, with substrate heating that varies in both space and time, the WIBL model captures the evolution of free-surface thickness and temperature within approximately 6% of the original Navier-Stokes equations. Three-dimensional simulations show that a condensing film undergoes dry-out due to Kapitza instability, whereas unsteady substrate heating promotes spanwise momentum spreading, modifies wave dynamics, and prevents dry-out. The WIBL model provides a good level of accuracy at a low computational cost, enabling extensive parametric studies, nonlinear stability analyses, and the design of optimal substrate-heating control strategies."

    "abstract": "Modern deep learning methods typically treat image sequences as large tensors of sequentially stacked frames. However, is this straightforward representation ideal given the current state-of-the-art (SoTA)? In this work, we address this question in the context of generative models and aim to devise a more effective way of modeling image sequence data. Observing the inefficiencies and bottlenecks of current SoTA image sequence generation methods, we showcase that rather than working with large tensors, we can improve the generation process by factorizing it into first generating the coarse sequence at low resolution and then refining the individual frames at high resolution. We train a generative model solely on grid images comprising subsampled frames. Yet, we learn to generate image sequences, using the strong self-attention mechanism of the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to capture correlations between frames. In effect, our formulation extends a 2D image generator to operate as a low-resolution 3D image-sequence generator without introducing any architectural modifications. Subsequently, we super-resolve each frame individually to add the sequence-independent high-resolution details. This approach offers several advantages and can overcome key limitations of the SoTA in this domain. Compared to existing image sequence generation models, our method achieves superior synthesis quality and improved coherence across sequences. It also delivers high-fidelity generation of arbitrary-length sequences and increased efficiency in inference time and training data usage. Furthermore, our straightforward formulation enables our method to generalize effectively across diverse data domains, which typically require additional priors and supervision to model in a generative context. Our method consistently outperforms SoTA in quality and inference speed (at least twice-as-fast) across datasets."

In this paper, we present a photometric and spectroscopic analysis of 124 subluminous SNe~Ia, the largest sample of spectroscopically classified subluminous SNe~Ia observed with a single instrument, comprising 87 91bg-like, 12 86G-like, 18 04gs-like, and 7 02es-like events. We complement the published DR2 SALT2 light-curve parameters with new parameters obtained using template-based fits from SNooPy. Expansion velocities and pseudo-equivalent widths pEW of key spectral features are measured using Spextractor, and spectral averages are constructed for each subluminous subtype, binned by phase. We also analyze the host galaxy environments, both global and local, in terms of $g - z$ color, stellar mass, and directional light radius $d_{DLR}$. We find that all subluminous SNe~Ia (except the 02es-like subtype) are intrinsically red. This is evident by separating extrinsic from intrinsic color components. Since SALT2 is not trained on subluminous SNe~Ia, it compensates for their redder colors by inflating the $c$ parameter, thus extending the luminosity-width relation to negative values of x1. As expected, all subluminous SNe~Ia fall within the Cool region of the Branch et al. (2006) diagram, with the exception of 02es-like events, which show lower Si II 5972 pEW values. All subluminous subtypes tend to occur in more massive, redder host galaxies, and in the reddest local environments. Notably, 91bg- and 86G-like SNe~Ia explode at significantly larger normalized galactocentric distances. Finally, we identify the $pEW$ of the blended Ti II+Si II+Mg II absorption feature at 4300~A, along with s_BV, as robust and sufficient indicators for subclassifying subluminous SNe~Ia."

I will begin my lecture with a short historical overview in which I sketch a development over time that led to this worry for the future of cybersecurity. It is this worry that determined my research agenda and its central theme of the role of uncertainty in cybersecurity. My worry is that waste is accumulating in cyberspace. This waste consists of a multitude of overlapping controls whose risk reductions are uncertain. Unless we start pruning these control frameworks, this waste accumulation causes aging of cyberspace and could ultimately lead to a system collapse."

Nevertheless, most existing studies focus on higher education and conventional instructional contexts, leaving open questions about how key learning factors are related in AI-mediated learning environments and how these relationships may vary across different age groups. Addressing these gaps, our work investigates whether four critical learning factors, experience, clarity, comfort, and motivation, maintain coherent interrelationships in AI-augmented educational settings, and how the structure of these relationships differs between middle and high school students. The study was conducted in authentic classroom contexts where students interacted with AI tools as part of programming learning activities to collect data on the four learning factors and students' perceptions. Using a multimethod quantitative analysis, which combined correlation analysis and text mining, we revealed markedly different dimensional structures between the two age groups. Middle school students exhibit strong positive correlations across all dimensions, indicating holistic evaluation patterns whereby positive perceptions in one dimension generalise to others. In contrast, high school students show weak or near-zero correlations between key dimensions, suggesting a more differentiated evaluation process in which dimensions are assessed independently. These findings reveal that perception dimensions actively mediate AI-augmented learning and that the developmental stage moderates their interdependencies. This work establishes a foundation for the development of AI integration strategies that respond to learners' developmental levels and account for age-specific dimensional structures in student-AI interactions."

In this paper, we focus on optimizing a representative class of attacks that search for the optimal ray direction yielding the minimum $\\ell_2$-norm perturbation required to move a benign image into the adversarial region. Inspired by Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG), we propose a momentum-based algorithm, ARS-OPT, which proactively estimates the gradient with respect to a future ray direction inferred from accumulated momentum. We provide a theoretical analysis of its convergence behavior, showing that ARS-OPT enables more accurate directional updates and achieves faster, more stable optimization. To further accelerate convergence, we incorporate surrogate-model priors into ARS-OPT's gradient estimation, resulting in PARS-OPT with enhanced performance. The superiority of our approach is supported by theoretical guarantees under standard assumptions. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that our method surpasses 13 state-of-the-art approaches in query efficiency."

    "abstract": "High-energy blazar light curves, in X-rays and beyond, have historically preferred a log-normal flux distribution, signifying multiplicative processes either in the jet itself or due to connection(s) with accretion. Here we present 18 year archival Fermi-LAT light curves (0.1-100 GeV) of the flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) CTA 102 from August 2008 to November 2025, which underwent a huge flare in 2017, with a $\\sim$ factor of 100 jump in $γ$-ray flux, along with similar flaring in X-rays. Our statistical analyses confirm that neither the pre nor the post-flare total GeV light curves follow a strictly log-normal distribution. Instead, we observe a statistically significant reduction in skewness from the pre to the post-flare light curves, which implies the blazar transitioned from an energetic state with frequent flaring to a more plateaued state with occasional flaring. We further find that this state transition can be explained through magnetic relaxation, where many reconnection events caused the 2017 flare, after which the magnetic field was ordered and its energy reached a minimum. To explain this further, we use a Monte Carlo simulation of a modified minijets-in-a-jet model where GeV flares are produced only when a maximum number of minijets move toward the broad line region and towards the line of sight, in the context of an external Compton model. The flux distributions (both observed and simulated) could be fit by a modified log-normal power-law distribution, implying our minijets model can reproduce the GeV flares in CTA 102 as well as their flux distributions."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models can develop reasoning capabilities through online fine-tuning with rule-based rewards. However, recent studies reveal a critical constraint: reinforcement learning succeeds only when the base model already assigns non-negligible probability to correct answers -- a property we term 'latent solvability'. This work investigates the emergence of chemical reasoning capabilities and what these prerequisites mean for chemistry. We identify two necessary conditions for RL-based chemical reasoning: 1) Symbolic competence, and 2) Latent chemical knowledge. We propose mid-stage scientific training (MiST): a set of mid-stage training techniques to satisfy these, including data-mixing with SMILES/CIF-aware pre-processing, continued pre-training on 2.9B tokens, and supervised fine-tuning on 1B tokens. These steps raise the latent-solvability score on 3B and 7B models by up to 1.8x, and enable RL to lift top-1 accuracy from 10.9 to 63.9% on organic reaction naming, and from 40.6 to 67.4% on inorganic material generation. Similar results are observed for other challenging chemical tasks, while producing interpretable reasoning traces. Our results define clear prerequisites for chemical reasoning training and highlight the broader role of mid-stage training in unlocking reasoning capabilities."

Microscopically, the two-fold sign reversal arises from a crossover between weak and strong scattering regimes, while high-order terms emerge from the interplay of anisotropic Fermi velocity and relaxation time. Our results establish high-order AMR as a symmetry-prescribed property of cubic ferromagnets, providing critical benchmarks for spin-orbit transport theory and enabling new angular-sensitive spintronic functionalities."

By flux-tuning the cavity frequency at different readout powers, we attribute the first shift to the fixed-qubit and the second to the SQUID-qubit, indicating successful coupling between the two circuits and a single cavity mode. Our study demonstrates the flexible coupling achievable between 2D-material-based superconducting circuits and 3D cavities, and paves the way toward constructing multi-qubit 3D transmon devices from 2D materials."

    "abstract": "We propose a unified analytic and variational framework for studying stability in deep learning systems viewed as coupled representation-parameter dynamics. The central object is the Learning Stability Profile, which tracks the infinitesimal response of representations, parameters, and update mechanisms to perturbations along the learning trajectory. We prove a Fundamental Analytic Stability Theorem showing that uniform boundedness of these stability signatures is equivalent, up to norm equivalence, to the existence of a Lyapunov-type energy that dissipates along the learning flow. In smooth regimes, the framework yields explicit stability exponents linking spectral norms, activation regularity, step sizes, and learning rates to contractivity of the learning dynamics. Classical spectral stability results for feedforward networks, a discrete CFL-type condition for residual architectures, and parametric and temporal stability laws for stochastic gradient methods arise as direct consequences. The theory extends to non-smooth learning systems, including ReLU networks, proximal and projected updates, and stochastic subgradient flows, by replacing classical derivatives with Clarke generalized derivatives and smooth energies with variational Lyapunov functionals. The resulting framework provides a unified dynamical description of stability across architectures and optimization methods, clarifying how architectural and algorithmic choices jointly govern robustness and sensitivity to perturbations. It also provides a foundation for further extensions to continuous-time limits and geometric formulations of learning dynamics."

Building on this idea, we ask a broader question: can randomness in fermion mass parameters also give rise to nonanarchical neutrino mixing angles, and how does the answer depend on the geometry of the mass graph? To explore this, we analyse three representative geometries a nearest neighbour chain, a fully connected non local model, and the Petersen graph in both Dirac and Majorana neutrino realisations. In the regime of strong diagonal disorder, all geometries display robust localization and naturally generate the observed neutrino mass scale, with the corresponding flavour mixing angles reflecting the random localization centres and thus taking an anarchical form. In the regime of weak disorder, where localization is milder, and eigenmodes can exhibit quasidegeneracies, light neutrino masses can emerge through GIM-mechanismlike cancellations among the heavy states. The weak disorder with geometry dependent weak localization constitutes a distinct pathway to structured mixings within disordered theory spaces. Overall, our results delineate the regimes in which disorder driven mechanisms produce hierarchical masses and identify the conditions under which structured flavour mixing can arise."

Existing approaches to evaluating pedestrian environments often rely on static, infrastructure-based indices or retrospective surveys, which overlook the dynamic, subjective, and psychophysiological dimensions of everyday walking experience. This paper introduces a multimodal, human-centered framework for assessing pedestrian well-being in the wild by integrating three complementary data streams: continuous physiological sensing, geospatial tracking, and momentary self-reports collected using the Experience Sampling Method. The framework conceptualizes pedestrian experience as a triangulation enabling a holistic understanding of how urban environments influence well-being. The utility of our framework is then demonstrated through a naturalistic case study conducted in the Greater Philadelphia region, in which participants wore research-grade wearable sensors and carried GPS-enabled smartphones during their regular daily activities. Physiological indicators of autonomic nervous system activity, including heart rate variability and electrodermal activity, were synchronized with spatial trajectories and in situ self-reports of stress, affect, and perceived infrastructure conditions. Results illustrate substantial inter- and intra-individual variability in both subjective experience and physiological response, as well as context-dependent patterns associated with traffic exposure, pedestrian infrastructure quality, and environmental enclosure. The findings also suggest that commonly used walkability indices may not fully capture experiential dimensions of pedestrian well-being. By enabling real-world, multimodal measurement of pedestrian experience, the proposed framework offers a scalable and transferable approach for advancing human-centered urban analytics."

We demonstrate this capability experimentally in a specific system: a nanobeam zipper cavity by changing the geometry of its supporting tethers. A single design parameter, corresponding to a nanoscale geometry change, controls the magnitude of the photothermal backaction and even its sign. These insights will allow engineering the combined photothermal and radiation pressure forces in nano-optomechanical systems, such that backaction-induced linewidth variations are deterministically minimized if needed, or maximized for applications that require cooling or amplification at specific laser detuning."

Words with symbol frequencies far from one half have smaller combinatorial richness and therefore appear less complex under the standard definition. In this paper an entropy-normalized complexity measure is introduced that divides the Kolmogorov complexity of a word by the empirical entropy of its observed distribution of zeros and ones. This adjustment isolates intrinsic descriptive complexity from the purely combinatorial effect of symbol imbalance. For Martin Löf random sequences under constructive exchangeable measures, the adjusted complexity grows linearly and converges to one. A pathological construction shows that regularity of the underlying measure is essential. The proposed framework connects Kolmogorov complexity, empirical entropy, and randomness in a natural manner and suggests applications in randomness testing and in the analysis of structured binary data."

We develop a functional framework that captures the interplay between spatial transport and the degeneracies arising in the collision operator. A key ingredient of the analysis is a dispersive estimate for the transport flow, which quantifies decay effects generated by spatial propagation. Using this dispersive mechanism, we obtain improved bounds for the nonlinear collision operator and show that small solutions near the vacuum can be propagated on time scales significantly longer than those dictated by conservation laws alone. In particular, dispersion allows one to extend the classical quadratic lifespan to a quartic time scale."

To achieve this, we propose a novel parametric activation-induced hierarchical implicit representation framework, referred to as NAME, based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Our method introduces a hierarchical temporal encoding mechanism that extracts features from motion sequences at multiple temporal scales, enabling effective capture of intricate temporal patterns. Additionally, we integrate a custom parametric activation function, powered by Fourier transformations, into the MLP-based decoder to enhance the expressiveness of the continuous representation. This parametric formulation significantly augments the model's ability to represent complex motion behaviors with high accuracy. Extensive evaluations across several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed approach."

    "abstract": "Non-Abelian topological charges (NATCs), characterized by their noncommutative algebra, offer a framework for describing multigap topological phases beyond conventional Abelian invariants. While higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) host boundary states at corners or hinges, their characterization has largely relied on Abelian invariants such as winding and Chern numbers. Here, we propose a coupled-wire scheme of constructing non-Abelian HOTPs and analyze a non-Abelian second-order topological insulator as its minimal model. The resulting Hamiltonian supports hybridized corner modes, protected by parity-time-reversal plus sublattice symmetries and described by a topological vector that unites a non-Abelian quaternion charge with an Abelian winding number. Corner states emerge only when both invariants are nontrivial, whereas weak topological edge states of non-Abelian origins arise when the quaternion charge is nontrivial, enriching the bulk-edge-corner correspondence. The system further exhibits both non-Abelian and Abelian topological phase transitions, providing a unified platform that bridges these two distinct topological classes. Our work extends the understanding of HOTPs into non-Abelian regimes and suggests feasible experimental realizations in synthetic quantum systems, such as photonic or acoustic metamaterials."

The technique employs simple, low-cost instrumentation comprising a single monochrome digital camera and a single pulsed LED. A timing sequence, based on a geometric progression of time lags, is used to generate a \"multi-tau\" scheme, providing high sampling density at short timescales where dynamics are fastest. In the current implementation, a temporal resolution of 80 $μ$s is achieved, limited by the dead time of the camera electronics. Validation of MTPI-DDM was performed by measuring the diffusion of 99 nm polystyrene nanoparticles in water. Compared to conventional continuous-wave (CW) DDM, the pulsed approach extends the range of the shortest measurable time lags by nearly two orders of magnitude and enhances DDM signal amplitudes by eliminating motion blur."

Scalar-tensor formulation of this theory yields an Einstein-frame Starobinsky-type scalar potential augmented by Gauss--Bonnet and derivative couplings, which modify the inflationary slow-roll dynamics. We show that a non-zero coupling $α$ for the Gauss-Bonnet term can shift $(n_s, r)$ along a trajectory that brings the predictions into better agreement with the ACT likelihood. We also find that $L+L^2$ gravity, in its scalar-tensor formulation, is equivalent to Higgs inflation coupled to the Gauss--Bonnet term, and belongs to the Horndeski/galileon class of modified gravities. This work establishes the quadratic $f(L)$ gravity as a compelling and physically motivated extension that preserves the successes of Starobinsky inflation while improving its fit to modern precision cosmological data."

This is mainly because existing GNNs tend to focus on learning local node representations, making it difficult to effectively capture structural relationships between node pairs. Furthermore, excessive reliance on local neighborhood information can lead to over-smoothing. Prior studies have shown that introducing global structural encoding can partially alleviate this issue. To address these limitations, we propose a Community-Enhanced Link Prediction (CELP) framework that incorporates community structure to jointly model local and global graph topology. Specifically, CELP enhances the graph via community-aware, confidence-guided edge completion and pruning, while integrating multi-scale structural features to achieve more accurate link prediction. Experimental results across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that CELP achieves superior performance, validating the crucial role of community structure in improving link prediction accuracy."

    "abstract": "We study a continuous-time portfolio choice problem for an investor whose state-dependent preferences are determined by an exogenous factor that evolves as an Itô diffusion process. Since risk attitudes at the end of the investment horizon are uncertain, terminal wealth is evaluated under a set of utility functions corresponding to all possible future preference states. These utilities are first converted into certainty equivalents at their respective levels of terminal risk aversion and then (nonlinearly) aggregated over the conditional distribution of future states, yielding an inherently time-inconsistent optimization criterion. We approach this problem by developing a general equilibrium framework for such state-dependent preferences and characterizing subgame-perfect equilibrium investment policies through an extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman system. This system gives rise to a coupled nonlinear partial integro-differential equation for the value functions associated with each state. We then specialize the model to a tractable constant relative risk aversion specification in which the preference factor follows an arithmetic Brownian motion. In this setting, the equilibrium policy admits a semi-explicit representation that decomposes into a standard myopic demand and a novel preference-hedging component that captures incentives to hedge against anticipated changes in risk aversion. Numerical experiments illustrate how features of the preference dynamics -- most notably the drift of the preference process and the correlation between preference shocks and asset returns -- jointly determine the sign and magnitude of the hedging demand and the evolution of the equilibrium risky investment over time."

In this paper, we propose DMLITE, a diffusion model and large language model (LLM) integrated traffic embedding framework for network traffic detection within resource-limited IoT environments. The DMLITE overcomes these challenges through a tri-phase architecture including traffic visual preprocessing, diffusion-based multi-level feature extraction, and LLM-guided feature optimization. Specifically, the framework utilizes self-supervised diffusion models to capture both fine-grained and abstract patterns in encrypted traffic through multi-level feature fusion and contrastive learning with representative sample selection, thus enabling rapid adaptation to new traffic patterns with minimal labeled data. Furthermore, DMLITE incorporates LLMs to dynamically adjust particle swarm optimization parameters for intelligent feature selection by implementing a dual objective function that minimizes both classification error and variance across data distributions. Comprehensive experimental validation on benchmark datasets confirms the effectiveness of DMLITE, achieving classification accuracies of 98.87\\%, 92.61\\%, and 99.83\\% on USTC-TFC, ISCX-VPN, and Edge-IIoTset datasets, respectively.

    "abstract": "Classical background electromagnetic fields are routinely employed in quantum electrodynamics to describe a wide range of physical situations, from laser-matter interactions to strong-field phenomena. In this work, we present a first-principles formulation that clarifies the quantum origin of such classical background fields in QED by systematically deriving them from coherent states of the electromagnetic field. Abstract Starting from the operator formulation of QED, we show how scattering amplitudes between coherent states naturally lead to an effective description in terms of background fields, while maintaining a clear separation between the coherent laser mode and other quantized photon degrees of freedom. This framework allows one to consistently incorporate effects beyond the fixed background approximation, such as depletion and backreaction, without assuming any particular field strength or intensity regime. Abstract We further demonstrate how the conventional generating functional with a prescribed background field emerges as a limiting case, corresponding to fixed coherent state boundary conditions. The path integral representation is then obtained as a reformulation of the same underlying Heisenberg picture amplitudes, providing a unified view of operator-based and functional approaches. Abstract Our results establish a general and intensity-independent foundation for QED with coherent background fields, within which the standard formulations of strong-field QED arise as well-defined special cases."

This is modeled by the so-called crowd-sourcing model, where the answer of expert $i$ on question $k$ is modeled by a random entry, parametrized by $M_{i,k}$ which is increasing linearly with the expected quality of the answer. To enable the unambiguous ranking of the experts by ability, several assumptions on $M$ are available in the literature. We consider here the general isotonic crowd-sourcing model, where $M$ is assumed to be isotonic up to an unknown permutation $π^*$ of the experts - namely, $M_{π^{*-1}(i),k} \\geq M_{π^{*-1}(i+1),k}$ for any $i\\in [n-1], k \\in [d]$. Then, ranking experts amounts to constructing an estimator of $π^*$. In particular, we investigate here the existence of statistically optimal and computationally efficient procedures and we describe recent results that disprove the existence of computational-statistical gaps for this problem. To provide insights on the key ideas, we start by discussing simpler and yet related sub-problems, namely sub-matrix detection and estimation. This corresponds to specific instances of the ranking problem where the matrix $M$ is constrained to be of the form $λ\\mathbf 1\\{S\\times T\\}$ where $S\\subset [n], T\\subset [d]$. This model has been extensively studied. We provide an overview of the results and proof techniques for this problem with a particular emphasis on the computational lower bounds based on low-degree polynomial methods.

Using prototypical candidate RuO$_2$ as an example, we show that the adjacent ferromagnet alone can dictate both the magnitude and sign of spin-charge conversion. Spin-pumping measurements on RuO$_2$/Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ (YIG) and RuO$_2$/Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ (Py) bilayers yield opposite effective spin-Hall angles that persist across crystalline and polycrystalline RuO$_2$. Inserting an ultrathin Au spacer at the RuO$_2$/YIG interface reverses the signal, envidencing a dominant interfacial inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect, whereas RuO$_2$/Py is governed by bulk inverse spin-Hall effect. First-principles calculations trace this dichotomy to interface-selective band hybridization: Rashba surface states survive at the insulating YIG contact yet are quenched by metallic Py. Our findings establish ferromagnetic interfacing as a deterministic knob for tailoring spin-charge conversion in altermagnetic oxides, paving the way to field-free, low-dissipation spintronic memory devices."

    "abstract": "In Wigner-crystal states of two-dimensional electrons, the spin ordering remains poorly understood. The small energy differences between candidate spin orders make theoretical studies less reliable, and probing magnetic order at a nonzero wave vector is experimentally challenging. In modern realizations of Wigner crystals, the electronic spin degree of freedom is often replaced by a valley pseudospin associated with nonzero Berry curvature. The resulting anomalous velocity couples the electrons' pseudospin texture to their orbital vibration. We show that this mechanism enables optical detection of pseudospin orders in Wigner crystals by producing sharp signatures in the terahertz optical conductivity. For example, antiferromagnetic pseudospin order enables light to excite collective electronic vibrations at the ordering wave vector, generating a characteristic absorption peak. Based on the same principle, we further show that a strong optical drive generates an effective potential that reshapes the pseudospin energy landscape, inducing phase transitions to stripe antiferromagnetic states. These results point to a route for optical detection and control of spin order via its coupling to orbital motion."

Accurately and efficiently recognizing both is crucial for developing robust and generalizable document parsing systems. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive unified recognition of text and formulas. However, they are large-sized and computationally demanding, restricting their usage in many applications. In this paper, we propose UniRec-0.1B, a unified recognition model with only 0.1B parameters. It is capable of performing text and formula recognition at multiple levels, including characters, words, lines, paragraphs, and documents. To implement this task, we first establish UniRec40M, a large-scale dataset comprises 40 million text, formula and their mix samples, enabling the training of a powerful yet lightweight model. Secondly, we identify two challenges when building such a lightweight but unified expert model. They are: structural variability across hierarchies and semantic entanglement between textual and formulaic content. To tackle these, we introduce a hierarchical supervision training that explicitly guides structural comprehension, and a semantic-decoupled tokenizer that separates text and formula representations. Finally, we develop a comprehensive evaluation benchmark covering Chinese and English documents from multiple domains and with multiple levels. Experimental results on this and public benchmarks demonstrate that UniRec-0.1B outperforms both general-purpose VLMs and leading document parsing expert models, while achieving a 2-9$\\times$ speedup, validating its effectiveness and efficiency.

The tropical theory retains the full complexity of renormalization with nested and overlapping vertex subdivergences and infinitely many primitive graphs. We compute the perturbation series of the tropical renormalization group functions exactly to 400 loops and study their asymptotic growth. In the minimal subtraction scheme, we find only an arithmetic sequence of singularities on the negative real axis in the Borel plane. These singularities are confluent and imply that the large-order perturbative asymptotics contain logarithmic and fractional power corrections. The absence of any further singularities suggests these series are Borel summable. In contrast, in a kinematic subtraction scheme, the singularity structure on the negative axis changes, and we find additional singularities on the positive real axis."

LiDAR is widely used for this purpose due to its accuracy and robustness. Recently, neural LiDAR mapping has shown impressive performance; however, most approaches rely on dense implicit representations and underutilize geometric structure, while existing voxel-guided methods struggle to achieve real-time performance. To address these challenges, we propose XGrid-Mapping, a hybrid grid framework that jointly exploits explicit and implicit representations for efficient neural LiDAR mapping. Specifically, the strategy combines a sparse grid, providing geometric priors and structural guidance, with an implicit dense grid that enriches scene representation. By coupling the VDB structure with a submap-based organization, the framework reduces computational load and enables efficient incremental mapping on a large scale. To mitigate discontinuities across submaps, we introduce a distillation-based overlap alignment strategy, in which preceding submaps supervise subsequent ones to ensure consistency in overlapping regions. To further enhance robustness and sampling efficiency, we incorporate a dynamic removal module. Extensive experiments show that our approach delivers superior mapping quality while overcoming the efficiency limitations of voxel-guided methods, thereby outperforming existing state-of-the-art mapping methods."

In particular, blind spots occur due to the intervals between CCTVs and limited Fields of View (FOV), which leads to object ID switching and trajectory loss, thereby reducing the reliability of real-time path prediction. This paper proposes SPOT (Spatial Prediction Over Trajectories), a map-guided LLM agent capable of tracking vehicles even in blind spots of multi-CCTV environments without prior training. The proposed method represents road structures (Waypoints) and CCTV placement information as documents based on 2D spatial coordinates and organizes them through chunking techniques to enable real-time querying and inference. Furthermore, it transforms the vehicle's position into the actual world coordinate system using the relative position and FOV information of objects observed in CCTV images. By combining map spatial information with the vehicle's moving direction, speed, and driving patterns, a beam search is performed at the intersection level to derive candidate CCTV locations where the vehicle is most likely to enter after the blind spot. Experimental results based on the CARLA simulator in a virtual city environment confirmed that the proposed method accurately predicts the next appearing CCTV even in blind spot sections, maintaining continuous vehicle trajectories more effectively than existing techniques."

As an application, we obtain a noncommutative Kalton--Randrianantoanina--Zaidenberg Theorem, providing a characterization of noncommutative $L_p$-spaces over finite von Neumann algebras and a necessary and sufficient condition for an operator on a noncommutative symmetric space to be an isometry. Having this at hand, we answer a question posed by Mityagin in 1970 [Uspehi Mat. Nauk] and its noncommutative counterpart by showing the any symmetric space $E(\\mathcal{M},τ)\\ne L_p(\\mathcal{M},τ)$ over a noncommutative probability is not isometric to a symmetric space over a von Neumann algebra equipped with a semifinite infinite faithful normal trace. It is also shown that any noncommutative $L_p$-space, $1\\le p<\\infty$, affiliated with an atomless semifinite von Neumann algebra has a unique symmetric structure up to isometries. This contributes to the resolution of an isometric version of Pełczyński's problem concerning the uniqueness of the symmetric structure in noncommutative symmetric spaces."

A naive implementation creates a new balance record per deposit, leading to unbounded storage growth and vulnerability to denial-of-service attacks. We present time-bucketed balance records, a data structure that bounds storage to O(k) records per account while guaranteeing that tokens never expire before their configured TTL. Our approach discretizes time into k buckets, coalescing deposits within the same bucket to limit unique expiration timestamps. We prove three key properties: (1) storage is bounded by k+1 records regardless of deposit frequency, (2) actual expiration time is always at least the configured TTL, and (3) adversaries cannot increase a victim's operation cost beyond O(k)[amortized] worst case. We provide a reference implementation in Solidity with measured gas costs demonstrating practical efficiency."

In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the challenges involved in implementing 3D parallelism in such environments, addressing critical issues such as the need for symmetric tensor parallelism, efficient gradient synchronization in asymmetric pipeline parallelism, and the trade-offs between memory utilization and computational efficiency. Building upon these insights, we introduce AutoHet, a novel system that automatically identifies the optimal parallelism plan for distributed training on heterogeneous GPUs. AutoHet supports asymmetric 3D parallelism structures and facilitates fine-grained workload distribution. We propose a theoretical model that frames the device grouping and load balancing as an optimization problem to minimize per-iteration training time, thus effectively balancing computing power and memory usage across GPUs with diverse capabilities. To enable elastic training upon spot instance preemption, AutoHet presents an efficient recovery strategy that prioritizes to retrieve training states from local nodes, and only downloads the missing checkpoints from the cloud storage. Our extensive evaluation, conducted on three large-scale models and utilizing combinations of three different GPU types, demonstrates that AutoHet outperforms existing DNN training systems, achieving up to a 1.79$\\times$ speedup in training throughput compared with Megatron-LM and Whale, and a 4.38$\\times$ speedup of recovery speed compared to a spot instance baseline."

Despite the promise of multi-modal approaches, challenges like multi-lingual generalization and the absence of a unified evaluation framework persist. To address these gaps, we propose FEND (Foundation model-based Evaluation of Neuropsychiatric Disorders), a comprehensive multi-modal framework integrating speech and text modalities for detecting AD, depression, and ASD across the lifespan. Leveraging 13 multi-lingual datasets spanning English, Chinese, Greek, French, and Dutch, we systematically evaluate multi-modal fusion performance. Our results show that multi-modal fusion excels in AD and depression detection but underperforms in ASD due to dataset heterogeneity. We also identify modality imbalance as a prevalent issue, where multi-modal fusion fails to surpass the best mono-modal models. Cross-corpus experiments reveal robust performance in task- and language-consistent scenarios but noticeable degradation in multi-lingual and task-heterogeneous settings. By providing extensive benchmarks and a detailed analysis of performance-influencing factors, FEND advances the field of automated, lifespan-inclusive, and multi-lingual neuropsychiatric disorder assessment. We encourage researchers to adopt the FEND framework for fair comparisons and reproducible research."

According to this system, the cooling power of the liquid xenon in the reboiler of 178K could be transferred to the product xenon cryostat to liquefy the gaseous product xenon by the R14 circulation, thus the liqueffed xenon could return to the detector with the same condition of which extracted from the detector to form a stable cooling cycle and prevent the instability of the detector. A research and development experiment is implemented to validate the feasibility of this large cooling recovery system, using the ethanol to simulate the liquid xenon. Experimental results show that the cooling power recovery of this system could achieve 17 kW with the efffciency of 76.5%, and the R14 ffow rate is 0.16 kg/s. This study realizes the online radon removal distillation with large ffow rate while eliminating the dependence of liquid nitrogen or cryocoolers, which means saving 2414 m3 liquid nitrogen per year or the power consumption of 230 kW.

However, powerful AI models typically have large model sizes, resulting in excessive end-to-end (E2E) downloading-and-inference (DAI) latency. To address this issue, we propose a simultaneous model downloading and inference (SLIDE) framework, which allows users to perform inference with downloaded layers while simultaneously receiving the remaining layers of the model. To this end, we formulate a task throughput maximization problem by jointly optimizing model provisioning, spectrum bandwidth allocation, and computing resource allocation for multi-user downlink systems. Unlike traditional DAI frameworks, SLIDE introduces recursive dependencies across layers, where inference latency depends recursively on the downloading bandwidth and computing resource allocation for each of the preceding layers. To solve this challenging problem, we design an efficient algorithm that acquires the optimal solution with polynomial-time complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SLIDE framework significantly improves task throughput under latency and communication resource constraints compared with the conventional model downloading schemes."

Prior progressive approaches are inherently limited by inference instability and error accumulation. To tackle these limitations, we present a Collaborative Multi-Agent Reasoning Framework that explicitly decouples Semantic Planning from Visual Synthesis. By employing specialized agents for upfront reasoning, our method generates a structured, explicit plan before pixel generation, enabling visually and semantically coherent single-pass synthesis. We integrate this framework with two critical mechanisms: (1) a self-correcting Verification Agent that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to rectify visible region segmentation and identify residual occluders strictly within the Semantic Planning phase, and (2) a Diverse Hypothesis Generator that addresses the ambiguity of invisible regions by offering diverse, plausible semantic interpretations, surpassing the limited pixel-level variations of standard random seed sampling. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of traditional metrics in assessing inferred invisible content, we introduce the MAC-Score (MLLM Amodal Completion Score), a novel human-aligned evaluation metric. Validated against human judgment and ground truth, these metrics establish a robust standard for assessing structural completeness and semantic consistency with visible context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets.

Here, we use ultrafast terahertz spectroscopy to probe the temperature-dependent superfluid density in an infinite-layer samarium nickelate film with a Tc of 20 K. The superfluid density decreases linearly with rising temperature, consistent with clean limit d-wave pairing. From this linear relation, we extract a superconducting gap of 2.5 meV and a gap-to-Tc ratio of 3, suggesting that this sample lies in the weak-coupling limit. Furthermore, the ratio of the mean free path to the coherence length, is determined to be 1.5, confirming the clean-limit behavior. These findings establish strong parallels between the pairing mechanisms in nickelate and cuprate superconductors."

The methodology's main ingredient is the penalization of any statistical dependence between $W$ and $Z$ conditioned on $Y$, replaced by the more readily implementable plain independence between $W$ and the random variable $Z_Y = T(Z,Y)$ that solves the [Monge] Optimal Transport Barycenter Problem for $Z\\mid Y$. In the Gaussian case considered in this article, the two statements are equivalent. When the true confounders $Z$ are unknown, other measurable contextual variables $S$ can be used as surrogates, a replacement that involves no relaxation in the Gaussian case if the covariance matrix $Σ_{ZS}$ has full range. The resulting linear feature extractor adopts a closed form in terms of the first $d$ eigenvectors of a known matrix. The procedure extends with little change to more general, non-Gaussian / non-linear cases."

The model dynamically updates beliefs as additional expert calls occur and attenuates contradictory assessments, which are absent from existing text-based screening tools. Empirically, our model outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks by 6.691% in F1-score and increases portfolio-level Return on Investment by 15.255%. Attention and ablation analyses reveal that conversational cues are particularly informative for technologically complex startups, young firms, diverse founding teams, and firms with low public visibility.

Missing observations shift recommendations toward frequently interacted items, which reduces the diversity of the recommendation list. To alleviate this problem, Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) is widely used and commonly models propensities based on a power-law function of item interaction frequency. However, we found that such power-law-based correction overly penalizes popular items and harms their recommendation performance. We address this issue by redefining the propensity score to allow broader item recommendation without excessively penalizing popular items. The proposed score is formulated by applying a sigmoid function to the logarithm of the item observation frequency, maintaining the simplicity of power-law scoring while allowing for more flexible adjustment. Furthermore, we incorporate the redefined propensity score into a linear autoencoder model, which tends to favor popular items, and evaluate its effectiveness. Experimental results revealed that our method substantially improves the diversity of items in the recommendation list without sacrificing recommendation accuracy."

    "abstract": "Quantized charge pumping in one-dimensional chiral wires has been widely studied in the context of topological physics in a (1+1)-dimensional synthetic space, yet the role of orbital and spin degrees of freedom in such topological pumps remains largely unexplored. Here, we examine how the topologically quantized charge pump in insulators generates spin polarizations, and assess whether this mechanism may offer distinct insight into the widely known spin-selective transport in chiral wires-commonly referred to as chirality-induced spin selectivity. We performed time-dependent Schrodinger equations of multi-orbital tight-binding Hamiltonians driven by a circularly polarized electric field. Our main findings are twofold. First, the intrinsic screw-like geometry of the system generates a distinctive winding structure governed by a single control parameter, in contrast to conventional adiabatic pumping mechanisms that require at least two independently modulated parameters, thereby providing a clear interpretation of one-dimensional pumping in terms of the topological structure in a (1+1)-dimensional Brillouin zone. Second, while the energy gap remains open throughout the pumping cycle, the Berry-phase driven real-time dynamics of the charge flow induces a nonequilibrium orbital polarization. Through spin-orbit coupling, this orbital response is partially converted into spin polarization whose direction is determined by the current and chirality. On the analogy between the synthetic (1+1)- and 2-dimensional topological insulators, we suggest that non-trivial spin-orbital dynamics may accompany the anomalous quantum charge Hall states of even-dimensional real materials."

In the mobile domain, especially in the Android ecosystem, FCG-based malware classification is particularly critical due to the platform's widespread adoption and the complex, component-based structure of Android apps. However, progress in this direction is hindered by the lack of large-scale, high-quality Android-specific FCG datasets. Existing datasets are often outdated, dominated by small or redundant graphs resulting from app repackaging, and fail to reflect the diversity of real-world malware. These limitations lead to overfitting and unreliable evaluation of graph-based classification methods.

Incremental damage can make such control fragile. This tends to go unnoticed until a small perturbation induces instability (i.e. loss of control). Traditional methods in the field of engineering rely on accurate system models to compute a safe set of operating instructions, which become invalid when the, possibly damaged, system diverges from its model. Here we demonstrate that the approach of such a feedback system towards instability can nonetheless be monitored through dynamical indicators of resilience. This holistic system safety monitor does not rely on a system model and is based on the generic phenomenon of critical slowing down, shown to occur in the climate, biology and other complex nonlinear systems approaching criticality. Our findings for engineered devices opens up a wide range of applications involving real-time early warning systems as well as an empirical guidance of resilient system design exploration, or \"tinkering\". While we demonstrate the validity using drones, the generic nature of the underlying principles suggest that these indicators could apply across a wider class of controlled systems including reactors, aircraft, and self-driving cars."

This keeps normal-case costs low and, if at least one honest challenger exists, can catch fraud. What has been less clear is whether honest challengers are actually incentivized and a dishonest proposer is properly damaged under the worst case environment. We build a model with a colluding minority, heterogeneous costs, and three ordering modes. We then ask whether two goals can be met together: honest non-loss and fraud deterrence. Our results are clear: in single-winner designs, the incentive design is impossible or limited in scale. By contrast, in multi-winner designs, we obtain simple, explicit conditions under which both goals hold."

    "abstract": "The primary objective of this thesis is to develop a consistent theoretical framework of dissipative hydrodynamics for a relativistic fluid with spin - hereafter referred to as relativistic dissipative spin hydrodynamics. In this framework, the dynamical description of a relativistic fluid requires a new macroscopic variable, the spin density, which is associated with a spin tensor. This tensor, defined as the expectation value of a rank-3 tensor operator in quantum field theory, contributes to the system's total angular momentum. The need for such a theory is motivated by recent measurements of spin polarization of hadrons produced in non-central relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Two distinct formulation methods are employed. The first is grounded in covariant thermodynamics and extends the conventional Navier-Stokes and Müller-Israel-Stewart theories of relativistic hydrodynamics by incorporating a spin tensor. The second is based on principles of relativistic quantum statistical mechanics, building upon and generalizing the foundational Zubarev approach. Both formulations aim to construct a closed system of evolution equations for the macroscopic variables and, via an entropy-current analysis, to identify the dissipative currents and their associated transport coefficients. These two approaches provide different perspectives for future applications focused on spin polarization measurements. Beyond its phenomenological relevance, the theory also opens several avenues for further theoretical developments. These include the verification of the thermodynamic relations employed in the first formulation method using microscopic frameworks, as well as a deeper understanding of the emerging transport coefficients - particularly those associated with the spin tensor - through microscopic modeling or data-driven parameter extraction."

In their proof, they establish that any two partial shuffles of the same size are Wilf-equivalent. We give an alternative proof of this fact, using an iterative approach. We also show that Wilf-equivalence is preserved on including a decreasing pattern in partial shuffles, and we provide some enumerative results for avoidance classes whose bases consist of a partial shuffle and a decreasing permutation."

    "abstract": "The empirical success of deep learning is often attributed to scaling laws that predict consistent gains as model, data, and compute grow; however, large models can exhibit training instability and diminishing returns, suggesting that scaling laws describe what success looks like but not when and why scaling succeeds or fails. A central obstacle is the lack of a rigorous understanding of feature learning at large depth. While muP characterizes feature-learning dynamics in the infinite-width limit and enables hyperparameter transfer across width, its depth extension (depth-muP) breaks down for residual blocks with more than one internal layer. We derive Neural Feature Dynamics (NFD) for ResNets with single-layer residual blocks, characterizing feature learning via a coupled forward-backward stochastic system in the joint infinite-width and infinite-depth limit. In this regime, NFD identifies when scaling-law trends persist and explains diminishing returns. It also reveals a vanishing mechanism induced by the 1/sqrt(depth) residual scaling under which the gradient-independence assumption (GIA), known to fail during training at finite depth, becomes provably valid again at infinite depth, yielding an analytically tractable regime for end-to-end feature learning. Motivated by this insight, we study two-layer residual blocks and show that the same mechanism causes feature-learning collapse in the first internal layer at large depth, providing a structural explanation for the empirical failure of depth-muP. Based on this diagnosis, we propose a depth-aware learning-rate correction that counteracts the collapse and empirically restores depth-wise hyperparameter transfer, yielding stronger performance in deeper ResNets."

This study presents a novel approach that begins by modeling the nonlinear and hysteretic dynamics of a magnetically actuated catheter system, consists of a magnetic catheter manipulated by servo-controlled magnetic fields generated by two external permanent magnets, and its complex behavior is captured using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. This model validated against experimental setup's data with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.42 mm and 99.8% coverage within 3 mm, establishing it as a reliable surrogate model. This LSTM enables the training of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents for controlling the system and avoiding damage to the real setup, with the potential for subsequent fine-tuning on the physical system. We implemented Deep Q-Network (DQN) and actor-critic RL controllers, comparing these two agents first for regulation and subsequently for path following along linear and half-sinusoidal paths for the catheter tip. The actor-critic outperforms DQN, offering greater accuracy and faster performance with less error, along with smoother trajectories at a 10 Hz sampling rate, in both regulation and path following compared to the DQN controller. This performance, due to the continuous action space, suits dynamic navigation tasks like navigating curved vascular structures for practical applications."

If stresses over the thinner sections of the thread breach the yield threshold, viscoplastic deformations then drive the filament towards pinch-off. The thread consequently evolves to a beads-on-a-string structure. The elasto-plastic anatomy of the beads is explored and categorized."

It is found that this scheme performs identically under incident illumination with either radial or azimuthal polarization. For this purpose, we use a focusing lens in combination with a diffractive optical element formed by a computer-generated hologram containing multiple alternate opaque and transparent regions. Based on vector diffraction theory, our analysis shows that the multi-zone amplitude mask redistributes the beam energy, thereby leading to the formation of a hollow beam. The proposed method provides control over the beam width which maintains a uniform dark core size after focusing through the various NA lens across all the higher order modes. Further the width of high intensity ring can be tuned by varying the NA of the focusing lens. This study shows that the proposed method is well suited for trapping particles or atoms while avoiding exposure to high central intensity, enabling improved contrast and resolution, facilitating ring-shaped ablation or heating, guiding atoms through dark regions to minimize thermal effects, and supporting information encoding using orbital angular momentum and other advanced optical applications."

The calculations show that Q varies in the range from 0.62 to 3.61. An example of the practical use of the CH3CHO and CH3OH lines tracing the same regions in three molecular clouds, located at large galactocentric distances (D_GC ~ 8 kpc) is considered.

This study examines the impact of AI accessibility across a two-semester, multi-course dataset including Business Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Calculus III. By comparing unproctored homework and proctored exam performance, we analyze how student learning behaviors shift in AI-accessible environments, particularly through epistemic off-loading of mathematical work. Guided by a sociocognitive framework, we employ complementary measures -- performance gaps, homework-exam correlations, and Wasserstein distance -- to characterize divergence between practice and mastery. Results reveal a growing integrity gap as course content shifts from procedural to conceptual and spatially intensive mathematics. In both Business Calculus and Linear Algebra, differences in homework format (online versus hand-written, TA-graded) do not yield substantively different performance patterns, indicating that paper-based homework is not inherently more resistant to AI-mediated offloading. While homework retains partial predictive validity in procedural courses, upper-division courses exhibit a collapse in alignment between homework and exams, indicating that unproctored assessments increasingly reflect synthetic fluency rather than internalized understanding. These findings highlight the need to rethink assessment practices in the AI era."

We find that at sufficiently high temperature, the genuine tripartite multi-entropy exhibits a volume-law scaling in sharp contrast to vacuum AdS$_3$, where the genuine contribution is universal and size-independent. Moreover, we find another phase: once one subsystem exceeds half of the total system, the leading genuine tripartite entanglement vanishes and reduces to that for global AdS${}_3$. This transition is indeed consistent with recent arguments for distillable EPR pairs in tripartite Haar-random states. Motivated by finite-cutoff holography, we further study the radial cutoff dependence of multi-entropy and show that genuine multi-entropy acquires nontrivial size dependence even for the tripartite case in AdS${}_3$. As a byproduct, we also observe an intriguing ``area-law'' contribution to multi-entropy that is relevant to vacuum AdS${}_3$."

We sample from this posterior to generate millions of theory-consistent synthetic panels that, when mixed with actual macroeconomic data, form the training corpus for a time-series transformer with attention. The trained model is then used to forecast out-of-sample through 2025.

This reduces focus on the much shorter but essential Key portion-the final answer, whose correctness directly determines task success and evaluation quality. To address this limitation, we propose SFTKey, a two-stage training scheme. In the first stage, conventional SFT is applied to ensure proper output format, while in the second stage, only the Key portion is fine-tuned to improve accuracy. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families demonstrate that SFTKey achieves an average accuracy improvement exceeding 5\\% over conventional SFT, while preserving the ability to generate correct formats.

Using intersection theory, Chern-Mather classes, and the Nash blow-up provided by Kempf's resolution, we reduce the computation of the virtual Euclidean Distance degree to explicit intersection numbers on a Grassmannian. Applying equivariant localization, we prove that this invariant depends stably polynomially on the input dimension. Numerical experiments based on homotopy continuation illustrate the dependence of the Euclidean Distance degree on the chosen metric and highlight the distinction between the generic and nongeneric cases, such as the Bombieri-Weyl metric."

In this study, we propose FluencyVE, which is a simple yet effective one-shot video editing approach. FluencyVE integrates the linear time-series module, Mamba, into a video editing model based on pretrained Stable Diffusion models, replacing the temporal attention layer. This enables global frame-level attention while reducing the computational costs. In addition, we employ low-rank approximation matrices to replace the query and key weight matrices in the causal attention, and use a weighted averaging technique during training to update the attention scores. This approach significantly preserves the generative power of the text-to-image model while effectively reducing the computational burden. Experiments and analyses demonstrate promising results in editing various attributes, subjects, and locations in real-world videos."

Unlike thermally modified earlier studies, SNS and CSNS constitute fully non-thermal, number-state-dependent quantum configurations. By embedding these states within the framework of semiclassical theory of gravity, we derive state-resolved expressions for the Hawking temperature, entropy variation, and corresponding mass loss of an evaporating black hole. The influence of the squeezing parameter $ρ$ and number state parameter $n$ on Hawking emission is examined through a series of analytical results supported by twelve detailed plots. The analysis reveals that the Hawking temperature exhibits monotonic growth with increasing $ρ$ and $n$, thereby elevating the effective temperature experienced at the black hole horizon. The entropy variations $Δ\\mathbb{S}_{\\mathrm{SNS}}$ and $Δ\\mathbb{S}_{\\mathrm{CSNS}}$ show strong nonlinear enhancement, especially at moderate and large squeezing values.

However, conventional methods typically lead to transient orientations characterized by periodic directional reversals and necessitate the generation of coherent superpositions across a broad spectrum of rotational states of ultracold molecules. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for achieving unidirectional field-free orientation by selectively manipulating two specific rotational states of symmetric top molecules. By leveraging the interplay between coherent superpositions and the precise selection of initial states, we demonstrate that both the maximum achievable orientation and its direction can be effectively controlled. To attain the desired two-state orientation, we present a quantum control strategy that utilizes a single control pulse, significantly simplifying the complexities of conventional multistate or multipulse schemes. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness and feasibility of this approach for methyl iodide (CH$_3$I) molecules, even when accounting for molecular centrifugal distortion.The results highlight the critical roles of initial-state selection and quantum coherence in achieving long-lasting, high unidirectional molecular orientation, opening new directions in stereochemistry, precision spectroscopy, and quantum computing."

In this work, we propose NExT-Vid, a novel autoregressive visual generative pretraining framework that utilizes masked next-frame prediction to jointly model images and videos.

The results show that HiUCCSD achieves equivalent performance to SymUCCSD for Abelian point group molecules, while avoiding the potential performance failure of SymUCCSD in the case of non-Abelian point group molecules. Across the studied molecular systems, HiUCCSD cuts the parameter count by 18%-83% for VQE and reduces the excitation operator pool size by 27%-84% for ADAPT-VQE, as compared with the UCCSD ansatz. With enhanced robustness and broader applicability, HiUCCSD offers a new ansatz option for advancing large-scale molecular VQE implementation."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the feasibility of deploying private 5G networks in hospital environments, with a focus on the operating room at the brand new Oulu University Hospital, Finland. The study aims to evaluate the interference risk with other wireless systems, and electromagnetic safety of a private 5G network in the 3.9-4.1 GHz band, while ensuring compatibility with legacy wireless systems, such as LTE and Wi-Fi. We conducted a measurement campaign, employing state-of-the-art instrumentation and a methodology that combined high resolution and long-duration spectrum scans. The results demonstrate no measurable interference between the hospital's private 5G network with adjacent LTE (4G) or Wi-Fi bands, confirming the spectral isolation of the 5G transmissions, and vise versa. Additionally, RF exposure levels in the operating room were found to be well below ICNIRP, WHO, and IEEE safety thresholds, ensuring that the network poses negligible biological risk to patients and hospital staff. The study also proposes spectrum management strategies for private 5G networks in hospitals, focusing on adaptive sensing and guardband planning. These findings provide a solid foundation for the integration of private 5G infrastructure in hospitals environments, supporting digital transformation in patient care without compromising electromagnetic compatibility or patient safety. The results also contribute to ongoing discussions around private 5G network deployments in sensitive sectors and provide actionable guidelines for future hospitals' wireless systems planning."

    "abstract": "Accurate book genre classification is fundamental to digital library organization, content discovery, and personalized recommendation. Existing approaches typically model genre prediction as a flat, single-label task, ignoring hierarchical genre structure and relying heavily on noisy, subjective user reviews, which often degrade classification reliability. We propose HiGeMine, a two-phase hierarchical genre mining framework that robustly integrates user reviews with authoritative book blurbs. In the first phase, HiGeMine employs a zero-shot semantic alignment strategy to filter reviews, retaining only those semantically consistent with the corresponding blurb, thereby mitigating noise, bias, and irrelevance. In the second phase, we introduce a dual-path, two-level graph-based classification architecture: a coarse-grained Level-1 binary classifier distinguishes fiction from non-fiction, followed by Level-2 multi-label classifiers for fine-grained genre prediction. Inter-genre dependencies are explicitly modeled using a label co-occurrence graph, while contextual representations are derived from pretrained language models applied to the filtered textual content. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we curate a new hierarchical book genre dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HiGeMine consistently outperformed strong baselines across hierarchical genre classification tasks. The proposed framework offers a principled and effective solution for leveraging both structured and unstructured textual data in hierarchical book genre analysis."

Fix a combinatorial triangulation $G$, and let $\\mathcal{T}(G)\\subset \\mathcal{T}(S,\\underline{p})$ be the locus where $G$ admits a geodesic realization; varying $G$, these loci form an open cover of $\\mathcal{T}(S,\\underline{p})$. On $\\mathcal{T}(G)$ we construct a circular foliation adapted to geodesic triangular complementary regions, which is naturally decomposed into interior and peripheral parts. This decomposition defines shear parameters on edges and radius parameters at the singularities, and yields global coordinates on $\\mathcal{T}(G)$: the resulting shear-radius map is a homeomorphism onto an explicit open cone in a finite-dimensional real vector space. In the spirit of Thurston, we then introduce partial stretch and anti-stretch deformations by rescaling the transverse measures of the interior or peripheral components. Peripheral stretch rays converge, in the simple-curve length-spectrum topology, to the cusped hyperbolic metric determined by the shear data, while interior anti-stretch rays converge to a circle-packed hyperbolic cone metric determined by the radii. Finally, we give criteria for the realization of prescribed cone angles for fixed $G$ and prove sharp upper bounds for admissible cone angles on the universally triangulable locus."

Due to limitations of experimental technology and computational methods, the exploration of the continuous evolution of clusters towards nanocrystal is still a big challenge. Here, we proposed a machine learning force field (MLFF) that can generalize well to various copper systems ranging from small clusters to large clusters and bulk. The continuous evolution of copper clusters CuN towards nanocrystal was revealed by investigating clusters in a wide size range (7 <= N <= 17885) based on MLFF simulated annealing. For small CuN (N < 40), electron counting rule plays a major role in stability. For large CuN (N > 80), geometric magic number rule plays a dominant role and the evolution of clusters is based on the formation of more and more icosahedral shells. For medium size CuN (40 <= N <= 80), both rules contribute. The critical size from cluster to nanocrystal was calculated to be around 8000 atoms (about 6 nm in diameter). Our work terminates the long-term challenge in nanoscience, and lay the methodological foundation for subsequent research on other cluster systems."

However, most existing methods rely on simple late fusion to enhance performance, which results in substantial computational overhead. Although early fusion with a shared backbone for all modalities is efficient, it struggles to achieve excellent performance. To address the dilemma of balancing efficiency and effectiveness, we introduce a self-supervised multimodal skeleton-based action representation learning framework, named Decomposition and Composition. The Decomposition strategy meticulously decomposes the fused multimodal features into distinct unimodal features, subsequently aligning them with their respective ground truth unimodal counterparts. On the other hand, the Composition strategy integrates multiple unimodal features, leveraging them as self-supervised guidance to enhance the learning of multimodal representations. Extensive experiments on the NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD II datasets demonstrate that the proposed method strikes an excellent balance between computational cost and model performance."

This paper provides an insider's account of the sociotechnical friction that arises when an institutional goal of empowering non-technical staff conflicts with the technical limitations of enterprise Large Language Models (LLMs). Through analytic autoethnography, this study examines a GenAI project pushed to an impasse, focusing on a workaround developed to navigate not only technical constraints but also the combined challenge of organisational territoriality and assertions of positional power. Drawing upon Alter's (2014) theory of workarounds, the analysis interprets \"articulation work\" as a form of \"invisible labour\". By engaging with the Information Systems (IS) domains of user innovation and technology-in-practice, this study argues that such user-driven workarounds should be understood not as deviations, but as integral acts of sociotechnical integration. This integration, however, highlights the central paradoxes of modern GenAI where such workarounds for \"unfinished\" systems can simultaneously create unofficial \"shadow\" systems and obscure the crucial, yet invisible, sociotechnical labour involved. The findings suggest that the invisible labour required to integrate GenAI within complex organisational politics is an important, rather than peripheral, component of how it becomes functional in practice."

However, currently, most sign language datasets are video-based and limited to automatically reconstructed 2D human poses (i.e., keypoints) and lack accurate 3D information. Furthermore, existing state-of-the-art for automatic 3D human pose estimation from sign language videos is prone to self-occlusion, noise, and motion blur effects, resulting in poor reconstruction quality. In response to this, we introduce DexAvatar, a novel framework to reconstruct bio-mechanically accurate fine-grained hand articulations and body movements from in-the-wild monocular sign language videos, guided by learned 3D hand and body priors. DexAvatar achieves strong performance in the SGNify motion capture dataset, the only benchmark available for this task, reaching an improvement of 35.11% in the estimation of body and hand poses compared to the state-of-the-art.

Existing blind-spot network (BSN) methods rely on pixel-shuffle downsampling (PD) to decorrelate noise, but aggressive downsampling fragments fine structures, while milder downsampling fails to remove correlated noise. To address this, we introduce Next-Scale Prediction (NSP), a novel self-supervised paradigm that decouples noise decorrelation from detail preservation. NSP constructs cross-scale training pairs, where BSN takes low-resolution, fully decorrelated sub-images as input to predict high-resolution targets that retain fine details. As a by-product, NSP naturally supports super-resolution of noisy images without retraining or modification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSP achieves state-of-the-art self-supervised denoising performance on real-world benchmarks, significantly alleviating the long-standing conflict between noise decorrelation and detail preservation."

In this study, we propose how to realize robust photon blockade, i.e., strong photon antibunching with arbitrary detuning conditions, by combining degenerate optical parametric amplification with a hybrid molecular cavity optomechanical system. More interesting, we find near-perfect optomechanical photon blockade at room temperature, which is robust against temperature and optical dissipation. In addition, our approach can release the strict condition of high temporal resolution by combining features of conventional and unconventional photon blockade. Our approach offers a feasible route to study intriguing quantum effects in hybrid molecular cavity optomechanical systems, and holds promise for applications in nonclassical state engineering, quantum sensing, and photonic precision measurements."

We present here a near-optimal, robust, and end-to-end quantum algorithm to solve time-dependent, dissipative, and nonlinear PDEs. We embed the PDEs in a truncated, high dimensional linear space on the basis of quantum homotopy analysis. The linearized system is discretized and integrated using finite-difference methods that use a compact quantum algorithm. The present approach can adapt its input to the nature of nonlinearity and underlying physics. The complexity estimates improve existing approaches in terms of scaling of matrix operator norms, condition number, simulation time, and accuracy. We provide a general embedding strategy, bounds on stability criteria, accuracy, gate counts and query complexity. A physically motivated measure of nonlinearity is connected to a parameter that is similar to the flow Reynolds number $Re_{\\textrm{H}}$, whose inverse marks the allowed integration window, for given accuracy and complexity. We illustrate the embedding scheme with numerical simulations of a one-dimensional Burgers problem. This work shows the potential of the hybrid quantum algorithm for simulating practical and nonlinear phenomena on near-term and fault-tolerant quantum devices."

    "abstract": "Modern surveillance systems increasingly rely on multi-wavelength sensors and deep neural networks to recognize faces in infrared images captured at night. However, most facial recognition models are trained on visible light datasets, leading to substantial performance degradation on infrared inputs due to significant domain shifts. Early feature-based methods for infrared face recognition proved ineffective, prompting researchers to adopt generative approaches that convert infrared images into visible light images for improved recognition. This paradigm, known as Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR), faces challenges such as model and modality discrepancies, leading to distortion and feature loss in generated images. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel latent diffusion-based model designed to generate high-quality visible face images from thermal inputs while preserving critical identity features. A multi-attribute classifier is incorporated to extract key facial attributes from visible images, mitigating feature loss during infrared-to-visible image restoration. Additionally, we propose the Self-attn Mamba module, which enhances global modeling of cross-modal features and significantly improves inference speed. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both image quality and identity preservation."

In the highly-degenerate regime, we find that a central role is played by the ramification locus of the projection. Additionally, we provide tools for counting the number of critical points over projective varieties, and discuss specific cases arising from deep learning. Our work bridges tools from algebraic geometry with ideas from machine learning, and it extends the line of literature around the Euclidean distance degree to the degenerate setting."

We show that with an appropriate choice of variables the coefficients of the Potts partition function at different energy levels are given by Euler characteristics of appropriate parts of a bigraded homology theory associated with the model. In the case of the dichromatic polynomial for graphs, we show that the two variable polynomial can be seen as a sum of powers of one variable multiplied by coefficients that are \"impropriety\" coloring polynomials for the underlying graph. An impropriety polynomial $C_{G}^{i}(n)$ counts the number of colorings in $n$ colors of the graph that are not proper at a given number $i$ of edges in the graph. The last section of the paper categorifies coloring evaluations rather than coloring polynomials. We then obtain a range of possible chain complexes and homology theories such that the chromatic evaluation is equal to the Euler characteristic of the homology. The freedom of choice in making such chain complexes is related to possible associative algebra structures on the set of colors."

    "abstract": "In multi-agent tasks, the central challenge lies in the dynamic adaptation of strategies. However, directly conditioning on opponents' strategies is intractable in the prevalent deep reinforcement learning paradigm due to a fundamental ``representational bottleneck'': neural policies are opaque, high-dimensional parameter vectors that are incomprehensible to other agents. In this work, we propose a paradigm shift that bridges this gap by representing policies as human-interpretable source code and utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) as approximate interpreters. This programmatic representation allows us to operationalize the game-theoretic concept of \\textit{Program Equilibrium}. We reformulate the learning problem by utilizing LLMs to perform optimization directly in the space of programmatic policies. The LLM functions as a point-wise best-response operator that iteratively synthesizes and refines the ego agent's policy code to respond to the opponent's strategy. We formalize this process as \\textit{Programmatic Iterated Best Response (PIBR)}, an algorithm where the policy code is optimized by textual gradients, using structured feedback derived from game utility and runtime unit tests. We demonstrate that this approach effectively solves several standard coordination matrix games and a cooperative Level-Based Foraging environment."

Offline evaluation on historical search logs shows consistent gains over a strong generic encoder, with particularly large improvements when replacing PCA compression with Matryoshka truncation. A manual assessment further highlights better handling of proper nouns, marketplace-specific semantics, and term-importance alignment.

    "abstract": "Fundamental phase noise in thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic integrated circuits is governed by thermal-charge-carrier-refractive (TCCR) dynamics arising from thermally driven carrier fluctuations. In contrast to the predominantly thermorefractive noise in silicon photonic platforms, TCCR noise represents a distinct mechanism that becomes critical for applications requiring high frequency stability and phase coherence, including optomechanical sensing, low-phase-noise microwave synthesis, and on-chip quantum squeezing. A quantitative understanding of the deterministic parameters that control TCCR noise is therefore essential for engineering the next generation of low-noise TFLN photonic systems. Here, we identify two dominant contributors to the TCCR noise in TFLN microresonators: material anisotropy and surface states. Material anisotropy results in increased noise for extraordinarily polarized optical modes and leads to a geometry dependent phase noise. Surface-state effects manifest as increased noise in higher-order transverse modes as well as more than 120-fold higher noise in suspended microresonators. Finally, we demonstrate that post-fabrication annealing -- widely used to reduce defect densities and recover crystal quality -- suppresses frequency noise by a factor of 8.2 in cladded microresonators. Together, these results establish a practical pathway for noise engineering in TFLN integrated photonic devices and accelerate their deployment in next-generation precision photonic systems."

We propose Granular-ball Guided Masking (GBGM), a structure-aware augmentation strategy guided by Granular-ball Computing (GBC). GBGM adaptively preserves semantically rich, structurally important regions while suppressing redundant areas through a coarse-to-fine hierarchical masking process, producing augmentations that are both representative and discriminative. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in classification accuracy and masked image reconstruction, confirming the effectiveness and broad applicability of the proposed method.

    "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have advanced the scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) by activating only a sparse subset of parameters per input, enabling state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational cost. As these models are increasingly deployed in critical domains, understanding and strengthening their alignment mechanisms is essential to prevent harmful outputs. However, existing LLM safety research has focused almost exclusively on dense architectures, leaving the unique safety properties of MoEs largely unexamined. The modular, sparsely-activated design of MoEs suggests that safety mechanisms may operate differently than in dense models, raising questions about their robustness. In this paper, we present GateBreaker, the first training-free, lightweight, and architecture-agnostic attack framework that compromises the safety alignment of modern MoE LLMs at inference time. GateBreaker operates in three stages: (i) gate-level profiling, which identifies safety experts disproportionately routed on harmful inputs, (ii) expert-level localization, which localizes the safety structure within safety experts, and (iii) targeted safety removal, which disables the identified safety structure to compromise the safety alignment. Our study shows that MoE safety concentrates within a small subset of neurons coordinated by sparse routing. Selective disabling of these neurons, approximately 3% of neurons in the targeted expert layers, significantly increases the averaged attack success rate (ASR) from 7.4% to 64.9% against the eight latest aligned MoE LLMs with limited utility degradation. These safety neurons transfer across models within the same family, raising ASR from 17.9% to 67.7% with one-shot transfer attack. Furthermore, GateBreaker generalizes to five MoE vision language models (VLMs) with 60.9% ASR on unsafe image inputs."

The framework facilitates execution through cross-level collaboration among expert agents: high-level expert agents comprehend natural language instructions with high flexibility, plan the overall experiment workflow, and invoke corresponding MCP-compatible tools on demand; meanwhile, low-level expert agents select optimal action plans for fundamental elements based on real-time traffic conditions. Extensive experiments across multiple scenarios show that TrafficSimAgent effectively executes simulations under various conditions and consistently produces reasonable outcomes even when user instructions are ambiguous. Besides, the carefully designed expert-level autonomous decision-driven optimization in TrafficSimAgent yields superior performance when compared with other systems and SOTA LLM based methods."

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has created many problems, especially in people's social lives. There has been increasing isolation and economic hardships since the beginning of the pandemic for people all over the world. Quarantines and lockdowns also took part in that, and so, people have been expressing their emotions throughout the pandemic period using social media platforms like Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, etc. In this study, we seek to analyze the emotions and mental health labels throughout the time period of March 2, 2020, up until July 4, 2020, from the threads and comments gathered from the r/unitedkingdom subreddit. We used a soft labeling technique to generate mental health conditions for each Reddit comment. We compared the overall results with important dates related to COVID-19 policies that took place in the United Kingdom. This can give us a view on how the pandemic and the important dates affect people self disclosing their emotions on social media platforms. Finally, we have developed a proof of concept to show that using mental health features may increase emotion prediction accuracy."

    "abstract": "The application of agentic AI systems in autonomous decision-making is growing in the areas of healthcare, smart cities, digital forensics, and supply chain management. Even though these systems are flexible and offer real-time reasoning, they also raise concerns of trust and oversight, and integrity of the information and activities upon which they are founded. The paper suggests a single architecture model comprising of LangChain-based multi-agent system with a permissioned blockchain to guarantee constant monitoring, policy enforcement, and immutable auditability of agentic action. The framework relates the perception conceptualization-action cycle to a blockchain layer of governance that verifies the inputs, evaluates recommended actions, and documents the outcomes of the execution. A Hyperledger Fabric-based system, action executors MCP-integrated, and LangChain agent are introduced and experiments of smart inventory management, traffic-signal control, and healthcare monitoring are done. The results suggest that blockchain-security verification is efficient in preventing unauthorized practices, offers traceability throughout the whole decision-making process, and maintains operational latency within reasonable ranges. The suggested framework provides a universal system of implementing high-impact agentic AI applications that are autonomous yet responsible."

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI)-native three-dimensional (3D) spectrum maps are crucial in spectrum monitoring for intelligent communication networks. However, it is challenging to obtain and transmit 3D spectrum maps in a spectrum-efficient, computation-efficient, and AI-driven manner, especially under complex communication environments and sparse sampling data. In this paper, we consider practical air-to-ground semantic communications for spectrum map completion, where the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) measures the spectrum at spatial points and extracts the spectrum semantics, which are then utilized to complete spectrum maps at the ground device. Since statistical machine learning can easily be misled by superficial data correlations with the lack of interpretability, we propose a novel knowledge-enhanced semantic spectrum map completion framework with two expert knowledge-driven constraints from physical signal propagation models. This framework can capture the real-world physics and avoid getting stuck in the mindset of superficial data distributions. Furthermore, a knowledge-enhanced vector-quantized Transformer (KE-VQ-Transformer) based multi-scale low-complex intelligent completion approach is proposed, where the sparse window is applied to avoid ultra-large 3D attention computation, and the multi-scale design improves the completion performance. The knowledge-enhanced mean square error (KMSE) and root KMSE (RKMSE) are introduced as novel metrics for semantic spectrum map completion that jointly consider the numerical precision and physical consistency with the signal propagation model, based on which a joint offline and online training method is developed with supervised and unsupervised knowledge loss. The simulation demonstrates that our proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmark schemes in terms of RKMSE."

    "abstract": "We study the emergence of a velocity-dip phenomenon in turbulent mixed convection in open Poiseuille-Rayleigh-Bénard (PRB) channels with a free-slip upper boundary. Three-dimensional direct numerical simulations (DNS) are performed for Rayleigh numbers in the range $10^5 \\leq Ra \\leq 10^8$, at a fixed Prandtl number $Pr = 0.71$ and a bulk Reynolds number $Re_b = 2850$. In the shear-dominated regime, the flow is characterised by small-scale structures such as near-wall streaks. As buoyancy becomes comparable to shear, streamwise-oriented large-scale rolls emerge and span the full channel height. At higher Rayleigh numbers, buoyancy dominates and the rolls fragment, giving rise to a convection-cell-dominated regime. Short-time-averaged flow fields show that streamwise rolls transport low-speed fluid from the bottom wall towards the upper boundary, forming laterally extended low-speed regions, while roll fragmentation induces upstream low-speed regions near the upper boundary. Both mechanisms locally reduce the near-surface mean velocity, leading to a velocity dip in which the maximum mean streamwise velocity is located below the upper boundary. Consistent with the mean momentum budget, the near-surface region exhibits a large-scale Reynolds shear stress that exceeds the local total shear stress, implying a negative viscous contribution and a reversal of the mean velocity gradient. To model this behaviour, we propose a model based on a balance between buoyancy and shear production with dissipation, incorporating a linear wall-normal profile for the Reynolds shear stress, a wall-normal-independent buoyancy-production term, and a decomposition of the dissipation into shear-induced and buoyancy-induced contributions. Our model accurately reproduces the DNS mean velocity profiles across the explored $Ra$ range."

To address this, this paper proposes TSA-LLM, a large language model (LLM)-based universal framework that models multi-variate transient dynamics prediction as a univariate generative task with three key innovations: First, a novel data processing pipeline featuring channel independence decomposition to resolve dimensional heterogeneity, sample-wise normalization to eliminate separate stable or unstable pipelines, and temporal patching for efficient long-sequence modeling; Second, a parameter-efficient freeze-and-finetune strategy that augments the LLM's architecture with dedicated input embedding and output projection layers while freezing core transformer blocks to preserve generic feature extraction capabilities; Third, a two-stage fine-tuning scheme that combines teacher forcing, which feeds the model ground-truth data during initial training, with scheduled sampling, which gradually shifts to leveraging model-generated predictions, to mitigate cumulative errors in long-horizon iterative prediction. Comprehensive testing demonstrates the framework's universality, as TSA-LLM trained solely on the New England 39-bus system achieves zero-shot generalization to mixed stability conditions and unseen faults, and matches expert performance on the larger Iceland 189-bus system with only 5% fine-tuning data. This multi-scenario versatility validates a universal framework that eliminates scenario-specific retraining and achieves scalability via large-scale parameters and cross-scenario training data."

    "abstract": "We initiate a formal study of fairness for the $k$-server problem, where the objective is not only to minimize the total movement cost, but also to distribute the cost equitably among servers. We first define a general notion of $(α,β)$-fairness, where, for parameters $α\\ge 1$ and $β\\ge 0$, no server incurs more than an $α/k$-fraction of the total cost plus an additive term $β$. We then show that fairness can be achieved without a loss in competitiveness in both the offline and online settings. In the offline setting, we give a deterministic algorithm that, for any $\\varepsilon > 0$, transforms any optimal solution into an $(α,β)$-fair solution for $α= 1 + \\varepsilon$ and $β= O(\\mathrm{diam} \\cdot \\log k / \\varepsilon)$, while increasing the cost of the solution by just an additive $O(\\mathrm{diam} \\cdot k \\log k / \\varepsilon)$ term. Here $\\mathrm{diam}$ is the diameter of the underlying metric space. We give a similar result in the online setting, showing that any competitive algorithm can be transformed into a randomized online algorithm that is fair with high probability against an oblivious adversary and still competitive up to a small loss. The above results leave open a significant question: can fairness be achieved in the online setting, either with a deterministic algorithm or a randomized algorithm, against a fully adaptive adversary? We make progress towards answering this question, showing that the classic deterministic Double Coverage Algorithm (DCA) is fair on line metrics and on tree metrics when $k = 2$. However, we also show a negative result: DCA fails to be fair for any non-vacuous parameters on general tree metrics."

Reinforcement Learning (RL) enhances this process by enabling multi-objective optimization and exploration of novel chemical space - capabilities that traditional supervised learning methods lack. In this work, we introduce \\textbf{ReACT-Drug}, a fully integrated, target-agnostic molecular design framework based on Reinforcement Learning. Unlike models requiring target-specific fine-tuning, ReACT-Drug utilizes a generalist approach by leveraging ESM-2 protein embeddings to identify similar proteins for a given target from a knowledge base such as Protein Data Base (PDB). Thereafter, the known drug ligands corresponding to such proteins are decomposed to initialize a fragment-based search space, biasing the agent towards biologically relevant subspaces. For each such fragment, the pipeline employs a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent guiding a ChemBERTa-encoded molecule through a dynamic action space of chemically valid, reaction-template-based transformations. This results in the generation of \\textit{de novo} drug candidates with competitive binding affinities and high synthetic accessibility, while ensuring 100\\% chemical validity and novelty as per MOSES benchmarking. This architecture highlights the potential of integrating structural biology, deep representation learning, and chemical synthesis rules to automate and accelerate rational drug design.

Our method is flexible, and can apply to a broad range of functional differential equations while still allowing for the incorporation of physical priors in either the prior mean or the kernel design. We demonstrate the performance of our method on several relevant equations, such as the Wetterich and Wilson--Polchinski equations, showing that it achieves equal or better performance than existing approximations such as the local-potential approximation, while being significantly more flexible. In particular, our method can handle non-constant fields, making it promising for the study of more complex field configurations, such as instantons."

As a prominent reconstruction technique for FVV generation, 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) models dynamic scenes with time-varying 3D Gaussian ellipsoids and achieves high-quality rendering via fast rasterization. However, existing 4DGS approaches suffer from quality degradation over long sequences and impose substantial bandwidth and storage overhead, limiting their applicability in real-time and wide-scale deployments. Therefore, we present AirGS, a streaming-optimized 4DGS framework that rearchitects the training and delivery pipeline to enable high-quality, low-latency FVV experiences. AirGS converts Gaussian video streams into multi-channel 2D formats and intelligently identifies keyframes to enhance frame reconstruction quality. It further combines temporal coherence with inflation loss to reduce training time and representation size. To support communication-efficient transmission, AirGS models 4DGS delivery as an integer linear programming problem and design a lightweight pruning level selection algorithm to adaptively prune the Gaussian updates to be transmitted, balancing reconstruction quality and bandwidth consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AirGS reduces quality deviation in PSNR by more than 20% when scene changes, maintains frame-level PSNR consistently above 30, accelerates training by 6 times, reduces per-frame transmission size by nearly 50% compared to the SOTA 4DGS approaches."

We show that any implementation of a phase clock in these systems either stops or ticks too fast after polynomially many expected steps, and that any terminating computation in these systems finishes or fails in expected polynomial time.

To address this, our work presents the first large-scale benchmarking study of MER-OV on the OV-MERD dataset, evaluating 19 mainstream MLLMs, including general-purpose, modality-specialized, and reasoning-enhanced architectures. Through systematic analysis of model reasoning capacity, fusion strategies, contextual utilization, and prompt design, we provide key insights into the capabilities and limitations of current MLLMs for MER-OV. Our evaluation reveals that a two-stage, trimodal (audio, video, and text) fusion approach achieves optimal performance in MER-OV, with video emerging as the most critical modality. We further identify a surprisingly narrow gap between open- and closed-source LLMs. These findings establish essential benchmarks and offer practical guidelines for advancing open-vocabulary and fine-grained affective computing, paving the way for more nuanced and interpretable emotion AI systems.

Existing distributed training frameworks such as DeepSpeed alleviate this issue using techniques like ZeRO and FSDP, which rely on multi GPU memory or CPU offloading, but often require additional hardware resources and reduce training speed. We introduce RevFFN, a memory efficient fine tuning paradigm for mixture of experts (MoE) LLMs. RevFFN employs carefully designed reversible Transformer blocks that allow reconstruction of layer input activations from outputs during backpropagation, eliminating the need to store most intermediate activations in memory. While preserving the expressive capacity of MoE architectures, this approach significantly reduces peak memory consumption for full parameter fine tuning. As a result, RevFFN enables efficient full fine tuning on a single consumer grade or server grade GPU."

As a leading platform, neutral atom arrays rely on atomic fluorescence imaging for qubit readout, requiring short exposure, low photon count schemes to mitigate heating and atom loss while enabling mid-circuit feedback. However, a fundamental challenge arises in the single-photon regime where severe overlap in state distributions causes conventional threshold discrimination to fail. Here, we report an AI-accelerated Bayesian inference method for fluorescence readout in neutral atom arrays. Our approach leverages Bayesian inference to achieve reliable state detection at the single-photon level under short exposure. Specifically, we introduce a weakly anchored Bayesian scheme that requires calibration of only one state, addressing asymmetric calibration challenges common across quantum platforms. Furthermore, acceleration is achieved via a permutation-invariant neural network, which yields a 100-fold speedup by compressing iterative inference into a single forward pass. The approach achieves relative readout fidelity above 99% and 98% for histogram overlaps of 61% and 72%, respectively, enabling reliable extraction of Rabi oscillations and Ramsey interference results unattainable with conventional threshold based methods.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in recommendation systems. However, the effective application of MLLMs to multimodal sequential recommendation remains unexplored: A) Existing methods primarily leverage the multimodal semantic understanding capabilities of pre-trained MLLMs to generate item embeddings or semantic IDs, thereby enhancing traditional recommendation models. These approaches generate item representations that exhibit limited interpretability, and pose challenges when transferring to language model-based recommendation systems. B) Other approaches convert user behavior sequence into image-text pairs and perform recommendation through multiple MLLM inference, incurring prohibitive computational and time costs. C) Current MLLM-based recommendation systems generally neglect the integration of collaborative signals. To address these limitations while balancing recommendation performance, interpretability, and computational cost, this paper proposes MultiModal Summarization-and-Retrieval-Augmented Sequential Recommendation. Specifically, we first employ MLLM to summarize items into concise keywords and fine-tune the model using rewards that incorporate summary length, information loss, and reconstruction difficulty, thereby enabling adaptive adjustment of the summarization policy. Inspired by retrieval-augmented generation, we then transform collaborative signals into corresponding keywords and integrate them as supplementary context. Finally, we apply supervised fine-tuning with multi-task learning to align the MLLM with the multimodal sequential recommendation. Extensive evaluations on common recommendation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MMSRARec, showcasing its capability to efficiently and interpretably understand user behavior histories and item information for accurate recommendations."

    "abstract": "Reasoning distillation has attracted increasing attention. It typically leverages a large teacher model to generate reasoning paths, which are then used to fine-tune a student model so that it mimics the teacher's behavior in training contexts. However, previous approaches have lacked a detailed analysis of the origins of the distilled model's capabilities. It remains unclear whether the student can maintain consistent behaviors with the teacher in novel test-time contexts, or whether it regresses to its original output patterns, raising concerns about the generalization of distillation models. To analyse this question, we introduce a cross-model Reasoning Distillation Provenance Tracing framework. For each action (e.g., a sentence) produced by the distilled model, we obtain the predictive probabilities assigned by the teacher, the original student, and the distilled model under the same context. By comparing these probabilities, we classify each action into different categories. By systematically disentangling the provenance of each action, we experimentally demonstrate that, in test-time contexts, the distilled model can indeed generate teacher-originated actions, which correlate with and plausibly explain observed performance on distilled model. Building on this analysis, we further propose a teacher-guided data selection method. Unlike prior approach that rely on heuristics, our method directly compares teacher-student divergences on the training data, providing a principled selection criterion. We validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple representative teacher models and diverse student models. The results highlight the utility of our provenance-tracing framework and underscore its promise for reasoning distillation. We hope to share Reasoning Distillation Provenance Tracing and our insights into reasoning distillation with the community."

    "abstract": "Deep clustering hinges on learning representations that are inherently clusterable. However, using a single encoder to produce a fixed embedding ignores the representation trajectory formed by a pretrained diffusion model across network hierarchies and noise timesteps, where clusterability varies substantially. We propose DiEC (Diffusion Embedded Clustering), which performs unsupervised clustering by directly reading internal activations from a pretrained diffusion U-Net. DiEC formulates representation selection as a two-dimensional search over layer x timestep, and exploits a weak-coupling property to decompose it into two stages. Specifically, we first fix the U-Net bottleneck layer as the Clustering-friendly Middle Layer (CML), and then use Optimal Timestep Search (OTS) to identify the clustering-optimal timestep (t*). During training, we extract bottleneck features at the fixed t* and obtain clustering representations via a lightweight residual mapping. We optimize a DEC-style KL self-training objective, augmented with adaptive graph regularization and entropy regularization to strengthen cluster structures. In parallel, we introduce a denoising-consistency branch at random timesteps to stabilize the representations and preserve generative consistency. Experiments show that DiEC achieves competitive clustering performance on multiple standard benchmarks."

Different from existing research, we consider a finite system of horizontally and equidistantly aligned waveguides and transform the wave propagation problem into Nonorthogonal Coupled-Mode Equations (NCME), rather than adopting the tight-binding approximation or orthogonal coupled-mode equations. We derive the exact expressions of the overlap integrals and coupling coefficients by utilizing the addition theorems of Bessel functions. We then generalize the discussion to an infinite waveguide array and rigorously characterize the dispersion relation and continuum with the help of theories in harmonic analysis. In the second part of the paper, we give a strict proof of the existence of BICs in the aforementioned waveguide system with two additional identical vertical waveguides aligned symmetrically above and below the horizontal waveguide array. We further numerically demonstrate the transition from a perfect BIC to a leaky mode by introducing a symmetry-breaking refractive index perturbation and quantitatively analyze the resulting radiation losses. This work gives a comprehensive study of symmetry-protected BICs and provides an efficient and precise computational model for designing such BICs devices."

However, the binary black hole merger events GW190521 and GW231123 appear unusual, as current analyses place their component masses within the PISN mass gap. In this work, we investigate the relationship between different lensing magnifications and the inferred source-frame black hole masses for these two events. If the gravitational wave source is lensed, neglecting lensing effect can bias the inferred luminosity distance and hence the redshift, leading to an underestimation of the luminosity distance and consequently an overestimation of the source-frame masses, potentially placing them in the mass-gap region. For the two events in mass gap, when adopting a lower bound of $60 M_{\\odot}$ for the mass gap, the minimum magnifications required to shift the inferred source-frame masses below this gap boundary are found to be $μ=12.2$ for GW190521 and $μ=320.1$ for GW231123, corresponding to lensing-corrected luminosity distances of $11155\\, \\mathrm{Mpc}$ and $15207\\, \\mathrm{Mpc}$, respectively. These results provide a quantitative reference for assessing the lensing hypothesis as a possible explanation for the existence of black holes in the PISN mass gap."

In computational molecular science, calculation of long-range electrostatic interactions between charged atoms - the strongest interactions in condensed phases, is a major bottleneck.

The algorithm employs the Ewald method based decomposition of electrostatic energy E into several energy terms, of which \"the Fourier component\" of E is computed in the algorithm proposed on a quantum device, utilizing the power of Quantum Fourier Transform. We demonstrate the algorithm's quantum advantage for a range of systems of point charges in the three-dimensional space when the number of charges (system size) N exceeds the number of grid points M, and show that the numerical error is rather small <0.1%. The algorithm can be implemented in running the all-atom Molecular Dynamics simulations on a quantum computer, thereby expanding the scope of applications of QFT methods in computational physics, chemistry, and biology."

    "abstract": "From the perspective of future developments in robotics, it is crucial to verify whether foundation models trained exclusively on offline data, such as images and language, can understand the robot motion. In particular, since Vision Language Models (VLMs) do not include low-level motion information from robots in their training datasets, video understanding including trajectory information remains a significant challenge. In this study, we assess two capabilities of VLMs through a video captioning task with low-level robot motion information: (1) automatic captioning of robot tasks and (2) segmentation of a series of tasks. Both capabilities are expected to enhance the efficiency of robot imitation learning by linking language and motion and serve as a measure of the foundation model's performance. The proposed method generates multiple \"scene\" captions using image captions and trajectory data from robot tasks. The full task caption is then generated by summarizing these individual captions. Additionally, the method performs subtask segmentation by comparing the similarity between text embeddings of image captions. In both captioning tasks, the proposed method aims to improve performance by providing the robot's motion data - joint and end-effector states - as input to the VLM. Simulator experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

This survey provides a unified treatment of pointing errors across optical and high frequency wireless communications. We establish consistent terminology and a cross-technology taxonomy of pointing errors, review angular misalignment and statistical distribution models, and analyze their impact on system performance. Mitigation techniques are systematically surveyed with emphasis on optical systems and their connection to underlying pointing error models. The survey further provides a detailed examination of pointing-error effects in orbital angular momentum (OAM) links and quantum optical communications, and surveys the corresponding mitigation approaches tailored to mode-dependent impairments and quantum measurement constraints. The survey also outlines open challenges and future research directions. By consolidating fragmented literature into a coherent framework, this work supports consistent analysis and robust design of next generation directional communication systems."

    "abstract": "Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) now support critical infrastructure spanning transportation, energy, manufacturing, medical devices, and autonomous robotics. Their defining characteristic is the tight coupling between digital computation and continuous physical dynamics which enables sophisticated autonomy but also creates highly non-linear failure modes. Small disturbances at sensors, firmware, networks, or physical interfaces can propagate through estimation and control pipelines, producing cascading instabilities that defy traditional single-layer reasoning. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) unifies nearly two decades of CPS resilience research into a structured Origin-Layer-Effect (OLE) taxonomy. This taxonomy provides a cross-layer lens for understanding how faults arise, how they propagate, and why unrelated CPS failures often share deep structural similarities. By mapping representative systems including RockDrone, MAYDAY, M2MON, HACMS, Byzantine fault-tolerant control, and learning-based recovery mechanisms onto the taxonomy, we reveal patterns of coverage, persistent blind spots, and recurring pathways of fault amplification. Our analysis identifies four structural gaps that span multiple CPS domains: (1) physical-model manipulation, (2) ML-enabled control without stability guarantees, (3) semantic inconsistencies between formal models and firmware, and (4) inadequate forensic visibility across cyber and physical layers. These insights motivate new directions for resilient CPS design, integrating robust control, runtime monitoring, formal assurance, and system-level visibility."

We present resistive MHD simulations of the nonlinear evolution of multi-mode mRTI in both two and three dimensions, examining the effects of uniform external magnetic fields oriented either parallel or perpendicular to the initial interface. In both 2-D and 3-D, weak parallel fields enhance mixing-zone growth, whereas stronger fields suppress it. For perpendicular fields, growth is initially inhibited but becomes enhanced at later times. These behaviors arise from magnetic tension, which modifies flow anisotropy, buoyancy, drag, and vortex dynamics. The interplay of these mechanisms governs the distinct ways in which magnetic fields influence mRTI evolution."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in transformer-based foundation models have made them the default choice for many tasks, but their rapidly growing size makes fitting a full model on a single GPU increasingly difficult and their computational cost prohibitive. Block low-rank (BLR) compression techniques address this challenge by learning compact representations of weight matrices. While traditional low-rank (LR) methods often incur sharp accuracy drops, BLR approaches such as Monarch and BLAST can better capture the underlying structure, thus preserving accuracy while reducing computations and memory footprints. In this work, we use roofline analysis to show that, although BLR methods achieve theoretical savings and practical speedups for single-token inference, multi-token inference often becomes memory-bound in practice, increasing latency despite compiler-level optimizations in PyTorch. To address this, we introduce custom Triton kernels with partial fusion and memory layout optimizations for both Monarch and BLAST. On memory-constrained NVIDIA GPUs such as Jetson Orin Nano and A40, our kernels deliver up to $3.76\\times$ speedups and $3\\times$ model size compression over PyTorch dense baselines using CUDA backend and compiler-level optimizations, while supporting various models including Llama-7/1B, GPT2-S, DiT-XL/2, and ViT-B.

This paper presents pokiSEC, a lightweight, ephemeral malware detonation sandbox that packages the full virtualization and access stack inside a Docker container. pokiSEC integrates QEMU with hardware acceleration (KVM when available) and exposes a browser-based workflow that supports bring-your-own Windows disk images. The key contribution is a Universal Entrypoint that performs runtime host-architecture detection and selects validated hypervisor configurations (machine types, acceleration modes, and device profiles), enabling a single container image and codebase to launch Windows guests on both ARM64 and x86_64 hosts. We validate pokiSEC on Apple Silicon (ARM64) and Ubuntu (AMD64), demonstrating interactive performance suitable for analyst workflows and consistent teardown semantics via ephemeral container lifecycles."

The prototype consists of 563 channels and represents about 10 percent of the final ZDC design in terms of both channel count and detector volume. It was irradiated at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) with a dose equivalent to 10$^{11}$ protons/cm$^2$. We demonstrate that, despite significant radiation damage to the SiPMs and non-uniform degradation across the detector volume, the detector can be successfully calibrated on a channel-by-channel basis using cosmic-ray data. The damage profile, similar to what is expected in the experiment, varies by an order of magnitude or more across the detector. Even for the most heavily damaged channels, the signal-to-noise ratio for a MIP signal remains above 5. This study provides a realistic test of the system's performance under irradiation. It complements previous SiPM-specific irradiation studies and will inform the future operation of the ZDC and other detectors that use SiPM-on-tile technology."

Atomic layer deposition of gate dielectrics on back-end-of-line compatible channel materials, such as amorphous oxide semiconductors, can induce defects or cause structural modifications that degrade electrical performance. While post-deposition annealing can partially repair this damage, it often degrades other device metrics. We report a novel channel-last concept that prevents such damage. Channel-last gate-all-around self-aligned transistors with amorphous oxide-semiconductor channels exhibit high on-state current ($>$ 1 mA/$μ$m) and low subthreshold swing (minimum of 63 mV/dec) without the need for post-deposition processing.

In particular, it suggests that there is no benefit in enhancing the signal or encoding it before addressing a classification problem. This assertion can be proven to be true for the case of the optimal Bayes classifier. However, in practice, it is common to perform \"low-level\" tasks before \"high-level\" downstream tasks despite the overwhelming capabilities of modern deep neural networks. In this paper, we aim to understand when and why low-level processing can be beneficial for classification. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of a binary classification setup, where we consider a classifier that is tightly connected to the optimal Bayes classifier and converges to it as the number of training samples increases. We prove that for any finite number of training samples, there exists a pre-classification processing that improves the classification accuracy. We also explore the effect of class separation, training set size, and class balance on the relative gain from this procedure. We support our theory with an empirical investigation of the theoretical setup. Finally, we conduct an empirical study where we investigate the effect of denoising and encoding on the performance of practical deep classifiers on benchmark datasets. Specifically, we vary the size and class distribution of the training set, and the noise level, and demonstrate trends that are consistent with our theoretical results."

    "abstract": "Integrating large language models (LLMs) into personal assistants, like Xiao Ai and Blue Heart V, effectively enhances their ability to interact with humans, solve complex tasks, and manage IoT devices. Such assistants are also termed LLM-driven agents. Upon receiving user requests, the LLM-driven agent generates plans using an LLM, executes these plans through various tools, and then returns the response to the user. During this process, the latency for generating a plan with an LLM can reach tens of seconds, significantly degrading user experience. Real-world dataset analysis shows that about 30% of the requests received by LLM-driven agents are identical or similar, which allows the reuse of previously generated plans to reduce latency. However, it is difficult to accurately define the similarity between the request texts received by the LLM-driven agent through directly evaluating the original request texts. Moreover, the diverse expressions of natural language and the unstructured format of plan texts make implementing plan reuse challenging. To address these issues, we present and implement a plan reuse mechanism for LLM-driven agents called AgentReuse. AgentReuse leverages the similarities and differences among requests' semantics and uses intent classification to evaluate the similarities between requests and enable the reuse of plans. Experimental results based on a real-world dataset demonstrate that AgentReuse achieves a 93% effective plan reuse rate, an F1 score of 0.9718, and an accuracy of 0.9459 in evaluating request similarities, reducing latency by 93.12% compared with baselines without using the reuse mechanism."

    "abstract": "We explore how the physical properties of disc galaxies relate to the presence of bars using data from the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey. By combining internal kinematical properties and environmental diagnostics, we find that barred galaxies are more frequently associated with centrally concentrated stellar mass distributions (within 1 and 2 effective radii) and exhibit lower values of the stellar angular momentum $λ_{Re}$. At fixed total stellar mass, barred galaxies exhibit: (i) higher stellar mass, and (ii) lower angular momentum, both in their inner regions than their unbarred counterparts. We find a bimodal dependence of the bar fraction on tidal interactions produced by the nearest neighbour. Specifically, the bar fraction peaks in the most isolated galaxies, where bars form unequivocally through internal secular processes, decreases at intermediate interaction strengths, and rises again in the strong interaction regime, likely reflecting the role of dense environments in sustaining or triggering bars. Our results suggest that internal gravitational instabilities are the primary driver of bar formation. External tidal perturbations play a secondary role, capable of triggering or enhancing bar formation in galaxies that are already internally predisposed. Our findings provide robust observational validation of theoretical bar formation and evolution models in galaxies."

    "abstract": "Traditional control interfaces for quadruped robots often impose a high barrier to entry, requiring specialized technical knowledge for effective operation. To address this, this paper presents a novel control framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable intuitive, natural language-based navigation. We propose a distributed architecture where high-level instruction processing is offloaded to an external server to overcome the onboard computational constraints of the DeepRobotics Jueying Lite 3 platform. The system grounds LLM-generated plans into executable ROS navigation commands using real-time sensor fusion (LiDAR, IMU, and Odometry). Experimental validation was conducted in a structured indoor environment across four distinct scenarios, ranging from single-room tasks to complex cross-zone navigation. The results demonstrate the system's robustness, achieving an aggregate success rate of over 90\\% across all scenarios, validating the feasibility of offloaded LLM-based planning for autonomous quadruped deployment in real-world settings."

    "abstract": "This paper presents prospects for a model-independent measurement of the $ZH$ production cross section at the FCC-ee using the recoil-mass technique at center-of-mass energies of $\\sqrt{s}=240$ and $365$ GeV. The analysis considers the muon, electron, and hadronic decay modes of the associated $Z$ boson. Event selections rely primarily on the kinematic properties of the reconstructed $Z$ decay products, ensuring maximal independence from specific Higgs boson decay modes, while multivariate techniques are employed to further enhance sensitivity. Statistical interpretations of the individual final states yield relative precisions of $0.52\\%$ for the combined leptonic channels and $0.38\\%$ for the hadronic channel at $\\sqrt{s}=240$ GeV with an integrated luminosity of $10.8$ ab$^{-1}$. Their full statistical combination leads to total uncertainties of $0.31\\%$ at $\\sqrt{s}=240$ GeV and $0.52\\%$ at $\\sqrt{s}=365$ GeV with $3.12$ ab$^{-1}$. Dedicated statistical tests demonstrate model independence at the level of the obtained precision. This study presents, for the first time, a consistent and combined analysis of the leptonic and hadronic final states, achieving the most precise projected determination of the $ZH$ production cross section at future lepton colliders, with model independence demonstrated within the statistical precision."

This includes species not yet studied in this cluster, such as F, P, K, Yb, and Pb, as well as oxygen isotopic ratios $^{16}$O/$^{17}$O and $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O. Membership was assessed using astrometry and chemical abundances, providing insight into the evolutionary stages of Li-enriched giants and cluster parameters (age, distance, extinction). However, the identification of Ba-stars remains challenging due to their binary nature and less reliable astrometric solutions. The cluster's abundances are broadly consistent with expectations for the Galactic thin disk. The mean fluorine abundance agrees with chemical evolution models predicting that young clusters (<2 Gyr) exhibit elevated [F/Fe], with production from SN II, SN Ia, AGB, and Wolf-Rayet stars. No distinct chemical or rotational features were found to explain the lithium enrichment, likely occurring either during the red clump phase or near the RGB tip. For the Ba-stars, nucleosynthesis models combined with the cluster's turn-off mass suggest polluting companion masses of 3.00 and 3.75 $M_{\\odot}$ for stars #002 and #201.

    "abstract": "Structured data extraction from tables plays a crucial role in document image analysis for scanned documents and digital archives. Although many methods have been proposed to detect table structures and extract cell contents, accurately identifying table segment boundaries (rows and columns) remains challenging, particularly in low-resolution or noisy images. In many real-world scenarios, table data are incomplete or degraded, limiting the adaptability of transformer-based methods to noisy inputs. Mask-based edge detection techniques have shown greater robustness under such conditions, as their sensitivity can be adjusted through threshold tuning; however, existing approaches typically apply masks directly to images, leading to noise sensitivity, resolution loss, or high computational cost. This paper proposes a novel multi-scale signal-processing method for detecting table edges from table masks. Row and column transitions are modeled as one-dimensional signals and processed using Gaussian convolution with progressively increasing variances, followed by statistical thresholding to suppress noise while preserving stable structural edges. Detected signal peaks are mapped back to image coordinates to obtain accurate segment boundaries. Experimental results show that applying the proposed approach to column edge detection improves Cell-Aware Segmentation Accuracy (CASA) a layout-aware metric evaluating both textual correctness and correct cell placement from 67% to 76% on the PubLayNet-1M benchmark when using TableNet with PyTesseract OCR. The method is robust to resolution variations through zero-padding and scaling strategies and produces optimized structured tabular outputs suitable for downstream analysis."

Off the shelf transformers, especially compact ones, treat this material as a flat stream of tokens. This approach leads to confident but incorrect numeric answers and forces the models to memorize separate facts inefficiently. SMART (Structured Memory and Reasoning Transformer) offers a different and practical solution to the above problem. SMART structures its processing by using a hierarchical approach, and is based upon three main job categories (1) A syntax-aware Fact Extractor (Grammarian) Tree LSTM which extracts facts as subject relation object relations from EM sentences (2) A compact indexed memory MANN (Memory Augmented Neural Network) that indexes these Rational Subject Relation Objects as 384 dimensional vectors that are associated with the source of the information, and (3) A 6 layer Transformer that learns to fuse the previously retrieved facts into its generated response. The entire SMART model utilizes 45.51M parameters, which is 64% less than GPT-2 (124M) and 69% less than BERT (133M), and it achieves a 21.3% higher accuracy than GPT-2, indicating that SMART fits the data better with the least amount of processing requirements. SMART employs dual modes of inference an indexed fast path for known documents (sub-second answer times) and an indexed dynamic path assisted by RAGs for new uploads (FAISS Top 20 results with memory severed at 64 slots). In real world deployment, this framework leads to more well supported results with reduced hallucinations than comparable small transformer models."

Such beams are under active investigation for applications in proton beam therapy, materials modification, and nuclear and high-energy-density physics. Despite extensive experimental and theoretical effort, predictive correlations between laser and target parameters and the resulting ion-beam properties remain an open research question, owing to the intrinsically multiphysics and strongly coupled nature of laser-plasma interactions. Here, we employ our unified multiphysics model that reproduces laser-solid interaction dynamics with accuracy exceeding 95% over a broad range of short- and ultrashort-pulse conditions. Using this model, we derive statistically validated scaling laws and probability maps that correlate proton, carbon, and oxygen ion cutoff energies, beam divergences, and ionization states to a wide set of laser and target parameters, including pulse duration, laser power, laser beam spot, target thickness, prepulse-main pulse interval, contrast, laser wavelength, and polarization. Continuous beam properties (cutoff energies and beam divergences) are described using multivariate regression with cross-validation, while discrete ionization states are analyzed using classification and regression tree (CART) methods, enabling nonlinear and threshold-dependent behavior to be captured. The resulting scaling relations, contour maps, and box plots elucidate the coupled roles of laser pulse, and target geometry in governing TNSA ion acceleration and charge-state formation. These results provide a predictive and physically interpretable framework for understanding and optimizing laser-driven ion sources across a wide parameter space."

We analyze the consequences for the three energy contents produced by metric restrictions imposed on the admissible deformations.

We extend this theory to variational analysis and cone-constrained dynamics by studying $K$-Lorentzian and $K$-completely log-concave polynomials over a proper convex cone $K\\subset\\mathbb{R}^n$. For a $K$-Lorentzian form $f$ and $v\\in\\operatorname{int}K$, we define an open cone $K^\\circ(f,v)$ and a closed cone $K(f,v)$ via directional derivatives along $v$, recovering the usual hyperbolicity cone when $f$ is hyperbolic. We prove that $K^\\circ(f,v)$ is a proper cone and equals $\\operatorname{int}K(f,v)$. If $f$ is $K(f,v)$-Lorentzian, then $K(f,v)$ is convex and maximal among convex cones on which $f$ is Lorentzian. Using the Rayleigh matrix $M_f(x)=\\nabla f(x)\\nabla f(x)^T - f(x)\\nabla^2 f(x)$, we obtain cone-restricted Rayleigh inequalities and show that two-direction Rayleigh inequalities on $K$ are equivalent to an acuteness condition for the bilinear form $v^T M_f(x) w$. This yields a cone-restricted negative-dependence interpretation linking the curvature of $\\log f$ to covariance properties of associated Gibbs measures. For determinantal generating polynomials, we identify the intersection of the hyperbolicity cone with the nonnegative orthant as the classical semipositive cone, and we extend this construction to general proper cones via $K$-semipositive cones. Finally, for linear evolution variational inequality (LEVI) systems, we show that if $q(x)=x^T A x$ is (strictly) $K$-Lorentzian, then $A$ is (strictly) $K$-copositive and yields Lyapunov (semi-)stability on $K$, giving new Lyapunov criteria for cone-constrained dynamics."

This is a natural generalization of a random purification channel, that transforms copies of an unknown mixed state to copies of a randomly chosen purification state. Our construction is based on the quantum Schur transform and the quantum Fourier transform over the symmetric group. By using the efficient construction of these quantum transforms, we can implement the random dilation superchannel with the circuit complexity $O(\\mathrm{poly}(n, \\log d_I, \\log d_O))$, where $n$ is the number of queries and $d_I$ and $d_O$ are the input and output dimensions of the input channel, respectively. As an application, we show an efficient storage-and-retrieval of an unknown quantum channel, which improves the program cost exponentially in the retrieval error $\\varepsilon$. For the case where the Kraus rank $r$ is the least possible (i.e., $r = d_I/d_O$), we show quantum circuits transforming $n$ parallel queries of an unknown quantum channel $Λ$ to $Θ(n^α)$ parallel queries of $Λ$ for any $α<2$ approximately, and its Petz recovery map for the reference state given by the maximally mixed state probabilistically and exactly.

We work out both of these deformations explicitly and verify that $T \\overline T$-deforming the boundary theory corresponds to imposing mixed boundary conditions on the metric at the conformal boundary, whereas the bulk \"Dirichlet deformation\" gives rise to a field theory deforming operator that includes $T \\overline T$ as well as other irrelevant terms. We check our results by calculating the deformed energy spectrum for either case using both the bulk and boundary prescriptions, finding agreement after taking into account additional terms coming from the flow of the scalar source. We interpret our explicit results and compare them with the predictions of similar proposals in the literature."

    "abstract": "Generating 3D human motions from textual descriptions is an important research problem with broad applications in video games, virtual reality, and augmented reality. Recent methods align the textual description with human motion at the sequence level, neglecting the internal semantic structure of modalities. However, both motion descriptions and motion sequences can be naturally decomposed into smaller and semantically coherent segments, which can serve as atomic alignment units to achieve finer-grained correspondence. Motivated by this, we propose SegMo, a novel Segment-aligned text-conditioned human Motion generation framework to achieve fine-grained text-motion alignment. Our framework consists of three modules: (1) Text Segment Extraction, which decomposes complex textual descriptions into temporally ordered phrases, each representing a simple atomic action; (2) Motion Segment Extraction, which partitions complete motion sequences into corresponding motion segments; and (3) Fine-grained Text-Motion Alignment, which aligns text and motion segments with contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SegMo improves the strong baseline on two widely used datasets, achieving an improved TOP 1 score of 0.553 on the HumanML3D test set. Moreover, thanks to the learned shared embedding space for text and motion segments, SegMo can also be applied to retrieval-style tasks such as motion grounding and motion-to-text retrieval."

Nevertheless, antenna and beam management approaches still face challenges in highly mobile solutions, such as vehicular connectivity, with increasing number of bands. In this work, the concepts of spectrum mobility is studied along with antenna array management in multiple frequencies to improve beamforming under mobility. The spectrum mobility problem aims to select the optimal channel frequency and beam direction in each time slot to maximize data rate. This problem is formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and Point-Based Value Iteration (PBVI) algorithm is used to find a policy with performance guarantees. Numerical examples confirm the efficacy of the resulting policy for multiple available frequency bands, even when the user mobility significantly deviates from models assumed during policy generation."

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across tasks such as visual question answering and image captioning. Yet, the extent to which these models perform visual reasoning as opposed to relying on linguistic priors remains unclear. To address this, we introduce VisRes Bench, a benchmark designed to study visual reasoning in naturalistic settings without contextual language supervision. Analyzing model behavior across three levels of complexity, we uncover clear limitations in perceptual and relational visual reasoning capacities. VisRes isolates distinct reasoning abilities across its levels. Level 1 probes perceptual completion and global image matching under perturbations such as blur, texture changes, occlusion, and rotation; Level 2 tests rule-based inference over a single attribute (e.g., color, count, orientation); and Level 3 targets compositional reasoning that requires integrating multiple visual attributes. Across more than 19,000 controlled task images, we find that state-of-the-art VLMs perform near random under subtle perceptual perturbations, revealing limited abstraction beyond pattern recognition. We conclude by discussing how VisRes provides a unified framework for advancing abstract visual reasoning in multimodal research."

    "abstract": "We establish a direct connection between the interior curvature structure of nonsingular black holes (BHs) with a Minkowski core and their observable optical signatures. By classifying these spacetimes into three fundamental types, Type I (Kretschmann scalar K_max increasing with mass M), Type II (mass-independent K_max), and Type III (K_max decreasing with M), we demonstrate how subtle variations in the core geometry imprint distinguishable features on the BH shadow. A detailed analysis of photon dynamics reveals that the parameters α and n, which control the deviation from Schwarzschild geometry and the radial decay of the regularizing factor, respectively, systematically alter the properties of the photon sphere. These intrinsic geometric differences propagate outward: for fixed parameters, Type III BHs, with the most compact photon sphere, produce the smallest and brightest shadows, whereas Type I BHs yield the largest and dimmest ones. Shadow computations under both static and infalling spherical accretion models confirm that the curvature-based classification directly corresponds to observable differences. Critically, Type III BHs exhibit the strongest sensitivity to parameter variations, making them optimal probes for constraining the underlying spacetime geometry. Our work reveals that even among nonsingular BHs sharing the same asymptotic core, differences in internal curvature are reflected in the shadow morphology, thereby providing a new pathway to test quantum-gravity-inspired models using upcoming high-resolution observations."

Even if this is a strong assumption, it has not received much attention from DiD practitioners and, in many cases, it is not even explicitly stated as an assumption, especially the no-interference assumption. In this technical note, we investigate what the DiD estimand identifies in the presence of unknown interference. We show that the DiD estimand identifies a contrast of causal effects, but it is not informative on any of these causal effects separately, without invoking further assumptions. Then, we explore different sets of assumptions under which the DiD estimand becomes informative about specific causal effects. We illustrate these results by revisiting the seminal paper on minimum wages and employment by Card and Krueger (1994)."

By harnessing quantum information scrambling, the protocol converts local interactions into delocalized metrologically useful correlations, enabling robust signal amplification through interference of the scrambled and polarized quantum states. We validate the time-reversal ability via Loschmidt echo measurements and quantify the information scrambling through out-of-time-ordered correlators, establishing the essential quantum resources of our protocol. Our measurements reveal that the sensing sensitivity surpasses the standard quantum limit (SQL) with increasing qubit number, reaching 3.78 in a 9-qubit configuration, compared to the SQL of 3.0. The scheme further exhibits inherent robustness to coherent control errors and probed signal noise.

    "abstract": "Understanding how emotions diffuse through social networks is central to computational social science. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to simulate social media interactions, raising the question of whether LLM-generated data can realistically reproduce emotion diffusion patterns observed in real online communities. In this study, we conduct a systematic comparison between emotion diffusion in real-world social graphs and in LLM-simulated interaction networks. We construct diffusion graphs from Reddit discussion data and compare them with synthetic social graphs generated through LLM-driven conversational simulations. Emotion states are inferred using established sentiment analysis pipelines, and both real and simulated graphs are analyzed from structural, behavioral, and predictive perspectives. Our results reveal substantial structural and dynamic discrepancies between real and simulated diffusion processes. Real-world emotion diffusion exhibits dense connectivity, repeated interactions, sentiment shifts, and emergent community structures, whereas LLM-simulated graphs largely consist of isolated linear chains with monotonic emotional trajectories. These structural limitations significantly affect downstream tasks such as graph-based emotion prediction, leading to reduced emotional diversity and class imbalance in simulated settings. Our findings highlight current limitations of LLM-based social simulation in capturing the interactive complexity and emotional heterogeneity of real social networks. This work provides empirical evidence for the cautious use of LLM-generated data in social science research and suggests directions for improving future simulation frameworks."

    "abstract": "Multi-agent trajectory generation is a core problem for autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems. However, efficiently modeling the dynamic interactions between numerous road users and infrastructures in complex scenes remains an open problem. Existing methods typically employ distance-based or fully connected dense graph structures to capture interaction information, which not only introduces a large number of redundant edges but also requires complex and heavily parameterized networks for encoding, thereby resulting in low training and inference efficiency, limiting scalability to large and complex traffic scenes. To overcome the limitations of existing methods, we propose SparScene, a sparse graph learning framework designed for efficient and scalable traffic scene representation. Instead of relying on distance thresholds, SparScene leverages the lane graph topology to construct structure-aware sparse connections between agents and lanes, enabling efficient yet informative scene graph representation. SparScene adopts a lightweight graph encoder that efficiently aggregates agent-map and agent-agent interactions, yielding compact scene representations with substantially improved efficiency and scalability. On the motion prediction benchmark of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), SparScene achieves competitive performance with remarkable efficiency. It generates trajectories for more than 200 agents in a scene within 5 ms and scales to more than 5,000 agents and 17,000 lanes with merely 54 ms of inference time with a GPU memory of 2.9 GB, highlighting its superior scalability for large-scale traffic scenes."

First, in the setting of semilinear elliptic PDEs, we introduce a refined variational truncation method that yields infinite sequences of positive as well as negative solutions. Second and most notably, we resolve a long-standing and difficult problem for nonvariational elliptic PDEs with gradient dependence. By combining our truncation method with an iterative scheme, we prove, for the first time, the existence of infinitely many solutions for this class of PDEs. Third, we overcome a central difficulty for periodic Hamiltonian systems on the real line: we show that the multiplicity of solutions, constructed on a sequence of finite intervals, survives in the limit; in other words, no collapse occurs, and we obtain multiple distinct solutions on the whole real line. The core novelty lies in a carefully designed truncation methodology that systematically separates solutions and remains effective across variational and non-variational PDEs as well as infinite dimensional dynamical systems. This unified perspective provides a robust and versatile tool for addressing multiplicity problems in the absence of symmetry."

    "abstract": "The generation of helical magnetic fields and the associated chiral asymmetry via the chiral anomaly is a generic feature in pseudoscalar inflation. In the presence of a Chern--Simons coupling between the inflaton and a U(1) gauge field, the homogeneous evolution of the inflaton induces a tachyonic instability in one circular polarization of the gauge field, resulting in the production of helical magnetic fields. In this work, we show that, in the case of a gauged lepton flavor symmetry, U(1)$_{L_i-L_j}$, this mechanism can lead to the generation of a sizable lepton asymmetry. In a simple setup, however, the resulting lepton asymmetry is typically too small to have an observational consequences, even setting aside constraints from baryon overproduction via sphaleron processes, due to the backreaction of the produced gauge fields and fermions on the inflationary dynamics. We demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome by implementing a mechanism to suppress fermion production during inflation. As a result, a much larger lepton asymmetry can be generated from the subsequent decay of magnetic helicity. Remarkably, for the gauged U(1)$_{L_μ-L_τ}$ symmetry, the generated asymmetry can be sufficiently large to suppress the primordial helium abundance, as may be inferred from recent cosmic microwave background observations by ACT."

This structure-semantics heterogeneity implies that no graph learning model with a fixed inductive bias can generalize optimally across diverse graph domains. However, most existing methods address this challenge from the model side by incrementally injecting new inductive biases, which remains fundamentally limited given the open-ended diversity of real-world graphs. In this work, we take a data-centric perspective and treat node semantics as a task-adaptive variable. We propose a Data-Adaptive Semantic Refinement framework DAS for graph representation learning, which couples a fixed graph neural network (GNN) and a large language model (LLM) in a closed feedback loop. The GNN provides implicit supervisory signals to guide the semantic refinement of LLM, and the refined semantics are fed back to update the same graph learner. We evaluate our approach on both text-rich and text-free graphs. Results show consistent improvements on structure-dominated graphs while remaining competitive on semantics-rich graphs, demonstrating the effectiveness of data-centric semantic adaptation under structure-semantics heterogeneity."

This paper presents a systematic evidence synthesis and exploratory investigation of VOC-based affective computing using low-cost sensors. Study 1, a systematic scoping review following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, analyzed 16 studies from 610 records across breath, sweat, skin, and urine biosources. Evidence indicates that stress and affective states are reflected in VOC signatures (aldehydes, ketones, fatty acids, sulfur compounds), though with considerable heterogeneity. Current research relies predominantly on laboratory-grade GC-MS or PTR-MS, while wearable sensors provide pattern-level outputs without compound-specific identification - a critical gap for practical systems. Study 2 (n=25) investigated whether low-cost TVOC sensors (BME688, ENS160) combined with physiological monitoring (HR, HRV, GSR) can detect laboratory-induced stress. Exploratory analysis revealed that high cardiovascular reactors exhibited elevated TVOC during arithmetic stress (d=1.38), though requiring replication in larger samples. Substantial interindividual variability emerged (CV>80%), with coupling patterns moderated by baseline emission levels and temporal lags of 30-80 seconds. Random Forest-based multimodal classification achieved 77.3% accuracy (5-fold CV). SHAP analysis indicated VOC sensors contributed 24.9% of model performance. Leave-one-subject-out validation yielded 65.3% accuracy, highlighting the need for individual calibration. This work provides three contributions: (1) comprehensive mapping of VOC biomarker evidence and technological gaps, (2) initial demonstration that low-cost sensors can capture stress-related VOC patterns in multimodal fusion, and (3) identification of key implementation challenges. Findings require replication in larger samples (n>=50)."

In this work, we introduce FreeInpaint, a plug-and-play tuning-free approach that directly optimizes the diffusion latents on the fly during inference to improve the faithfulness of the generated images. Technically, we introduce a prior-guided noise optimization method that steers model attention towards valid inpainting regions by optimizing the initial noise. Furthermore, we meticulously design a composite guidance objective tailored specifically for the inpainting task. This objective efficiently directs the denoising process, enhancing prompt alignment and visual rationality by optimizing intermediate latents at each step.

Specifically, we analyze the convergence properties and asymptotic bias of the OBF algorithm, and propose a pole selection algorithm that robustly minimizes the worst-case identification bias, with the bias measured under the $\\mathcal{H}_2$ error criterion. Our results include an analytical expression for the convergence rate and an explicit bound on the asymptotic identification bias, which depends on both the true system poles and the preselected model poles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the pole selection algorithm is asymptotically optimal, achieving the fundamental lower bound on the identification bias. The algorithm explicitly determines the model poles as the so-called Tsuji points, and the asymptotic identification bias decreases exponentially with the number of basis functions, with the rate of decrease governed by the hyperbolic Chebyshev constant. Numerical experiments validate the derived bounds and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pole selection algorithm."

    "abstract": "Historically, financial risk management has mostly addressed risk factors that arise from the financial environment. Climate risks present a novel and significant challenge for companies and financial markets. Investors aiming for avoidance of firms with high carbon footprints require suitable risk measures and portfolio management strategies. This paper presents the construction of decarbonized indices for tracking the S \\& P-500 index of the U.S. stock market, as well as the Indian index NIFTY-50, employing two distinct methodologies and study their performances. These decarbonized indices optimize the portfolio weights by minimizing the mean-VaR and mean-ES and seek to reduce the risk of significant financial losses while still pursuing decarbonization goals. Investors can thereby find a balance between financial performance and environmental responsibilities. Ensuring transparency in the development of these indices will encourage the excluded and under-weighted asset companies to lower their carbon footprints through appropriate action plans. For long-term passive investors, these indices may present a more favourable option than green stocks."

    "abstract": "Artificial gauge fields open up burgeoning opportunities for wave engineering in different disciplines. So far,previous works have mostly focused on synthesizing spatial gauge fields, where the pseudo-magnetic fields lie at the heart of these phenomena. In this Letter, we generalize the paradigm of gauge field optics to the time domain by using time-varying media with rotating anisotropy. Dual to its spatial counterpart, the temporal gauge field induces a pseudo-electric field for optical pulses, leading to the spin-dependent longitudinal shift and Zitterbewegung for both trajectory and frequency. In addition, we analyze the temporal non-Abelian interference effect induced by temporally bounded non-Abelian gauge field media, which results in the temporal spin-precession and the temporal analogy of the non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm effect. Our work not only fills the gap between synthetic gauge fields and time-varying physical systems, but also provides a fundamentally new approach for manipulating light with time-varying media."

    "abstract": "The logarithmic soft photon theorem in four spacetime dimensions encodes an infinite-dimensional asymptotic symmetry which acts on massive matter as a divergent superphaserotation. Here we extend this result to massless matter which is both more subtle and surprising. We derive the charge associated to divergent superphaserotations and show that it exactly vanishes to all orders in the electromagnetic coupling. This is in agreement with the vanishing of the classical logarithmic soft photon theorem which is one-loop exact. Special care is required for massless matter due to potential collinear divergences which, as we show, do however not affect the superphaserotation charge. We furthermore compute the infrared corrections to the charge associated to the subleading tree-level soft photon theorem. As a corollary of our result, we find that the tail to the velocity kick memory due to the long-range interactions between soft electromagnetic radiation and massless matter vanishes."

    "abstract": "Measuring the perceived quality of mobile applications is a pivotal consideration for app developers, users, and platforms, as perceived quality can be measured by getting user reviews. Yet, the common sentiment analysis (SA) does not focus on more linguistic indicators of app quality. In this study, a model based on DistilBERT is suggested to predict the perceived app quality and classify end-user reviews on a high-quality or low-quality scale. Manually annotated data was applied, using quality parameters (informativeness, clarity, relevance, specificity, coherence, level of details, and actionable usability feedback), while also integrating appraisal theory’s key components i.e., affect, appreciation, and judgment. Affect is related to the emotional tendency of the user. Appreciation concerns functional effectiveness, and the role of judgment is related to evaluation on the basis of performance. These linguistic indicators offer deeper insights into how users emotionally and cognitively assess app quality. In order to certify the interpretability of the model, an Explainable AI (XAI) solution, namely SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), was utilised to cross-check the annotations and confirm the emphasis of the model on primary measures of quality, such as usability, stability, and performance. The 5-fold stratified cross-validation measurement updated this model, yielding high performance with an average accuracy of 92.88%. It was evaluated on reviews of seven of the trending mobile apps, namely ESPN, Snapchat, Skype, Opera Mini,MX Player, VLC Media Player, and Daraz Online Shopping, and performed better than the baseline strategies. The findings confirm the strength and performance of the model, which presents a scalable automated app quality evaluation framework."

The novelty of the solution is that the input of the voltage divider and the reference input of the ADC are connected to the same output pin of the microcontroller, making the voltage divider only be stimulated during measurements, which significantly reduces the power consumption, and the resistance measurements of the sensor independent of the supply voltage and the on-resistance of the microcontroller pin, which reduces the measurement error. The method was illustrated based on a widely used Arduino module and resistors with values corresponding to a Pt1000 sensor. The paper also proposes a software systematic error correction algorithm used for circuit calibration, which reduces the relative systematic errors to the level of the quantisation error of a 10-bit ADC (0.2%). An oversampling method was also used and tested. Experimental studies show that 64-fold oversampling can reduce the relative random error to 0.06%."

    "abstract": "In real-world industrial processes, there are many lexicographic multiobjective problems, which consist of conflicting subtasks with explicit priorities. In the past, model predictive control (MPC) is combined with lexicographic optimization to form Lexicographic MPC (LMPC), which handles priorities in a hierarchical manner. Although higher priorities like safety in chemical reactions, can be strictly maintained, the recursive optimization incurs great burden for online computation, which makes LMPC impractical. Considering the great success, especially the low online computation cost of reinforcement learning (RL), several studies have been conducted in lexicographic multiobjective RL (LMORL) to train end-to-end policies for prioritized problems. However, existing LMORL methods are either limited to discrete domains with low precision control in processes, or heavily reliant on hyperparameter tuning with prior knowledge. To address these limitations in continuous process problems, lexicographically projected policy gradient RL (LPPG-RL) is proposed. LPPG-RL performs sequential policy gradient projections to identify a feasible policy update direction, ensuring compatibility with general continuous policy gradient RL algorithms. LPPG-RL employs Dykstra's projection instead of generic solvers to accelerate the direction search, particularly for high-dimension gradient vectors. In addition, LPPG-RL introduces subproblem exploration to mitigate gradient vanishing and improve training stability. Furthermore, convergence proof and stepsize analysis are provided. Finally, two CSTR problems serve as the case study, demonstrating the effectiveness of LPPG-RL through comparisons with baseline LMORL and LMPC methods."

    "abstract": "Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is widely used as an assistive method for foot drop correction. However, existing FES controllers often induce unnatural muscle activation through rigid stimulation or lack adaptability to dynamic changes in gait performance. This study proposed an FES profile optimization method to achieve natural and adaptive stimulation in order to compensate for disturbances through the following two steps: (i) a Hammerstein-structured ankle joint dynamic model was developed to establish the relationship between the FES profiles and musculoskeletal dynamic response; (ii) utilizing this model, a Norm-Optimal Iterative Learning Control (NOILC)-based FES controller was designed, and an optimal control learning gain was determined to adjust FES profiles for automatic correction of trajectory tracking errors. The proposed controller’s performance was evaluated using kinematic data from five stroke patients and compared with that under two conditions: no FES and fixed-profile FES. The experimental results showed that the proposed controller could result in ankle dorsiflexion motions closer to the reference trajectory, and the maximum dorsiflexion angle during the swing phase was significantly improved by 3.92° relative to the no FES condition and by 2.06° relative to the fixed-profile FES condition. This study indicates that the proposed controller can provide natural and adaptive FES profiles, enhancing gait performance for stroke patients and showing promising potential for clinical application."

Typically, the design process starts with an initial core shape and size, followed by iterative \"trial and error\" adjustments to the core size to achieve optimal dimensions. The proposed method is purely analytical for the case of inductors non-limited by saturation (NLS) and for the cases that are limited by saturation (LS), typically requiring calculation iterations. The proposed method is intended as a scoping and scaling tool, so it can also be used as a scaling law for the energy density of inductors for comparing volumes for different specifications. The method includes the variability of input design parameters to account for the deviation between theoretical designs and actual implementations. Finally, a workflow of the proposed method is presented that consists in two iterations of the method to improve significantly the deviation from the experimental results by recalculating the input parameters based on the initial core selection from the first pass. The maximum deviation for the method is improved from around 20% to 35% on the first iteration to around 4% to 20% for the second iteration."

Social presence is central in digital interactions, as it fosters a sense of “being together,” which is essential for affective communication, collaboration, and relationship-building in computer-mediated environments. This study explores the impact of behavioral synchronization through HugBits, a cushion -shaped device designed for remote hug-based interaction, on both perceived social presence and users' prosociality. We conducted two experiments: (1) testing whether hug synchronization increased perceived social presence, and (2) assessing whether synchronization influenced cooperative decision-making in a Prisoner's Dilemma game. In both experiments, the occurrence of behavioral synchronization (i.e., hugging) was controlled by having participants interact with a virtual agent that was designed to probabilistically promote or avoid synchronized hugs. Results show that more synchronized interactions significantly enhanced perceived social presence and promoted cooperative behavior. These findings highlight behavioral synchronization as a promising design strategy for affective communication technologies and provide concrete implications for integrating emotional and behavioral outcomes in computer-mediated communication research."

Our approach designs a diffusion multiview drug recommendation method, which employs a diffusion model to mitigate representation noise in clinical data induced by data sparsity. Then, we propose the contrastive deep fusion module, which utilizes self-attention to capture patients’ historical information and employs pair-wise attention to capture multiview clinical information. By introducing contrastive learning and combining the two types of attention mechanisms, we achieve information align and deep fusion. In the MIMIC-II, MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets, compared to the state-of-the-art models, CD-MDRec obtains an average improvement of 2.12% and 1.54% in Jaccard and F1-score metrics, respectively."

Although multimodal sleep stage classification approaches that extract features from time and time-frequency domains have shown promising results, they overlook underfitted modality, which can cause poor generalization. To encourage learning from underfitted modality, we propose to assign weight to each domain loss, which is inversely proportional to the validation accuracy of the domain. To effectively capture the diverse temporal dynamics of sleep transitions, a neural network architecture, which employs bidirectional temporal convolution, is proposed. In addition, a novel ensemble method that aggregates the ensembles of all multimodal features is proposed to improve the overall classification performance rather than relying on a single-domain output ensemble as in existing methods. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using the SleepEDF-20 and SleepEDF-78 datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed method exhibits superior classification performance compared with existing algorithms."

    "abstract": "When placing product promotion in contents, creators face the challenge of balancing the limited resources between creating high-quality content and integrating advertising seamlessly to mitigate advertising disutility. We conceptualize a creator on a user-generated content platform who maximizes both traffic-based revenue and commissions from selling products. Our study investigates how the platform leverages content incentives to influence the creator's devotion to content creation as well as viewers' engagement. Our modeling analysis reveals several interesting findings. We observe that the platform provides high incentives when content quality is low, but reduces them once quality exceeds a certain threshold. Correspondingly, the creator first devotes full effort to content creation and then shifts more effort to advertising integration. Our results suggest that an increase in the creator's efficiency in mitigating advertising disutility or the commission reduces the creator's motivation in content creation, ultimately lowering the platform's profit and consumer surplus. However, the creator does not always benefit from these improvements. In fact, the profit can diminish if the creator's efficiency in advertising integration or the commission becomes high enough. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of our insights under several key model extensions, including platform sales commissions and asymmetric cost structure."

    "abstract": "Vibration signal analysis methods based on digital signal processing (DSP) have been proven effective in motor fault diagnosis. However, DSP requires signal conversion from analog into digital and specific signal processors to execute the algorithm, leading to considerable computation load, energy consumption, and hardware cost. Inspired by the binary classification idea of decision trees, this study designs a vibration signal classifier based on pure analog circuits and proposes a real-time motor fault diagnosis method. This method directly extracts fault features through hardware circuits and achieves signal pattern classification, significantly improving diagnostic efficiency and system response speed. In particular, a filter matrix is constructed to realize the function of the nodes in the decision tree, and an optimization algorithm is applied to determine the optimal parameters for each filter and ensure that actual circuit characteristics match the expected results. After filter matrix configuration and optimization, the designed system can process the analog vibration signal from the accelerometer and map the input signal to the output with the encoded information. In the actual motor operation scenario, the analog circuit system takes only 78 ms to detect a sudden fault. This novel signal classification system avoids the analog-to-digital conversion process and boasts comprehensive advantages such as simple structure, short response time, and strong interpretability. Robustness experiments have proven that this method can be applied to different motor fault diagnosis scenarios and has the ability to diagnose hybrid electrical and mechanical faults. It provides reliable technical support for the intelligent maintenance strategies of motors and other rotating machinery, demonstrating significant engineering application values and broad research prospects."

    "abstract": "High-impedance single-phase-to-ground faults (HISPGs) are common in medium-voltage distribution networks, characterized by weak fault currents and high sensitivity to interference. Distributed power sources and the power electronic devices further introduce additional harmonic interference. These conditions collectively lead to low-quality sampled signals, weaken fault features, and thereby substantially increase the complexity of identifying faulted feeders. The proposed method integrates three components to address these issues. It employs adaptive GASF to convert one-dimensional time-series signals into image signals with an adaptive sliding window, integrates a Kolmogorov-Arnold network to fit complex fault features through spline functions, and applies a smoothing factor to stabilize attention scores, reducing overfitting to interference across training batches. This approach enhances spatial feature representation, strengthens fault feature capture, and improves robustness to interference. Experimental results highlight the proposed method’s superior performance under low-quality signal conditions, particularly at 1 kHz and 5 dB. The attention-based ViT model outperforms the sequence-based LSTM model by 12.68% and the convolution-based efficientnetv2_s model by 3.02% in faulted feeder identification accuracy. The proposed KEMT model achieves a 10.26% higher accuracy than the ViT model under the same conditions."

    "abstract": "The influence of the atmosphere and unevenness of the reflecting surface on the radiometric characteristics of natural coverings in the Kirchhoff approximation is analyzed while taking into account the effects of shading and multiple scattering. To describe the relationships between the characteristics of scattering, thermal radiation, and the geometry of the Earth’s surface, radiophysical models are used that take into account not only the effects of single scattering, but also multiple scattering and shading, the latter are discussed in this article. It is shown that in the case of a Gaussian distribution of the tangent of the slope angle of surface unevenness, the viewing angle, the dielectric constant of the medium, and the variance of the tangent of the slope angle of random irregularities are used to describe the characteristics of scattering and radiation. The effect of secondary and multiple scattering has been quantified. A radiophysical model of surface radiation has been obtained, which allows us to take into account the influence of reflected radiation from a cloudless atmosphere and surface unevenness on the characteristics of the thermal signal in the Kirchhoff approximation. It is determined that the equivalent temperature of atmospheric radiation has a weak dependence not only on the unevenness parameter, but also on the type of polarization of the received radiation. The obtained radiophysical model that uses multiple scattering and shading can be used to describe the relationship between the scattering and radiating properties of natural coverings."

    "abstract": "This paper explores the use of the recently proposed dual grid-forming control applied to modular multilevel converters and enhanced by embedded energy storage. Dual grid-forming technique enables the converter to form both ac and dc grids by leveraging its internal energy, while the embedded energy storage provides damping to the grid, thereby improving its stability margins. The application of dual grid-forming in a modular multilevel converter is characterized by using its internal power balance as a synchronization mechanism. The addition of controllable and decoupled energy storage provides a new and promising degree of freedom. On this basis, two innovative damping provision methods are proposed and compared with the existing solutions by means of small-signal eigenvalue analysis and time-domain numerical simulations. Results show enhanced system stability margins, with an increased damping ratio of the critical eigenvalue from 10% to 60%, and a lower perturbation of system variables when using the proposed strategies."

Vision-based systems offer a nonintrusive alternative to wearables, yet face challenges such as environmental variability and privacy concerns. To address these limitations, we propose a novel vision-based fall detection framework integrating YOLO11-based pose estimation, a confidence-aware Kalman filter for adaptive joint smoothing, and a spatio-temporal graph network enhanced by contrastive learning. The Kalman filter leverages detection confidence to improve keypoint tracking stability, while contrastive learning boosts feature discriminability and generalization. Our multi-loss strategy further improves both classification and temporal localization. Experimental results on the Le2i and UR-Fall datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced false positives. Cross-dataset evaluations further confirm the model’s strong generalization capability, making it suitable for real-world deployment in diverse environments."

Due to its excellent material properties, GaN MOSFET can be used in airborne DC/AC inverters to significantly improve their switching frequency and other characteristics. However, excessive switching speeds and frequencies can lead to high-frequency resonance and electromagnetic interference. In this paper, a random frequency space vector pulse width modulation strategy based on a hybrid differential evolution-particle swarm algorithm is proposed to reduce EMI emissions and switching loss in GaN-based DC/AC inverter. First, the high-frequency circuit model of the GaN MOSFET, the propagation path model of common mode interference and the equivalent circuit are established to analyze the generation mechanism and influence factors of conducted EMI. The temperature-dependent GaN switching losses are modeled using the proposed random frequency modulation strategy, with the hybrid differential evolution-particle swarm algorithm applying different weights to the optimization objective function."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of unmanned technology, unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) are now capable of performing maritime missions such as hydrographic surveying, port inspection, and emergency response. In traditional marine exploration path planning, it is generally assumed that once the sonar swath of a USV passes through a target area, the scanning of that area is considered complete. However, in practical missions, multiple sonar passes over the target area are required to ensure reliable detection. By integrating the infinitesimal element method and the grid method, the target area is divided into a number of cells, each treated as a planned detection target. A value is assigned to each cell based on the number of times it has been detected, which is used to calculate detection reliability. The particle swarm optimization algorithm is employed to analyze and optimize typical USV paths. A cost function is designed according to actual mission characteristics to improve the reliability and convergence speed of the algorithm. Simulation results show that when the detection probability of the USV is taken into account, a zigzag maneuver yields the best overall mission efficiency."

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for sustainable and reliable electricity in isolated island communities presents significant technical and economic challenges. Lemukutan Island in west Kalimantan currently relies on diesel generators operating only 14 hours a day, leading to high fuel consumption and limited electricity access. Lemukutan Island has been officially designated as a tourism village within the Bengkayang Regency due to its natural attractions, supporting facilities, accessibility, and active participation of the community in tourism development. Using Indonesia’s solar potential of $207,898 \\mathrm{MWp}$, including $20,113 \\mathrm{MW}$ in West Kalimantan, this study investigates the feasibility of achieving a continuous $\\mathbf{2 4}$-hour electricity supply through the integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems, diesel generators, and battery storage. A 725 kWp PV system was designed using simulation tools, and a techno-economic analysis was performed in three scenarios: (i) diesel-only operation, (ii) PV-diesel hybrid, and (iii) PV-diesel-battery hybrid. The results show that the baseline diesel-only system incurs the highest net present cost (NPC) and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE), with a strong dependence on fossil fuel. The PV-diesel configuration reduces fuel consumption and emissions, while the PV-diesel-battery system offers the most optimal solution, achieving an NPC of USD $\\mathbf{1. 9 0 2}$ million, an LCOE of USD $0.158 / \\mathrm{kWh}$, and a reduction in fuel consumption 49% compared to diesel-only operation. These findings demonstrate that the PV-diesel-battery hybrid configuration is the most costeffective and sustainable option to ensure continuous electricity access for Lemukutan Island and similar isolated areas."

This study presents the design and development of a cost-effective device capable of detecting excessive vibration by measuring acceleration and cutting force signals directly from the turning tool holder during external cylindrical turning. Based on the acquired sensor data, two machine learning models - LSTM and ResNet18 - were implemented to identify abnormal vibration patterns. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed models achieved a detection accuracy of up to 98% in identifying excessive vibrations.

It can be seen as a combination of three independent half-bridge ZVS-PWM DC/AC converters. They operate independently but 120 degrees out of phase with each other. Each of them uses its own resonant tank to generate its own high-frequency resonant voltage waveforms and then combines them to form its own sinewave output voltage waveform with lower high frequency harmonics. The resonant tanks also provide ZVS function on all power switches. The switch loss and EMI of proposed converter is lower. The presented DC/AC converter uses the three-phase sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM) control technique to regulate system dynamic characteristic. This paper designs and makes a 2000 W ZVS-PWM three-phase DC/AC converter to verify circuit performance."

    "abstract": "Previous methods with a conventional gate driver often suffer from a trade-off between EMI and switching losses. This paper proposes a real-time feedback control method using a digital active gate drive (DAGD) to overcome this trade-off in a three-phase inverter system. The proposed system monitors conducted EMI in the $\\mathbf{5 -3 0 ~ M H z}$ range using a LISN and spectrum analyzer and automatically adjusts the gate drive strength to maintain the EMI level at a predefined target. The experimental results demonstrated that the EMI level successfully converged to the two different target values during continuous operation, regardless of the initial settings. This effective EMI tracking enables reduced switching losses by avoiding EMI over-suppression."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a design method for the primary leakage inductance of toroidal transformers for pulse power supplies. The transformer employs printed circuit boards (PCBs) for the windings, and the leakage inductance is adjusted by varying the spacer height between the primary and secondary windings. A total-permeance-based formula was derived and validated with prototypes. Measurement results showed a linear spacer-inductance relationship with less than 10% error. When the space between the primary winding and secondary winding is only the air, a 21% slope deviation was observed with increased spacer height, due to copper-foil leakage flux. Inserting a magnetic-material filament into part of the air gap reduced the slope error to 3%. This modification also enabled the target inductance to be achieved with a 34% lower spacer height, facilitating miniaturization for high-frequency pulse power transformers."

The system adopts synchronous rectification to reduce conduction and switching losses, while employing multiphase interleaving to distribute current, suppress ripple, and alleviate capacitor stress. Compared with conventional multi-phase buck converters, this work introduces a modified duty-offset method for current sharing control, which replaces the conventional algorithm, shortens computation time, and improves system stability. In addition, a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller is implemented to enhance dynamic response at high frequencies. Experimental results show that the proposed converter achieves a peak efficiency of 96.657% at an output power of 432 W, confirming both the feasibility and the distinct advantages of the proposed method for high-current, high-efficiency applications."

Since power devices of the CDHB resonant converter can be operated with soft-switching, the system efficiency is increased and therefore increasing the switching frequency and the power density of the converter. In this paper, the primary-side current is detected to generate the control signal of the secondary-side synchronous rectifiers, reducing conduction losses. Finally, an experimental prototype of the CDHB resonant converter with the presented primaryside based synchronous rectification control method is implemented. The input voltage range is 740 V to 840 V, the output voltage is 15 V, the rated power is 105 W, and the series resonant frequency is designed at 1 MHz. At the input voltage of 800 V and the current output of 4.2 A condition, the highest efficiency is achieved at 94%."

    "abstract": "Bifacial photovoltaic (PV) systems are increasingly deployed in open-field environments, where dust deposition is a critical factor influencing long-term performance and durability. This study investigates the performance of bifacial PV technology after two years of operation using a combination of electrical characterization, morphological analysis, and spectroscopic evaluation. Two strings of 28 series-connected bifacial modules were tested using the Solmetric PV Analyzer. Under similar irradiance conditions ($851-858 \\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{m}^{2}$) and module temperatures ($\\sim 39^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$), the strings exhibited performance ratios of $89.7 \\%$ and $89.1 \\%$ with fill factors of 0.75 and 0.74. Analysis of accumulated dust using SEM-EDS revealed predominantly silica-based particles $\\left(69.5 \\% \\mathrm{SiO}_{2}, 8.9 \\% \\mathrm{Al}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{3}\\right)$, which directly impact light transmission. UV-VIS-NIR spectroscopy showed $42.6 \\%$ reflectance at $\\boldsymbol{\\sim} \\mathbf{8 5 7} \\mathbf{n m}$, critically affecting the spectral response of the silicon cells. Despite this dust accumulation, both strings maintained relatively high voltage ratios (0.81) and current ratios ($0.92-0.93$), with measured power outputs of $\\sim 10.9 \\mathrm{~kW}$ ($90 \\%$ of predicted values). The angular, irregular dust particles observed via SEM microscopy suggest non-uniform deposition patterns that partially explain the minimal degradation in electrical performance despite the challenging tropical environment. These findings highlight how dust particle size, composition, and spectral filtering synergistically contribute to performance degradation. The integration of electrical and material diagnostics offers a comprehensive approach for assessing dust-induced losses and guiding maintenance or mitigation strategies for bifacial PV systems under long-term outdoor exposure."

The core components of LMCnet include explicit illumination enhancement guided by illumination priors, a lightweight multi-head window self-attention module, which together significantly reduce computational overhead.

    "abstract": "Transformer-based MoE models have become mainstream in large language models (LLMs). The core design of the Transformer architecture is the attention mechanism that each input token will calculate the attention values with others. The Mixture of Experts (MoE)-based LLMs was proposed to replace the dense layer in the Transformer with a gate function and several sparsely activated small experts. This design saves the inference cost since only part of the experts are used. However, existing MoE works only use the data features as the input of the gate function; the importance information of attention value is ignored. In this paper, we propose an attention-enhanced mixture of experts (AMoE), a novel transformer-based MoE model. Specifically, we propose a new gate with an integrated attention mechanism, which improves the model’s performance. We conduct comprehensive experiments to support the effectiveness of our proposals."

    "abstract": "Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) play a key role in EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). They offer a high information transfer rate (ITR), require little user training, and resist noise. Recently, many studies have focused on developing SSVEP-based EEG classification systems using CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and hybrid structures. These evaluations usually center on accuracy, ITR, and generalization across different subjects. Some researchers have tried to study this area, but the review papers available usually have a limited viewpoint. They usually emphasize inputs, architectures, or classifications and overlook important performance measures such as accuracy, ITR, and generalization ability. Furthermore, many of these papers are outdated and do not account for recent advancements from 2022 to 2025. They provide general categories without a detailed analysis of methods or architecture. To address these gaps, we present a new survey that includes SSVEP-based EEG classification studies published between 2020 and 2025. This survey focuses on explainable AI (XAI) approaches. Our review looks at current methods and highlights key challenges. These challenges include data efficiency, practical use in the real world, and the development of solutions that don’t require calibration. We also discuss future research directions. We emphasize the need to improve hybrid models, domain adaptation, and interpretable AI to boost both performance and trust in SSVEP-based BCIs."

    "abstract": "Hypoxia represents a significant concern in aviation safety. Numerous studies have examined its impact on cognitive performance and other aspects of human functioning, but only a limited number have addressed its effects on balance, which involves multisensory integration and contributes to postural stability. A PRISMA-based literature search confirmed that evidence in this area remains scarce. Consequently, an experimental study was conducted to investigate the influence of hypoxic conditions on postural stability in pilots. Eleven licensed pilots were exposed to normobaric hypoxia, induced by breathing a reduced-oxygen gas mixture at ambient pressure, simulating an altitude of $4572 \\mathrm{~m}(15000 \\mathrm{ft})$. The experiment involved two simulated flights under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, while postural stability was assessed before, between, and after the flights using a balance board. Several parameters derived from center of pressure (COP) displacement in both one- and two-dimensional analyses were evaluated. Data were analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA (rANOVA) followed by post-hoc testing.The results did not reveal consistent statistically significant effects of hypoxia on postural stability. Significant differences were observed only in mediolateral parameters (SD-ML and ROM-ML) when aggregated across sensory conditions, but no effects were found when conditions were examined individually. Within the limitations of the small sample size, single simulated altitude, and short exposure duration, the study concludes that acute mild hypoxia at $4572 \\mathrm{~m}(15000 \\mathrm{ft})$ does not measurably impair basic postural stability in pilots."

The experimental section investigates differences between the affordable Prusa i3 MK2 printer and the industrial-grade Fortus 450 mc, using a wrist brace model as a test geometry. The model was processed in Stratasys Insight (for the Fortus) and Ultimaker Cura (for the Prusa) software environments. Quantitative parameters such as printing time, material consumption, energy usage, and production cost were systematically compared for three print orientations. Derived indicators-including relative cost, energy efficiency, and material utilization ratios-were calculated to identify key trends. The results demonstrate the contrasting performance and economic profiles of both printers, offering practical insights for users selecting between consumer-level and industrial FDM systems."

The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is systematically developing a regulatory framework that reflects the non-deterministic nature of AI, the limited explainability of models, and the need for so-called continuous assurance throughout the entire system lifecycle. This article analyzes the concept of AI levels, the forthcoming regulatory system Part-AI, its linkage with the EU AI Act, and the strategic objectives defined in the EASA AI Roadmap 2.0. At the same time, it presents selected examples of practical AI applications from the Fly AI Report (2020) and other studies, confirming benefits in areas such as predictive maintenance, flight trajectory management, airport operations, and enhancement of passenger experience. The discussion highlights the need to align technological innovation with regulatory requirements on trustworthiness, explainability, and safety, emphasizing the importance of coordination between EASA, European institutions, and industry. In conclusion, it is argued that the introduction of AI in aviation is feasible only through a gradual, transparent, and rigorously monitored process that maintains the balance between innovation and public trust."

The collection of network and process information is crucial for ensuring operational security and efficiency in these environments. However, resource constraints in Operational Technology (OT) environments make it difficult to implement traditional solutions. While Demilitarized Zones (DMZs) are useful for isolating and securing critical systems, orchestrating them is time and resource-consuming. Moreover, the use of network slicing to orchestrate a dynamic DMZ along with a Federated Learning (FL)-ready OT environment remains underexplored. This paper presents an integrated framework combining Federated Learning (FL), network slicing, and a dynamically provisioned DMZ to enable real-time monitoring and enhanced cybersecurity without disrupting operations. Leveraging digital twin technology and Kubernetes Network Functions (KNFs), the architecture supports predictive analytics, anomaly detection, and Industry 4.0 requirements. Performance evaluations validate the proposed architecture’s efficiency in throughput, deployment speed, and learning accuracy, establishing a robust foundation for future ICS automation and data-driven decision-making."

This paper introduces a framework for assessing resilience using a hybrid network graph of infrastructure systems that merges critical sectors with individual assets and employs scenario-based node removals to mimic cascading disruptions. Critical sectors are identified using eigenvector centrality and PageRank, while Spearman’s rank correlation quantifies disruption to system order under different scenarios, ranging from sector-wide outages to targeted asset failures. The framework is applied to the watershed of an industrial region and its dam network, linked to thirteen abstract critical infrastructure sectors. The method reveals large systemic influence of the Energy sector and identifies high-impact assets. By integrating sector–asset couplings with customizable disruptive scenarios, the framework enables resilience assessments that capture both systemic and localized vulnerabilities. The innovation is to join stress testing of infrastructure networks with system order. The results provide decision-makers with clear indicators for prioritizing mitigation investments and refining contingency plans to enhance the robustness of interdependent infrastructure."

This paper reports an initial intercomparison between these two implementations of GNSS-R altimetry using the GPS L1 C/A raw signals from a stationary experiment. The phase delay and signal power of the reflected signal are analyzed to determine the antenna heights in the way of reflectometry and interferometry, respectively. Altimetry results are shown; the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) of reflectometric retrievals are 1.193 m and 1.433 m, while those of interferometric retrievals are 0.045 m and 0.080 m. With quality control further applied to the phase and power observables, the MAE and RMSE of reflectometric retrievals are 0.377 m and 0.470 m, and those of interferometric retrievals are 0.056 m and 0.082 m. These results indicate that interferometry performs better in terms of altimetry accuracy than reflectometry, and quality control could be applied to improve the accuracy of reflectometric altimetry when the reflected signal is interfered by a direct multipath."

Detailed Analysis and characterization of several design parameters and sensor configurations have been investigated experimentally, such as the width and length of the electrodes and pencil graphite content.

A full Wheatstone bridge configuration has been chosen based on the optimized design parameters. The fabricated structure demonstrated promising results with great sensitivity, high stability, and a wide uniform range from maximum tension to maximum compression. The proposed Full Wheatstone device allows environmental compensation and exhibits a very high gauge factor (GF) of 40.2 for tensile strain and 34.4 for compressive strain for a deflection range of -30 mm to 30 mm. The proposed full, pencil-drawn Wheatstone bridge configuration is cost-effective and easy to fabricate with high sensitivity at 130 mV/V, spanning the entire range of the device. This enables compatibility with standard electronic readout platforms, including microcontrollers, for biomedical sensing, machine–human interfaces, and strain-sensing applications."

Improved imaging results are demonstrated using more realistic subwavelength-focused incident fields compared to conventional approaches. Conventional regularization and nonlinear inversion techniques are used. The impact of the full width at half-maximum and sidelobe level of the subwavelength-focused incident field on image accuracy are investigated to assess the feasibility of using subwavelength-focused fields for quantitative imaging."

First, the theory of mrMIWs is presented, followed by a novel network analysis for first-order, finite-length mrMIWs that allows for rapid design and analysis. The resulting model provides the most accurate analytical prediction of the behavior of real mrMIWs, such as passband ripples, to date. Notably, the adaptability of the model empowers the introduction and accurate modeling of parasitic magnetic coupling, a herein proposed phenomenon wherein the direct magnetic coupling between the transmitting and receiving loops overpowers the magnetoinductive propagation. Figures of merit are then introduced to quantify the performance of mrMIWs as sensors, followed by a study of various possible deformations for mrMIWs. Overall, this paper makes advances in mrMIW theory, empowers rapid design of first-order mrMIWs, and develops the theoretical framework required for the development of sensors based on mrMIWs."

    "abstract": "Color transfer on fabric images has become a prevalent computer-aided tool in the fashion design and textile industry, enabling the automatic generation of simulated recolored images available for computer previews. Many existing variational methods are sourced with color palettes due to their ease to use; however, these approaches are often limited by practical inefficiencies, primarily arising from their reliance on cost-intensive iterative calculations. Moreover, the presence of color bleeding and distortion frequently degenerates the visual quality of their recolored fabric images. In this paper, we propose a novel color transfer variational framework on fabric images that consists of three modules: (1) image decomposition, (2) image segmentation, and (3) image recoloring. The first module constructs a variational Wasserstein optimization to generate independent reflectance and shading images, utilizing outputs from the intrinsic image decomposition network OS-Net for efficient modeling and initialization. Building on the piecewise constant approximation of the reflectance image, the second module formulates a variational model to partition the reflectance image into multiple regions of interest, represented by fuzzy membership functions. For image recoloring, color transfer results are produced by reintegrating the shading image with the recolored reflectance image, modified according to the given color palette. Experiment results demonstrate that, compared to classical fabric color transfer variational methods and recent learning-based approaches, our framework significantly enhances operational efficiency and achieves superior color transfer performance. It effectively eliminates unexpected color bleeding and distortion while preserving the original geometric structures and intricate fabric details in recolored images."

    "abstract": "Remote Sensing (RS) Change Detection (CD), a technique focused on identifying surface alterations from bi-temporal images, holds substantial significance for various applications, such as land management and disaster surveillance. In the last decade, deep learning-based CD methods have advanced rapidly. However, recognizing sporadic distributional changes over time in complex scenes remains a significant challenge. However, many existing solutions rely on large model capacities and high computational costs, yet still fail to incorporate sufficient semantic information for accurately recognizing complex real changes. To tackle this challenge, a lightweight full-information and dual-guide network (Lighter) for RSCD is presented. Specifically, we design a lightweight full-information mingling module (FIMM) that emphasizes the injection of multi-perspective information during the feature interaction. This approach leverages rich semantics as cues to reason about diverse changes. Furthermore, we propose a lightweight dual-guide difference capture module (DDCM), which utilizes the unique information of each guide to teach each other thereby reducing the interference of pseudo-variations. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our lightweight architecture achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with only 1.10M parameters and 2.01G FLOPs. The code will be released upon publication."

    "abstract": "Sea ice recognition is of great significance for reflecting climate change and ensuring ship navigation safety. In recent years, many deep learning-based methods have been proposed and applied to the segmentation and recognition of sea ice regions. However, existing deep learning models often struggle to effectively capture the subtle spectral differences between sea ice and seawater, as well as the large-scale spatial dependencies in high-resolution remote sensing images, resulting in limited segmentation accuracy in areas with ambiguous ice-water boundaries. This paper proposes a red-blue normalized difference index (RB-NDI) guided state space model approach for sea ice segmentation, termed SI-Mamba. In the proposed SI-Mamba, the Index-Guided Collaborative Enhancement (IGCE) module employs an RB-NDI index-guided state space model (SSM) mechanism to overcome the limitations in explicit modeling of spectral features, achieving efficient modeling of long-range spatial dependencies in sea ice distribution. Furthermore, the designed Dynamic Boundary Focus Loss (DBFL) function adjusts the model's expressive capability in edge-sensitive regions through collaborative optimization between the main segmentation head and the index-assisted head. Experiments on multiple generated sea ice datasets demonstrate that the proposed SI-Mamba achieves improved performance in sea ice segmentation and identification in optical remote sensing images. It significantly enhances the accuracy of ice-water boundary recognition and generalization capability in complex scenarios, offering a novel and effective solution for remote sensing based sea ice recognition."

In this context, this work provides novel analytical results for the performance evaluation of multi-carrier systems over fading channels based on the concept of effective SNR, which collapses all per-subcarrier SNRs into a single equivalent SNR that provides the same performance as the full multi-carrier system. A universal model for the statistics of the effective SNR based on analytically tractable expressions and valid for any fading scenario is presented, which can be particularised to specific fading scenarios through the selection of two constant parameters. The proposed modelling approach is exploited to derive novel mathematical expressions that enable a simple, versatile and universal analysis of the performance of multi-carrier systems over fading channels."

Existing approaches based on digital filters induce higher computational burden and alter the system pole locations affecting the inherent characteristics of deadbeat-controlled DABs. Therefore, this letter proposes a novel deadbeat control method with adaptive noise resistance ability for DABs. Instead of digital filters, an adaptive attenuation coefficient is used to efficiently and adaptively mitigate the impact of noises, using a simple structure. Combing with the compensation term derived from the system model, it introduces no steady-state error and preserves the original closed-loop pole locations, thereby maximally retaining the essential features of deadbeat control. Experimental results verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "A quantum sensing monitoring method for discharge signals is proposed based on magnetic field perturbation perception with diamond NV centers (Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers). First, a quantum sensing system integrating optical excitation, microwave drive, and fluorescence signal acquisition was constructed. The quantum state response patterns of NV centers under static and transient magnetic fields were systematically verified by assembling a high-concentration ensemble of NV-center diamond sensing units and an opto-electronically integrated probe combined with excitation sources: permanent magnet constant magnetic field and pulsed current discharge. Experimental results indicate that greater the local magnetic flux density gradient of the probe, or the more uneven the magnetic field distribution, makes it easier to induce the obvious splitting of NV color center energy level. In the absence of external fields, the ODMR spectrum exhibits two shallow resonance peaks. As external magnetic field perturbations intensify, peak depth significantly increases, characterizing enhanced Zeeman splitting of the ground state levels. Simultaneously, despite the time-varying nature of the electromagnetic field induced by pulsed current discharges, the quantum probe stably captures locally perturbed magnetic fields generated by the discharges. The constructed NV-center-based quantum sensing system demonstrates outstanding sensitivity and stability in both static and transient magnetic field detection. This article provides a feasible pathway and technical foundation for quantum monitoring of transient electromagnetic fields during partial discharges in electrical equipment."

    "abstract": "Switched-capacitor (SC) converters are increasingly adopted for their high volumetric power density. However, a comprehensive approach to the systematic synthesis of SC converter topologies remains insufficiently developed. This study presents an equation-based design framework that explicitly represents the dc bias conditions and component interconnections through symbolic topological equations. These equations capture the fundamental principles of SC converter operation, including Kirchhoff's circuit laws and charge balance conditions. Additionally, a set of design constraints is defined to ensure a unique and deterministic solution for charge variables. Building on this foundation, a structured synthesis procedure is presented to generate arbitrary SC converters that achieve specified voltage conversion ratios. The methodology is demonstrated through detailed derivations of a conventional 4:1 Dickson topology and a modified 3:1 FCML topology. As a practical application of the design procedure, three distinct 6:1 converter topologies are developed. One configuration is implemented as a 48V-to-8 V converter prototype, which achieves a peak efficiency of 98.19% and exhibits high-load performance approximately equal to that of the conventional Dickson converter while reducing the volume of passive components by 50%. The experimental results confirm the theoretical validity and practical utility of the proposed analytical framework."

While most SISR models perform similarly on images with simple textures, their differences become more pronounced when handling complex directional textures, which are challenging to reconstruct. In view of this, we propose a Tree Recursive Network (TRN) for SISR that utilizes a tree-shaped topology and a non-local coordinate attention mechanism to capture global directional textures. First, a binary tree residual block is introduced to preserve the attention and residual features without increasing the number of parameters. Second, a non-local coordinate attention mechanism is applied to integrate non-local and directional features to effectively capture global information while reducing computational complexity. Third, a directional attention fusion technique that integrates attention and residual features is presented. Extensive experimental results show that TRN outperforms other models in terms of evaluation metrics such as PSNR and SSIM. Notably, on the ×2 Urban100 dataset, the PSNR of TRN is 0.24 dB higher than that of the popular model CFIN, which highlights its potential and usefulness."

    "abstract": "The Internet of Energy (IoE) is emerging as a key enabler for integrated energy and security management in resource-constrained IoT environments. This convergence offers new opportunities for intelligent and sustainable energy and security operations. However, the inherent computational and energy limitations of IoT devices, combined with the complexity of security configurations, often lead to the neglect of protection mechanisms. The lack of lightweight, adaptable solutions makes standardized security protocols – such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram TLS (DTLS) – unsuitable for large, heterogeneous deployments. Their static and rigid nature causes excessive overhead and limits adaptability under dynamic network conditions. To address these challenges, this article introduces an IoE-enabled architectural vision that tightly integrates energy and security management. In this architecture the IoE Controller (IoE-C) is introduced. It operates as an orchestration layer, leveraging data from energy and security monitoring platforms to dynamically adapt tailored security measures on IoT constrained devices. The Energy and Security aware Index (ESaI) is proposed as a composite metric to evaluate and guide the security-energy trade-off. The proposed paradigm generalizes the concept of dynamic and lightweight security across widely adopted IoT protocols, such as MQTT and CoAP. Evaluation results demonstrate improvements in device lifetime and energy efficiency compared to traditional TLS/DTLS-based solutions, while preserving adequate security guarantees. The framework outlines a scalable and sustainable path for secure IoT deployments in 6G and future energy-intelligent infrastructures."

    "abstract": "The current mainstream research on color-thermal (i.e., RGB-T) object detection assumes that the RGB and thermal images are strictly aligned. However, in practical situations, due to the insufficient spatiotemporal synchronization, stereo disparity of the camera in the installation position, and the errors in the image pairs registration process, the position of the same objects in RGB and thermal images are not completely overlapped. The position shift can cause distortion, trailing, and blurring issues during the image fusion process, leading to a decrease in model detection accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose a novel multiscale graph spatial alignment network (MGSANet), which can effectively alleviate the negative effects of cross-modal image misalignment. Specifically, we represent the feature maps extracted from RGB and thermal images by backbone network as a graph structure, and use graph attention network (GAT) to model the spatial position deviation relationship. Furthermore, considering the multiscale characteristics of the objects, we represent the feature maps with multiscale graphs. We then align RGB and thermal feature maps in a potential feature space according to the learned deviation relationship for object detection. In addition, considering the scarcity of RGB-T datasets from the perspective of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and to verify the object detection performance on different platforms, we construct an RGB-T object detection dataset collected by the UAV platform, named KUSTDrone. We conducted experiments on datasets collected by vehicle and UAV platforms respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that MGSANet outperforms the competitive methods for weakly aligned RGB-T object detection.

Unlike single-layer models, multilayer networks have multiple interacting layers, each with unique topological features. In this article, we generalize previously developed results for distributed optimization in multiplex networks to the more general case of multilayer networks by employing a tensor formalism to represent multilayer networks and their tensor-Laplacian diffusion dynamics. Although multiplex networks are a special case of multilayer networks, where each layer has the same number of replica nodes connected one-to-one, this generalized framework removes the need for replica nodes, allowing variability in both topology and number of nodes across layers. This approach provides a fully generalized structure for distributed optimization in multilayer networks and enables more complex interlayer connections. We derive the multilayer combinatorial Laplacian tensor and extend the distributed gradient descent algorithm. We provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence of algorithms. Numerical examples validate our approach, and we explore the impact of heterogeneous layer topologies and complex interlayer dynamics on consensus time, underscoring their implications for real-world multilayer systems."

We approximate the cascaded end-to-end gain via a Gamma distribution using moment matching, model spatial dependence across FAS ports with a block-correlation structure, and derive an accurate, closed-form approximation for the outage probability using Gauss–Chebyshev quadrature. Extensive simulations show that the proposed Gamma-based analysis markedly outperforms CLT-based baselines-especially for small numbers of RIS elements and ports-while converging to them as the array grows. The results provide actionable guidance for V2X design and dimensioning under practical constraints on RIS size, FAS aperture, and channel correlation."

Further, our results show that preprocessing significantly enhances forecasting accuracy while multi-step prediction achieves comparable accuracy results to single-step benchmarks. Our framework’s ability to handle extended forecasting horizons with reduced computational overhead highlights its practicality for real-world application, such as adaptive traffic control and logistics planning.

    "abstract": "Neck muscle weakness causes the inability to raise and move the head, leading to fatigue, neck pain, and a “head-on-chest” posture (dropped head syndrome) in severe cases, which significantly affects quality of life. Static neck collars are the current standard of care. However, these collars are passive, which cannot restore the head-neck movement necessary for daily tasks. Emerging robotic devices like powered neck exoskeletons were developed to enable head-neck movements. Previous laboratory tests showed improved patients’ ability to follow prescribed trajectories; however, the ability to assist with daily tasks of such a robotic device remains unknown. In this paper, the functional range of motion allowed by a state-of-the-art powered neck exoskeleton was compared to a clinic-standard static neck collar in healthy adults performing simulated daily tasks wearing these devices. Results showed a greater head range of motion and consequently less compensatory torso movements while wearing the neck exoskeleton in its transparent mode. Participants rated the neck exoskeleton more favorably than the static collar in terms of comfort and ability to perform the tasks. Results also revealed the range of motion limits of the current neck exoskeleton for these daily tasks. These results provided justifications for using neck exoskeletons to restore daily functions and offered critical insights into future refinement of this technology to enable head range of motion for critical daily activities."

    "abstract": "Experiments on dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) for electric vehicles (EVs) typically require vast testing grounds and significant costs, making them difficult to implement. As a solution, experimental systems utilizing rotational motion for DWPT have been proposed. However, few such systems have been developed and their design methods and fundamental characteristics remain unclear. This paper presents the construction of a rotation-type experimental system for DWPT and discusses its design methodology and basic characteristics. In developing the prototype, mechanical stability was verified through simulations analyzing stress and critical rotational speed of the rotating components. A sector-shaped transmitter coil, suitable for this system, was designed and analyzed using electromagnetic field simulations, confirming similar characteristics to conventional linear-rail-based systems. Furthermore, the effects of misalignment between transmitter and receiver coils and the electrical characteristics of slip rings and brushes were evaluated. Finally, power transfer characteristics were validated through experiments at a linear velocity equivalent of 40 km/h and 3.3 kW power transfer."

    "abstract": "Accurate driving risk prediction is essential for preventing traffic accidents, particularly in complex mountain tunnel environments where conventional assessment methods often fall short. This study presents a novel approach for quantifying and predicting driving risk under multi-vehicle interactions scenarios. A weighted comprehensive risk matrix is constructed by integrating Time-to-Collision (TTC) and Interaction Strength (IS), taking into account the behavior of surrounding vehicles. Arisk representation framework centered on the ego vehicle and a multi-level risk classification scheme are proposed. To capture the spatial and temporal dynamics of driving risk, a hybrid deep learning model is proposed, combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and Attention mechanisms. The model was validated using real-world trajectory data from six mountain tunnels in Chongqing, China. The model achieved prediction accuracies of 83% in car-following and 76% in lane-changing scenarios, outperforming traditional methods. The proposed model significantly enhances the identification and prediction of abnormal driving behaviors under highly interaction conditions, offering a valuable tool to improve intelligent driving safety in mountain tunnels."

    "abstract": "Task-Oriented Semantic Communication (TOSC) has been regarded as a promising communication framework, serving for various Artificial Intelligence (AI) task driven applications. The existing TOSC frameworks focus on extracting the full semantic features of source data and learning low-dimensional channel inputs to transmit them within limited bandwidth resources. Although transmitting full semantic features can preserve the integrity of data meaning, this approach does not attain the performance threshold of the TOSC. In this paper, we propose a Task-oriented Adaptive Semantic Communication (TasCom) framework to effectively facilitate the inference of different AI tasks. Based on the Generative AI (GAI) techniques, we first propose a Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) that which only extracts and fuses task-related semantic features, and then transmits them to achieve efficient task-oriented semantic transmission. Then, we propose a generative training algorithm to train the proposed JSCC for optimal performance. Furthermore, an Adaptive Coding Controller (ACC) is proposed to find the optimal coding scheme for the proposed JSCC, which allows the semantic features with significant contributions to the task inference to preferentially occupy limited bandwidth resources for wireless transmission. The simulation results show that the proposed TasCom outperforms the existing TOSC and traditional codec schemes on the object detection and instance segmentation tasks under all considered channel conditions."

    "abstract": "Long-range (LoRa) technology has emerged as a promising solution for Internet of Things applications due to its low power consumption and long communication range. However, its pure ALOHA-based MAC layer leads to severe packet collisions as the network scale expands, significantly degrading the system energy efficiency (EE). While careful allocation of transmission parameters such as channel (CH), transmission power (TP), and spreading factor (SF) could mitigate this issue, the complex interference patterns in multi-gateway scenarios and the time-consuming nature of EE evaluation pose significant challenges. Therefore, we propose an analytical model to calculate the system EE while fully considering the impacts of multiple gateways, duty cycling, quasi-orthogonal SFs and capture effects. Based on this model, we formulate a joint CH, SF, and TP allocation problem to optimize the system EE. To solve this NP-hard optimization problem, we decompose it into CH assignment and SF/TP assignment subproblems. A two-phase optimization framework is then designed. In the first phase, a matching-based algorithm is designed for CH assignment. In the second phase, a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach that incorporates a two-stage attention mechanism and graph convolutional networks is proposed for SF/TP assignment, which effectively captures and weights inter-ED interactions in multi-gateway scenarios. Simulation results indicate that the proposed approach well-suited for complex multi-GW LoRa network topologies and outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms."

The proposed framework enables computational complexity to scale polylogarithmically with the system dimension demonstrating the potential of quantum algorithms to enhance classical optimization routines in nonlinear control applications."

    "abstract": "Continuous operation of the transformer will result in a decline in the quality of the transformer’s insulating oil. One of the parameters that can be used as an indicator of the decline in transformer oil quality is the increase in the content of corrosive sulfur compounds, where this condition is a significant factor contributing to internal transformer damage. This study aims to develop a model to predict future values for the corrosive sulfur categories in transformer oil using long-term historical test data (2010-2023). The Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm was developed and systematically compared with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Random Forest (RF), and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model to evaluate their ability to model temporal degradation behavior. The experimental results showed that the LSTM model achieved the highest performance, with an accuracy of 0.83 and an F1 score of 0.83, outperforming GRU (0.67), RF (0.15) and SARIMA (0.54). The LSTM achieved the highest accuracy (0.83) and the F1 score (0.83), confirming its ability to capture long-term dependencies. Unlike previous studies that focused on dissolved gas analysis (DGA), this work introduces the first LSTM-based framework that uses ASTM D130 data to forecast transformer oil corrosion."

However, the intermittent nature of renewable generation and its dependence on inverter-based interfaces pose significant challenges for microgrid frequency control strategies. This paper proposes a novel Long Short-term Memory (LSTM)-based Model-Free Predictive Control (LSTM-MFPC) scheme that explicitly considers both the lookback window and prediction horizon in its design. The proposed controller is employed to regulate microgrid frequency under sudden irradiance fluctuations, which lead to abrupt changes in photovoltaic (PV) output. The method is validated using a Controller-Hardware-in-the-Loop (CHIL) simulation implemented on an OPAL-RT real-time digital simulator in conjunction with a Jetson edge device. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms conventional controllers, such as PI controllers, traditional Model Predictive Controllers (MPCs), and basic multilayer perceptron-based MFPCs (MLP-MFPCs)."

The modern gantry crane exhibits nonlinear dynamics and significant load oscillations during motion, which pose challenges for precise positioning and operational safety. The objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of both control approaches in reducing pendulum oscillations, minimizing settling time, and improving overall system response. A dynamic model of a modern crane system is developed and simulated by using MATLAB/Simulink environment, incorporating test scenarios such as target position changes and external disturbances. Simulation results indicate that the FLC with the Mamdani-Sugeno technique offers superior performance under nonlinear and uncertain conditions, while the PID controller performs effectively in stable, deterministic environments. This study provides insights into selecting appropriate control strategies for modern crane system design."

Statistically, feature or variable selection produces a parsimonious/simple model but with optimal performance. Feature selection in ML can be performed using logistic regression, among other methods. Statistically, logistic regression for survey data with complex designs differs from naïve logistic regression, in which data are assumed to be randomly sampled. This study models the classification of poor households using the 2023 Susenas data, comprising 341,082 households and 28 features. The methods used were boosting methods (Gradient Boosting, LightGBM, CatBoost, and XGBoost). The results indicate a class imbalance that must be addressed. In this study, SMOTE was used to address this issue. The results of the statistical testing (Kruskal-Wallis test) showed significant differences between SMOTE and non-SMOTE in the boosting model. Additionally, feature selection yielded different results compared to non-feature selection. LightGBM, CatBoost, and XGBoost outperformed Gradient Boosting in classifying poor households in Indonesia. Overall, the F1-score in the Boosting model was 0.779 with feature selection."

The immutable nature of blockchain conflicts with the requirement for data deletion, creating a fundamental tension between technological capabilities and regulatory compliance. This paper presents a novel cryptographic audit framework for implementing GDPR-compliant data erasure in configurable tokenization systems. Our approach leverages cryptographic key destruction, zero-knowledge proofs for audit trails, and automated smart contract mechanisms to achieve practical data deletion while preserving blockchain immutability. The framework introduces a triple-layer architecture separating on-chain and off-chain references from off-chain sensitive data, enabling verifiable data erasure through cryptographic “shredding” techniques. We demonstrate the framework’s effectiveness through detailed algorithms and present a proof of concept comprehensive audit mechanism that generates cryptographic proofs of successful data deletion without revealing sensitive information. Our solution addresses critical gaps in current blockchain privacy implementations and provides a practical pathway for regulatory compliance in tokenization ecosystems."

    "abstract": "This paper leverages an Input-Output methodology to develop an algorithmic framework designed to address supply chain challenges that arise when domestic production is expanded—particularly in the context of recent U.S. policies aimed at achieving energy independence and dominance. Beyond analyzing historical trends, the proposed tool generates forward-looking metrics that support strategic decision-making. Additionally, it introduces two indicators— MS1 and MS2—that quantify the effectiveness of import substitution efforts over time and in response to changes in output. These metrics are embedded within a broader algorithm that integrates macroeconomic data, sectoral interdependencies, and trade dynamics to assess the feasibility and impact of industrial policy interventions. By doing so, the tool not only evaluates past performance but also enables scenario-based forecasting and investment planning.Our contribution is twofold. First, we propose a systematic methodology to categorize industrial sectors into four strategic roles: boosters, non-boosters, strategical pivots, and non-strategical pivots. This classification enables the identification of key sectors that are critical to the supply chains of other industries and the whole industrial sector. Second, we apply this framework to construct an ordinal vector of industrial sectors that highlights leverage points for strengthening domestic energy production and reducing reliance on imported components.By integrating policy analysis, input-output modeling, and techno-economic evaluation, This approach provides policymakers and industry stakeholders with a robust, data-driven foundation for designing strategies that strengthen domestic supply chains, reduce reliance on foreign inputs, and align with national energy security objectives."

Based on the analysis results, we optimized the SPICE model to provide clearer results and formulated the conditions for the timely triggering of the GDT. Two different types of exposure and two meander line (ML)-based structures were considered. It was demonstrated how the first pulse from the output of the lines primes the GDT for triggering, with subsequent pulses being suppressed by the device. Despite the fact that in this case the first pulse (which primes the GDT) propagates further and is not attenuated, its amplitude is still lower than that of the original pulse. This is important for reducing the heating of sensitive elements in radio-electronic equipment. In this scenario, the maximum ultra-wideband (UWB) pulse attenuation in structures 1 and 2 was 25 and 44 times, respectively. Additionally, we considered the case where the GDT was connected at the input of the line and found that this connection is preferable for maximum UWB pulse suppression. Specifically, the maximum UWB pulse attenuation in structures 1 and 2 was 102 and 143 times, respectively. As a result, the attenuation of UWB pulses at the output of the ML with the GDT was increased, compared to the ML alone."

This is a puzzling observation, as theory predicts that greater model capacity should eventually lead to overfitting – yet this is rarely seen in practice. But what if overfitting does occur, not globally, but in specific sub-regions of the data space? In this work, we introduce a novel score that measures the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">forgetting rate</i> of deep models on validation data, capturing what we term <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">local overfitting:</i> a performance degradation confined to certain regions of the input space. We demonstrate that local overfitting can arise even without conventional overfitting, and is closely linked to the double descent phenomenon. Building on these insights, we introduce a two-stage approach that leverages the training history of a single model to recover and retain forgotten knowledge: first, by aggregating checkpoints into an ensemble, and then by distilling it into a single model of the original size, thus enhancing performance without added inference cost. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, modern architectures, and training regimes validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, in the presence of label noise, our method – <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Knowledge Fusion</i> followed by <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Knowledge Distillation</i> – outperforms both the original model and independently trained ensembles, achieving a rare win-win scenario: reduced training and inference complexity."

    "abstract": "Accurate detection of active fires (AF) is crucial for improving estimates of biomass burning emissions and environmental management. Satellite remote sensing at shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands with 10-30m spatial resolution has a great potential in identifying the numerous small active fires missed by fire-monitoring systems using coarse spatial resolution data, but is challenging due to heterogeneous backgrounds and multiple interferences. By combing enhanced threshold method and abundant prior information, we developed a generalized and robust fire detection algorithm using the daytime Sentinel-2 SWIR observations over complex surfaces in China. To discriminate with high reflecting surface targets such as rooftop and solar panels, more thresholds with visible and SWIR bands along with land cover datasets are utilized. Moreover, industrial thermal anomalies are excluded by time series satellite images. Validations of Sentinel-2 AF detection through visual inspection show very low commission rates (<1-3%) over selected regions of the world. Since burnt areas in fire boundaries with higher temperature than backgrounds were taken as AFs, the average omission rates increase to ~3-4%. A maximum omission rate of ~7-8% occurs in African grassland, which has a short burning time. Despite consistent spatial patterns, 1 km MODIS and 375 m VIIRS detections performed in the medium infrared bands missed more than 90% of Sentinel-2 AFs. With the flexible framework, our method also has robust performance in similar Landsat 8/9 SWIR observations. By combing Sentinel-2 2B/2C and Landsat 8/9 observations, our reliable AF detection at fine scales (20-30 m) can provide a significant supplement for the biomass burning emission estimation with a temporal resolution of 2-3 days."

    "abstract": "This article presents a robust control strategy for formation enclosing and tracking of a dynamic target by a group of two-wheeled mobile robots under network control. Reference trajectories are designed to enable the robots to encircle and follow the target while meeting motion and field-of-view constraints. An event-triggered nonsingular terminal sliding mode controller is then proposed, where a specific class of scalar functions defines a novel sliding surface that ensures finite-time convergence in the presence of matched disturbances and avoids singularity. An event-triggered mechanism determines control signal transmissions and is adapted to handle communication delays, ensuring closed-loop stability while reducing communication load. The proposed method is validated through experiments on a multi-robot triangular formation tracking task, demonstrating its applicability and effectiveness in practical networked scenarios."

    "abstract": "Salient object detection from optical remote sensing images seeks to detect and segment out objects that stand out visually by mimicking human interpretation. Accurately detecting salient objects in remote sensing imagery is hindered by the broad variability in object appearances and background complexity. Despite recent advancements, there exist two major challenges. Firstly, it remains unclear how to fuse shallow features with deep features optimally. Secondly, defining an optimal strategy for multi-scale feature processing is crucial, as patterns can vary significantly across different levels. We introduce a novel bidirectional attention mechanism to tackle these challenges. Our framework features: (1) a Parallel Convolution-Channel Attention (PCCA) module that boosts edge representation and highlights salient feature channels, and (2) a Holistic Reverse Attention (HRA) module that preserves crucial details in high-level features. Coupled with a multiscale progressive decoder, our method enables precise feature integration. Extensive evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrates the superiority of our proposed model compared with 17 state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, achieving a significant 11.57% reduction in Mean Absolute Error and setting a new state-of-the-art on S-measure with a 0.4% improvement."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel framework for low-latency frequency division duplex (FDD) multi-input multi-output (MIMO) transmission with Internet of Things (IoT) communications. Our key idea is eliminating feedback associated with downlink channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) acquisition. Instead, we propose to reconstruct downlink CSIT from uplink reference signals by exploiting the frequency invariance property of channel parameters. Nonetheless, the frequency disparity between the uplink and downlink makes it impossible to get perfect downlink CSIT, resulting in substantial interference. To address this, we formulate a max-min fairness problem and propose a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-aided efficient precoding method. In particular, to fully harness the potential benefits of RSMA, we propose a method that approximates the error covariance matrix and incorporates it into the precoder optimization process. This approach effectively accounts for the impact of imperfect CSIT, enabling the design of a robust precoder that efficiently handles CSIT inaccuracies. Simulation results demonstrate that our framework outperforms other baseline methods in terms of the minimum spectral efficiency when no direct CSI feedback is used. Moreover, we show that our framework significantly reduces communication latency compared to conventional CSI feedback-based methods, underscoring its effectiveness in enhancing latency performance for IoT communications."

This article presents a deep learning method based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) for synthesizing sparse arrays. With predefined constraints such as aperture size, number of elements, and minimum element spacing, a training dataset that enables the proposed DDPM is generated to directly learn the distribution characteristics of these sparse arrays. To simplify the network architecture, the backbone network U-Net is replaced by a multilayer perceptron (MLP). In addition, an innovative conditional generation strategy is introduced to enhance the training accuracy, categorizing the training data into diverse cross-conditional labels based on PSLL and sparse ratio. During the training process, two separate regression networks are employed to predict the sparse ratio and the PSLL, and a Pareto-optimal weighting scheme (PWS) is designed to address the trade-off between them. Examples of two planar sparse arrays and a conformal sparse array demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DDPM-based method, highlighting its superiority in reducing PSLL and increasing sparse ratio, reducing inference time compared with the existing methods."

    "abstract": "With the development of industrial intelligence, deep learning-based soft sensors are widely used in complex industrial systems to estimate key quality variables in real-time, with long short-term memory (LSTM) networks excelling in nonlinear dynamic modeling. However, conventional LSTM networks face the challenge of redundant memory weight allocation, which hinders efficient capture of critical temporal dependencies. Moreover, the probability distribution of industrial process variables often exhibits dynamic temporal shifts, significantly deteriorating model generalization performance. In this study, a novel long short-term complementary memory network based on temporal distribution matching (TDM-LSTCM) is proposed for product quality prediction in industrial processes. First, a novel memory update rate gate is designed based on LSTM to obtain adaptive update rate factors for different time steps, regulating the information flow rate. Second, the memory update rate gate is embedded into the input and forget gates, leading to the development of a complementary input-forget regulation gate structure to optimize the cell state update mechanism. Furthermore, the TDM algorithm is incorporated into the training process through a dual-stage optimization strategy. During the distribution characterization stage, the training dataset is partitioned into distinct periods with the most pronounced distributional discrepancies. In the distribution matching stage, cross-period discrepancies in hidden states are minimized to facilitate the extraction of common information. Finally, the proposed methodology is validated through a penicillin fermentation process and flue gas desulfurization system. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed approach outperforms other modeling methods, showcasing its promising application potential."

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) bridges the gap between the physical and digital worlds, enabling seamless interaction with real-world objects via the Internet. However, IoT systems face significant challenges in ensuring efficient data generation, collection, and management, particularly due to the resource-constrained and unreliable nature of connected devices, which can lead to data loss. This paper presents DRACO (Data Replication and Collection), a framework that integrates a distributed hop-by-hop data replication approach with a routing-free mobile sink-based data collection strategy. DRACO enhances data availability, optimizes replica placement, and ensures efficient data retrieval even under node failures and varying network densities. Extensive ns-3 simulations demonstrate that DRACO outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, improving data availability by up to 15% and 34%, and replica creation by up to 18% and 40%, compared to greedy and random replication techniques, respectively. DRACO also ensures efficient data dissemination through optimized replica distribution and achieves superior data collection efficiency under varying node densities and failure scenarios as compared to commonly used uncontrolled sink mobility approaches namely random walk and self-avoiding random walk. By addressing key IoT data management challenges, DRACO offers a scalable and resilient solution well-suited for emerging use cases including industrial IoT device monitoring, smart city environmental sensing, agricultural IoT data collection, and disaster response networks, where maintaining data availability under device failures or intermittent connectivity is critical."

Unlike conventional model-based controllers, the proposed method learns optimal charging strategies through interaction with a virtualized electro-thermal environment, enabling adaptability to nonlinear battery dynamics and stochastic user behavior. The charging problem is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process, and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is employed to learn adaptive control strategies. A hybrid two-stage learning structure is designed, combining indirect reinforcement learning in simulation for safe policy acquisition and direct learning for real-world adaptability. A multi-objective reward function is developed to reflect user-specific trade-offs among charging efficiency, charging time, and target SoC achievement, while safety constraints are embedded through penalty terms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DRL controller achieves faster convergence, improved charging efficiency, and stronger constraint satisfaction compared to the conventional constant current – constant voltage (CC–CV) and model predictive control (MPC) benchmarks."

    "abstract": "Synchronous reluctance motors (SynRMs), which are characterized by the absence of permanent magnets and rotor windings, have garnered significant attention in recent years. A notable characteristic of SynRMs is the substantial variation in the inductances $L_{d}$ and $L_{q}$ along the d and q axes, which is influenced by magnetic saturation and the current flowing through each axis. Furthermore, cross-coupling interference occurs, where $L_{d}$ varies with the q-axis current, and $L_{q}$ varies with the d-axis current. Therefore, errors in motor parameters owing to variations in $L_{d}$ and $L_{q}$ influence the position sensorless control. To address these challenges, we propose a novel position sensorless control technique that leverages a SynRM model to estimate the high-frequency extended EMF generated by superposing high-frequency currents at low speeds. In this approach, when the circular superposition method, which superimposes high-frequency currents on both the d and q axes, is employed, the position estimation error converges even if a significant discrepancy exists between the actual and set values of $L_{q}$ of the SynRM model. By implementing this method and calibrating $L_{d}$ within the SynRM model to ensure convergence of the position estimation error, $L_{d}$ can be measured regardless of the variation in $L_{q}$. This paper presents experimental results that demonstrate the efficacy of this approach. In this study, we leverage this advantage to demonstrate that our method for measuring $L_{d}$, while considering cross-coupling interference yields highly valuable experimental results."

It is achieved by introducing a zero-power transfer period within the SPS waveform, during which power transfer is actively canceled. It enables to reduce the net transferred power while maintaining a constant repetitive frequency. This method does not change the magnetic flux and field in the transformer from that by the conventional single phase shift (SPS); therefore, audible acoustic noise from the transformer core, it can be a problem when the load is varying periodically, can potentially be suppressed. The effectiveness of the proposed method was experimentally verified using a 3.3 kW DAB converter with 3.3 kV SiC-MOSFETs."

Transient analyses under double-pulse test conditions successfully reproduce the current imbalance in experiments, with rise time and fall time showing good agreement between simulation and measurement (errors within 0.9-5.2 %). Furthermore, the simulation environment enables the evaluation of countermeasures using an active gate driver with individually tuned waveforms. The agreement between simulation and measurement validates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The aim of the research is to investigate the content of a service engineer job with the help of cognitive modeling using the agricultural and industrial complex as a case study. It includes building a cognitive model and its analysis to identify functionally important factors using simulation modeling. Methods: to realize the aim the development of cognitive model variants has been built in the form of sign graphs, the vertices of which being the concepts of a subject field (factors) and the curves being the causal relations between them. The estimate of factor interactions is made with the help of simplicial analysis and simulation experiment series. The results of the research show that the set of factors influencing on the job of a service engineer such as “resource planning”, “economic thinking”, “readiness to learn”, experience”, “remoteness of service centers” are functionally important for this profession. These factors recognized by the experts should be considered by management administrations when making managerial decisions."

The agents in the formation system are represented using dual quaternion parameterized kinematics in the configuration space, such that a control strategy is designed to achieve the simultaneous attitude synchronization and position consensus to a target reference trajectory. The control strategy is formulated based on a distributed leader follower formation architecture, with a static configuration modelled using graph theory. The goal of the formation system is to ensure the convergence and tracking of attitude trajectory of the leader agent by the followers agents, while maintaining a preset desired formation shape between the agents. Numerical simulations have been presented using four homogeneous rigid bodies, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control configuration in the consensus based formation acquisition and maintenance."

Traditional industrial Ethernet and fieldbus technologies can achieve deterministic transmission through dedicated protocols, yet wireless communication still faces instability in industrial scenarios. Although 5G networks possess potential advantages in low latency and high reliability, their performance in industrial closed-loop control has not been systematically validated. To address this gap, this paper designs and implements a 5G network test platform tailored for industrial closed-loop control. The platform is constructed based on an end-edge-cloud collaborative architecture, ensuring consistency between the plant and actual industrial processes. On this platform, a digital twin model is integrated with the control system and 5G network to conduct closed-loop control experiments over 5G transmission, followed by a comparative analysis of the network’s impact on control performance. The results demonstrate that the proposed platform can effectively replicate industrial control processes, providing a verification method for assessing the applicability of 5G networks in closed-loop control. Furthermore, it establishes an experimental foundation for future network protocol optimization and industrial adoption."

We employed the Soft Actor-Critic(SAC) algorithm for learning and conducted evaluation experiments on the Donkey Simulator under six different conditions, combining the with or without self-aligning torque, the the with or without steering angle observation, and the output format for force or angle. Agents with self-aligning torque consistently achieved faster lap times across all conditions compared to agents without it. This demonstrates their contribution to stability and performance. This study suggests potential applicability not only in simulators but also for future real-world autonomous driving on low-friction surfaces."

As data space initiatives evolve, personalized recommendations are increasingly recognized as key use cases. However, traditional recommendation approaches typically rely on centralized aggregation of user behavior data-directly conflicting with the core ethos of data spaces: sovereignty, privacy, and trust. Federated recommendation systems offer a promising alternative by training models locally and exchanging only intermediate parameters to build a global model. Despite this potential, the integration of federated recommendation techniques and data space architectures remains largely underexplored in research and practice. This paper addresses this gap by designing and evaluating a prototype of a federated recommendation system specifically tailored for data spaces and compliant with their underlying infrastructure. Our findings highlight the viability of developing privacy-preserving, collaborative recommendation systems within data spaces, and contribute to the broader adoption of AI across these emerging ecosystems."

It has a better noise immunity than using the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), which is easily affected by noise. The proposed sensing method can get more precise feedback value when the reference ground of microcontroller is interfered. This paper introduces the operation of the eCAP module and provides a detailed description of the sensing circuit design process. Additionally, the method for reconstructing the actual current from the signals obtained by the eCAP is presented. Simulation results obtained from the PLECS software and experimental results using the Texas Instruments LAUNCHXL-F28379D as the microcontroller are presented for validation.

This dataset was created to be used as part of the Computational Hearing in Multisource Environments (CHiME) 9 Challenge, Task 2 (ECHI), which aims at developing systems to extract and enhance speech from the conversation partners, i.e. removing the background noise using audio from microphone signals of hearing aids or Project Aria smart glasses. This dataset can be used to both train and evaluate the performance of neural-network or signal-processing-based speech enhancement algorithms, and it was created due to the lack of datasets of conversational speech in noisy environments with clean reference audio. Groups of four people were seated around a table, surrounded by loudspeakers which played interfering speech, cafeteria-style sounds and ambient background noise. Participants were instructed to have conversations guided by provided conversation prompts. Each participant also recorded a reading of the first paragraph of the rainbow passage as a clean sample of their voice, which may be used by a speech enhancement system to extract their speech from the noisy mixture. This dataset contains 29 hours of audio from 194 participants."

In this article, we propose a novel multifeature fusion algorithm based on bathymetry and backscatter intensity data acquired by a multibeam bathymetry system. To address the challenge of the limited availability of labeled samples, a sample enhancement algorithm is proposed to effectively expand the data set while preserving sample consistency. To improve the feature expression ability of single-source data, we extract various texture features from the backscatter intensity data using the gray-level co-occurrence matrix, while different topographic features are derived from the bathymetry data. Given the high dimensionality and redundancy of these features, the random forest algorithm is employed to quantify feature importance, and a feature selection method is proposed based on importance ranking. Experimental results demonstrate that the selected feature combination achieves higher classification accuracy and stronger feature expression ability. By integrating the sample enhancement and multifeature fusion algorithms, the random forest model attains a classification accuracy of 96.73% on real data. This work establishes a viable framework for seabed sediment classification by leveraging the sample enhancement and multifeature fusion."

The proposed architecture employs substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) technology with slot feeding, fabricated using the standard printed circuit board (PCB) process. It is seamlessly integrated into a silicon wafer through advanced heterogeneous integration technique to facilitate accurate antenna measurement. A benzocyclobutene (BCB)-based coplanar waveguide with ground (CPWG) to PCB-based SIW transition is designed to ensure effective interconnection and probe measurement. The microbump operates in a quasi-TM₁₀ mode, while the slot resonates in a half-wavelength mode, with both modes closely aligned in frequency and exhibiting strong mutual coupling. Furthermore, the dual microbumps act as electric dipoles, coupling with the slot’s magnetic response to form a hybrid configuration that significantly enhances bandwidth. Remarkably, the design achieves high performance despite utilizing cost-effective but lossy FR-4 substrate, which is typically suboptimal for millimeter-wave (mmWave) applications. Compared to conventional slot antenna, the proposed design exhibits significant improvements: impedance bandwidth increases from 5.9% to 42.8%, radiation efficiency from 57.8% to 71.6%, and maximum realized gain from 4.95 dBi to 8.54 dBi. These advancements make the antenna an excellent candidate for highly integrated antenna-in-package (AiP) solutions on FR-4 substrate."

Meanwhile, the number of parameters of CNN-biGRU-A-P is reduced by 93.2% compared to the traditional Deep-CNN.

    "abstract": "Hydrocarbon steam reforming (HSR) is widely employed in refineries for hydrogen production, where carbon monoxide (CO) concentration serves as a critical indicator of carbon emission intensity. However, accurately estimating CO concentration in real time remains a challenge due to the limited labeled data and poor data quality. To address these issues, a digital twin-guided soft sensor with dual spatial attention (DTDSA) is proposed. Firstly, a digital twin model is developed to produce pseudo-labels by mechanism simulator, alleviating the shortage of labeled data while embedding domain knowledge to guide subsequent feature extraction. Secondly, a novel dual spatial attention stacked quality-autoencoder (DSA-SQAE) model is proposed to dynamically capture critical features, thereby improving robustness against poor data quality. Specifically, an input spatial attention layer is designed to extract informative features across layers, while a gated spatial attention layer is incorporated to capture multi-level features and model complex spatial dependencies. Furthermore, a real-virtual-supervised training strategy is incorporated to enhance the extraction of critical features from both real and simulated data. Finally, experimental results from a real HSR case demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves CO concentration prediction accuracy."

    "abstract": "Data collected from multiple sensors contains rich fault information for bearing fault diagnosis. However, it is difficult to leverage these joint information due to the following reasons: (1) signals from different channels often have asynchronous sampling lengths, which can greatly hinder subsequent processing; (2) unpaired frequency transformations can lead to significant algorithmic degradation; and (3) handling multi-channel data simultaneously can be quite time-consuming. To solve above three challenges, in this paper, we newly propose a multi-channel sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) based approach for bearing fault diagnosis. The key innovations are: (1) extend the existing sparse frequency learning model into multi-channel form, accommodating variable-length signals across different channels; (2) identify the fault frequencies from the signal envelopes without any frequency transformations by leveraging the common sparsity of the fault frequencies-of-interest in the frequency domain; and (3) construct a real-valued data model with a special unitary matrix, and integrate the generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) method into the Bayesian framework to enhance the fault detection performance while reducing computational complexity. Since the message passing has the property of element-wise operation and can provide exact marginal posteriors, the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance with low-complexity. Both simulation and real datasets can demonstrate it."

    "abstract": "The crux of data disclosure lies in the meticulous quantification and judicious trade-off between privacy leakage and utility. Firstly, the measurement of privacy leakage is the premise of sensitive data compliance disclosure. Existing solutions are mainly based on the qualitative perspective and the group perspective, which are unable to quantitatively measure the risk of individual privacy leakage. Secondly, in terms of balancing privacy leakage and utility, existing solutions overlook uninformed disclosure scenarios. In such scenarios, the two-dimensional privacy-utility game will be reduced to the optimization of a single parameter of mutual information. To address the aforementioned drawbacks, this paper proposes a data disclosure mechanism tailored for heterogeneous privacy profiles. Specifically, we decouple the multilevel privacy leakage through mutual information. By respectively addressing the informed and uninformed disclosure, we achieve the optimization of the joint potential energy surface of privacy and utility, breaking through the dilemma of excessive protection and utility collapse in data disclosure. On this basis, we conduct a comprehensive discussion on the two data disclosure strategies, namely introducing disturbance and linear obfuscation. The results of extensive simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism. Finally, our work shows that balancing privacy and utility in data disclosure is unfeasible with disturbance-introducing strategies. In contrast, using linear obfuscation strategies can achieve such a balance, and the optimal approach is the disclosure scheme that minimizes the data disclosure loss."

    "abstract": "Glaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness, remains challenging to diagnose due to its asymptomatic progression. Traditional diagnostic methods require high-resolution fundus imaging and specialized expertise, limiting their feasibility for widespread screening, particularly in resource-limited areas, such as rural regions and remote mountainous areas in China. To address this issue, we propose U-Net-Segformer, a glaucoma screening framework designed to enhance segmentation accuracy for low-quality images and mitigate performance degradation across datasets. The model achieved Dice coefficients of 91.01% and 97.50% for optic cup (OC) segmentation and 89.39% and 96.50% for optic disc (OD) segmentation on the Drishti-GS and REFUGE datasets, with absolute cup-to-disc ratio errors of 3.13% and 3.76%, respectively. By integrating U-Net-Segformer with portable fundus imaging devices and cloud-based AI analysis, we developed an intelligent, mobile glaucoma screening system capable of real-time diagnosis. The system features a user-friendly mobile terminal that enables fundus image capture anywhere, with cloud-based processing for real-time screening results. This approach addresses the shortage of glaucoma screening resources in primary care and remote areas. Extensive evaluations on public and self-collected datasets from partner hospitals demonstrated a 94% accuracy rate, confirming the system’s effectiveness and clinical applicability."

    "abstract": "Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a cornerstone of precision health, enabling personalized health management through the continuous monitoring of daily activities and behavioral patterns. Many existing HAR methods prioritize advancing feature extraction architectures while often overlooking the detrimental impact of inherent data noise. This oversight can compromise feature integrity and, consequently, degrade recognition accuracy. To address this limitation, we introduce the Multimodal Uncertainty Fusion Network (MUFNet), a novel framework that integrates skeleton and RGB data streams. A key innovation of MUFNet is the Feature Uncertainty Enhancement Module (FUEM), which models feature reliability by learning a class-aligned Gaussian distribution. This allows the model to stochastically identify and amplify robust feature channels, thereby enhancing feature resilience to noise. Concurrently, a Dynamic Temporal Convolution (DTC) module employs learnable continuous offsets to adeptly capture actions of varying temporal dynamics, including those that are rapid or irregular. Our approach fuses features from multiple skeleton modalities (3D joint, 3D bone, and 2D joint) with spatiotemporal region-of-interest (ST-ROI) features extracted from RGB frames, where the latter is guided by the 2D skeleton structure. Comprehensive evaluations on three public multimodal HAR benchmarks— NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and Northwestern-UCLA—validate the superiority of MUFNet. Our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracies of 95.6% (X-Sub) / 98.9% (X-View) on NTU RGB+D 60, 91.3% (X-Sub) / 92.9% (X-Set) on NTU RGB+D 120, and 95.3% on Northwestern-UCLA.

    "abstract": "The digital economy is profoundly reshaping rural societies, leading to new patterns of interaction, organization, and development. Predicting rural social structures under this transformation requires methods capable of modeling complex relational data. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based framework for rural social structure prediction. Our method constructs heterogeneous graphs where individuals, households, and organizations are represented as nodes, and their economic, social, and digital interactions are represented as edges. We design a relation-aware message passing mechanism to integrate multi-source attributes, including demographic features, communication records, and digital economy participation. Furthermore, a temporal extension is introduced to capture the evolving dynamics of rural communities over time. To validate our approach, we conduct experiments on real-world rural datasets collected from multiple provinces, consisting of household survey data, mobile communication logs, and e-commerce activity. Experimental results show that our method achieves significant improvements over traditional baselines such as logistic regression, random forests, and standard GNN variants. Specifically, the proposed model reaches an average overall prediction accuracy of 92.3%. These results demonstrate that our framework effectively captures both structural dependencies and temporal dynamics, offering new insights into rural social structure analysis and providing technical support for digital inclusion and rural governance strategies."

    "abstract": "Along with motor dysfunction, people with Parkinson’s Disease (PD) often develop cognitive dysfunction, linked to the gait abnormality - freezing of gait (FOG). Spatial navigation in Virtual Reality Floor Mazes (VR-FM) provides a unique framework for studying the effects of cognitive load on walking, with the ability to manipulate the complexity of the cognitive load. In addition, mazes include turns which simulate indoor home environments that people with PD frequently traverse in their daily life. This study is aimed to examine the effects of increasing cognitive load, applied with VR-FM, on motor performance in PD subjects with and without FOG. This is particularly important in understanding Parkinson’s Disease, as cognitive decline is a strong contributor to morbidity and mortality as the disease progresses and may be a contributing factor to FOG. Fourteen subjects with PD, including eight who exhibited FOG, completed VR-FM under three conditions: (i) Control mazes where the path to the goal is displayed, (ii) Easy mazes with two or less decision points, (iii) Hard mazes, with more than two decision points. In comparison to non-freezers, freezers took fewer spin steps, shorter and slower strides, and reduced medial-lateral sway of the center of mass. These deficits became worse with maze difficulty, accompanied by further degradation in balance measured by margin of stability. Increased cognitive load imposed by the VR-FM led to gait deterioration and a prioritization for balance in both freezers and non-freezers. This supports the use of VR-FM as a tool to investigate motor-cognitive interplay in PD. Freezers exhibit more pronounced deterioration in gait and balance in VR-FM. Hence, VR-FM can serve as a potential tool to characterize and identify freezers."

    "abstract": "As two mainstream frameworks in federated learning (FL), both centralized and decentralized approaches have shown great application value in practical scenarios. However, existing studies do not provide sufficient evidence and clear guidance for analysis of which performs better in the FL community. Although decentralized methods have been proven to approach the comparable convergence of centralized with less communication, their test performance always falls short of expectations in empirical studies. To comprehensively and fairly compare their efficiency gaps in FL, in this paper, we explore their stability and generalization efficiency. Specifically, we prove that on the general smooth non-convex objectives, 1) centralized FL (CFL) always generalizes better than decentralized FL (DFL); 2) CFL achieves the best performance via adopting partial participation instead of full participation; and, 3) there is a necessary requirement for the topology in DFL to avoid performance collapse as the training scale increases. We also conduct extensive experiments on several common setups in FL to validate that our theoretical analysis is consistent with experimental phenomena and contextually valid in several general and practical scenarios."

    "abstract": "The Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2), equipped with the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) system, uses a 532 nm laser to measure global surface elevations and enable spaceborne nearshore bathymetry. The main challenge in ATLAS-based bathymetry is accurately distinguishing water-surface and seafloor photons from diverse environmental datasets. This is particularly difficult due to the strong attenuation of laser signals in water, contamination from sun glint and subsurface backscattering, and the sparse distribution of bottom-return photons in turbid coastal waters. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel bathymetric method based on the adaptive-bandwidth mean shift filtering method (AMFM). This method adaptively determines bandwidth parameters via k-nearest neighbors to identify surface/seafloor photon clustering centers, reconstructs wave and seabed topography using B-splines for automatic photon extraction, and performs refraction correction to ensure bathymetric accuracy. The bathymetric results were highly accurate, with slope, coefficient of determination (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</i><sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>), and root mean square error (RMSE) values reaching 0.98, 0.98, and 0.47 m, respectively. AMFM achieved high accuracy and full adaptivity photon filtering for ATLAS dataset. The shift bandwidth can adaptively change based on the data distribution to adjust the cluster shape and quantity, which is robust for detecting noise and outliers. Additionally, numerous experiments were performed with various ATLAS datasets covering areas around the South China Sea, Atlantic Ocean, and Pacific Ocean. This method, which includes curve fitting in postprocessing, is suitable for photon datasets with various spatial distributions and densities. Finally, based on the methods’ ability to search for the cluster center and detect local density maxima, photon datasets can be separated into several intervals in the along-track direction to achieve segment handling. Using multithreading technology, AMFM achieved high calculation efficiency and adaptively detected signal photons, thereby providing a powerful solution for processing massive amounts of ATLAS data."

Specifically, we improve the widely adopted binary-swap algorithm by compressing intermediate images with strict pixel-wise error bounds. We propose a per-pixel error-bound model tailored to each communication request in the binary-swap algorithm to control the compositing error. We derive a per-round error bound based on the color and opacity of each intermediate pixel during compositing. Our algorithm also uses a dynamic strategy that balances compression and communication cost, deciding whether to compress based on network latency, bandwidth, and compressor performance. Our method significantly improves the frame rate for in situ rendering, demonstrating notable performance improvements in frame rate. We evaluate our algorithm through an end-to-end GPU-based parallel volume rendering pipeline using a GPU-accelerated renderer and compressor, integrated with CUDA-aware MPI. We demonstrate scalability with up to 512 GPUs on the Perlmutter supercomputer."

The experiment used BDSBAS measured data from the 333rd and 334th days of 2024 (B1C frequency point, PRN 1 to 32 satellites) to simulate extreme scenarios where the broadcast frequency was compressed from 6s to 60s, and compared the performance of LSTM and linear extrapolation models. The results show that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the LSTM model is 0.0314m, which is better than the linear model (0.1527m). The research has verified the high-precision prediction ability of LSTM in low-frequency broadcast scenarios, providing technical support for BDSBAS to integrate authentication messages and optimize message architecture, and helping to improve the autonomous controllability and service security of the Beidou Navigation System."

Under the proposed approach, the stability of the closed-loop system is theoretically guaranteed through mathematical proof based on the Lyapunov theorem. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach are demonstrated through comparative simulations under different operating scenarios."

    "abstract": "In this paper, a recursive terminal back-stepping sliding-mode (RTBS) controller is proposed to provide a high-precision and high-speed performance for the Electro-hydraulic Actuator (EHA) system. For the controller, a terminal sliding manifold with an integral sliding function is integrated into the traditional back-stepping control strategy in a recursive structure that the sliding surface reaches the stable point successfully and robustly and remains stable under varies disturbances and uncertainties. The system’s stability, proved by Lyapunov theory, guarantees the robustness of the proposed controller when applying on such high-order system. The effectiveness of the controller is then verified via numbers of simulations in comparison to the conventional back-stepping sliding mode control framework which shows a significant improvement in the control accuracy of tracking errors and the ability of ignoring system disturbances."

The system employs the virtual resistance droop control method for parallel operation, which enables proportional load sharing according to inverter capacities without requiring a dedicated instantaneous communication. The T-type three-level topology is adopted, offering advantages such as reduced component count, high efficiency, and lower output voltage total harmonic distortion (THD). For modulation method, a variant of carrier-based PWM (CBPWM) is utilized. Compared with the space vector PWM (SVPWM), CBPWM offers simpler implementation since it does not require space vector position determination, while still achieving high voltage utilization. To validate the proposed approach, two 6 kW inverters were developed and tested, confirming feasibility of the design."

Traditional multi-source inverter systems typically require two-stage power conversion and employ Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation for power flow control, which is often complex and computationally intensive. To eliminate the complexity, a three-phase, threelevel dual-port inverter is proposed, allowing two independent DC sources to connect and enabling single-stage power conversion using a common negative bus. A Carrier-Based Pulse Width Modulation technique is adopted to simplify modulation and facilitate directional power regulation. The power-sharing ratio between two DC sources can be precisely adjusted through this method. The proposed concept is validated through both simulation and Hardware-in-the-Loop testing."

This paper proposes a three-phase LLC resonant converter with integrated phase-shedding control to address key issues in conventional LLC converters, such as large output current ripple and poor efficiency under light-load conditions. The proposed converter is comprehensively designed, simulated, and experimentally implemented. The proposed three-phase LLC resonant converter with phase-shedding control operates at input voltage of 400 V, within output voltage range of 280 V to 410 V, and a maximum output power of 2000 W. According to experimental results, the converter maintains an efficiency above 90% across the full load range, with a peak efficiency reaching 97.38%, The novelty of this work lies in the implementation of the controlled high-impedance interval, which fundamentally enables reliable and efficient phase-shedding operation."

While existing literature extensively examines microgrid resilience under static failure scenarios, limited research addresses the dynamic coordination of distributed energy storage systems (DESS) across networked microgrids during evolving damage and recovery conditions. This study proposes a comprehensive resilience-oriented optimization framework that integrates tornado event modeling with multitimescale mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) for coordinated DESS operation in networked microgrids. The framework employs a rolling-horizon approach to capture real-time damage progression, asynchronous component repairs, and renewable generation uncertainty, enabling adaptive storage coordination strategies that minimize load curtailment while preserving critical reserves. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed coordinated DESS operation enhances critical load continuity, reduces system-wide curtailment, and accelerates recovery trajectories under diverse tornado scenarios. The framework provides a scalable platform for resilience-enhanced planning in distribution networks facing escalating climate-induced disruptions."

The purpose of this research is to evaluate student satisfaction with data packages using logistic regression and KNN algorithms for comparison of the two algorithms. A total of 812 data were collected through questionnaires both manually and digitally via Google Forms. The areas where the data was obtained are located in the eastern part of Manatuto district, the central part of Dili district, Aileu, and the western part of Liquisa district. Data processing was carried out with preprocessing, normalization, and label encoding as a response to missing data to ensure model robustness and data consistency. Logistic regression is used for classification of client satisfaction levels and successfully achieved the highest accuracy of 96.34%. In comparison, the KNN algorithm achieved an accuracy of 79.27%, which is why logistic regression has higher accuracy than KNN. This evaluation highlights that internet speed, service reliability, and affordable pricing for students, where internet speed shows a reliable correlation. The model’s capability can also be well produced and minimizes overfitting. The results of this study provide important lessons for telecommunications service providers and can improve the offerings from service providers to meet the digital needs of students in Timor-Leste.

Although many studies have been conducted on these techniques’ space vector modulation version, less attention has been paid to the carrier-based version, which is practically superior. This paper presents carrier-based implementation of the aforementioned techniques. Besides, it compares their performance regarding output power quality, control complexity, circulating current, and common mode voltage variation.

To mitigate these risks, lending protocols have integrated automated risk management tools into their smart contracts. However, the effectiveness of the latest risk management features introduced in the most recent versions of these lending protocols is understudied. To close this gap, we use a panel regression fixed effects model to empirically analyse the cross-version (v2 and v3) and cross-chain (L1 and L2) effectiveness of liquidation mechanisms, measured through TVL and total revenue as proxies for performance of the two most popular lending protocols, Aave and Compound, during the period Jan 2021 to Dec 2024. Our analysis reveals that liquidation events in v3 of both protocols lead to an increase in total value locked and total revenue, with stronger impact on the L2 blockchain compared to L1. In contrast, liquidations in v2 have an insignificant impact, which indicates that the most recent v3 protocols have better risk management than the earlier v2 protocols. We also show that L1 blockchains are the preferred choice among large investors for their robust liquidity and ecosystem depth, while L2 blockchains are more popular among retail investors for their lower fees and faster execution."

    "abstract": "Critical infrastructure systems are increasingly vulnerable to a range of threats. However, resilience assessments often fall short of capturing the complexity of multi-sector dynamics and the cascading impacts of these disruptions. To address this gap, this paper introduces an approach for Integrated Metrics for system Performance, Attributes, and Critical Threats (IMPACT). The IMPACT framework provides a structured method for resilience analysis by integrating three core components: (1) threat representations, which characterize chronic and acute threats by their origin and occurrence patterns; (2) system attributes, which assess inherent system qualities from a multi-sector dimension (e.g., built infrastructure, environmental, regional dynamics); and (3) performance outcomes, which capture cascading effects and recovery interdependencies across multiple sectors. In addition to explicitly representing multiple dimensions of import, the IMPACT framework enables integration of both traditional and multi-disciplinary metrics to advance resilience insights. Using a case study of the Colorado River Basin in Texas, we demonstrate the value of the IMPACT framework for revealing insights about the frequency and persistence of a drought-related threat as well as system attributes of water rights and sectoral demands that contribute to variations in water shortages, ultimately influencing the overall performance of the system. Additional work is needed to evaluate the utility of the IMPACT framework to other critical infrastructure systems, especially across regions and compounded threats. By linking threats, attributes, and outcomes, the IMPACT framework supports a more holistic understanding of risk and resilience in critical infrastructure systems across sectors."

    "abstract": "Sebira Island is one of the outermost small islands within the administrative region of DKI Jakarta and it remains unconnected to the main electricity grid due to the absence of an undersea cable. Limited electricity availability, high operational costs of fossil fuel consumption and geographical constraints highlight the urgent need for a more efficient and sustainable energy system. This study aims to evaluate and optimize the configuration of Sebira Island’s hybrid microgrid by comparing three energy dispatch strategies: Load Following (LF), Cycle Charging (CC) and Combined Dispatch (CD). The analysis is based on several key indicators, including Net Present Cost (NPC), Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE), annual carbon emissions, operation and maintenance (O&M) costs and land requirements for each strategy. The results indicate that the CD strategy delivers the most optimal performance, achieving the lowest NPC and LCOE at ${\\$}$4,777,391 and ${\\$}$0.219/kWh respectively, along with the lowest annual carbon emissions of $608,049 \\mathrm{~kg}$. However, the CD strategy requires an additional land area of $1,972.42 \\mathrm{~m}^{2}$, which exceeds the available space of only $776 \\mathrm{~m}^{2}$. In contrast, the CC and LF strategies remain within the land constraints but offer slightly lower energy and economic efficiency. Therefore, while CD is the most technically and environmentally favorable strategy, its implementation would require additional solutions such as rooftop PV installations, multi-tier panel mounting systems or land expansion. This study is expected to serve as a valuable reference for the development of hybrid microgrid systems in other island or remote regions of Indonesia that face similar challenges in achieving reliable, environmentally friendly and sustainable energy access."

This eliminates voltage drops across gate resistors, enabling accurate, temperature-compensated sensing of the gate voltage $V_{\\mathrm{GE}}$, which correlates with $I_{\\mathrm{L}}$. A track-and-hold circuit captures the Miller plateau voltage as a DC signal, suitable for digitization using a low-speed analog-to-digital converter. A physics-based polynomial fitting model using the known junction temperature $T_{\\mathrm{J}}$ allows accurate $I_{\\mathrm{L}}$ estimation with only ten calibration points. The proposed sensor circuit integrated into gate driver IC is fabricated using a $\\mathbf{1 8 0}-\\mathbf{n m}$ BCD process, achieving a compact IC chip size of $2.0 \\mathrm{~mm} \\times 2.5 \\mathrm{~mm}$, with the sensor circuit occupying only $\\mathbf{7 0 0} \\mu \\mathbf{m} \\times \\mathbf{5 0 0} \\mu \\mathbf{m}$. Experimental validation through 600 V double-pulse tests using a $1,200 \\mathrm{~V}$, 100 A IGBT module confirms $I_{\\mathrm{L}}$ estimation from 10 A to 80 A at $T_{\\mathrm{J}}$ ranges from $25^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ to $\\mathbf{1 2 5}^{\\circ} \\mathbf{C}$, with an estimation error of up to 8.27 A."

    "abstract": "Accurate thermal field prediction is the cornerstone of thermal design of high-frequency transformer (HFT). The leakage flux induced power loss (LFPL), which includes leakage flux eddy current loss (LFECL) and leakage flux core loss (LFCL), can increase the hotspot temperature of nanocrystalline core HFT. This paper proposes a coupled thermal field prediction method for nanocrystalline core HFT considering LFPL and analyzes the thermal field characteristics. Firstly, the LFPL density distributions in nanocrystalline core are analyzed with finite element method, demonstrating high LFPL density on surface ribbons. Then, a coupled thermal field prediction method for nanocrystalline core HFT considering LFPL is proposed. The total thermal field is calculated by summation of thermal fields with LFECL, LFCL, and main flux core loss and winding loss. The thermal fields with LFPL are calculated with unidirectional magnetic-thermal coupled method, in which LFPL densities are calculated by proposed equivalent frequency domain simulation method and coupled to Heat Transfer module. The temperature dependences of power losses are considered for high-accuracy thermal field prediction. With the proposed method, the temperature calculation errors are reduced to below 3°C. Finally, the thermal field characteristics are analyzed. Finite element simulation results show that hotspot temperatures will be greatly increased by LFPL. The proposed method can help improve the thermal design of nanocrystalline core HFT."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning framework that utilizes the data and computing power of local devices to optimize a common objective. While effective, this paradigm suffers from significant communication overhead, impacting overall training efficiency. To mitigate this, prior works have explored compression techniques such as weight quantization in the weight exchange process. This leads to clients employing different quantization levels based on their hardware or network constraints, necessitating a mixed-precision aggregation process at the server. This introduces additional challenges, exacerbating client drift and leading to performance degradation. In this work, we propose FedShift, a novel aggregation methodology designed to mitigate performance degradation in FL scenarios with mixed quantization levels. FedShift employs a statistical matching mechanism based on weight shifting to align mixed-precision models, thereby reducing model divergence and addressing quantization-induced bias. Our approach functions as an add-on to existing FL optimization algorithms, enhancing their robustness and improving convergence. We provide both empirical results that demonstrate that FedShift effectively mitigates the negative impact of mixed-precision aggregation, yielding superior performance across various FL benchmarks, and a theoretical analysis that shows the guarantee of convergence to the optimum with the FedShift algorithm."

    "abstract": "Decentralized Finance (DeFi) promises to lay ground for a more open financial system enabled by blockchain technology. Therein, stablecoins have recently gained momentum as regulated and trusted payment instruments, increasingly adopted for cross-border transactions and supported by initiatives such as the GENIUS Act in the U.S. and the European MiCAR framework. While stablecoins create the foundation of trust for linking DeFi with traditional finance, the ecosystem still depends heavily on cryptocurrency markets due to limited real-world asset integration. Existing research largely focuses on traditional securities and tradable assets, but scant attention has been paid to one of the world’s largest asset classes, real estate. To address this gap, we propose a framework for the tokenization of real estate for integration into the DeFi ecosystem. Using the Design Science Research (DSR) approach, we construct and evaluate our framework through expert interviews and smart contract simulations. The simulations validate technical feasibility and demonstrate efficiency gains, with batch transfers reducing transaction costs for portfolio purchases. Building on these evaluations, we derive design principles for the nascent field of real-world asset tokenization. These principles highlight the importance of covering the entire product range, pursuing end-to-end compliance, leveraging token standards for interoperability, and extending their functionality for efficiency and scalability. By combining regulatory, organizational, and technical perspectives, our work advances design knowledge for compliant integration of real-world assets into DeFi."

    "abstract": "As the pivot to understand the property of the whole graph, substructure extraction plays an essential role in graph representation learning. Following a “convolution + pooling” paradigm, recent progress mainly relies on cluster pooling to achieve substructure compression. However, it suffers from high complexity caused by dense implementation and poor effectiveness resulting from rigid node assignment. Besides, the separating design of the universally adopted paradigm leads to substantial redundancy of model architecture and underutilization of convolution capability. To overcome the above dilemmas, in this paper, we propose GAS, a sparsely implemented graph representation learning model that can adaptively discover critical substructures in a flexible manner through a simplified paradigm. Specifically, GAS reformulates substructure construction from a dense node assignment problem to a sparse node absorbing problem, reducing complexity by eliminating dense assignment and complex matrix multiplication. Besides, we propose an adaptive absorbing strategy to overcome the suboptimality caused by rigidity. It allows multi-substructure compatibility for high-influential nodes while single-substructure qualification for low-influential nodes, making a leap in the flexible division of substructures with better local clarity. In addition, theoretical analysis provides evidence that a simplified paradigm with merely convolutional operation is adequate for reinforced efficiency and intensive substructure extracting quality. To this end, we design AConv layer, which empowers convolution operation with substructure construction capability, leading to a simplified graph representation learning paradigm without extra pooling layers. Extensive experiments on graph classification and molecular property prediction tasks demonstrate a significant improvement of GAS with an average performance gain of 8.77% and 4.65% compared with SOTA competitors. Investigation of parameter size and training time quantifies the superiority of GAS with high efficiency and tractability for large-scale graphs. Ablation study confirms the necessity of the adaptive node absorbing strategy. A visualization further demonstrates the advantage of the method."

    "abstract": "Accurate identification of tomato leaf diseases is essential for improving crop health management and reducing agricultural losses. However, the wide variety of tomato diseases, the limited availability of real-world datasets, and the variability of agricultural environments make developing reliable and explainable tomato disease identification systems challenging. Traditional deep learning models trained on controlled datasets often fail to generalize in real-world farm environments due to complex backgrounds and variations in illumination and image conditions. This paper presents a hierarchical, multi-stage framework that integrates leaf detection, segmentation, and classification with interpretability to achieve robust and explainable disease identification. The proposed pipeline employs YOLO11 for leaf detection, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for segmentation, a ResNet-50 classifier, and LIME interpretability. To evaluate the impact of the pipeline on robustness and generalization, we conducted cross-domain experiments in two settings, using PlantVillage for laboratory conditions and PlantDoc for real-world conditions. The proposed pipeline improved real-world accuracy from 22.79 % with a flat ResNet-50 to 55.33 %, cutting the accuracy drop by 34.0 %. The pipeline stages focused on leaf isolation to ensure that predictions are driven by symptomatic tissue rather than background. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization and transparency, addressing major gaps in existing plant disease identification systems."

Experimental results show that, compared to conventional non-deep learning methods, the proposed approach achieves a 7.5 dB improvement in bit error rate (BER). Moreover, in comparison with the point-by-point pre-equalization algorithm reported in Ref. 7, the proposed approach attains BER performance approaching that of an orthogonal transmission system while reducing computational complexity by 46.31%.

This combination reduces the number of evaluated switching vectors per sampling period from 16 to 8, resulting in a 43% reduction in computational effort. When the zero component of the grid current is considered, the number of tested vectors can be reduced to just 4, without affecting control performance. This results in a total reduction of 67% compared to the standard approach. Simulations and experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

However, its practical deployment remains severely limited by hardware-induced noise and decoherence. In the absence of full fault tolerance, Quantum Error Mitigation (QEM) techniques offer a viable approach to enhance QAOA performance on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we present a unified classification of QEM strategies specifically tailored for QAOA, systematically categorized into preprocessing, during execution, and post-processing phases. We further classify QAOA deployment settings—such as hardware-constrained devices, stochastic noise-dominated environments, and dense graphs problem—and recommend appropriate QEM techniques for each. A comparative analysis highlights the trade-offs among mitigation accuracy, resource overhead, and robustness to different noise types. By synthesizing recent advances and identifying open challenges, our paper provides both a comprehensive survey and a practical framework for designing robust, noise-resilient QAOA pipelines on near-term quantum platforms."

First, we model the initial dataset as a two-level encoding tree and categorize the data vertices into distinct density partitions according to the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">information uncertainty</i> determined in the encoding tree. Each partition is then assigned to an agent to find the best clustering parameters without manual assistance. The allocation is density-adaptive, enabling AR-DBSCAN to effectively handle diverse density distributions within the dataset by utilizing distinct agents for different partitions. Second, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning guided automatic parameter searching process is designed. The process of adjusting the parameter search direction by perceiving the clustering environment is modeled as a Markov decision process. Using a weakly-supervised reward training policy network, each agent adaptively learns the optimal clustering parameters by interacting with the clusters. Third, a recursive search mechanism adaptable to the data's scale is presented, enabling efficient and controlled exploration of large parameter spaces. Extensive experiments are conducted on nine artificial datasets and a real-world dataset. The results of offline and online tasks show that AR-DBSCAN not only improves clustering accuracy by up to 144.1% and 175.3% in the Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) and the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) metrics, respectively, but also is capable of robustly finding dominant parameters."

    "abstract": "In autonomous vehicles (AVs), optimization-based coordinated control of multiple actuators entails a substantial computational burden. Moreover, the complexity of driving scenarios makes the design of observers for unmeasurable states particularly challenging. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a physics-informed long short-term memory (PI-LSTM) network that learns a mapping from historical onboard sensor data to control actions within a physics-guided framework. Specifically, the PI-LSTM forms an integrated architecture that unifies state estimation and motion control. The upstream LSTM estimator infers unobservable vehicle states from measurable sensor signals, and its outputs are explicitly propagated to the downstream LSTM-based model predictive control (MPC) solver, which is trained within a physics-informed framework that incorporates discrete-time vehicle dynamics, constraints, and cost functions to compute optimal control actions over a finite prediction horizon. By embedding physics-based priors and preserving explicit signal pathways, the interpretability, robustness, and generalization of PI-LSTM in safety-critical applications such as chassis control are enhanced. Extensive co-simulations and real vehicle experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves closed-loop control performance by more than 5% compared with baseline methods, while achieving real-time inference at 100 Hz on embedded vehicle controllers. This work highlights the potential of hybrid data- and physics-driven approaches for advancing state estimation and motion control in AVs."

The group maintenance model is governed by a two-phase scheduling framework: from tentative component age determination to dynamic system group clustering. We provide structural insights into the optimality of system maintenance timing through penalty analysis. Leveraging these findings, we design an efficient heuristic grouping algorithm that transforms the long-term maintenance planning problem into short-term group selection problems, significantly streamlining computational efforts and allowing for adaptive refinement. Comparative experiments on phased-array radar systems demonstrate substantial improvements over existing policies."

Wide-bandgap semiconductors such as GaN and SiC enable steep voltage transitions and switching frequencies far beyond those of traditional silicon devices, significantly improving efficiency and power density yet also increasing conducted electromagnetic disturbances. In this framework, developing innovative EMI-filter solutions is essential, since effectively suppressing common-mode (CM) noise at low frequencies often makes traditional passive filters too heavy and bulky for the strict size, weight, and efficiency constraints required in the automotive, aerospace, and industrial automation sectors. A promising approach is offered by active EMI filters, which sense the disturbance and inject a compensating waveform aimed at cancelling the noise at its source. Among them, digital-based solutions stand out for their flexibility and ability to adapt to dynamic operating conditions. However, they face an inherent limitation related to the delay introduced by the signal-processing chain, as even small time misalignments between the noise and the compensating waveform may impair filter performance."

A modular architecture has been developed for estimation of an instrument’s tooltip pose from video frames acquired during laparoscopic training. Our method incorporates a GPU-based algorithm that takes input from a customized deep learning model (YOLOv7), detects the edges of the surgical instrument, and computes tooltip’s 3D pose. Additionally, an automated 3D-pose dataset generation technique is introduced to generate datasets for training the model. Our method was evaluated using a vision-based tracking experiment, achieving 3D positional errors of 0.72 mm, 0.88 mm, and 3.81 mm over the X, Y, and Z-axes, and an orientation error of 5.65° with an end-to-end latency of 144 ms and sustained real-time throughput of 11.4 frames per second (fps). The proposed method enables accurate estimation of laparoscopic instrument tooltip poses without the need for additional hardware or markers. This work represents a significant step toward automated skill assessment in laparoscopic training using box trainers."

    "abstract": "AI-native 6G networks are envisioned to tightly embed artificial intelligence (AI) into the wireless ecosystem, enabling real-time, personalized, and privacy-preserving intelligence at the edge. A foundational pillar of this vision is federated learning (FL), which allows distributed model training across devices without sharing raw data. However, implementing classical FL methods faces several bottlenecks in heterogeneous dynamic wireless networks, including limited device compute capacity, unreliable connectivity, intermittent communications, and vulnerability to model security and data privacy breaches. This article investigates the integration of quantum federated learning (QFL) into AI-native 6G networks, forming a transformative paradigm capable of overcoming these challenges. By leveraging quantum techniques across computing, communication, and cryptography within FL workflows, QFL offers new capabilities along three key dimensions: (i) edge intelligence, (ii) network optimization, and (iii) security and privacy, which are studied in this work. We further present a case study demonstrating that a QFL framework employing the quantum approximate optimization algorithm outperforms classical methods in model convergence. We conclude the paper by identifying practical challenges facing QFL deployment, such as quantum state fragility, incompatibility with classical protocols, and hardware constraints, and then outline key research directions toward its scalable real-world adoption."

Vision-centric Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has emerged as a trendy 3D perception paradigm due to its compatibility with task properties, low cost, and rich visual cues. Despite impressive results, current approaches inevitably suffer from problems such as depth errors or depth ambiguities during the 2D-to-3D transformation process. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we first introduce an Optical Flow-Guided (OFG) Depth-Net that leverages the strengths of pretrained depth estimation models, while incorporating optical flow images to improve depth prediction accuracy in regions with significant depth changes. Then, we propose a depth ambiguity-mitigated feature lifting strategy that implements deformable cross-attention in 3D pixel space to avoid depth ambiguities caused by the projection process from 3D to 2D and further enhances the effectiveness of feature updating through the utilization of prior mask indices. Moreover, we customize two subnetworks: a residual voxel network and a sparse UNet, to enhance the network’s geometric prediction capabilities and ensure consistent semantic reasoning across varying scales. By doing so, our method achieves performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods on the SemanticKITTI, SSCBench-KITTI-360 and Occ3D-nuScene benchmarks."

    "abstract": "Diagnosing bearing faults, which are the most critical and frequent type of fault that can lead to other faults in rotating electrical machines, has been a challenge for engineers and researchers in recent years. Several deep learning methods have been proposed to detect bearing faults with high accuracy. However, the practical implementation of these models must be considered. Two significant challenges in the real-world execution of these methods are: (a) theoretical methods often have many parameters, making them heavy-weighted and slow, and (b) environmental noise is another significant issue that effects accuracy of detection. In deep learning, vision transformers (ViT) have gained popularity among researchers in computer vision tasks. Unlike CNNs, which learn local features, ViTs can learn global representations. However, ViTs are heavier than CNNs. To tackle the challenges in the practical implementation of bearing fault detection and leverage the advantages of both ViT and CNN, the MobileViT, a lightweight and mobile-friendly vision transformer, is utilized for bearing fault detection for the first time in literature. This paper evaluates various types of bearing faults and fault severities in multi-level loads. To achieve this, 1-D vibration signals from CWRU dataset were converted to 2-D time-frequency image samples using continuous wavelet transformation. MobileViT was trained on time-frequency images to learn representative features and classify them. To consider the noise condition, the model's performance in the range of -4 to 4 signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was investigated. The proposed approach was also validated on real bearing damages from the Paderborn dataset to assess generalization capability. The results are compared with other methods and demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method."

Finally, some numerical examples are presented to validate the excellent performance of the new estimator and to verify the accuracy of the CLT."

    "abstract": "Milling of hardened carbon steels like SKD11 generates complex physical interactions that can affect tool wear, surface quality, and process stability. This study presents a multiphysics experimental approach aimed at better understanding these physical interactions. The first objective is to monitor key features in real-time, including cutting force, vibration, cutting temperature, and sound signal, during the milling process. An integrated setup involving infrared thermography and thermocouples, a piezoelectric dynamometer, sound and vibration emission sensors was used, and data were collected under two different cutting conditions. The second measurement objective is to inspect the end-of-process features such as surface quality, tool wear, and chip formation. Tool wear was measured by different methods at the end of the cut in order to show the strong correlation between cutting forces, temperature, sound signal, and vibration patterns of the machining process. The results of this study are focused mainly on the design approach rather than on detailed numerical details. The tooth-passing frequency analyzed from the cutting-force signal was correlated with the sound signal. Cutting strategies affect the surface quality under the same cutting conditions. This work provides guidance on eliminating redundant measurements for multiphysics investigations of the milling process, and accounts for all features, in contrast to previous experimental studies. Besides those findings, there are some issues that need to be improved, such as repositioning the thermocouples, elongating the cutting path to inspect the tool state and surface quality; more cutting conditions should also be applied."

The accuracy of multi - task classification is not high. In this article, a method of multi-scale feature fusion is proposed for feature extraction. For task classification, an improved Transformer model with an adaptive attention mechanism is proposed. A dynamic gating mechanism is embedded to adaptively calibrate the self-attention weights, achieving selective enhancement of key features and suppression of noise information. The improved model was compared with other classifiers via 5×5 cross-validation and leave-one-out cross-validation. Additionally, ablation experiments were conducted by removing specific features. The results show that the model’s performance is superior to other classifiers, and the highest accuracy is achieved in both validation methods. The ablation experiments demonstrate that the classification performance of the integrated features is better, with an accuracy rate of up to 77.97%."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising framework for privacy-preserving machine learning. FL enables distributed data owners (clients) to collaboratively train a global model without sharing their local data with a central server. However, FL is inherently vulnerable to free-rider and poisoning attacks, where free riders dissimulate their participation of training by sending counterfeit yet harmless model updates to the central server, while adversarial clients send poisonous model updates to the server to degrade the global model performance. Their distinctive attacking patterns make the simultaneous defense against both attacks very challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a novel model-agnostic Shapley value-based robust and fair federated learning method (SVRFL), which models FL as a cooperative game and leverages Shapley values of model updates to defend against free riders and adversarial clients. Specifically, a client reputation score and a model utility score are computed using the Shapley value. Based on these scores, we ensure the basic fairness within FL by identifying and eliminating free riders, and realize adversarial robustness through discarding poisonous model updates, with theoretical convergence guaranteed. Extensive experiments show that SVRFL can detect typical free-rider attacks with up to full precision and is resistant to poisoning attacks launched by adversarial clients."

    "abstract": "With rich temporal-spatial information, video-based person re-identification methods have shown broad prospects. Although tracklets can be easily obtained with ready-made tracking models, annotating identities is still expensive and impractical. Therefore, some video-based methods propose using only a few identity annotations or camera labels to facilitate feature learning. They also simply average the frame features of each tracklet, overlooking unexpected variations and inherent identity consistency within tracklets. In this paper, we propose the Self-Supervised Refined Clustering (SSR-C) framework without relying on any annotation or auxiliary information to promote unsupervised video person re-identification. Specifically, we first propose the Noise-Filtered Tracklet Partition (NFTP) module to reduce the feature bias of tracklets caused by noisy tracking results, and sequentially partition the noise-filtered tracklets into “sub-tracklets”. Then, we cluster and further merge sub-tracklets using the self-supervised signal from the tracklet partition, which is enhanced through a progressive strategy to generate reliable pseudo labels, facilitating intra-class cross-tracklet aggregation. Moreover, we propose the Class Smoothing Classification (CSC) loss to efficiently promote model learning. Extensive experiments on the MARS and DukeMTMC-VideoReID datasets demonstrate that our proposed SSR-C for unsupervised video person re-identification achieves state-of-the-art results and is comparable to advanced supervised methods."

This paper proposes a non-coupled, high-gain bidirectional DC-DC converter designed to address these limitations. The proposed converter operates boost mode in one power flow direction and buck mode in reverse power flow direction, optimizing performance across a wider range of operating conditions. The converter’s design is based on the integration of a modified bidirectional SEPIC converter topology with an active switched inductor (ASL) at the front end. This results in a simplified circuit architecture and control strategy, requiring fewer components while effectively minimizing voltage stress on most switches. Additionally, SiC MOSFET is implemented to enhance the efficiency of the proposed topology. The converter is rated for 250 W, and a prototype was developed and tested in the laboratory. The experimental setup demonstrated a peak efficiency of 97.78%, validating the converter’s performance.

Existing studies mainly focus on multimodal fusion and inter-level feature interaction during feature extraction, that is, correcting or enhancing dual-branch weights through fused features or multimodal interactions, while neglecting the supplementation of missing modality features. This limitation can lead to noise propagation across layers and a reduction in interaction capability caused by feature absence. In this paper, we propose a Multimodal Collaborative Interactive Soft Fusion Network (MCISFNet) for RGB-infrared aerial image object detection. The proposed method introduces a Saliency-guided Multimodal Soft Fusion Mechanism (SMSFM), which explicitly directs attention to and enhances critical regions, dynamically adjusts feature weights, and integrates complementary information to mitigate the problem of missing data in dual-branch representations. To address the complexity of aerial scenarios, we further develop a Multi-scale Interactive Gating Module (MIGM) that explicitly incorporates multi-scale contextual information, enabling fine-grained refinement of primary modality features and enhancing the discriminability of fused representations. Moreover, we design a Cross-modal Global Context Collaborative Modeling (CGCCM) strategy, in which a cross-modal shared branch is constructed to jointly perform context extraction and feature fusion. This collaborative design not only improves the alignment of deep semantic features but also ensures that the learned RGB and IR features are more consistent and complementary, while reducing computational cost. Extensive experiments conducted on three multimodal aerial image detection datasets (DroneVehicle, VEDAI, and ODinMJ) demonstrate the robustness and generalization capability of the proposed MCISFNet framework."

    "abstract": "Indoor localization remains challenging due to multipath propagation, dynamic obstacles, and environmental noise. Traditional methods based on geometric or probabilistic models often fail under such complex conditions. The core challenge lies in effectively modeling spatial, temporal, and multi-channel characteristics of noisy wireless signals. Channel State Information (CSI) has the potential to address these issues by providing more detailed spatial and frequency domain features, making it a promising candidate for robust indoor localization. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a unified indoor localization framework—GACB Loc—which integrates graph convolution-based multi-channel attention, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) to jointly model spatial, temporal, and channel-wise dependencies in CSI data. Aiming at the multi-channel characteristics of CSI data, a Transformer-inspired graph convolution attention mechanism framework suitable for CSI data is proposed. First, the CSI phase data are preprocessed, and CNN is employed to extract advanced features and capture complex spatial and frequency domain patterns from the CSI phase data. Then, by utilizing the graph structure of CSI data and adaptively focusing on the most important channels, the model’s ability to prioritize relevant information is improved. Finally, BLSTM is proposed to capture temporal dependencies in the data. We conducted experiments on the proposed method using both publicly available datasets and real-world deployment environments. The results on two public datasets showed mean localization errors of 0.4945 m and 0.6546 m, while real-world tests achieved average errors of 0.1691 m and 0.8259 m, demonstrating our approach’s effectiveness and robustness.

The covert optimization designs are proposed to enhance the covert rate for each mode. Specifically, the closed-form expressions of the warden's approximate minimum detection error probability are derived to measure the warden's detection performance. The covert rate is maximized by jointly optimizing the transmit powers and the beamforming vectors under both the quality of service constraint of the overt link and the covert constraint. Additionally, the low-complexity optimization designs of each mode are proposed to achieve a desirable tradeoff between complexity and performance. The results show that the proposed designs outperform the baseline designs in covert rate, indicating the advantage of exploiting the imperfect channel state information (CSI) knowledge of Warden's detection channel for beamforming design. Furthermore, the comparison of the two modes reveals that the interference levels from the overt transmitter to the covert receiver and the transmitter's CSI estimation error are the key factors determining which mode achieves superior covert performance."

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the communication-efficient distributed Nash equilibrium seeking (DNES) of multi-agent systems (MASs) under unreliable communications. The “unreliability” is characterized as irregular topology switchings (e.g., due to communication failures, adversarial attacks, or other agents' blockages), which will often cause disconnected communication topologies and further result in failure of DNES. To overcome this challenge while reducing data transmissions, a novel dynamic event-triggered (DET) mechanism with an online-tuned auxiliary variable is first proposed. Based on this mechanism, a gradient-based DET-DNES algorithm that steers the outputs of all agents exponentially to the NE is derived, and the effects of switching topologies on the convergence of the developed strategies is revealed by appropriately constructing a switching Lyapunov function and using <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$M$</tex-math></inline-formula>-matrix theory. Rigorous proof to exclude the Zeno behavior is also provided by characterizing the couplings caused by the coexistence of triggering and switching. Furthermore, the derived results are extended to high-order nonlinear MASs with time-varying parametric uncertainties, in which some nonlinear damping terms are designed and introduced to overcome the non-differentiablity problem caused by the triggering and switching. At last, an example of energy resource competition is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

    "abstract": "Generative steganography has recently attracted considerable attention due to its superior security properties. However, most existing approaches suffer from limited hiding capacity. To address this issue, this paper proposes a high-capacity image steganography framework that integrates an encoder–decoder architecture with a latent diffusion model. Specifically, a message encoder is designed to transform binary secret messages into latent-space representations through a series of ResDense modules, enabling efficient hiding of large-scale information. The encoded latent features are then guided by the latent diffusion model to synthesize visually realistic stego images. During message extraction, the stego image undergoes iterative noise addition within the diffusion process to reconstruct the latent representation, from which a message decoder accurately recovers the hidden message. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a high hiding capacity of over 30,000 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while ensuring reliable message recovery under common image storage formats such as JPEG and PNG."

This study introduces a unified, traffic-aware survivability and importance framework that integrates flow-level quality-of-service awareness and component criticality within a single analytical model. In contrast to the techniques of conventional topology, the amalgamation of class sensitivity to flow priorities is proposed to quantify the effect of failures on service continuity. The nodes and links that most impact network resilience are identified using a component-level importance metric. The performance of the representative backbone topology shows the higher quality of the class-conscious framework overflow-independent models in exceptionally characterising the cause as well as critical failure points. As a component of the 5G/6G and Digital Twin implementation, this research provides the foundations of the 5G/6G QoS-based resiliency and, therefore, novel creation of AI and security standards development of trustworthy twin systems."

    "abstract": "Automatic weather recognition using images has important applications in land and air traffic control, autonomous vehicles, road safety, and crop management. Despite its relevance, this field remains underexplored due to the difficulty of extracting robust features for weather conditions that often overlap visually, and the high cost of building large, labeled datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a Multistep Visual Pretraining (MVP) approach, a resource-efficient training pipeline designed to maximize performance with limited supervision. MVP leverages self-supervised pretraining on a large-scale unlabeled weather dataset, followed by supervised fine-tuning on a small labeled dataset, while reusing ImageNet pretrained models to minimize computational requirements. Unlike traditional strategies that demand massive manually labeled data and extensive GPU resources, MVP achieves competitive performance with a compact ResNet-50 architecture, only 1200 labeled images for fine-tuning, and a single mid-range GPU. Our method reached 94% accuracy in multi-class weather recognition, demonstrating that robust, real-world performance can be achieved without the prohibitive costs of large-scale annotation or high-end computing infrastructure. This study extends our previous work, “Weather Recognition Using Self-Supervised Deep Learning”, going from binary to multi-class classification while reducing data and resource dependency, thus offering a scalable and practical solution for real-world deployment."

Conventional single-exit networks process all inputs at full depth, incurring unnecessary FLOPs and energy even for easy scenes. This paper proposes a confidence-guided multi-exit framework for energy-optimized road-scene object detection. We augment the MobileNet-V1/V2/V3 and EfficientDet-D0 backbones with two early exits and a final head, and we use a simple softmax-based confidence rule to select the exit for each input. We derive conditions under which early exiting reduces expected computation and we bound the error under calibrated confidence. Experiments on the dataset show that the proposed MobileNet-V2 multi-exit detector achieves 92.3% mAP@0.5 while reducing measured GPU energy by 14.73% per image compared to a single-exit baseline. On a low-power device, the same model lowers energy per image from 2.67 J with single-exit to 2.26 J under the dynamic early-exit policy, corresponding to about a 17% reduction, and still meets real-time constraints with 72.5 ms latency. Across backbones, the confidence-guided policy consistently yields better latency–energy trade-offs than prior early–exit baselines at comparable accuracy."

This work proposes and develops the functional model for seven DSAS architectures along with Fault/Error Handling Model (FEHM), and conducts the combined reliability analysis with the primary system (CB-and-half scheme). The analysis is carried out utilizing both Monte Carlo and analytical approaches. The results show that, firstly, the impact of the automated switching is significant in improving the substation reliability indices as compared to manual switching. Secondly, the developed models only affect the substation reliability indices when the secondary system failure modes are included.

    "abstract": "Virtual synchronous generator (VSG) control may lead to active power oscillations under insufficient damping. Although various feedback control-based methods have been proposed to address this issue, they often degrade the inherent inertial response of the VSG. In this paper, fractional-order control is introduced into the VSG, providing additional degrees of freedom, which leads to the formulation of three fractional-order VSG (FOVSG) control strategies. The active power and frequency dynamic performances of these FOVSG schemes are analyzed and compared, and then proposes a generalized FOVSG (GFOVSG) control. By appropriately designing the GFOVSG, controllable active power dynamics can be achieved while significantly enhancing the system's inertial response. To evaluate the impact of GFOVSG on the small-signal stability of the grid-connected system, a stability analysis method is developed based on the fractional-order small-signal model of the system, and the small-signal stability criterion is derived. Compared to the VSG, grid-forming inverters with the GFOVSG can maintain small-signal stability under stronger grid conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulation and experimental results."

The combination of metal reduction and Characteristic Mode Analysis (CMA) enables the effective suppression of scattering modes, achieved by carefully analyzing and manipulating modal currents. This technique achieves an RCS reduction of up to 8.6 dB across a broad frequency range of 1-20 GHz (181%), including both in-band and out-of-band frequencies, under normal incidence of linearly polarized (LP) waves. Moreover, it demonstrates RCS reductions of up to 6 dB over an approximate frequency range of 2-20 GHz for varying incidence angles of LP waves. Additionally, RCS reductions of up to 5 dB are attained across the 3-20 GHz frequency range for both normal and obliquely incident circularly polarized (CP) waves. Notably, the RCS reduction achieved is robust and insensitive to polarization and angle variations, thereby ensuring a consistent performance enhancement, while preserving the antenna’s inherent radiation capabilities. To validate the design, a prototype was developed and tested, yielding measured results that closely match the simulated data, confirming the effectiveness of this hybrid technique."

The main control objective is to minimize the horizontal tracking error while maintaining a constant flight altitude. Firstly, a moving target’s position is acquired from a virtual vision camera based on image processing techniques, and the measurement noise is attenuated by a Kalman Filter (KF). In addition, the target’s velocity and acceleration are also estimated in real-time by using a classical KF. Based on these approximated values, an Integral SMC algorithm is constructed to guarantee a small horizontal position tracking error. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, Software-In-The-Loop simulation (SITL) are conducted and compared with a classical Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. The flight simulation environment is configured on the PX4 platform, in which the virtual hexacopter UAV is equipped with a downward-facing gimbaled monocular camera to ensure that the relative position of the moving target is continuous observation. Simulation results demonstrated that the ISMC consistently outperforms the PID controller in terms of tracking precision, robustness, and responsiveness under identical testing conditions."

The model proposed in the paper mainly includes three core modules.

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have become essential for identifying and preventing such attacks. However, implementing IDS in an IoMT environment requires a lightweight approach due to the resource limitations of IoMT gateways or edge devices. This research aims to develop an intrusion detection system for the IoMT using basic deep learning models. A tuned algorithm modification was used to create a lightweight model, ensuring that these models could operate optimally on resource-constrained devices. The dataset used in this study encompasses various types of attacks relevant to the IoMT. The model performance was evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC. The results indicate that the Fully Connected Deep Neural Network (FCDNN) model combined with focal loss delivers the highest accuracy, 94.6%, while maintaining a model size of less than 256 KB, making it an effective solution for intrusion detection within the IoMT.

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) has achieved remarkable progress across various fields, yet designing customized DL architectures remains complex and labor-intensive. While AutoML frameworks assist with model selection and hyperparameter tuning, they lack mechanisms to integrate structured domain knowledge. To overcome this limitation, we propose an ontology-driven approach that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason over structured knowledge and dynamically generate DL architectures. Traditional ontology systems rely on XML formats and rule-based engines, which hinder adaptability and compatibility with modern AI tools. Our approach transforms ontological concepts—such as classes, properties, and rules—into structured natural language, allowing LLMs to process and infer directly from them. This enables intuitive understanding and flexible reasoning without the need for external inference engines. We develop a prototype system that uses LLMs for DL architecture generation guided by ontology-based reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate improved adaptability and reduced reliance on specialized tools. Furthermore, we incorporate a Few-Shot Learning mechanism to enhance LLMs’ capability to interpret and apply ontology rules effectively. This research bridges the gap between structured knowledge representation and natural language-based reasoning, contributing to the development of autonomous and intelligent DL systems capable of domain-specific optimization."

    "abstract": "The development of artificial intelligence (AI), such as chatbots in the academic field, relies on large and high-quality datasets. Manually creating these datasets is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and delays AI deployment. To address this, we propose an automated dataset generation framework using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and transformer-based models. This research uses pretrained large language models (LLM), specifically T5 and BERT, to extract meaningful information from academic PDF documents, particularly two-column structured papers, and generate question-answer (QA) pairs as chatbot datasets. The proposed framework includes a text extraction, preprocessing, and QA generator; the pair will then be evaluated using three metrics: confidence score, BERTScore, and F1-Token. Unlike prior works that primarily target comprehension benchmarks dataset and task-based such as SQuAD or UnifiedQA, our framework accelerates the creation of datasets for chatbots, reduces the need for human effort, and guarantees the maintenance of high-quality and relevant datasets by directly processing unstructured academic PDFs with a nocel of dual-model strategy where T5 is used for question generation, and BERT is used for answer extraction to answer the generated question, with a built-in filtering mechanic and an adaptive parameter adjustment strategy that dynamically tunes parameters to maintain semantic diversity and reduce redundancy while ensuring semantic quality. Experimental results shows that the framework consistently produces QA pairs with high semantic value and both BERTscore and confidence score having high scores indicating a strong performance, demonstrating the viability of the framework as a scalable tool for automated dataset creation for chatbots."

Using the example of a German SME, its development is tracked over a three-year period during which elements of Spetzler's Decision Quality Framework were introduced. The study focuses on five specific areas in which decisions played a central role: Data Access, Use of Camera-Based Recognition, Object Tracking, Structural Reasoning, and Warehouse Space Optimization. Based on these use cases, the impact of the project was evaluated using a retrospective joint-assessment based on Spetzler's six dimensions. The results show that the SME was able to improve its decision-making practices in a meaningful way. Although the results are based on a single case, they indicate the potential of evaluating the decision quality in an early stage of Digital transformation. The article is one of the first practical investigations into how ex-ante decision quality methods can be applied in SMEs undergoing digital transformation."

    "abstract": "This paper examines the comparison of time series of a set of concepts based on the formation of weighted directed graphs of the mutual influences of time series concepts on each other. The graph vertices correspond to the concepts, and the weighted arcs correspond to the values of the influence of one concept on another. The graph structure can be characterized using the spectrum of the eigenvalues of the graph’s Laplace matrix, which corresponds to the heat equation. For this purpose, a heat kernel matrix is formed; the time derivative of the heat kernel matrix is determined by the Laplace matrix. The coefficients of the Taylor series expansion of the heat content of the heat kernel can be used to represent the graph structure. The paper presents relations for determining the Mahalanobis distance between feature vectors (heat kernel invariants) which can be used for pattern recognition. The topicality of the problem is to increase the uniqueness of identification when recognizing time series by taking into account both the spectrum of eigenvalues of the Laplace matrix of the graph and the eigenvectors. The goal of this paper is to explore the possibility of using the coefficients of the power series expansion of the heat content of the constructed graph as feature vectors – characteristics of the graph’s properties. The novelty of the methods presented in this paper lies in the fact that, unlike the spectral embedding method, it explores the possibility of comparing graphs (images) based on the Mahalanobis distance between invariants constructed from the thermal content decomposition coefficients. An algorithm for minimizing the Mahalanobis distance between graph vertices is proposed, based on learning the Mahalanobis matrix.By comparing graphs corresponding to time series of a set of concepts, it is possible to compare time series."

Following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, a total of 22 studies were included, covering probabilistic models, machine learning approaches, human factor frameworks, and ergonomic modeling. Bayesian networks and probabilistic methods were shown to provide structured reasoning but remain data dependent. Machine learning offers scalability and predictive capacity, yet suffers from transparency and regulatory acceptance issues. Human factor frameworks, such as HFACS, STAMP, and FRMS, provide indispensable contextual insight but lack predictive precision. Ergonomic and performance modeling bridges the gap between human capabilities and system design but remains underintegrated into predictive analytics. The review concludes that hybrid approaches combining data-driven methods with human factor frameworks represent the most promising direction for proactive aviation safety."

    "abstract": "Conthereum is a concurrent Ethereum solution for intra-block parallel transaction execution, enabling validators to utilize multi-core infrastructure and transform the sequential execution model of Ethereum into a parallel one. This shift significantly increases throughput and transactions per second (TPS), while ensuring conflict-free execution in both proposer and attestor modes and preserving execution order consistency in the attestor. At the heart of Conthereum is a novel, lightweight, high-performance scheduler inspired by the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSS). We propose a custom greedy heuristic algorithm, along with its efficient implementation, that solves this formulation effectively and decisively outperforms existing scheduling methods in finding suboptimal solutions that satisfy the constraints, achieve minimal makespan, and maximize speedup in parallel execution. Additionally, Conthereum includes an offline phase that equips its real-time scheduler with a conflict analysis repository obtained through static analysis of smart contracts, identifying potentially conflicting functions using a pessimistic approach. Building on this novel scheduler and extensive conflict data, Conthereum outperforms existing concurrent intra-block solutions. Empirical evaluations show nearlinear throughput gains with increasing computational power on standard 8-core machines. Although scalability deviates from linear at higher core counts and increased transaction conflicts, as theoretically expected, Conthereum still significantly improves upon the current Ethereum sequential execution model and outperforms existing intra-block concurrent solutions across a wide range of conditions."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a theoretical formulation and real implementation of the Feedback Linearization (FBL) control algorithm for a hexacopter unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to improve the tracking performance of the control system in both attitude and position. The traditional Proportional–Integral–Derivative (PID) controller is widely used for linear systems due to its simplicity and straightforward gain tuning. However, for nonlinear models, the control performance of the classical PID algorithm faces serious limitations in terms of stability, especially for underactuated systems like UAVs. The Feedback Linearization controller is a well-known technique that relies on a mathematical model to achieve full input–output linearization, thereby enhancing tracking precision and reducing errors. The structure of the entire control system can be separated into two parts. First, a low-level controller is developed for attitude stabilization by controlling the rotational speeds of multiple rotors. Another part is a high-level controller responsible for driving the horizontal position to the desired value. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, Hardware-in-the-Loop (HITL) simulation and real implementation on the Pixhawk 6C flight controller, combined with the PX4 platform, are conducted and compared with the classical PID controller. The results from both simulation and real experiments demonstrated the superior performance of the Feedback Linearization controller compared to conventional control methods."

    "abstract": "A dual Fabry–Pérot interferometer system based on the optical Vernier effect is proposed for high-resolution temperature sensing. By introducing a slight cavity length detuning between the sensing and reference interferometers, a long-period envelope is generated, which effectively amplifies spectral shifts resulting from temperature variations. Numerical simulations and experimental results consistently confirm that an increase in temperature induces a distinct blue shift in the interference spectrum, primarily due to the combined effects of thermal expansion and the thermo-optic response of air within the cavity. To quantify this temperature dependence, the peak wavelengths of the second-order upper envelope were extracted at multiple temperature conditions and fitted using linear regression. The analysis shows a consistent wavelength shift of approximately one fringe per 10 degrees Celsius, with a coefficient of determination as high as 0.9701, indicating excellent linearity. These results demonstrate the feasibility, stability, and precision of the proposed system based on the optical Vernier effect for accurate temperature monitoring. Its compact configuration makes it a promising candidate for advanced fiber-optic sensing applications."

To achieve this, we propose a novel receiver design for passive coherent demodulation of LoRa. In this design, we creatively couple LoRa’s down-conversion with de-chirping (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">dc</i><sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>), leveraging the processing gain brought by chirp spread spectrum (CSS) modulation to boost communication range without the need for additional power supply. Moreover, we exploit the cyclical time-frequency feature intrinsic to LoRa for demodulation, and a low-power analog-digital signal processing circuit with negligible power is devised to replace the existing power-intensive sampling and costly digital computation. We prototype Sisyphus for proof-of-concept, and comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that Sisyphus can achieve significant power savings compared to legacy LoRa receiver while retaining the anti-interference ability of legacy LoRa. We envision that the design of Sisyphus can unlock the potential for broader applications of LoRa-based backscatter devices."

GPS data from nine mountain trails in Japan including two solo hikes and seven group hikes (teams of five to ten people each) were collected in order to verify this theory. Nine potential statistical models were compared to the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">VH</i> distribution of each trail. Akaike information criterion and mean squared error were used to quantify goodness-of-fit. The log-normal distribution consistently produced the lowest AIC and MSE values across all trails, demonstrating both its theoretical and empirical suitability for describing the dynamics of skewed exertion. The ideal log-normal parameter ranges that describe typical hiking behavior were found through brute-force simulations using hundred million samples per trail. The framework’s potential for anomaly detection was demonstrated by the deviations from these ranges observed in trails with self-reported discomfort. The suggested system offers scalable applicability for health-conscious trail monitoring and early-warning systems in natural settings because it is lightweight, GPS-based, and sensor-minimal."

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has recently emerged as a viable technique for establishing sensing and communication using the same resources. Nonetheless, the operation of ISAC networks is often challenged by the absence of a direct link between the sensing node and the targets, and by the risk of disclosing confidential data to malicious targets when using the same signal for both tasks. In this paper, a robust reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided scheme for securing a full-duplex (FD) ISAC network is proposed. The considered network consists of uplink and downlink users served in FD through a multi-antenna dual-functional radar communication base station (BS), which employs co-located multi-antenna communication-radar arrays to detect multiple malicious targets while preserving communication secrecy in their presence. Additionally, the BS utilizes an optimized artificial noise (AN) that serves to disrupt the malicious targets’ reception and increase the sensing illumination power. By optimally designing the RIS phase shifts, transmit beamforming matrix, AN covariance matrix, and uplink users’ transmit power and combining vectors using an alternating optimization-based algorithm, the network’s sensing performance is maximized under secrecy and total power constraints. Numerical results present the proposed scheme’s efficacy, particularly when a direct link between the BS and the various nodes/targets is absent."

How about its energy efficiency (EE) over passive one? Below, the EE of active RIS-aided wireless network in Rayleigh fading channels is analyzed. Using the law of large numbers, EE is derived as a function of five factors: power allocation factor, the number (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>) of RIS elements, the total power, the noise variances at RIS and at user.

To evaluate the impact of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i> on EE, we establish an equation with the EE of active RIS equaling that of passive one, and three methods, bisection, Newton’s method, and simulated annealing, are designed to find the roots of this equation.

    "abstract": "To overcome the challenge of balancing high performance with low manufacturing cost in large-aperture compact antenna test range (CATR) systems, this letter proposes and validates a novel linear array feed parabolic cylindrical CATR based on a dimension-separation diffraction control strategy. This strategy decouples the complex two-dimensional edge diffraction problem into two independent one-dimensional problems. In the vertical dimension, passive suppression of edge diffraction is achieved by designing mechanical serrations on the upper and lower edges of the reflector. In the horizontal dimension, this letter proposes an active diffraction cancellation algorithm that controls the quiet zone ripple caused by the straight-cut edges by optimizing the complex excitations of the feed array, eliminating the need for physical serrations. This design concept ensures a high-quality quiet zone, characterized by peak-to-peak amplitude and phase variations of less than 1 dB and 10°, respectively. Simultaneously, it simplifies the reflector manufacturing process and significantly improves aperture efficiency. The proposed CATR demonstrates an exceptional aperture efficiency of up to 91% at 10 GHz. Even at a lower frequency of 2.6 GHz, despite more pronounced diffraction effects from a smaller electrical aperture, it maintains an efficiency of 78.5%. This significantly outperforms both traditional CATR (50%) and fully-serrated edge designs with tapering excitation (67.5%)."

    "abstract": "The electric power sector is undergoing substantial transformations due to the rising electrification of demand, enhanced integration of renewable energy resources, and the emergence of new technologies. These changes are rendering the electric grid more volatile and unpredictable, making it more challenging to maintain reliable operations. In order to address these issues, advanced time series prediction models are needed for closing the gap between the forecasted and actual grid outcomes. In this paper, we introduce a multivariate time series prediction model that combines traditional state space models with deep learning methods to simultaneously capture and predict the underlying dynamics of multiple time series. Additionally, we design a time series processing module that incorporates high resolution external forecasts into sequence-to-sequence prediction models, achieving this with negligible increases in size and no loss of accuracy. We also release an extended dataset spanning five years of load, electricity price, ancillary service price, and renewable generation. To complement this dataset, we provide an open-access toolbox that includes our proposed model, the dataset itself, and several state-of-the-art prediction models, thereby creating a unified framework for benchmarking advanced machine learning approaches. Our findings indicate that the proposed model outperforms existing models across various prediction tasks, improving state-of-the-art prediction error by an average of 7% and decreasing model parameters by 43%.

Moreover, the generalization ability of existing GNN-based models on the low homophily graph is relatively poor. To this end, we propose a graph clustering framework named synergistic deep graph clustering network (<monospace xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SynC</monospace>). <monospace xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SynC</monospace> employs a transform input graph autoencoder (TIGAE) to obtain high-quality embeddings via mitigating the representation collapse issue of GAE for guiding structure augmentation.

However, batteries minor faults are characterized by diverse triggers and coupled features, which are easily covered by noise. Early diagnosis of minor faults is extremely challenging. The traditional threshold method is difficult to determine the optimal threshold, which cannot diagnose minor faults. Therefore, a minor multifault cooperative diagnosis framework based on multi-information fusion is proposed. On the one hand, the variance generalized S-transform is presented to detect minor faults. Further, internal short circuits, external short circuits, and poor contact faults are distinguished based on the voltage pseudo-variance and temperature rise. On the other hand, the variable scale distance integral distance and voltage spectrum integration method are invented to diagnose self-discharge faults and sensor faults, respectively. The equivalent internal resistance approach is used to detect inconsistent faults. The experimental results demonstrate that the presented approach achieves a 98.5% fault detection rate and a 97.7% detection accuracy rate. The detection results of different types of batteries faults and simultaneous faults of diverse cells prove the robustness of the proposed technology."

Each OpMod requires a dedicated model for analysis, and failure to correctly identify these OpMods may lead to reduced model accuracy. Traditionally, boundaries between OpMods involving discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) are considered to lack analytical expressions describing the relationships among switching frequency, voltage gain, and load. In this paper, analytical expressions for the boundaries of all common OpMods are derived by extracting the magnetizing inductor voltage at OpMod boundary as critical features and integrating Kirchhoff's Voltage Law. As a theoretical analytical solution, this method exhibits no errors in OpMod boundaries compared to simulation results. Based on this, a novel online OpMod recognition strategy is proposed, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing control systems and design frameworks.

    "abstract": "Memristors have been employed in the design of integrated memory, logic gates, analog circuits, and neuromorphic systems. Their non-volatile nature, high integration density, and compatibility with CMOS technology have been widely documented in numerous studies. Existing research has compared the operational characteristics of various memristor models, including linear, nonlinear, current-controlled threshold adaptive models, and voltage-controlled adaptive models. However, many of these traditional models are either too domain-specific or physically complex, which limits their practical simulation efficiency. In response to the need for a simple, general-purpose, and fast-simulating model in EDA flows, this study proposes an BV-VTEAM which is advanced version of the V-VTEAM model for bipolar memristors. The new model maintains a balance between simplicity and accuracy. In the BV-VTEAM model, the internal state variable represents the memristor's conductivity level. This dynamic variable evolves over time based on the applied stimulus. The state update is performed using a manual integration method, where the time step is automatically selected based on the nearest absolute timestamps in both the growth and decay phases. The bounded function is applied to ensure that internal state variable remains within physical limits. Additionally, the output current is regulated by a maximum threshold using a soft-bounded approach to avoid Zero Jacobian issues, thus improving numerical stability. The operation conditions are analyzed in various dynamic parameters in terms of supply voltage, operating frequency, maximum current, time constant, and nonlinearity exponent This BV-VTEAM model is further utilized to design digital logic circuits, including AND, OR, and flip-flops, laying the groundwork for constructing more complex digital systems based on memristive components."

Moreover, only simple addition operations are used in feature fusion, resulting in semantic gaps. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose an adaptive multilevel feature fusion network (LEAMFF-Net) based on localization enhancement, designing a multiscale context interaction module (MSCIM) to enhance the extraction of multiscale features by using inflated convolution, and finally, a localization enhancement module (LEM) is designed to enhance feature localization. It fuses multilevel features via a multiscale adaptive feature fusion (AMFF) module. Moreover, it transfers accurate shallow-level localization information to higher-level representations, enabling the network to focus on key features. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on three widely used remote sensing datasets. The proposed model outperforms most state-of-the-art methods."

Resistance Rdut is generally calculated by measuring the on-state voltage across the power semiconductors and dividing it by the conduction current. In isolated converters, the need for galvanic isolation between the on-state voltage measurement circuit (OVMC) and the controller presents a key design challenge: the high bandwidth (BW) required for the measurement conflicts with the limited BW of the signal isolator. This paper presents a novel circuit that overcomes this limitation by incorporating a sample-and-hold stage before the isolator. This method preserves the on-state voltage as a DC-level signal, allowing it to be accurately transmitted through a low-BW isolator.

In this study, we present a multi-class PD detection system based on finger-tapping, using an attention-enhanced CNN-BiLSTM framework combined with handcrafted feature extraction and deep learning techniques. In the procedure, we used an existing dataset of finger-tapping videos to extract temporal, frequency, and amplitude-based features from wrist and hand movements using their formulas. These handcrafted features were then processed through our attention-enhanced CNN-BiLSTM model, a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates CNN, BiLSTM, and attention mechanisms to classify PD severity into multiple levels. The features first pass through a Conv1D-MaxPooling block to capture local spatial dependencies, followed by processing through a BiLSTM layer to model the temporal dynamics of the motion. An attention mechanism is applied to emphasize the most informative temporal features, which are then refined by a second BiLSTM layer. The CNN-derived features and attention-enhanced BiLSTM outputs are concatenated, followed by dense and dropout layers, before being passed through a softmax classifier to predict the PD severity level. Our model demonstrated strong performance in distinguishing between the five severity classes, showcasing the effectiveness of combining spatial-temporal representations with attention mechanisms for automated PD severity detection.

A detailed case study of a commercial flight from Bratislava (LZIB) to Doha (OTHH) on a Boeing 737-800 aircraft is presented. The analysis evaluates the environmental and economic impacts of replacing conventional Jet A-1 fuel with various types of SAF, produced using technologies such as HEFA, FT-SPK, ATJ, and SIP from different feedstocks. Scenarios with SAF blends of $10 \\%$, 30%, $50 \\%$, and a hypothetical $100 \\%$ are compared. The results indicate that while all SAF variants reduce emissions, the overall life-cycle carbon footprint and costs vary significantly depending on the production technology and feedstock used. The findings suggest that SAF produced from waste materials, particularly through the HEFA and FT-SPK production pathways, offer the most promising balance between environmental benefits and economic viability. This study highlights the crucial role of feedstock selection and policy support in accelerating the decarbonization of the aviation sector."

    "abstract": "Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a paradigm for digital identity management that offers privacy and flexibility advantages. A key technology in SSI is Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and their associated metadata, DID Documents (DDOs). DDOs contain crucial verification material such as the public keys of the entity identified by the DID (i.e., the DID subject) and are often anchored on a distributed ledger to ensure security and availability. Long-lived DIDs must support updates (e.g., key rotation). Ideally, only the DID subject should authorize DDO updates. However, in practice, update capabilities may be shared or delegated. While the DID specification acknowledges such scenarios, it does not define how updates should be authorized when multiple entities jointly control a DID (i.e., group control). This article examines the implementation of an on-chain, trustless mechanism enabling DID controllers under group control to program their governance rules. The main research question is the following: Can a technical mechanism be developed to orchestrate on-chain group control of a DDO in a ledger-agnostic and adaptable manner?"

    "abstract": "The emergence of blockchain technology has reshaped the financial sector, leading to the introduction of new financial products and services. In parallel, central banks worldwide are investigating the possibility of issuing central bank digital currency (CBDC) and the potential use of blockchain as a foundational technology. Of particular interest is offline functionality, where transactions can be completed even if neither party is connected to the ledger at the time of transaction. Such offline functionality carries unique opportunities for countries and policy makers, but also comes with a new set of risks. Proposed herein is an assessment framework as a critical modeling tool towards risk evaluation. The framework is broadly applicable to blockchain-based solutions that support multiple off-chain transactions prior to synchronization. Urban and rural environments were modeled to demonstrate the model’s fidelity and flexibility. A test offline digital currency solution was evaluated via threat level experiments to ascertain the prototype’s resilience to varying levels of malicious activity. Results illustrate how various parameter configurations affect resilience to malicious activity and information propagation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the framework in providing valuable insights for the design of offline currency systems."

    "abstract": "This article proposes a dynamic self-triggered (DST) control strategy and a switching signal for a cascaded switched continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) system subject to asymmetric input constraints. First, the switched subsystems are established, and an improved nonquadratic performance function (PF) is designed, enabling the decentralized constrained switched control problem (CP) to be decomposed into a set of unconstrained optimal switched CPs for the individual subsystems. To reduce communication and computational burdens while eliminating the need for dedicated trigger-monitoring hardware, a dynamic self-triggering mechanism is incorporated into the controller. Subsequently, the DST Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation associated with the transformed optimal switched CP is derived. To circumvent repeated trial-and-error and ease the selection of activation functions, a dual heuristic programming method utilizing echo state networks (ESNs) is adopted to approximate the PF. According to the Lyapunov theorem, the output weights of the ESN and the states of the closed-loop switched subsystems are proven to be uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed DST control strategy and switching signals is validated on a cascaded switched CSTR system comprising three reactors."

The proposed framework is generalized accommodate an arbitrary number of users, incorporates round–robin (RR) scheduling, and use iterative interference cancellation (IIC) with chase combining (CC) to enhance fair power allocation while reducing the packet drop rate (PDR). The results reveal that NOMA-ARQ with IIC significantly outperforms conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) in various scenarios. The signal-to-noise (SNR) gain in PDR performance is particularly evident in moderate to high SNR conditions, ranging from 13 to 35 dB, and for scenarios involving three users with multiple transmission attempts. The proposed approach demonstrates up to a threefold increase in system throughput compared to OMA, highlighting its potential for enhancing backhaul performance in dense IoT deployments. These findings highlight the potential of IIC-assisted ARQ-NOMA to address the requirements for spectrum efficiency and data reliability effectively."

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technologies, Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) networks are recognized as pivotal in enhancing the efficiency and safety of intelligent transportation systems. However, the highly dynamic and mobile nature of V2X environments poses considerable challenges for task offloading, particularly in achieving low delay, high energy efficiency and task success rate maximization. To address these issues, this study introduces the Dynamic Task Offloading Framework (DTOF) and the Hybrid Integrated Offloading Algorithm (HIOA). The DTOF incorporates dynamic task segmentation with cross-layer resource allocation, thereby improving adaptability under high mobility conditions, with vehicle speeds ranging from 20 to 120km/h. The HIOA integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with game-theoretic methods to achieve near-optimal multi-objective optimization, encompassing delay minimization and energy efficiency improvement across vehicle densities of 30 to 80 vehicles/km2. Specifically designed to satisfy the delay requirement for Level 4 and beyond autonomous driving, the HIOA ensures both low delay and energy efficiency. Hybrid simulations combining SUMO traffic modeling and a 5G New Radio (NR) channel model demonstrate that the HIOA achieves superior performance compared to existing approaches. Under typical operating conditions, it reduces service access delay by 25%,lowers energy consumption by 18% and elevates task success rate by 30%. Moreover, the HIOA maintains robust performance under peak traffic scenarios (80 vehicles/km2) and amid infrastructure impairments (30% RSU failure rate). This work substantially augments the efficiency and adaptability of V2X, establishing a solid groundwork for further development of autonomous driving technologies. Future research will investigate federated learning for cross-domain collaboration and refine the integration of game-theoretic and DRL mechanisms to further reduce computational complexity."

We present a theoretical model for optical signal transmission under bending eavesdropping, analyzing the impact of bending eavesdropping on fiber physical characteristics such as dispersion and nonlinear effect. These physical characteristics are embedded into a convolutional neural network (CNN) to construct PICN, which automatically captures subtle variations of the signal features under bending eavesdropping. To validate the effectiveness of the scheme, we first develop an eavesdropping experimental platform in an 80-km 168 Gbps dual-polarization quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) coherent optical communication system. Polarization data are then collected under normal transmission, 10.8 mm and 15 mm bending radius. Finally, the detection performance of four classifiers including PICN, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) are evaluated at single and mixed bending radii. Experimental results demonstrate that PICN achieves detection accuracies of 100%, 98.53%, and 99.02% under 10.8 mm, 15 mm, and mixed bending radii, respectively. Our work provides novel theoretical foundations and innovative perspectives for bending eavesdropping detection in optical fiber communication systems."

However, most existing schemes rely on a dual-server model to hide access patterns and often involve complex spatial relation judgments during range comparisons, leading to low query efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a novel Fast and Access Hidden Range Query (FAHRQ) scheme. First, we introduce an efficient range membership verification technique based on Bloom filters and Lagrange interpolation function, combine homomorphic encryption to ensure the confidentiality of spatial data and the computational flexibility of related operations, and realize the access pattern hidden under single server. Then, we construct an index using R-tree and employ Bloom filters and prefix 0-1 encoding to accelerate the minimum bounding rectangle intersection judgment, enabling secure and efficient range queries over encrypted spatial data while maintaining retrieval accuracy. Finally, we give a formal security analysis to show that our scheme achieves access pattern hidden while protecting data security, and conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our scheme improves query efficiency by 5 – 7× compared to existing schemes."

    "abstract": "Decentralized storage auditing approaches are designed to ensure data security in dishonest decentralized storage providers. However, the need for data updates introduces new challenges to the design of decentralized storage auditing approaches. Existing approaches can support dynamic auditing for updated files. Unfortunately, they can only deal with block-level updating, which is counter-intuitive and requires conversion from semantic changes to binary changes. Furthermore, existing dynamic auditing approaches require the recalculation of auxiliary auditing information (e.g., auditing authenticators) in data owners, which imposes unnecessary additional burdens on data owners, particularly those with constrained resources in decentralized storage environments. In this paper, we focus on image files and propose iAudit, an efficient pixel-level dynamic image auditing approach in decentralized storage. We first design a novel image authenticator with image pixels for efficient dynamic auditing, which combines convolution operations and polynomial commitment in authenticator construction. Additionally, we build an owner-free dynamic mechanism in dynamic decentralized storage auditing approach by utilizing zero-knowledge proof techniques. In this way, the dynamic operation overheads incurred by auditing can be completely eliminated from the data owners. A prototype of iAudit is implemented, and extensive experimental results demonstrate that iAudit outperforms state-of-the-art works, achieving over a 210× speedup for data owner in dynamic update phase."

    "abstract": "The increasing regulatory demands for sustainability pose a significant challenge for engineering management in aligning corporate strategies with practical implementation. This paper investigates how multinational organizations operationalize sustainability directives, focusing on the integration of environmental product declarations within engineering practices and information systems. Employing a 13-month ethnographic case study within the global product lifecycle management (PLM) unit of a large multinational enterprise, we apply task–technology fit (TTF) theory to evaluate the effectiveness of current digital infrastructures, including PLM, enterprise resource planning, and product configuration systems. Our findings highlight a critical misalignment between regulatory sustainability requirements and technological capabilities. Engineering managers often rely on manual processes, because of fragmented data systems and limited automation, resulting in inefficiencies and compliance risks. Sustainability is predominantly defined through customer-driven performance metrics focused on resource efficiency at the deployment stage. It is also shaped by multiple institutional logics, where sales follow a market logic, corporate leadership a reputational or ESG logic, and engineering a technical logic. These differences fragment efforts and limit integration. The study achieved a high level of rigor through methodological triangulation of interviews, observations, documents, and system access, combined with insider–outsider researcher roles and reflexive analysis. We recommend improving interoperability and automation of digital systems to streamline sustainability reporting and compliance, and encourage closer alignment among corporate strategy, technological infrastructure, and engineering practices. This study contributes to the literature by showing why integration challenges persist despite regulatory imperatives and underscores the need for strategic investment in integrated technological solutions."

To accurately predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of wet friction components and to address the overfitting and poor robustness often observed in single models, this study proposes an innovative framework that integrates a neural network with a Wiener process model, thereby establishing a novel data–model interaction architecture. The framework gathers multidimensional degradation data from accelerated life tests and uses Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to derive a composite health index. Subsequently, the composite health index is modeled using the Wiener Degradation Process (Wiener) to estimate the RUL. An objective function based on the prediction error is then defined, and the Adam algorithm adjusts the framework parameters dynamically to minimize this function and improve the RUL prediction accuracy. The prediction results suggest that the mean relative error (MRE) of this model is only 4.47%, confirming its accuracy. This method provides a more reliable RUL prediction solution for wet friction component based on artificial intelligence."

    "abstract": "In the past few decades, autonomous driving algorithms have made significant progress in perception, planning, and control. However, evaluating individual components does not fully reflect the performance of entire systems, highlighting the need for more holistic assessment methods. This motivates the development of HUGSIM, a closed-loop, photo-realistic, and real-time simulator for evaluating autonomous driving algorithms. We achieve this by lifting captured 2D RGB images into the 3D space via 3D Gaussian Splatting, improving the rendering quality for closed-loop scenarios, and building the closed-loop environment. In terms of rendering, we tackle challenges of novel view synthesis in closed-loop scenarios, including viewpoint extrapolation and 360-degree vehicle rendering. Beyond novel view synthesis, HUGSIM further enables the full closed simulation loop, dynamically updating the ego and actor states and observations based on control commands. Moreover, HUGSIM offers a comprehensive benchmark across more than 70 sequences from KITTI-360, Waymo, nuScenes, and PandaSet, along with over 400 varying scenarios, providing a fair and realistic evaluation platform for existing autonomous driving algorithms. HUGSIM not only serves as an intuitive evaluation benchmark but also unlocks the potential for fine-tuning autonomous driving algorithms in a photorealistic closed-loop setting."

    "abstract": "Consumer electronics such as smartwatches, fitness trackers, and IoT-enabled medical devices are at the forefront of next-generation connected healthcare systems when integrated with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). These consumer electronics provide transparent, reliable, and patient-centric healthcare when integrated with XAI. Current approaches use centralized AI models that violate data privacy, are non-interpretable, and do not inspire trust in patients. Black-box decision-making further reduces clinical adoption and personalization of interventions in healthcare. In response to these issues, this paper presents a Federated Explainable AI (FedXAI) framework wherein health data is retained on consumer devices and only model updates are shared for collaborative learning. Explainability makes sure that both patients and clinicians understand how AI predictions have been made. The proposed methodology is described for early detection and monitoring of cardiovascular disease using data generated from wearable consumer electronics. Interpretable alerts about irregular heart activity help achieve timely interventions, enhance patient engagement, and support clinical decision-making. Results show FedXAI as an enhancement over existing methods in terms of diagnostic accuracy while keeping data private and increasing trust in an AI-driven healthcare system; thus, it becomes a potential foundation toward future connected healthcare solutions."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a W-band circularly polarized (CP) antenna array utilizing dual split rings and hexagonal lattices for satellite communication (SatCom). The dual split rings are sequentially stacked on top of a multilayer printed circuit board (PCB) and are aperture-coupled by a feeding ring. The magnitude and phase of the induced currents in the dual rings are independently controlled by adjusting the line width and rotation angle to achieve optimal AR performance, while the radius and split gap of the rings determine the resonant frequency. This enables greater flexibility in PCB-based W-band CP antenna design against manufacturing constraints. The feeding ring is excited by a center via post within a hexagonal lattice. The rotational symmetry of this feeding structure facilitates symmetric beam patterns, required for two-dimensional beam steering in SatCom. In addition, via fence surrounding the center via post mitigates mutual coupling caused by surfacewaves. The effectiveness of the proposed design approach is demonstrated by a full-wave numerical simulation and validated through fabrication and measurement. The fabricated 4 × 8 antenna array exhibits VSWR < 2 over 15 GHz (85−100 GHz), a 3-dB axial ratio bandwidth of 2.8 GHz (89.7−92.5 GHz), and a peak right-hand circular polarization gain of 15.7 dBic at 92 GHz. The fabricated array shows beam steering capabilities of ±60° with scan loss up to 4.5 dB at 92 GHz."

    "abstract": "Lithium-ion batteries are essential for clean energy technologies, but their performance degrades over time. Accurately estimating their state of health (SoH) as a key indicator of their degradation is crucial for battery management, especially in electric vehicles and battery energy storage systems. There are many studies focused on SoH estimation, from the simplest least squares regression to more sophisticated ones based on data-driven techniques and neural networks. However, higher accuracy means higher complexity and, generally, higher execution time. In this sense, this paper presents an iterative algorithm that estimates the SoH using a cyclic least squares approach. The robustness of the algorithm is mainly based on an iterative process developed for the calculation of the state of charge, performed through the least squares calculation. The algorithm is improved by the use of an optimized extended Kalman filter to estimate the battery parameters and states. The method is tested under various operational conditions, presenting satisfactory results."

People tend to automatically move their gaze towards the perceived source of sound; therefore, gaze measurement can be used to quickly, easily, and accurately quantify the ability to locate sound. Eye Tracking is practically applicable to solving this problem. The authors present the implementation of a system for real-time eye detection and gaze tracking, head movement compensation by tracking facial reference points, and signal filtering using the Kalman filter. To demonstrate its usability, an application of solution was created to test the reaction time of the tracked object from the moment the sound source is detected, with three testing modes and a comprehensive data collection system. Based on the measured results, the authors identify the limitations of the implementation and propose possibilities for further development of the implemented system. The findings of this work can be used to improve training programs, improve vehicle control, support economic evaluations of aircraft noise impacts, and raise aviation safety standards in future research."

    "abstract": "This paper provides a quantitative analysis of the legacy financial model governing European Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) to establish an empirical baseline for the transition towards a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). The research problem centers on the model’s inherent economic characteristics, particularly its cost inelasticity and risk allocation mechanisms, which are poorly understood in a quantitative sense. The methodology involves constructing a mathematical financial model based on the European performance and charging scheme. This model is calibrated and validated using six years (2018-2023) of detailed financial and operational data from a representative national provider, LPS SR of Slovakia. The results of a 7-year simulation (2018-2024) quantify the ANSP’s financial performance, revealing a massive loss in 2020 followed by a sharp, regulation-driven return to profitability in 2022. The discussion analyzes these findings, concluding that the legacy system is defined by regulatory resilience, where financial risk from demand shocks is transferred directly to airspace users, rather than being absorbed by the provider. This analysis demonstrates that a shift to an SOA is not merely a technical change but a fundamental economic transition from a regulated cost-recovery utility to a market-based system where service providers must assume full financial risk."

Existing counter-UAV (CUAS) solutions frequently rely on radar, radio-frequency detection and optical systems, which are often constrained by computationally intensive classifiers. This paper introduces a geometric motion-based algorithm for aerial object detection and localization that avoids reliance on appearance features or machine learning. The method detects motion pixels in video frames, projects them into threedimensional rays using camera calibration data, and estimates object position by intersecting rays from multiple viewpoints. A proof-of-concept experiment was conducted with low-cost commercially available hardware. Tests with a fixed-wing UAV of 1.8 m wingspan confirmed the ability of the system to reconstruct three-dimensional flight trajectories. Additional observations of avian targets and a passenger airplane at cruising altitude illustrated both the generality of the method and its limitations. The results demonstrate that even with low-cost hardware and lightweight computation, geometric motion-based approaches can contribute to UAV detection and airspace awareness."

To address these issues, this paper proposes an enhanced denoising network based on the U-Net architecture, termed MSDA-UNet. Firstly, a Bidirectional Cross Attention Module (BiCrossGroup) is introduced to capture global geometric structures and long-range semantic dependencies by leveraging bidirectional spatial perception in both horizontal and vertical directions, combined with a cross-group attention mechanism. Secondly, a Multi-scale Enhancement Module (MEM) is designed, which employs a hybrid structure of parallel atrous convolutions and depthwise separable convolutions to generate discriminative multi-scale features through dynamic receptive field fusion. Finally, a Dynamic Grid Upsampling Module (DyGridUpsample) is incorporated to perform pixel-level spatially adaptive reconstruction via a learnable deformable grid, thereby enhancing the recovery of high-frequency details. Extensive experiments conducted on the NWPU-RESISC45 [7], UCMercedLandUse [8] and OPTIMAL-31 [9] datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently surpasses existing mainstream approaches in terms of PSNR and SSIM under high-noise conditions."

The conventional maximum rate of change of torque (CMRCT) implementations often depend on offline inductance lookup tables and complex preprocessing to define the optimal current angle trajectory for the maximum rate of change of torque (MRCT) solution. In contrast, the proposed strategy achieves the MRCT condition by using a proportional-integral (PI) MRCT controller, which directly regulates the EMRCT error from EMRCT index. This EMRCT strategy using a PI MRCT controller eliminates the need for multidimensional inductance tables, significantly reducing control complexity and memory usage. The proposed strategy is validated on a floating-point digital signal processor, and experimental results confirm that it delivers robust, efficient performance under constant torque region without any offline inductance preparation."

Traditionally, the pulse-widthmodulation (PWM) technique with duty cycle modulation is adopted for the AHB converter. However, under the PD3.1 specification with the wide output voltage range feature, conventional PWM control methods might fail. Therefore, a hybrid modulation strategy for AHB flyback converters is proposed in this paper. The pulse-wide-modulation (PWM), the pulse-frequency-modulation (PFM) and the burst mode control are integrated and developed for the hybrid control. With the proposed approach, the AHB converter with wide output voltage range can easily be realized without complex control mechanisms. Besides, the soft-switching feature can be achieved under different control modes to ensure the high circuit efficiency. The developed control strategy can be realized by microcontrollers without adding extra circuit or components. Finally, a 240 W prototype circuit with hardware experiments that demonstrate the performance and feasibility of the proposed strategy."

    "abstract": "This study examines the integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools and immersive technologies within metaverse-based higher education environments, framed by established learning science theories on student engagement [8]–[10]. Specifically, it investigates how the application of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, MidJourney, and Leonardo AI, combined with Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), influences vigor, dedication, and absorption in design learning. The research was conducted within the Tec Virtual Campus, a structured metaverse environment, involving 87 undergraduate architecture and design students in interdisciplinary projects. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining pre- and post-intervention surveys using the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES-S-9) and qualitative thematic analysis of student reflections. Statistical results revealed significant improvements (p < 0.01) in all UWES-S-9 subscales, with large effect sizes for dedication (d = 0.88) and medium-to-large effects for vigor (d = 0.76) and absorption (d = 0.73). Qualitative findings showed that GenAI tools supported creative ideation, narrative development, and the overcoming of creative blocks, while immersive validation in VR/AR enhanced spatial iteration and experiential design quality. This paper contributes by (1) offering a detailed methodological account of AI/XR integration in metaverse-based courses, (2) grounding the approach in engagement and experiential learning theories [8]–[10], and (3) providing empirical evidence of its positive impact on creativity and spatial competencies. Limitations include the absence of a control group, the lack of direct performance-based spatial assessments, and the manual, non-structured use of AI prompts. Future work should explore comparative studies with control conditions, advanced prompt engineering, and longitudinal tracking of learning outcomes."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the issue of degraded accuracy in traditional communication signal recognition under low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) environments by proposing a Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory hybrid network (CNN-LSTM) architecture that jointly leverages spatiotemporal features for signal identification. Conventional CNN models in low-SNR scenarios tend to overemphasize localized spectral features while neglecting temporal dynamic characteristics of signals, whereas standalone LSTM struggles to effectively extract spatial structural patterns in frequency spectra. To resolve this, spatial feature abstraction is performed on the amplitude/phase two-dimensional distribution of FFT spectra through CNN convolutional and pooling layers, capturing distinctive frequency-domain characteristics of modulated signals. Simultaneously, LSTM gated mechanisms model temporal dependencies between signal segments to extract phase continuity characteristics during symbol transitions. This approach effectively mitigates feature ambiguity caused by noise interference in low-SNR conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed joint modeling strategy achieves a 19.2% improvement in recognition accuracy for QPSK and 16QAM signals at 0dB SNR compared to standalone CNN models, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Even though some studies have looked at digital tools used in remote work, there hasn’t been much research on how social media helps with team collaboration. This study addresses that by using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the SEM-PLS Purposive Sampling Method to examine how social media supports teamwork in remote settings. The research included a survey with 406 valid responses from students at Binus University in the Jabodetabek area. The study looks at five key factors that is Social Identification (SI), Perceived Usefulness (PU), Online Knowledge Sharing Behavior (KS), Continuance Intention (CI), and Work From Home (WFH). The findings show that social media improves communication, knowledge sharing, and how well teams work together when they’re not in the same place. This research is special because it uses TAM in the context of social media and teamwork, adding to theory about technology use and giving practical advice to companies that want to improve how they manage remote work."

This study compares two approaches: Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a machine learning model and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as a deep learning model, for binary classification of chest X-ray images into pneumonia or normal condition. Preprocessing techniques were applied to enhance image quality before model training. Model performances were evaluated with several metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrices and training time. Experimental results demonstrated that CNN achieved superior average accuracy with a value of 88% compared to SVM model that only receives 83% in accuracy. The SVM model performed optimally with a poly kernel, yielding the best confusion matrix results and faster training time. In contrast, CNN required larger epoch values and longer training duration to achieve high accuracy. This work highlights the trade-offs between computational efficiency and accuracy for pneumonia detection. Future research involves increasing the size of the training/testing dataset and increasing the power of this model to classify grades of pneumonia severity."

    "abstract": "Hyperparameter optimization plays a pivotal role in the reliability and generalization of machine-learning models for software quality prediction. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of three search strategies: Grid Search, Random Search, and a Hybrid approach applied to the detection of four types of code smells (BLOB, Functional Decomposition, Spaghetti Code, and Swiss Army Knife). Experiments were performed on three open-source Java systems (Azureus, ArgoUML, and Xerces) using Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The results show that all three strategies produce consistent patterns in accuracy and F1-score across the datasets, confirming the robustness of the evaluation framework. Simultaneously, Random Search tends to achieve higher recall for the Functional Decomposition smell, reflecting its ability to explore sparse and irregular hyperparameter spaces. The Hybrid approach combines the exploratory strength of Random Search with the local refinement of Grid Search, offering greater stability with a moderate computational cost. A correlation analysis of software metrics further reveals that while the Blob smell is consistently associated with size and coupling indicators, the other smells—Functional Decomposition, Spaghetti Code, and Swiss Army Knife are captured more indirectly through general structural proxies such as size, cohesion, and coupling. Overall, these findings suggest that hyperparameter tuning not only enhances predictive performance but also provides valuable insights into the structural factors underlying code smells."

Traditional identification of miRNA-disease associations (MDAs) is costly and slow, motivating computational approaches. In this study, we propose HGNNMDA, a hybrid prediction model applying graph neural networks (GNNs) for predicting MDAs. The key novelty of HGNNMDA lies in its interactive dual-branch architecture, where each branch integrates both graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and graph attention networks (GATs) to extract robust features from diverse biological data sources. This design generates complementary feature representations by leveraging GCNs to capture structural associations through neighborhood aggregation, while employing GATs to prioritize the most relevant interactions via attention mechanisms, effectively overcoming limitations of single-architecture GNNs. The obtained feature vectors are then processed by XGBoosts to generate predictive scores, which are subsequently combined for final predictions. HGNNMDA outperforms seven recent methods in experimental validation on three datasets (HMDD v2.0, HMDD v3.2, and an independent dataset) and shows strong results in de novo validation and case studies.

The framework is validated under two hardware implementations: an offline <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$256\\times 128$</tex-math> </inline-formula> SPAD array with PC based processing and a real-time FPGA proof-of-concept prototype with <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$2.4\\mu $</tex-math> </inline-formula>s latency for on-chip integration. Experiments demonstrate robust depth estimation, reflectivity reconstruction, and dynamic event-based representation under both static and dynamic conditions. The results confirm that asynchronous operation reduces redundant background data and computational load, while remaining tunable via simple hyperparameters. These findings establish a foundation for compact, low-latency, event-driven LiDAR architectures suited to robotics, autonomous driving, and consumer applications. In addition, we have derived a semi-closed-form solution for the detection probability of the raw-peak finding based LiDAR systems that could benefit both conventional frame-based and proposed asynchronous LiDAR systems."

    "abstract": "Sonification offers a non-visual way to understand data, with pitch-based encodings being the most common. Yet, how well people perceive slope and acceleration—key features of data trends—remains poorly understood. Drawing on people's natural abilities to perceive tempo, we introduce a novel sampling method for pitch-based sonification to enhance the perception of slope and acceleration in univariate functions. While traditional sonification methods often sample data at uniform x-spacing, yielding notes played at a fixed tempo with variable pitch intervals (Variable Pitch Interval), our approach samples at uniform y-spacing, producing notes with consistent pitch intervals but variable tempo (Variable Tempo). We conducted psychoacoustic experiments to understand slope and acceleration perception across three sampling methods: Variable Pitch Interval, Variable Tempo, and a Continuous (no sampling) baseline. In slope comparison tasks, Variable Tempo was more accurate than the other methods when modulated by the magnitude ratio between slopes. For acceleration perception, just-noticeable differences under Variable Tempo were over 13 times finer than with other methods. Participants also commonly reported higher confidence, lower mental effort, and a stronger preference for Variable Tempo compared to other methods. This work contributes models of slope and acceleration perception across pitch-based sonification techniques, introduces Variable Tempo as a novel and preferred sampling method, and provides promising initial evidence that leveraging timing can lead to more sensitive, accurate, and precise interpretation of derivative-based data features."

In this paper, we propose a data-driven position error compensation method to enhance the positioning accuracy of GNSS-visual-inertial navigation system (GVINS) during GNSS outages. First, we introduce the equivalent inertial navigation system (E-INS), which is an abstraction of sensors such as cameras and inertial measurement units (IMUs) that only have localization capabilities, along with their measurement processing workflows. E-INS is employed to address the challenges posed by the differences in data modalities and measurement frequencies between cameras and IMUs. These differences complicate the design of the neural network. Subsequently, we design an error compensation network (EC-Net). It constructs a mapping between vehicle states and navigation data, enabling compensation of positioning solutions based on historical data when the GNSS signal is unavailable. EC-Net is built using stacked convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and gated recurrent units (GRUs) to effectively capture the spatiotemporal information in vehicle navigation sequences and suppress noise interference from low-cost sensors. Additionally, we utilize a trigonometric function-based Euler angle representation method to process the input features of EC-Net. It avoids the discontinuities at boundaries inherent in radian representations. The experimental results based on public datasets and real-world scenarios demonstrate that, compared to five other widely used methods, our proposed method achieves the highest accuracy during GNSS outages of up to five minutes. This effectively validates the performance of our approach."

    "abstract": "Microgrids (MGs) rely on open communication networks for frequency control to maintain power balance, while channel fading caused by issues such as time delays and packet losses deteriorates system control performance and stability. This degradation severely compromises the safe operation of MGs. The low inertia of the MG and the high volatility of renewable energy sources (RESs) increase the difficulty of MG frequency control. In this article, for the frequency control system (FCS) of MGs under the influence of channel fading, a cooperative control strategy combining secondary frequency control (SFC) and virtual inertia control (VIC) based on an event-triggering mechanism is proposed. First, an MG FCS incorporating a virtual synchronous generator under the influence of channel fading is established. Afterward, using Lyapunov theory and stochastic analysis methods, sufficient conditions are derived to assess the stability and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$H_{\\infty}$</tex-math> </inline-formula> performance of the system under an event-triggered mechanism. Next, the controller gains of cooperative control between the SFC and VIC are obtained by constructing and solving linear matrix inequalities through matrix transformation. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed cooperative control strategy, which integrates SFC and VIC, is rigorously validated through both simulation and experimental testing. This strategy effectively enhances the ability of low-rotational-inertia MGs to handle sudden load changes and RES fluctuations during frequency control, while strengthening their robustness against communication interference."

    "abstract": "Stochastic disruptions such as flash events arising from benign traffic bursts and switch thermal fluctuations are major contributors to intermittent service degradation in software-defined industrial networks. These events violate IEC 61850-derived quality of service requirements and user-defined service-level agreements, hindering the reliable and timely delivery of control, monitoring, and best-effort traffic in IEC 61400-25-compliant wind power plants. Failure to maintain these requirements often results in delayed or lost control signals, reduced operational efficiency, and increased risk of wind turbine generator downtime. To address these challenges, this study proposes a threshold-triggered Deep Q-Network self-healing agent that autonomically detects, analyzes, and mitigates network disruptions while adapting routing behavior and resource allocation in real time. The proposed agent was trained, validated, and tested on an emulated tri-clustered switch network deployed in a cloud-based proof-of-concept testbed. Simulation results show that the proposed agent improves disruption recovery performance by 53.84% compared to a baseline shortest-path and load-balanced routing approach, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including the Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System by 13.1% and the Deep Q-Network and Traffic Prediction-based Routing Optimization method by 21.5%, in a super-spine leaf data-plane architecture. Additionally, the agent maintains switch thermal stability by proactively initiating external rack cooling when required. These findings highlight the potential of deep reinforcement learning in building resilience in software-defined industrial networks deployed in mission-critical, time-sensitive application scenarios."

In this paper, we present a formal analysis of the DD diversity achieved by ODDM modulation along with supporting simulations. Specifically, the analysis and simulations reveal that the asymptotic DD diversity order of ODDM modulation is one, and this order is achieved at lower bit error rate (BER) values for increased frame sizes. We also present low-complexity detector for ODDM modulation based on the Orthogonal approximate message passing (OAMP) algorithm, and show that this detector extracts full DD diversity with the reduced complexity."

    "abstract": "The counter-rotating axial-flux hybrid-excitation permanent magnet (PM) machine is a novel power device specifically designed for counter-rotating propeller (CRP) systems. Cogging torque (CT) can induce vibrations and noise, adversely affecting its dynamic performance and stealth characteristics, necessitating strict suppression. However, the variable-flux and consequent-pole (CP) structure obscure the characteristics of the CT, leading to a lack of a clear theoretical basis for its suppression. To address this challenge, this paper investigates CT suppression in the counter-rotating axial-flux hybrid-excitation PM machines using non-uniform teeth (NUT) and comprehensively analyzes the implementation consequences. Firstly, a general CT model of the counter-rotating axial-flux hybrid-excitation PM machine is established, and the fundamental principles of NUT are derived. Subsequently, the constraints required to achieve a beneficial effect while preventing phase-phase asymmetry are proposed. Furthermore, the impact of the proposed method on the electromagnetic performance of counter-rotating axial-flux hybrid-excitation PM machine is examined, leading to the formulation of optimal angle allocation principles and recalculation of the winding factor. Finally, theoretical analysis is validated through experimental results, demonstrating that the research work effectively guides the application of NUT and enhances the robustness of counter-rotating axial-flux hybrid-excitation PM machine in CRP drive systems."

    "abstract": "Asymptotic state regulation of fully actuated systems (FASs) with time-varying unknown parameters, perturbed input matrices, and nonlinear uncertainties is considered. Compared to the closely related results on FASs with time-varying parameters, the requirement that the time-varying parameters are differentiable and the assumptions imposed on their derivatives in those works are no longer needed in this article, which means that many types of time-varying parameters that were difficult to handle by previous methods, such as those that are continuous and bounded but not differentiable, can now be handled. Furthermore, inspired by the congelation of variables method, a novel robust adaptive method is proposed, which achieves the global asymptotic convergence of the state variables instead of the global boundedness obtained in previous methods, and guarantees the global boundedness of the estimation. In the developed controller, the adaptive part compensates for time-varying parameters, and the robust part overcomes the effects of incomplete compensation and other remaining uncertainties. Moreover, a parallel extension of the developed method to the disturbed case and a discussion on parameter selection are given. Finally, the proposed method is successfully applied to the control of resonant circuit systems and Norrbin ship steering systems."

    "abstract": "Accurately registering breast MR imagesfrom different time points enables the alignment of anatomical structures and tracking of tumor progression, sup porting more effective breast cancer detection, diagnosis, and treatment planning. However, the complexity of dense tissue and its highly non-rigid nature pose challenges for conventional registration methods, which primarily focus on aligning general structures while overlooking intricate internal details. To address this, we propose GuidedMorph, a novel two-stage registration framework designed to better align dense tissue. In addition to a single-scale network for global structure alignment, we introduce a framework that utilizes dense tissue information to track breast movement. The learned transformation fields are fused by introducing the Dual Spatial Transformer Network (DSTN), improving overall alignment accuracy. A novel warping method based on the Euclidean distance transform (EDT) is also proposed to accurately warp the registered dense tissue and breast masks, preserving fine structural details during deformation. It also operates effectively with the VoxelMorph and TransMorph backbones, offering a versatile solution for breast registration. We validate our method on ISPY2 and internal dataset, demonstrating superior performance in dense tissue, overall breast alignment, and breast structural similarity index measure (SSIM), with notable improvements by over 20.9% in dense tissue Dice, 2.1% in breast Dice, and 3.5% in breast SSIM compared to the best baseline.

    "abstract": "Cooperative double intelligent reflecting surface (double-IRS) has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing physical layer security (PLS) in MIMO systems. However, existing studies are limited to narrowband scenarios and fail to address wideband MIMO-OFDM. In this regime, frequency-flat IRS phases and cascaded IRS links cause severe coupling, rendering narrowband designs inapplicable. To overcome this challenge, we introduce cooperative double-IRS-assisted wideband MIMO-OFDM and propose an efficient manifold-based solution. By regarding the power and constant modulus constraints as Riemannian manifolds, we reformulate the non-convex secrecy sum rate maximization as an unconstrained optimization on a product manifold. Building on this formulation, we further develop a product Riemannian gradient descent (PRGD) algorithm with guaranteed stationary convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme effectively resolves the OFDM coupling issue and achieves significant secrecy rate gains, outperforming single-IRS and distributed multi-IRS benchmarks by 32.0% and 22.3%, respectively."

The absence of energy consumption on magnetic flow excitation and the focus on achieving maximum specific performance indicators across a wide range of practical applications make the use of PMSM as electromechanical energy converters in electrical engineering complexes economically attractive. However, a motion transmission and conversion mechanism in electrical engineering complexes creates an insurmountable barrier to improving their energy efficiency and reliability. This article presents an example of optimizing a magnetic system design of a linear magnetoelectric motor as part of a single-stage piston compressor drive. Expressions for independent variables determining the mass and dimensional parameters of the linear magnetoelectric motor are derived. The magnetic field is studied, and the electromagnetic traction force is calculated with application software."

The experiment utilizes a recycled Vaisala RS41-SGP radiosonde, which is planned to be integrated in the future with a certified commercial unmanned aerial system platform, enabling efficient acquisition of detailed atmospheric profiles for simulation and real-world training scenarios. The primary objective is to compare measured temperature, humidity, and pressure values with reference data from a professional Vaisala DigiCORA radiosonde operated by the Slovak Hydrometeorological Authority. The methodology involves a tandem flight of both the recycled and reference radiosonde to ensure robust validation under real-world conditions. Data analysis focuses on quantifying deviations, calculating Root Mean Square Error, and assessing correlations to demonstrate the reliability of the proposed solution, which is critical for evaluating environmental impacts on aviation operations and training. The paper’s findings suggest that this methodology offers a cost-effective alternative for ad-hoc measurements of vertical atmospheric profiles, essential for optimizing UAV training flights, supporting simulation environments, and enhancing the accuracy of meteorological data for training purposes. Meteorological expertise is crucial for interpreting and applying these data in training contexts."

    "abstract": "Spatial disorientation continues to pose a major threat to aviation safety, yet civil pilot training syllabi address vestibular illusions only at the theoretical level. This study presents the conceptual design of a multiaxial aerotrim-based flight simulator developed to provide controlled induction of critical illusions, including the somatogravic, somatogyral, and Coriolis illusions. The system employs unrestricted angular motion in yaw, pitch, and roll, combined with immersive virtual reality, to reproduce illusion-specific motion profiles validated in prior experimental research. Unlike conventional Full Flight Simulators or FNPT devices, which are constrained by motion cueing algorithms and high operational costs, the proposed design offers a technically feasible and economically accessible solution capable of delivering reproducible and safe training scenarios. From a regulatory perspective, the simulator’s modular architecture allows for scalable certification pathways ranging from Other Training Device and Basic Instrument Training Device to FNPT I/II, and potentially Full Flight Simulator, depending on the integrated flight model fidelity. The approach not only addresses a critical training gap but also ensures compatibility with existing instructional frameworks, supporting seamless integration into approved syllabi. By enabling systematic and practical exposure to vestibular illusions, the proposed system bridges the gap between methodological readiness and technical feasibility, thereby strengthening pilot training."

    "abstract": "The emergence of blockchain technology has spawned a broader discussion of designs for digital currencies, with Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) - digital forms of fiat currency - being one of them. An important feature of digital currencies is facilitating transactions without network connectivity, which can enhance the scalability of cryptocurrencies and the privacy of CBDC users. However, in the case of CBDCs, this characteristic also introduces new regulatory challenges, particularly when it comes to applying established Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) frameworks. This paper introduces a prototype for offline digital currency payments, equally applicable to cryptocurrencies and CBDCs, that leverages Secure Elements and digital credentials to address the tension of offline payment support with regulatory compliance. Performance evaluation results suggest that the prototype can be flexibly adapted to different regulatory environments, with a transaction latency comparable to reallife commercial payment systems. Furthermore, we conceptualize how the integration of Zero-Knowledge Proofs into our design could accommodate various tiers of enhanced privacy protection."

    "abstract": "Following the design of more efficient blockchain consensus algorithms, the execution layer has emerged as the new performance bottleneck of blockchains, especially under high contention. Current parallel execution frameworks either rely on optimistic concurrency control (OCC) or on pessimistic concurrency control (PCC), both of which see their performance decrease when workloads are highly contended, albeit for different reasons. In this work, we present NEMO, a new blockchain execution engine that combines OCC with the object data model to address this challenge. NEMO introduces three core innovations: (i) a greedy commit rule for transactions that do not use shared objects; (ii) refined handling of dependencies to reduce re-executions; and (iii) the use of incomplete but statically derivable read/write hints to guide execution. Through simulated execution experiments, we demonstrate that NEMO significantly reduces redundant computation and achieves higher throughput than representative approaches. For example, with $\\mathbf{1 6}$ workers nemo’s throughput is up to $42 \\%$ higher than the one of BlockSTM, the state-of-the-art OCC approach, and 61% higher than the pessimistic concurrency control baseline used."

The proposed setup is developed to comparatively assess the performance advantages of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSMs) when integrated with a pneumatic CVT, as opposed to conventional motor types such as induction machines. The system incorporates a high-torque dual-chain coupling to ensure reliable torque transmission, high-resolution encoders for accurate rotational speed measurements, INA240-based current sensing circuits for enhanced rejection of PWM switching noise, and an eddy current brake for load emulation and torque evaluation. The PMSM is controlled using Field-Oriented Control (FOC), implemented through an IGBT inverter driven by an STM32 microcontroller. In contrast, the induction motor is operated via a standard inverter with RS485 communication interface. Preliminary experimental results demonstrate that the PMSM configuration yields faster dynamic response, more stable torque output, and improved overall efficiency under identical load conditions compared to the induction motor configuration."

A 1-bit transmissive intelligent reconfigurable metasurface with a size of 10×10 operating in the Ka-band is designed. This work analyzes the transmission mechanism of vortex multiplexed beams carrying arbitrary opposite topological charges, and develops an OAM multiplexing tuning scheme based on the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with a shared aperture. Simulation results show that the combined purity of the tunable OAM multiplexing modes generated by the metasurface exceeds 71%, and the isolation between modes is close to -17 dB. This verifies that the OAM metasurface can not only provide reliable transmission performance for vortex multiplexed beams but also adjust the OAM multiplexing order. This work provides an effective solution for improving the spatial utilization efficiency of overlapping propagation directions, and provides a new degree of freedom for OAM multiplexing technology."

    "abstract": "In dynamic wireless transfer (DWPT) systems with series-series (SS) compensation, the active ground coil sections must be switched according to the position of the onboard coil. Closely laying the ground coil sections together and appropriately switching them ensures that the onboard coil is always coupled with one or two of the ground coils. However, switching the sections may lead to a sharp drop in transmission power due to the sudden transition of the operating point of the circuits. This paper proposes a sequencing method for transmitting power continuously while going over a ground coil seam. Shifting the timing of switching the ground coil sections and operating the two ground coils before and after the seam while the onboard coil is over the seam makes the transition of the operating point gradual. This prevents a drop in transmission power. Besides, transmitting power with two ground coils improves the transmission efficiency compared to transmitting power with only one ground coil. By conducting the scale-down experiment, it is confirmed that switching the operating mode has little effect on power transmission and that the maximum current through crossing the seam is reduced from 19A to 12A."

The regenerative DAB converter is utilized to estimate the transformer under test, which is back-to-back connected to another identical transformer, for the purpose of using the same two power converters on both sides. With the help of power regeneration, the power supply needs only to cover the power loss rather than the power rating, thus reducing the burden of experimental equipment. However, due to the practical presence of leakage inductance in the other transformer, a certain amount of voltage drop is induced in the measured waveform. In this paper, the influence of this voltage drop is theoretically evaluated, emphasizing the discrepancy between the actual system and the developed system. To mitigate this discrepancy, the possibility of different transformer combinations is taken into account as well."

The MPC controller is designed to track the reference speed while minimizing both speed error and control effort. The model inside the MPC is constructed based on the speed and acceleration dynamics of the motorcycle through state-space modeling. The designed MPC is then evaluated in a real-time environment using dSPACE Scalexio. To assess its disturbance handling capability, a high-frequency sine wave with an amplitude of 5 km/h is introduced into the vehicle’s longitudinal speed. Two test cases are conducted at cruise reference speeds of 30 km/h and 60 km/h, with the performance of the MPC controller compared against the Proportional-Integral (PI) controller, both with and without disturbance. The results demonstrate that the MPC has a better performance in terms of overshoot reduction and speed regulation, highlighting its potential as a reliable and efficient control solution for electric motorcycles."

    "abstract": "Aiming at the difficulty of extracting valid information from electromagnetic signals under noisy conditions, a joint denoising method based on Double Tree-Complex Wavelet Transform (DT-CWT) and Least Mean Square (LMS) adaptive threshold algorithm is proposed. This method overcomes the strong dependency of traditional wavelet denoising on wavelet basis functions and achieves lower computational complexity compared to empirical mode decomposition (EMD). Experimental results show that the DT-CWT-LMS algorithm significantly improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under various noise intensities and consistently achieves lower root mean square error (RMSE) than other comparison algorithms, demonstrating excellent denoising performance for single electromagnetic signals. In particular, it exhibits stronger suppression of residual noise. However, experiments also reveal a performance degradation of this method when dealing with coupled electromagnetic signals. Further analysis indicates that the Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) algorithm has a strong decomposition capability for coupled signals, but its denoising performance is highly sensitive to parameter settings. This motivates the optimization of VMD parameters to improve its denoising effectiveness for coupled electromagnetic signals."

    "abstract": "With the continuous development of aerial vehicle technology, Aerial Vehicle Multi-Object Tracking has become one of the key technologies in aerial vehicle applications. Due to problems such as incorrect identity recognition and target loss during the target tracking process of aerial vehicles, a multi-object tracking algorithm based on improved YOLOv8 + DeepSORT is proposed. First, in the target detection part, the improved YOLOv8s algorithm is adopted. Its backbone network is changed to ResNet-34 to enhance the detection ability of small targets and adapt to the computing power of aerial vehicles. Then, the positioning loss function of YOLOv8s is improved from CIOU to SIOU to improve the detection accuracy and the regression efficiency of anchor boxes. The tracking module uses the CBAM Attention Mechanism for feature fusion in Deep SORT. Compared with mainstream target tracking algorithms, this algorithm performs well in multiple performance indicators. Among them, on the VisDrone-MOT2019 Dataset, the Tracking Accuracy reaches 64.4%, and the Identity Consistency reaches 72.5%, which is significantly better than traditional target tracking algorithms."

    "abstract": "We present the Distributed Modularization of Thought (DMoT) approach for code generation using several small language models, fine-tuned for distinct phases of the code generation process. Instead of the conventional single-model approach in direct code generation, our DMoT method decomposes the task into a hierarchy of subtasks using hierarchical Multi-Level Reasoning (MLR) graphs. Each phase, from solving simple subproblems to verifying syntax and compliance with initial requirements, is handled by a dedicated fine-tuned model. Models were trained through knowledge distillation from a larger model (ChatGPT-4.1) using a quantized LoRA technique, enabling execution on accessible hardware. Experimental evaluation is conducted on the BigCodeBench benchmark, which includes realistic and complex programming tasks. These results show that a system composed of several specialized small models outperforms single-model approaches in terms of accuracy (pass@1) and structural quality (CodeBLEU). So, small fine-tuned language models can rival and even outperform larger models, offering a resource-efficient path in the code generation processes."

By modifying the physical dimensions of the electric and magnetic field vectors into a common unit, this approach introduces mathematical symmetry into the governing equations and simplifies the numerical implementation. The new framework was verified by solving two-dimensional FDTD simulations which showed comparable accuracy to conventional formulations.

    "abstract": "Efficient resource utilization is vital for terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks (TN-NTN) integration. However, different spatio-temporal resource scales in TN and NTN networks pose challenges for joint resource allocation. To tackle this problem, we propose a joint user scheduling and multi-domain resource allocation scheme in the downlink network, to improve coverage for ground users (GUs). Specifically, the scheme is designed in two time-scales, including large-scale satellite beam-hopping (i.e., spatial resource allocation) and small-scale time-frequency resource allocation. For beam-hopping, we first analyze the coverage of terrestrial base stations (TBS) for GUs, and accordingly propose a joint design of user scheduling and beam-hopping. For time-frequency resource allocation, to cope with the complexity induced by multi-domain and multi-scale resources, we propose a two-step approach which first obtains a preliminary allocation with worst-case co-frequency interference assumption, then employs the genetic algorithm to re-allocate redundant resources, thereby increasing the proportion of successfully served GUs. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme through simulations with different user demands and network service settings. Results show that the proposed scheme provides considerable improvement over existing schemes, which can efficiently reduce co-frequency interference and provide service for more GUs."

Unlike conventional uniform sampling (US), the RDP-NUS accurately extracts key features while efficiently reducing overall data volume without additional data cropping or dimensionality reduction algorithms. Comparative studies demonstrate that the proposed RDP-LFN framework consistently outperforms US-FCN approaches, achieving lower loss with sparse sampled points and various FCN depths. Utilizing the RDP-LFN framework, a single-layer optically transparent UWB AFSR is designed. The measurement of the fabricated prototype exhibits good agreement with numerical simulation, validating the efficacy and feasibility of the proposed method in addressing the challenging requirements for multifunctional electromagnetic devices in modern electronic systems. This is the first attempt to introduce a NUS strategy into neural networks (NNs) enabled FSS design, offering new insights for intelligent design of microwave devices."

Wi-Fi 7 not only scales Wi-Fi 6 with doubled bandwidth, but also supports real-time applications, which brings revolutionary changes to Wi-Fi. In this article, we start by introducing the main objectives and timeline of Wi-Fi 7 and then list the latest key techniques which promote the performance improvement of Wi-Fi 7. Finally, we validate the most critical objectives of Wi-Fi 7 - the potential up to 30 Gb/s throughput and lower latency.

    "abstract": "As an amendment to the deep forest, deep forest regression (DFR) has been recently proposed for industrial process modeling. However, training DFR models is an arduous task in terms of computational cost, which incurs limitations for practical industrial applications, such as soft measurement models of difficult-to-measure key process indices. Therefore, we propose a lightweight and high-precision DFR (LHDFR) algorithm to (1) shrink model size, (2) reduce computation cost, and (3) improve modeling accuracy simultaneously without increasing calculation operations. This algorithm is implemented simply and effectively in a deep ensemble structure. In particular, we utilize an unbiased estimation to weaken the swamping effect of representation features among cascade layers. Furthermore, two different types of decision tree algorithms are applied to the forest algorithms in each layer. Then, we present a gradient enhancement strategy with a step factor among layers to enhance the accuracy of the model. The shrinking layer-by-layer method is employed to take advantage of the depth of the decision tree. The comparative results based on six benmark datasets and an actual dioxin soft sensing application case on municipal solid waste incineration process demonstrate the superior performance of our LHDFR model."

    "abstract": "This paper presents Hydra, a dynamic BFT protocol that allows replicas to join and leave the system dynamically. It addresses the limitations of traditional static BFTs in managing membership changes and can be used to simplify the implementation of many features in modern blockchain applications. Hydra relies on weaker assumptions to achieve standard properties compared to the existing solution Dyno and introduces a configuration auto-transition protocol to ensure liveness. Through temporary configurations and explicitly defined replica responsibilities for request handling, Hydra pipelines membership requests alongside regular requests and realizes clarity, achieving a more efficient and smoother configuration transitions. It also employs a non-blocking configuration discovery mechanism, enabling new replicas to participate in consensus quickly. We formally prove Hydra's correctness under the dynamic BFT model. Experimental results demonstrate Hydra's ability to maintain throughput fluctuations within 5% during various replica join and leave scenarios, outperforming Dyno and existing BFT system supporting reconfiguration in both stability and efficiency. Hydra effectively manages scenarios that Dyno circumvents with stronger assumptions and quickly restores throughput to normal levels."

    "abstract": "Cuckoo Hashing is a well-known scheme for maintaining a hash-based data structure with worst-case constant search time. The search can be easily pipelined in FPGAs to obtain a response every clock cycle. However, inserting new elements may require multiple iterations to reallocate elements due to collisions, a challenge that intensifies with increasing table occupancy (load). Here, we pursue an efficient implementation of Cuckoo Hashing in FPGAs that exploits the inherent parallel processing capabilities of the technology to minimize the insertion time and enhance the performance of real-time applications like communications networks. Our analysis shows that the candidate implementation alternatives can be grouped into four different categories, considering the number of iterations required to perform new element insertions relative to the hash table’s load. Within each category, the performance is similar, providing flexibility for implementation. Among these methods, one exhibits the best results under all load conditions, without incurring a large complexity penalty, reducing the number of iterations for the insertion by more than 60% for loads beyond 95% compared to the most recent works. A Cuckoo Hashing architecture for networking applications is presented and used to evaluate and verify all insertion methods through hardware evaluation. Our implementation improves on existing architectures by at least 0.2 operations per clock cycle."

However, it remains critical challenges for channel state information (CSI) acquisitions of double-RIS systems with ultra-heavy pilot overhead and multi-path interference. This paper proposes a novel channel generation method in double-RIS communication systems based on the utilization of conditional diffusion model (CDM). The CDM model is carefully designed and trained on synthetic channel data to capture the high-dimensional channel characteristics. It addresses the limitations of conventional deep learning-based CSI estimation approaches, such as insufficient model understanding capability and poor environmental adaptability. Then we provide a detailed analysis of the diffusion process for channel generation, elaborating on how CDM is able to acquire CSI efficiently. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CDM based channel acquisition method outperforms benchmarks in terms of normalized mean squared error, achieving an improvement of approximately 18%."

Additionally, the likelihood function is reformulated through theoretical derivation to eliminate covariance matrix inversion, thereby reducing computational complexity. Furthermore, the coati optimization algorithm (COA) is introduced to perform adaptive searching for the actual source position within the signal subspace, effectively compensating for model errors caused by grid mismatch.

For the PD-MZI with a waist diameter of 40 <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mu$</tex-math></inline-formula> m and a taper length of 1.8 cm, within the wavelength range of 1537–1607 nm, the maximum polarization-dependent loss (PDL) reached 19.4 dB. The MZI exhibited nonuniform loss and PDL characteristics, enabling its use as both a wavelength-selective and mode-locking component in nonlinear polarization rotation (NPR) based fiber laser systems. The designed laser achieved a 3 dB spectral bandwidth of 7 nm, a pulse separation of 448.3 fs, and a repetition rate of 21.5 MHz, corresponding to a conventional soliton. Moreover, by adjusting the pump power and cavity polarization state, a soliton molecule state was also observed. Owing to its simple fabrication, compact structure, and high damage threshold, this all-fiber polarization-selective device provides an effective alternative to conventional mode-locking elements in NPR-based ultrafast fiber laser systems."

    "abstract": "This paper examines the controllability of the stator and rotor magnetic flux linkages of doubly fed induction machines (DFIMs), considering small-signal oscillations and their relationship with electromagnetic machine design. To this aim, we first analyze 66 sets of lumped parameters from the dynamic model of a DFIM. Based on this, we classify DFIMs into three categories based on their modal parameters, namely, two for wind applications and one for pumped-hydro applications. Additionally, we identify reciprocal relationships between the damping of both identified oscillatory modes and the largest eigenvalues of the stator and rotor controllability Gramian matrices. Among the different lumped parameters, the winding resistances are found to influence these relationships the most. All analyzed DFIMs for wind applications were found to be less controllable and to exhibit better damping of oscillatory modes than DFIMs for pumped-hydro applications. Furthermore, based on the results of the controllability analysis, we selected three objective function candidates suitable for an optimization procedure aimed at minimizing the energy required to control the rotor flux linkages. An example objective function was evaluated in a multi-objective DFIM design process for wind applications that enables the design of more controllable machines that provide the desired damping of oscillations, which can consequently contribute to improving grid resilience."

    "abstract": "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), with its outstanding features, has developed into a vital technical method for the global detection of maritime and terrestrial targets. However, the unique imaging mechanism intrinsic to SAR inherently produces coherent speckle noise. This noise significantly deteriorates the quality of the image, thereby adversely affecting downstream applications like target recognition and classification. Therefore, research on SAR image denoising holds significant practical and theoretical value. However, due to the limitations of the local receptive field of CNN, it is difficult for it to capture global spatial features. Although Transformer can achieve global spatial modeling, its quadratic complexity results in a large amount of computational overhead. To tackle these issues, this paper introduces RSS-Net, a new denoising network for SAR images, built on an encoder-decoder architecture. RSS-Net demonstrates significant improvements in SAR image denoising performance, due to its ability to extract multi-scale feature information. The network incorporates the Residue State-Space Block (RSSB), which fuses Mamba's Vision State Space Module (VSSM) and a CNN-based Channel Attention Block (CAB). VSSM leverages 2D-Selective Scan (SS2D) better acquires spatial information features in SAR images by scanning in four directions. RSSB efficiently merges Mamba's ability to model long-range dependencies and conventional convolution's strengths in extracting local features. This integration effectively alleviates the common detail blurring problem in existing SAR denoising methods and strengthens the restoration of high-frequency image details. The novel application of the Mamba to SAR image denoising enables the proposed method to attain both long-range contextual dependency modeling and linear computational cost, thus resolving the balance between global modeling capacity and efficiency in computation, while also pointing to new avenues for future research. Experimental evaluations confirm the superior denoising efficacy of the proposed algorithm."

Using electromagnetic transient simulations in DIgSILENT PowerFactory 2022, five operating scenarios are compared following the loss of the largest infeed ($\\approx 63 \\mathrm{MW}$): (1) the current base case with $50 \\%$ generator participation in primary frequency response (PFR); (2) full PFR participation; (3) base case with automatic generation control (AGC); (4) base case with AGC plus a $\\mathbf{3 0 ~ M W}$ battery energy storage system (BESS) providing fast frequency response (FFR); and (5) full PFR with AGC. Key findings show that mandating $100 \\%$ PFR substantially reduces the frequency nadir but does not change the initial rate of change of frequency (RoCoF). A $\\mathbf{3 0 ~ M W}$ BESS delivers rapid inertial support and markedly improves the nadir, yet a short BESS discharge duration can produce a secondary frequency dip when AGC has not fully taken over. The results demonstrate that resilience requires both near-instantaneous FFR and sufficient energy capacity plus coordinated AGC and PFR. The paper recommends a hybrid BESS-conventional procurement and control approach as a practical blueprint for islanded and lowinertia systems."

    "abstract": "Fixed-rate sampling techniques are commonly employed in microcontroller unit (MCU)-based real-time digital control applications, offering simplified analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) process and confined closed-loop pole locations. However, in electric motor control, rotor position is typically obtained from an encoder that generates pulses as the shaft rotates. Due to variable speed, the pulse intervals become non-uniform, leading to a variable sampling rate that prevents the use of fixed-rate sampling. To address this issue, a direct digital control strategy based on a proportional-integral (PI) controller is proposed. By optimizing the controller’s zero location and gain, the drift of closed-loop poles is minimized, ensuring consistent control performance despite variations in current command and load conditions. Experimental validation on a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "This paper implements a symmetric, non-isolated bidirectional DC-DC converter for integration into a Power-Hardware-in-the-Loop (PHIL) motor-driver test bench. The converter equips the electric motor emulator (EME) with an independently regulated, adaptive DC-link, thereby decoupling it from the drive’s fixed common bus and balancing high-speed voltage margin against low/medium-speed efficiency. Required EME voltages are derived by matching current slopes to a target PMSM, and worst-case DC-link sizing follows from spacevector zero-vector conditions. Hardware results show that the adaptive scheme preserves high-speed emulation fidelity comparable to the constant-voltage case while substantially reducing semiconductor and passive losses at lower speeds and improving zero-sequence control margin. The transformer-free topology is retrofit-friendly and requires no changes to the drive under test or to standard EME modulation, offering a practical path to extend speed range and raise efficiency in PHIL applications."

This paper introduces a novel tracking framework which integrates the Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) algorithm with the Particle Filter (PF) in microphone networks. To accurately capture the speech source's complex dynamics, we employ multiple motion models. For each model, several Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) candidates, derived from the generalized cross-correlation (GCC) function, serve as measurements. A multiple-hypothesis likelihood model is then utilized to calculate particle weights, enabling accurate position estimation for each motion mode through a weighted particle set. The final state estimate is obtained by fusing the approximated positions of all motion models based on the IMM algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the superior robustness of the proposed method against noise and reverberation, achieving consistently lower tracking errors compared to existing approaches."

Nevertheless, real execution encounters obstacles including transaction expenses and scalability constraints. This paper delineates essential parameters (gas fees, block size) and architectural elements (off-chain/IPFS storage, on-chain verification) via empirical experimentation and system design. We implement a prototype that executes 21 digital certificate transactions on an Ethereum-based blockchain, documenting gas fees and block sizes. Results indicate that gas costs exhibit considerable variation ($0.0098-$0.06), while block sizes oscillate (505-600 KB), underscoring the interdependencies of cost and scalability. An integrated off-chain/IPFS design decreases on-chain storage requirements by 85% while preserving cryptographic integrity. Our research offers practical recommendations for enhancing blockchain implementations in certificate systems, ensuring a balance among cost, scalability, and security. Subsequent research will investigate Layer-2 methods for gas optimization."

False negative represents the top element with respect to the falsity order and false positive is the bottom element. This gives us the rich language to reason about the expected values of random variables. As an illustration of the applicability of our model, we present a logical version of educational scenario."

Decisions are made by the duty operator of the central security post (CSP). Decisions are made on the issue of dispatching a physical security detail to the facility from which an alarm message has been received under conditions of CSP overload, when all detailes are busy at other facilities. The information stored in the following data is used for decision-making: in AW operation protocols of physical protection systems at centrally guarded facilities; in AW protected facility databases; and based on the results of facility inspections. The paper proposes a list of factors influencing prioritization, generates their importance coefficients based on expert assessments using the Delphi method, and develops a generalized decision-making algorithm. It is shown that, based on the application of the algorithm for automating decision-making in AWs of physical protection systems at centrally guarded facilities, a decision-support system for CSP duty operators can be created."

This paper analyses five potential antenna locations on a representative tactical aircraft-nose, lower fuselage, upper fuselage, vertical tail, wing pylon and dual configuration (upper and lower)—using full-wave electromagnetic simulations in Altair FEKO. The results demonstrate significant trade-offs in coverage performance across positions: nose and tail placements offer directional advantages but suffer from shadowing, while pylonmounted solutions exhibit severe anisotropy. The lower fuselage provides the most balanced air-to-ground coverage, and the upper fuselage ensures robust air-to-air connectivity. The study confirms that no single location achieves omnidirectional coverage; instead, dual placement on upper and lower fuselage surfaces emerges as the most effective and reliable strategy, aligning with both civil and military best practices."

    "abstract": "Cryptocurrencies have transformed financial markets with their innovative blockchain technology and volatile price movements, presenting both challenges and opportunities for predictive analytics. Ethereum, being one of the leading cryptocurrencies, has experienced significant market fluctuations, making its price prediction an attractive yet complex problem. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in predicting Ethereum prices for short-term and few-shot forecasting scenarios. The main challenge in training models for time series analysis is the lack of data. We address this by leveraging a novel approach that adapts existing pre-trained LLMs on natural language or images from billions of tokens to the unique characteristics of Ethereum price time series data. Through thorough experimentation and comparison with traditional and contemporary models, our results demonstrate that selectively freezing certain layers of pre-trained LLMs achieves state-of-the-art performance in this domain. This approach consistently surpasses benchmarks across multiple metrics, including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness. Our research not only contributes to the existing body of knowledge on LLMs but also provides practical insights in the cryptocurrency prediction domain. The adaptability of pre-trained LLMs to handle the nature of Ethereum prices suggests a promising direction for future research, potentially including the integration of sentiment analysis to further refine forecasting accuracy."

    "abstract": "Interoperable blockchain networks require robust redaction control mechanisms to uphold privacy, regulatory compliance, and trust, especially when managing modifications and deletions across multiple autonomous systems. While existing redaction frameworks primarily apply to isolated blockchains, cross-network redaction needs a separate handling process due to varying governance models across chains and inter-consortium trust. In this paper, we propose $\\operatorname{ReAcct}$, a comprehensive redaction control framework for blockchain interoperations that regulates and validates redaction requests across chains. ReAcct refines internal metadata for redaction request and response exchange to protect sensitive information. It also enables proof of redaction across interconnected networks. We present a rigorous system architecture, incorporating a detailed threat and trust model for cross-network redaction control. We implement ReAcct using Hyperledger Cacti as the interoperability layer for redaction request-response communication exchange between Hyperledger Fabric networks and leverage IPFS for distributed storage. Our evaluation shows that $\\boldsymbol{R} \\boldsymbol{A} \\boldsymbol{A} \\boldsymbol{c} \\boldsymbol{t}$ effectively enforces redaction policies across interoperable blockchains, maintaining low performance overhead and demonstrating scalability under increasing workload."

    "abstract": "The growing integration of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) into power system control offers unprecedented adaptability and performance benefits. However, it also introduces new vulnerabilities that can be exploited by adversarial cyber threats. Unlike traditional model-based controllers, DRL agents depend heavily on real-time observations, feedback loops, and learned policies—making them inherently susceptible to malicious manipulation. This paper investigates the cybersecurity and resilience of a DRL-based wide-area secondary controller operating within an autonomous microgrid. Specifically, we evaluate a Deep Q-Learning Network (DQN) agent responsible for maintaining voltage and frequency stability through coordinated decision-making. To assess its robustness, we simulate a comprehensive suite of cyberattack scenarios—including false data injection, strategically triggered backdoors, spoofing, reward poisoning, and coordinated multi-vector attacks targeting both observation and actuation channels of the trained DQN. We also introduce a set of evaluation metrics—including reward degradation, frequency and voltage deviation, and a composite system stability index—to quantitatively assess the impact of these attacks. Our simulation results reveal that even subtle, state-dependent, or reward-level manipulations can significantly degrade control performance while evading detection by conventional monitoring systems. In contrast, high-magnitude sensor attacks result in a complete loss of observability but are easier to detect by system operators. Our experimental results also showed that coordinated attacks that simultaneously disrupt multiple channels induce severe impacts, triggering transient instability in frequency and voltage regulation."

We examined the solutions derived by relevance-zone based solvers on seven L&D problems from the renowned book “<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Life and Death Dictionary</i>” written by Cho Chikun, a Go grandmaster, and found several interesting results. First, for each problem, the solvers identify a relevance-zone that highlights the critical areas for solving. Second, the solvers discover a series of patterns, including some that are rare. Finally, the solvers even find different answers compared to the given solutions for two problems. We also identified two issues with the solver: (a) it misjudges values of rare patterns, and (b) it tends to prioritize living directly rather than maximizing territory, which differs from the behavior of human Go players. We suggest possible approaches to address these issues in future work."

    "abstract": "In distributed satellite communication systems, spatial diversity techniques such as Space-Time Block Coding (STBC) offer an attractive opportunity to enhance the link’s capabilities without additional spectrum consumption. One of the major challenges that still remains is the degradation of the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) at the receiver, primarily due to time misalignment between satellites. This paper presents a robust receiver architecture that demonstrates strong resilience against SINR degradation caused by time misalignment between satellites and maintains robust performance even under additional impairments such as power imbalance and Doppler shifts. Moreover, we present an efficient implementation of the receiver, which combines both software and hardware platforms."

    "abstract": "Pointing control technology is critical for numerous applications such as space communication and target surveillance. The challenge for pointing systems is to achieve the highest possible control accuracy under actuator constraints and various uncertainties, where the typical single-controller structure struggles to deliver the desired performance due to its inherent conflict between different objectives. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a robust model predictive control (MPC) framework enhanced by an uncertainty and disturbance estimator (UDE). The framework incorporates two innovative strategies: 1) a time-varying UDE (TV-UDE) to avoid transient peaking phenomena and ensure reliable disturbance estimation, and 2) a flexible mechanism that dynamically adjusts the range of nominal control based on UDE’s output such that the actuator constraint is fulfilled. This flexible mechanism avoids the usage of offline over-tightened constraints, providing a safe and less-conservative input range for MPC. As far as we know, this paper provides the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">first comprehensive framework</i> for pointing systems, which is capable of maximizing control performance while handling constraints and disturbances. The proposed framework is validated and compared to existing methods through simulations and experiments on a pointing platform, demonstrating the highest servo accuracy under different disturbance conditions."

For these problems, directional algorithms of optimization of initial conditions, i.e. the initial coordinates of controlled objects, with monotonous improvement of the control performance functional at each dual optimization step are proposed. Some of the analytical results have been verified by simulation tests and all omitted proofs have been completed."

This paper introduces a novel deliberation-based consensus mechanism where Large Language Models (LLMs) act as rational agents engaging in structured discussions to reach a unanimous consensus. By leveraging graded consensus and a multi-round deliberation process, our approach ensures unanimous consensus for definitive problems and graded consensus for prioritized decision problems and policies. We provide a formalization of our system and use it to show that the properties of blockchains are maintained, while also addressing the behavior in terms of adversaries, stalled deliberations, and confidence in consensus. Moreover, experimental results demonstrate system feasibility, showcasing convergence, block properties, and accuracy, which enable deliberative decision-making on blockchain networks."

    "abstract": "Blockchains are considered for healthcare data sharing due to their immutability, decentralization, and auditability. However, ledger transparency exposes on-chain identifiers and activity metadata, enabling linkage across pseudonyms and inference over user behavior. Prior work has primarily focused on content confidentiality and access control, while leaving identity unlinkability insufficiently addressed. To this end, we present an approach that integrates Account ion (AA), zeroknowledge proofs (Groth16), and Pedersen commitments. The approach embeds proof- and commitment-based verification into programmable smart contract accounts (SCAs), enabling authentication without disclosing identifiers and decoupling transactions from static keys. We develop a proof-of-concept on the Polygon Amoy testnet using Circom and Solidity, and evaluate privacy under a global, passive, external, static, and computationally bounded attacker. For the ERC-4337 comparison, the attacker is assumed to know user-SCA mappings; for the account-shuffling comparison, the attacker knows one SCA per user. Using entropy metrics and clustering-based inference over on-chain metadata, our approach achieves the maximum entropy of $\\log _{2}(10) \\approx 3.32$ in a ten-user setting (versus 0 for ERC-4337 as specified, i.e., without privacy extensions) and substantially reduces clustering accuracy relative to address shuffling (ARI $0.468 \\rightarrow 0.038$, NMI $0.653 \\rightarrow 0.177$), while maintaining the auditability required for healthcare governance."

However, under traditional pulse frequency modulation control, the LLC-SRC suffers from limited output gain and poor output voltage regulation under light-load conditions. Common improvement techniques include burst-mode control, PWM control, primary-side phase-shift-controlled and secondary-side phase-shift-controlled, and valley switching control (VSC). Compared to these methods, the VSC offers higher light-load efficiency, lower output ripple, and wider output voltage gain range. This study investigates the impact of switching position in VSC control on the efficiency of an LLC-SRC converter. By adjusting the switching to different valley points, higher efficiency can be achieved. The analysis includes circuit operation, valley point characteristics, and loss analysis. Finally, a 1 kW LLC-SRC converter employing full-range valley switching control is implemented, featuring an input and output voltage of $400 V_{D C}$."

To tackle this, we propose a topic modeling approach using BERTopic enhanced with IndoBERT embeddings. The dataset is divided into three categories beach, nature, and temple tourism with each category modeled independently to preserve contextual relevance. Through extensive hyperparameter tuning, the model achieved coherence scores of 0.6147 for nature, 0.5298 for temple, and 0.4539 for beach reviews. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining transformer-based embeddings and multimodal data preprocessing to generate coherent, interpretable topics from Indonesian travel reviews. These findings suggest that BERTopic with IndoBERT is well suited for Indonesian tourism review analysis, offering insights into visitor perceptions across various attraction types."

Grounded analysis and informed decisions are essential skills for investors to succeed in the stock market business. With the advancement of modern technology development, artificial intelligence can be utilized to make predictions of stock prices. Deep learning models have shown potential in making predictions. However, a deep learning model that yields good results for one company’s stock may not perform as well on others. For this reason, this research aims to compare the performance of a well-known deep learning model, CNN-LSTM, with other models on the leading five FMCG companies in Indonesia. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was first applied to each dataset. Then, the datasets were preprocessed and trained using different models with hyperparameter tuning. To measure model performance, metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> score were used.

These results came from more than one model, as CNN-LSTM and LSTM-CNN performed better across the companies. These results may be influenced by the unique fluctuations in each company’s stock price, which could be better captured by different deep learning models."

    "abstract": "Rainfall is a significant natural phenomenon that impacts various sectors of life especially in tropical countries like Indonesia. Rainfall prediction is essential to support planning in agriculture, environmental management, and disaster mitigation. The random forest algorithm is widely used in weather data classification due to its ability to handle complex data. Challenges occur when the data is imbalanced, meaning that the number of instances in each class differs significantly. This condition causes the model to be biased toward the majority class. Data balancing methods such as Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Approach (ADASYN) are used to overcome this issue. This study aims to determine the effect of applying SMOTE and ADASYN on the performance of the random forest algorithm in classifying rainfall data in Bandung City. Evaluation was carried out using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. The results show that the random forest model without balancing achieved an accuracy of only 70.3%, whereas after applying SMOTE and ADASYN the accuracy increased to 84% and 79%, respectively. Precision, recall, and F1-score values also improved significantly. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that SMOTE is more effective than ADASYN in improving the classification performance of imbalanced rainfall data."

First, the ZVS operating mechanism of the SC-HB-DAB is illustrated using vector diagrams across various load conditions. Then, the proposed architecture is analyzed to verify the effectiveness of ZVS operation at light loads and low output voltages. Experimental results demonstrate that the SC-HB-DAB achieves up to a $10 \\%$ efficiency improvement compared to a conventional half-bridge DAB under light-load conditions (below $10 \\%$ of rated power), confirming the performance benefits of the proposed design."

Traditional methods include load-flow analysis and statistical regression, which often fail to capture the inner complexity of relationships among network nodes and time-varying load patterns. To overcome this, we propose a deep learning model called A3T-GCN, which combines graph-based learning for spatial features, recurrent networks for time sequences, and an attention mechanism to focus on the most relevant historical data. We trained and tested this model using hourly data from Bengkulu Province, Indonesia, between January and August 2025. We evaluated the model in six forecasting horizons from 1 hour up to 1 month. The model outperformed others: from the shortest to the longest horizon, with a percentage increase in RMSE at 36.54% and in MAE at 44.54%, the benchmark models exceeded 70% and 100%, respectively. The results show that A3TGCN plays a significant role in improving energy efficiency and maintaining voltage stability, while also serving as a valuable tool for optimizing infrastructure planning and investment strategies in distribution systems."

Existing methods based on the Galois field Fourier transform (GFFT) still rely on error-free polynomials for recognition. The proposed solution to this problem is a blind recognition algorithm with single-error recognition and correction under harsh channel conditions. The approach involves calculating a part of the spectrum, which allows for accurately identifying a received polynomial with a single error and its error position, making it possible due to the property of the finite field of the Galois field, enabling recognition without the need for error-free polynomials. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher recognition performance with lower computational complexity compared to existing methods."

This study, carried out in Qilian County from January 26 to May 2, 2020, introduces a novel approach that integrates optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to map snow cover conditions. Specifically, snow extent was derived from fused MODIS and Landsat-8 OLI data using the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM), which generated 7-day mean Landsat-8 simulated images with a spatial resolution of 30 m. The snow extent was classified using the SNOMAP algorithm. The wet snow extent was identified using a multi-temporal, multi-polarization change detection algorithm applied to Sentinel-1 SAR data, with local incidence angle (LIA) correction. Corrections for dry and wet snow extents were made by estimating the mean elevation of wet snow across different slope orientations. Ultimately, we produced maps of dry and wet snow extents at a spatial resolution of 30 m for every 7-day period. The results demonstrate that the fusion of MODIS and Landsat-8 images performs effectively, with R² values between the corresponding bands of simulated and real images exceeding 0.73. The extent of dry and wet snow in the study area exhibits significant variability with temperature and undergoes multiple melting processes. The method proposed in this study enables continuous and detailed monitoring of large-scale snowmelt processes, providing essential scientific support for extensive studies on energy, climate, and the water cycle."

    "abstract": "Online gaming performance is highly dependent on low latency, as even small delays can disrupt gameplay and reduce competitiveness. Türk Telekom provides both fiber and DSL-based internet connections. In DSL connections, interleave modes have a significant impact on latency. This study investigates the effect of two interleave modes, interleave-0 (fastpath) and interleave-16, on gaming performance, focusing on their influence on ping values and connection stability. Experimental measurements were conducted on multiple DSLAM and modem types, both with and without IPTV service. This paper indicates that interleave-0 mode can substantially reduce ping times and download latency, in some cases nearly halving them (e.g., from 22 ms to 13 ms for ping and from 55 ms to 17ms for download latency on H-chassis DSLAMs with 100 Mbps connections). This improvement leads to smoother online gameplay and an enhanced user experience. The study used Huawei and ZTE modems across H- and V-chassis DSLAMs, providing actionable insights for ISPs."

    "abstract": "The stochastic resonance (SR) method enhances the weak periodic signal by transferring the noise energy to that of the weak signal, and is regarded as an excellent tool to extract weak signal from strong noise environment. Among the various SR methods, the classical bistable SR (CBSR) method is the most widely use one due to its simplicity and conciseness, but the output saturation phenomenon exhibited by the CBSR limits its weak signal enhancement ability, resulting in unsatisfactory signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) thresholds for detecting weak signals. Aiming at overcoming the output saturation issue of CBSR and further reducing the SNR detection threshold, this paper proposes a new under-damped unsaturated piecewise asymmetric bistable stochastic resonance (UDUPABSR) method by taking advantage of a newly established unsaturated bistable potential function as well as a newly constructed second-order SR system. Furthermore, the output SNR of the proposed UDUPABSR method is determined to represent the capability of weak signal enhancement, and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is used to optimize the corresponding system parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by using both simulated weak periodic signals and real rolling bearing fault datasets of different fault types. Validation results show that the proposed method has better weak signal enhancement ability in terms of noise suppression and signal augmentation in comparison with existing SR methods."

To address these issues, we propose an adaptive ground-air collaboration that integrates roadside unit (RSU) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) networks. Unlike existing methods with a fixed UAV configuration, our system dynamically learns when to deploy or retract UAVs based on real-time conditions, thereby improving aerial resource utilization. We introduce UDMP-CTOP, a two-timescale hierarchical framework based on proximal policy optimization (PPO), which consists of UAV deployment management (UDMP) and collaborative task offloading (CTOP). A multi-objective utility function is designed to minimize system costs while ensuring regional fairness, preventing localized performance degradation during global optimization. In addition to learning optimal policies for task offloading and cache placement, we address the underexplored cache replacement problem under edge memory constraints. To this end, we propose a fuzzy logic-based cache replacement (FCR) mechanism that considers data recency, frequency, and volume. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithms achieve superior task success rates and low system costs under diverse conditions, yielding higher total utility across various topologies while reducing UAV energy consumption."

However, coordinating various homes is a nontrivial task due to uncertainties regarding renewable energy, user behavior, and the concern of privacy disclosure. The complex properties of household appliances further put forward requirements for the decision-making procedure. To solve these, this article proposes a novel federated transfer framework based on a teacher–student learning paradigm for the energy optimization process. The pretrained model based on an open-source building environment is introduced to assist the learning procedure under a cross-domain adaption mechanism, which avoids the time-consuming learning process from scratch. Considering household appliance discrepancies, a hybrid proximal policy optimization method with discrete-continuous action space is proposed to schedule these devices optimally. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method in terms of training performance, cost efficiency, and comfort level."

    "abstract": "Open-vocabulary grasping is essential for enabling robots to operate robustly in open and dynamic real-world environments. Current methods typically focus on predicting grasp poses from fused cross-modal features. The coupling of visual features and textual semantics in the feature space results in scene-level representations. However, such representations lack object-level discrimination, thereby limiting the model’s ability to recognize and generalize to novel targets. Moreover, existing positional encoding methods employed in cross-modal modeling lack the capacity to effectively capture spatial relationships between regions, which limits the model’s spatial reasoning performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose a method that combines Structured Semantic Disentanglement with Attention Diffusion (SDAD) for open-vocabulary robotic grasping. Specifically, to improve the semantic disentanglement in cross-modal features, a language-guided Disentanglement strategy that regularizes the feature space is proposed to disentangle target semantics features and conditional semantics features. To further improve spatial context modeling, we introduce an attention diffusion mechanism inspired by Fick’s law, which describes natural diffusion driven by concentration gradients, enabling attention to propagate smoothly from condition-feature-anchored regions across the scene. The target features are subsequently used to complete the matching and localization of the corresponding object regions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in open-vocabulary grasping tasks. Moreover, in real-world scenarios, the proposed model achieves a grasp success rate of 84% on base categories and 66% on novel categories, outperforming the state-of-the-art method GLIPv2 by 7% and 5%, respectively."

    "abstract": "Privacy-preserving federated learning (PPFL) is a strong-privacy distributed learning paradigm, which typically employs secure aggregation (SA) protocols to protect the aggregation results of federated learning. However, the high computational cost of existing SA protocols is difficult to generalize to decentralized federated learning (DFL) with the large number of clients and fails to defend against model poisoning attacks launched by Byzantine adversaries. In this paper, we propose an efficient computational SA protocol compatible with DFL, referred to as PriDFL, and address the issue of Byzantine-robust aggregation. Specifically, we design an advanced secret-sharing protocol based on number-theoretic transformations to reduce the computational complexity from <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$O(n^{2})$</tex-math></inline-formula> to <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathcal {O}(n\\log n)$</tex-math></inline-formula> during data sharing. We employ a single-mask approach to provide lightweight gradient privacy protection for DFL. To mitigate the impact of poisoned gradients on model convergence, we develop a Byzantine resilience criterion grounded in model cross-updating. The proposed criterion efficiently detects poisoned gradients and non-independent identically distributed (non-IID) data with local computation. Security analysis shows that PriDFL satisfies the security requirements in an honest but curious setting. We evaluate PriDFL on typical datasets (e.g., MNIST and CIFAR-10) and the results show that PriDFL is computation-communication efficient and Byzantine resilient. In particular, PriDFL optimizes the computational efficiency by 6-10× compared to the well-utilized SA protocols while supporting Byzantine robustness."

    "abstract": "Constant envelope orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (CE-OFDM) has attracted increasing attention as a power-efficient modulation scheme for Internet of Things (IoT) networks, particularly in energy-constrained scenarios such as space–air–ground integrated networks (SAGINs). Despite its inherently low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), CE-OFDM suffers from significant bit error rate (BER) degradation due to nonlinear phase wrapping caused by phase modulation. To address this limitation, we propose a selective mapping (SLM)-aided CE-OFDM scheme, in which the transmit sequence with the minimum number of phase jumps is selected from a pre-defined set of candidates. This strategy effectively mitigates the impact of phase wrapping and significantly improves BER performance. Furthermore, to eliminate the spectral overhead caused by conventional side information transmission, we propose an embedded side information (ESI) mechanism that seamlessly incorporates index data into the transmitted signal without requiring additional bandwidth. Simulation results verify that the proposed SLM-aided CE-OFDM scheme, equipped with ESI, achieves substantial BER improvements over conventional CE-OFDM systems, while maintaining the low-PAPR property essential for energy-constrained IoT devices."

Mobile data collection, employing mobile collectors, mitigates these issues but introduces electricity shortages due to limited battery capacity. This paper addresses the core research problem of minimizing charger deployment costs while ensuring uninterrupted power for mobile collectors in long-running LSM-WSNs. We formulate the Minimum-Cost Charger Deployment (MCCD) problem, prove its NP-hardness, and establish its equivalence to the Overflow-Free MCCD (OF-MCCD) problem. By refining constraints and transforming OF-MCCD into a Minimum-Cost Submodular Cover (MCSC) problem, we propose a greedy algorithm with an approximation ratio of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$ln\\gamma +1$</tex-math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\gamma$</tex-math></inline-formula> is a system parameter.

Semi-monolithic crystals have the potential to combine the timing capabilities of pixelated crystals and the 3D positioning accuracy of monolithic scintillators. In this work, we present a preclinical PET prototype consisting of 2 rings defining an inner diameter of 106 mm and an axial length of 52 mm. Each ring contains 14 arrays of 1 × 22 LYSO slabs of 0.97 mm × 25.6 mm × 12 mm, coupled to 8 × 8 SiPMs arrays. The sensitivity, spatial resolution, count rate performance and image quality were studied using the NEMA NU 4-2008 protocol. All images were reconstructed using the MLEM algorithm with 0.5 mm voxel size, including DOI information and normalization correction. A mean spatial resolution for all measured positions and across the three directions (axial, transaxial and radial) of 1.61 ± 0.19 mm was obtained at the center of the FOV. A peak sensitivity of 3.5% was obtained at the center of the scanner, for an energy window (EW) between 358 keV -664 keV. The noise equivalent count rate peak reached 106.9 kcps for an activity of 11.7 MBq using the mouse-sized phantom, the same EW window and a time coincidence window of 10 ns. For the image quality phantom, contrast recovery coefficients of 0.20, 0.62, 0.75, 0.81 and 0.85 were found for the 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 mm rods, respectively. Spill-over-ratio values of 0.10 for air-filled and 0.23 for water-filled cylinders were measured. Also, according to the Rayleigh criterion, 1.5, 1.2 and 1 mm hot spots of a micro-Derenzo phantom were well distinguished."

These innovations are driven by a vast array of interconnected wireless entities, including IoT devices, access points, UAVs, and CAVs, which increase network complexity and demand more advanced decision-making algorithms. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), especially reinforcement learning (RL), are key enablers for such networks, providing solutions to high-dimensional and complex challenges. However, as networks expand to multi-agent environments, traditional online RL approaches face cost, safety, and scalability limitations. Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) offers a promising solution by utilizing pre-collected data, reducing the need for real-time interaction. This article introduces a novel offline MARL algorithm based on conservative Q-learning (CQL), ensuring safe and efficient training. We extend this with meta-learning to address dynamic environments and validate the approach through use cases in radio resource management and UAV networks. Our work highlights offline MARL’s advantages, limitations, and future directions in wireless applications."

    "abstract": "Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) can mitigate the straggler problem due to unbalanced training time of clients in Synchronous Federated Learning (SFL), thereby reducing the aggregation time and improving the training efficiency. However, AFL introduces training bias since different updating frequencies of heterogeneous clients can cause unequal knowledge contributions to the global model. Meanwhile, if the client data are heterogeneous, the local optimum may be drifted from the global one, which exacerbates the training bias problem. In order to solve the above issues, we propose a Knowledge Alignment framework for AFL with Heterogeneous Data, termed as KAFL-HD. Firstly, considering data heterogeneity, a data quality-aware aggregation method is proposed to estimate client contributions precisely, where both model staleness and data quality are utilized in aggregation weights. Secondly, a knowledge distillation method with staleness is designed to supplement more knowledge from slow clients to the global model. Thirdly, an adaptive learning rate adjustment method is proposed to customize the local learning rate based on the aggregation frequency and weight, which aligns the knowledge contributions of clients in the local training process. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis under a non-convex setting to show the convergence speed of KAFL-HD. Finally, comprehensive experiments are conducted, and the results show that KAFL-HD achieves the highest accuracy and fairness performance compared to the state-of-the-art baselines."

To the best of our knowledge, the 2189 nm wavelength is the longest wavelength ever achieved via Raman generation or other nonlinear optical processes in tellurite glass microresonators. We also constructed and analyzed a theoretical model incorporating four nonlinearly interacting Raman modes. The model accounts for two modes in the first cascade and two in the second.

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology and Internet of Things technology, cyber–physical systems (CPSs) have also been fully developed, which promotes the widespread use of CPS in a variety of areas and brings many new opportunities and challenges. This article considers the consistent identification of finite impulse response (FIR) systems with multilevel quantized observations subjected to data tampering attacks. First, a defense algorithm based on known parameters is designed for the case where the attack is known. Second, on the basis of the algorithm with known attack, a joint consistent estimation approach is proposed for estimating system parameters, and the convergence and asymptotic normality of the algorithm are proved. Then, according to the asymptotic normality of the algorithm, the trace of the defense algorithm’s asymptotic error covariance matrix is used as the defense index to establish the optimal defense model. Finally, the effectiveness of the defense strategy is verified through experiments."

    "abstract": "Significant progress has been made in class-incremental (learning new classes without forgetting old ones) and domain-incremental (adapting to data from different distributions) semantic segmentation for remote sensing images. However, in real-world deployment, class-space changes and distribution shifts may co-occur between old and new data. Existing incremental learning methods typically address only one type of shift, struggling to handle joint class and domain incremental learning. To achieve class-domain incremental segmentation, we propose CDISeg, a novel framework that enables cross-domain knowledge accumulation through feature synthesis. CDISeg employs a temporary style encoder while repurposing the segmentation model’s backbone as the content encoder. By enforcing orthogonality between their outputs, the model disentangles image content from style, thereby preserving domainspecific style features throughout incremental learning steps. The framework synthesizes old-domain features by projecting old-domain styles onto new-domain content, which supports the preservation of old knowledge, extends new classes to past domains, and facilitates the learning of old classes over new-domain images. Additionally, we introduce class-aware style randomization to enhance feature disentanglement and improve synthesis quality. Extensive experiments on ISPRS and Open-EarthMap datasets demonstrate the remarkable superiority of CDISeg in enabling models to progressively acquire new classes from new domains while recognizing all learned classes across all encountered domains."

    "abstract": "In the Machine Learning as a Service paradigm, a service provider (e.g., a server) hosting a model offers inference APIs to clients, who can send their queries and receive the inference results. While most recent secure inference works focus on addressing privacy issues, they overlook the importance of checking the service quality and reliability. A malicious server may deviate from the protocol specification to deliberately provide incorrect services such as using low-quality models. Thus, it is necessary to design new solutions to empower clients to verify the server’s model accuracy and inference integrity while protecting both parties’ privacy. We present Conan, a new secure and reliable inference framework against malicious servers to achieve accuracy verification, inference integrity, and privacy simultaneously. In Conan, the server first commits to the model and proves in zero-knowledge that the committed model achieves the claimed accuracy. Then both parties perform secure inference on the committed model against the malicious server. To instantiate the above framework, we design generic maliciously secure two-party computation (2PC) protocols with a fixed corrupted party, which may be of independent interest. Our protocols achieve high efficiency by utilizing the advantage that the semi-honest party can check the behavior of the corrupted party. Furthermore, they support both arithmetic and Boolean circuit evaluation, a crucial attribute for secure inference on complicated machine learning models. We implement the fixed-corruption 2PC protocols for our secure and reliable inference. The experimental results show 1 ~ 2 orders of magnitude improvements over conventional maliciously secure protocols in terms of communication and computation costs."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a customer-focused resilience enhancement planning framework in power distribution systems considering a leader-follower approach under appropriate regulatory mechanisms. The regulator, distribution system operator (DSO), and customers are the key players in this framework, implemented through a three-step process. Firstly, the regulator establishes a penalty-reward model (PRM). Subsequently, the revenue-cap regulation is applied, and finally, customers' participation is incorporated through a leader-follower approach, modeled using a bi-level optimization problem. This approach considers the individual objectives of the DSO (as the leader) and interested customers to invest in self-generation (as followers), reflecting the accuracy, realism, and practicality of this framework since each entity looks for optimizing its own objective. Furthermore, the incentives provided by the DSO for customers' participation are directly modeled into the objectives of both the leader and followers. The proposed stochastic bi-level optimization problem, which takes the form of a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, is solved using a reformulation and decomposition technique based on the column-and-constraint generation. Deploying the IEEE 33-bus test system exposed to a hurricane, the capability of the proposed framework is validated in enhancing the energy supply resilience under the regulatory objectives while achieving economic benefits for all involved entities."

The computational tractability advantages of DC-OPF problems come at the expense of inaccuracies relative to AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problems that accurately model the nonlinear steady-state behavior of power grids. This paper proposes an algorithm that significantly improves the accuracy of the generators' active power setpoints from DC-OPF problems with respect to the corresponding AC-OPF problems over a specified range of operating conditions. Using sensitivity information in a machine learning-inspired methodology, this algorithm tunes coefficient and bias parameters in the DC power flow approximation to improve the accuracy of the resulting DC-OPF solutions. Employing the Truncated Newton Conjugate-Gradient (TNC) method, a Quasi-Newton optimization technique, this parameter tuning occurs during an offline training phase, with the resulting parameters then used in online computations. Numerical results underscore the algorithm's efficacy with accuracy improvements in squared two-norm and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\infty$</tex-math></inline-formula>-norm losses of up to 90% and 79%, respectively, relative to traditional DC-OPF formulations."

One key application is in aerial image mosaics, where seams often arise between images captured by aircraft. Blending large-scale mosaics, however, typically requires access to global image information, resulting in high memory demands. Prior work has addressed this challenge either through interactive local blending or by leveraging high-performance computing (HPC) systems with distributed memory.In this work, we present an out-of-core blending approach that processes large mosaics tile by tile using an iterative Poisson solver. Our method leverages a downsampled global mosaic to guide local blending, eliminating the need to load the full-resolution dataset into memory. We further introduce two adaptive execution strategies that vary the number of solver iterations per tile, improving both efficiency and quality. We demonstrate our approach using large orthomosaic datasets from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), and implement the pipeline using the SYCL programming model for cross-platform portability."

The TAC is activated upon detection of output voltage deviations and provides auxiliary current paths to accelerate the charging or discharging of both the output and compensation capacitors. This results in a significant reduction in output voltage recovery time. To maintain low power consumption, the TAC remains inactive during steady-state operation. The proposed design is implemented using a 0.35 μ m CMOS process. Experimental results demonstrate that the TAC reduces transient recovery time by a factor of nine and effectively suppresses output voltage ripple compared to conventional architectures, thereby confirming its superior transient performance and practical viability."

To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel point cloud completion network that integrates self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to jointly enhance global context understanding and local detail restoration. Our model adopts an encoder-decoder architecture combined with a GAN framework to improve completion fidelity and geometric consistency. Experimental results on multiple public datasets show that the proposed method achieves significant improvements in average Chamfer Distance (CD) compared to the baseline model PF-Net. Moreover, qualitative visualization results and robustness experiments further validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "With the heightened security requirements for critical areas within water supply stations, the need for enhanced security in key zones such as distribution rooms and pump houses has grown significantly. Real-time monitoring serves as a pivotal component in ensuring the operational maintenance of these facilities. Existing embedded intelligent perception systems, which integrate traditional security measures with deep learning, can improve automated detection capabilities. However, they commonly struggle to balance energy consumption with real-time performance. To address this, this paper proposes Resnet50-MHC, a progressive hierarchical inference image classification model based on Resnet50. This model detects abnormal human behaviour and environmental anomalies in critical station areas. It employs multi-task training through hierarchical labelling and, during inference, aligns multi-level classification tasks with model layers from coarse to fine. This progressive inference optimises power consumption and real-time performance for classification tasks. Practical testing on NVIDIA Jetson Nano and Huawei Atlas 200I DK A2 edge computing platforms demonstrates that compared to the original ResNet50, ResNet50-MHC achieves classification accuracy improvements of 3.06% and 3.07% respectively across both platforms. Inference speed increases by 42% and 50%, while average power consumption decreases by 22.6% and 7.1%. These experiments conclusively validate the model's effectiveness in enhancing detection accuracy, real-time performance, and energy efficiency, thereby providing an energy-saving and high-performance technical solution for intelligent security at water supply stations."

However, traditional texturing methods are often time-consuming, require specialized artistic skills, and face scalability challenges across diverse assets. To overcome these limitations, this research introduces an AI-assisted, region-aware texture transfer framework that leverages generative AI models to efficiently extract textures from real-world images and seamlessly apply them to 3D models within virtual environments. Our approach aims to accelerate the asset creation pipeline, minimize manual effort, and enhance the visual quality of metaverse graphics.We explore two complementary methods: a guided prompt-based texture generation technique that synthesizes context-aware textures using textual prompts, and a segmentation-based method that employs region-aware segmentation for precise texture application on targeted areas of 3D objects.Experimental tests conducted across two datasets reveal that segmentation guidance significantly improves texture fidelity. On the SNED dataset, the segmentation-based method outperforms guided prompting with a 10.1% increase in CLIP similarity, a 12.7% reduction in LPIPS, and a 75.7% improvement in ResNet50 cosine similarity. On the IKEA dataset, while the improvements are more modest—such as a 2.5% increase in CLIP score and an 8.3% reduction in LPIPS—the segmentation-based method still performs competitively overall, despite a slight 1.4% drop in ResNet50 cosine similarity.These findings affirm the strong potential of generative AI to facilitate faster, more diverse, and higher-quality texture generation than conventional manual methods, enabling more efficient and scalable content creation in metaverse environments."

    "abstract": "For moiré-based alignment technique, to meet the increasingly precision requirements, the alignment marks are designed to be more complex and larger in area. However, the space on the wafer for placing the alignment marks is very narrow. Therefore, advancing the miniaturization of alignment marks is a key direction for the development of this technology Unfortunately, the mainstream frequency-based misalignment value analysis algorithms are challenging to apply to small-area alignment marks, as traditional filters struggle to accurately extract useful information from the frequency spectrum of the detection signal. To this end, we propose a neural network for analyzing moiré fringes based on convolutional attention filters(CAFN), which can achieve a direct mapping of small-area moiré fringe images to misalignment value. Experimental results show that on our test dataset, the average error of CAFN is 0.7nm, with a processing speed of 100 Hz."

    "abstract": "We present a deployment-oriented, privacy-preserving speaker-verification pipeline purpose-built for end-to-end encrypted chats. All nonlinear acoustic modeling and embedding extraction run on the user device, while the cloud performs only fixed-point cosine matching and a single threshold comparison via secure multiparty computation, so that the verifier learns only a one-bit accept/reject decision. Integer templates are rendered cancelable with per-tenant salts, enabling revocation and cross-realm unlinkability throughout the template lifecycle. To align evaluation with deployment arithmetic, we introduce a decision-only calibration procedure that operates in the same fixed-point regime as inference; it uses isotonic regression with binomial-uncertainty intervals to select operating points without exposing scores. Empirically, the system yields accuracy comparable to its plaintext baseline at matched operating points on standard VoxCeleb protocols, maintains stable operating characteristics under a unified tie policy across floating-point, fixed-point, and multiparty computation instantiations, and exhibits latency and communication footprints compatible with interactive use. The design further generalizes across conditions (e.g., duration and noise) and to a low-resource language. We release trial lists, per-threshold tables, and code to support independent audits. Overall, this work should be read as a feasibility study rather than a ready-to-deploy product: our goal is to surface the trade-offs and limitations of privacy-preserving speaker verification in realistic encrypted messaging environments, not to claim production-grade performance. Within this feasibility scope, our contribution is an engineering integration under end-to-end encryption and MPC constraints: (i) a practical split-inference architecture that keeps all non-linear acoustics and embeddings on device; (ii) a fixed-point, decision-only calibration pipeline that is numerically aligned with the secure deployment regime; and (iii) a revocable, unlinkable template mechanism instantiated via per-tenant salts and orthonormal transforms, consistent with ISO/IEC 24745. In contrast to HE-based schemes that homomorphically evaluate large parts of the embedding network or PLDA-based MPC designs that assume server-side access to embeddings, our verifier outsources only cosine-family matching and a single threshold comparison under MPC, never exposing raw audio, float embeddings, or plaintext templates. Together, these elements offer a pragmatic path to piloting privacy-preserving speaker verification in controlled encrypted channels without relaxing end-to-end encryption guarantees."

    "abstract": "Daylighting is critical for energy efficiency and occupant well-being in fitness centers. Deep floor plans and high occupancy densities present challenges for daylight distribution while simultaneously offering opportunities to enhance performance through architectural cavities. However, current design practice often relies on intuition and trial-and-error approaches, resulting in suboptimal cavity utilization and potential glare or thermal penalties. To address these limitations, we employ an enhanced genetic algorithm (E-NSGA-II) to optimize cavity parameters—including size, location, orientation, and quantity—within a parametric two-story gymnasium model. The optimization aims to maximize daylighting performance while minimizing glare and artificial lighting energy consumption under relevant design constraints. The performance of candidate designs is evaluated through annual daylight simulations (Daysim/Radiance) to derive key metrics including spatial daylight autonomy (sDA), useful daylight illuminance (UDI), and daylight glare index (DGI). This study achieves the first synergistic optimization of architectural cavity parameters with human visual comfort and circadian rhythm health by incorporating health-related lighting metrics—such as autonomous daylighting ratio and effective daylight illuminance—into a multi-objective optimization function. Experimental results demonstrate that the optimized cavity configuration reduces lighting energy consumption by 12–18% while elevating the Universal Daylight Index (UDI) to 78.4%. This ensures occupants remain within a biologically effective light environment during the majority of their activity time, providing a viable pathway for architectural design to transition from experience-driven to data-driven approaches."

However, the continuous monitoring of rectal or vaginal temperatures poses challenges owing to hygiene concerns and the stress it imposes on pigs. This article presents a novel water-supply device that enables automatic stress-free oral temperature measurements during voluntary drinking. By capturing oral temperature during water intake, the device supports continuous monitoring without causing discomfort to the pigs. For accuracy, a measurement-and-counting algorithm is implemented to identify valid temperature data and prevent interference between oral and water temperatures. After integrating the algorithm into the device, its effectiveness for water delivery and accurate oral temperature measurements is evaluated. Experiments conducted on a farm confirmed the reliability of the device for measuring oral temperatures in pigs. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that oral temperature, as determined by the application of the algorithm, has the potential to serve as a reliable surrogate for core body temperature. The device using this algorithm and its extensive results are presented in detail."

This article proposes a standardized 6G edge–cloud IoT framework for continuous environmental perception and mental health monitoring in university campuses. The architecture integrates distributed edge intelligence with cloud-scale analytics over ultra-reliable low-latency 6G links, enabling privacy-preserving, real-time feedback and large-scale coordination. Edge nodes execute local inference and federated learning to keep sensitive data on-site, while the cloud layer performs global model fusion and cross-campus analytics. Comparative benchmarking demonstrates that the proposed hybrid architecture outperforms cloud-only and edge-only designs in latency, energy efficiency, scalability, and privacy preservation. Importantly, the framework aligns with emerging 3GPP 6G architectural standards, ETSI MEC reference models, and IoT interoperability protocols such as MQTT and OPC UA, ensuring portability and regulatory compliance. A campus deployment scenario illustrates how standardized edge–cloud collaboration can drive adaptive interventions such as ventilation and lighting control to support student well-being.

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral image classification (HSIC) is a valuable method for identifying coastal wetland vegetation, but challenges like environmental complexity and difficulty in distinguishing land cover types make large-scale labeling difficult. Cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL) offers a potential solution to limited labeling. Existing CDFSL HSIC methods have made significant progress, but still face challenges like prototype deviation, covariate shifts, and rely on complex domain alignment (DA) methods. To address these issues, a feature reconstruction-based CDFSL (FRFSL) algorithm is proposed. Within FRFSL, a Prototype Calibration Module (PCM) is designed for the prototype deviation, which employs a Bayesian inference-enhanced Gaussian Mixture Model to select reliable query features for prototype reconstruction, aligning the prototypes more closely with the actual distribution. Additionally, a ridge regression closed-form solution is incorporated into the Distance Metric Module (DMM), employing a projection matrix for prototype reconstruction to mitigate covariate shifts between the support and query sets. Features from both source and target domains are reconstructed into dynamic graphs, transforming DA into a graph matching problem guided by optimal transport theory. A novel shared transport matrix implementation algorithm is developed to achieve lightweight and interpretable alignment. Extensive experiments on three self-constructed coastal wetland datasets and one public dataset show that FRFSL outperforms eleven state-of-the-art algorithms. The code will be available at https://github.com/Yqx-ACE/TIP_2025_FRFSL."

Existing L2C methods oversimplify interaction between human and AI by relying on a single, global user model that neglects individual user variability, leading to suboptimal cooperative performance. Addressing this, we introduce L2CU, a novel L2C framework for human-AI cooperative classification with unseen users. Given sparse and noisy user annotations, L2CU identifies representative annotator profiles capturing distinct labeling patterns. By matching unseen users to these profiles, L2CU leverages profile-specific models to complement the user and achieve superior joint accuracy. We evaluate L2CU on datasets (CIFAR-10N, CIFAR-10H, Fashion-MNIST-H, Chaoyang and AgNews), demonstrating its effectiveness as a model-agnostic solution for improving human-AI cooperative classification."

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for IoT applications has driven the need for precise and scalable indoor positioning systems (IPS). Among existing techniques, Wi-Fi round trip time (RTT), introduced by the IEEE 802.11mc standard, offers high accuracy but suffers from scalability limitations due to the frames specifically sent for localization purposes. While fingerprinting can improve system scalability compared to multilateration, it relies on computationally intensive machine learning algorithms, which can be challenging to deploy on resource-constrained IoT devices. This article proposes a novel approach to improve the scalability and efficiency of Wi-Fi RTT fingerprinting solutions. The proposed system aims to simplify clustering and feature selection tasks by sorting RSSI measurements, thus eliminating the need for more complex algorithms. Experimental evaluations, in scenarios with varying densities of access points (APs), demonstrate significant performance gains compared to state of the art approaches. In high-density scenarios (e.g., one AP per 22 m2), the proposed system achieves an RMSE below 50 cm, a decrease of almost 98% in the memory used by the device, and supports location requests of up to 124 simultaneous Wi-Fi users, representing a 7.8% increase in scalability compared to previous proposals. These results highlight the potential of the proposed system to achieve a good compromise among accuracy, scalability, and complexity, making it a viable solution for IPS implementation in IoT environments."

    "abstract": "Reliable symbol detection in wireless communications is often challenged by rapidly varying channel conditions, especially on resource-constrained platforms. To address this issue, we propose AdaLiteNet, a lightweight channel-adaptive neural network for symbol detection. AdaLiteNet adopts a symbol-by-symbol detection strategy with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units, reducing size of parameters to 51.3 K while preserving temporal dependencies. A two-stage framework is employed: (1) LiteNet, an offline-trained general detector initialized with joint-channel datasets, and (2) AdaLiteNet, an adaptive detector fine-tuned online when decoding performance drops. In addition, a multi-point collaborative detection algorithm enriches training data by exploiting distributed receivers. Experiments with real-world Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast (ADS-B) signals demonstrate that AdaLiteNet increases the decoding success rate by about 20 percentage points compared with the pulse-position modulation (PPM) baseline on low-quality datasets. Further tests on simulated Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) and 16-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (16-QAM) signals confirm strong adaptability under dynamic channels. Moreover, the lightweight design enables AdaLiteNet to achieve near real-time inference on resource-constrained platforms, making it a practical solution for deployment on IoT edge devices."

However, round complexity remains a significant challenge, especially in high-latency networks. Some works can support multi-input AND and thereby reduce online round complexity, but they require <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">exponential</i> communication for generating the correlations in either preprocessing or online phase.

    "abstract": "Point cloud registration is a central theme in computer vision, with alignment algorithms continuously improving for greater robustness. Commonly used methods evaluate Euclidean distances between point clouds and minimize an objective function, such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). However, these approaches are most effective when the point clouds are well-prealigned and issues such as differences in density, noise, holes, and limited overlap can compromise the results. Traditional methods, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP), require choosing one point cloud as fixed, since Euclidean distances lack commutativity. When only one point cloud has issues, adjustments can be made, but in real scenarios, both point clouds may be affected, often necessitating preprocessing. The authors introduce a novel differential entropy-based metric, designed to serve as the objective function within an optimization framework for fine rigid pairwise 3D point cloud registration, denoted as Iterative Differential Entropy Minimization (IDEM). This metric does not depend on the choice of a fixed point cloud and, during transformations, reveals a clear minimum corresponding to the best alignment. Multiple case studies are conducted, and the results are compared with those obtained using RMSE, Chamfer distance, and Hausdorff distance. The proposed metric proves effective even with density differences, noise, holes, and partial overlap, where RMSE does not always yield optimal alignment."

    "abstract": "Ozone pollution suppresses plant photosynthesis and reduces crop yields, yet many global assessments still rely on indicators or models that are difficult to compare across regions. We propose a concise and scalable remote sensing index, called Ozone Vegetation Exposure Intensity ( VEI<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O<sub>3</sub></sub> ), that combines near-surface ozone concentrations with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to characterize the spatiotemporal distribution of vegetation ozone exposure. Using global observations from 2003 to 2019, we find pronounced spatial and seasonal contrasts, with higher exposure in industrialized and densely vegetated regions, particularly during spring and summer in the Northern Hemisphere. VEI<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O<sub>3</sub></sub> is consistently associated with independent vegetation metrics: regions of higher ozone exposure generally correspond to lower Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF), indicating ozone-induced stress on vegetation activity. In site-level evaluations using the Community Land Model (CLM5.0) and FLUXNET eddy-covariance data, we identify a new potential critical ozone concentration of 42.38 ppb, which yields improved performance over the traditional AOT40 (Accumulated exposure Over a Threshold of 40 ppb) in broad, non-cropland contexts – suggesting it can complement existing ozone exposure indices. VEI<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O<sub>3</sub></sub> can be operationalized for ozone risk management: for example, by screening hotspots to prioritize field inspections and expand monitoring networks; by serving alongside AOT40 as a metric for evaluating seasonal mitigation plans and issuing alerts during peak growing seasons; and by coupling with land-use and crop distribution data to support emission-control planning and scenario analysis. Key limitations of our current approach include reliance on monthly ozone and NDVI products (with uneven monitoring coverage), a predominantly linear statistical framework that does not capture time lags or nonlinear dose–response behavior, and the absence of explicit stomatal-flux representation. Priorities for future work include controlled experimental validation, integration of VEI<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O<sub>3</sub></sub> with stomatal flux schemes in land-surface models, expansion of ground observations in data-sparse regions, and testing of alternative vegetation indices with stricter cloud and reflectance screening. VEI<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O<sub>3</sub></sub> represents a new remote sensing index for detecting vegetation ozone exposure. The critical levels and model-improvement directions inferred here should be treated as potential references that, with further validation and refinement, can help bridge the gap between observations, models, and policy, ultimately providing a reliable remote-sensing-based decision support tool for managing risks to ecosystem productivity and food security."

    "abstract": "Elevation multi-channel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) with digital beamforming (DBF) capability can significantly enhance system gain by virtue of scan-on-receive (SCORE) technology, becoming the core system for achieving high-resolution and wide swath. A thorny issue arises from radio spectrum reuse, known as radio frequency interference (RFI), which will degrade SAR signals and affect the application of SAR images. Compared to single-channel systems, elevation multi-channel SAR offers enhanced degrees of freedom in range, enabling improved RFI resolution. Furthermore, prior knowledge of RFI locations facilitates precise RFI suppression. In this paper, an RFI geolocation method using two-dimensional beam modulation of the DBF-SCORE SAR system is proposed. In the first step, based on the aperture motion and the mutual modulation of the SAR and RFI antenna patterns, the zero Doppler moment of the RFI is estimated. In the second step, based on the modulation of the SCORE beam on the RFI down-range, the slant range of the RFI is estimated. Finally, the range- Doppler equations are established to solve the RFI coordinates. The effectiveness of the proposed method is supported by the measured RFI-contaminated data collected by an air-ground joint experiment from the X-Band 16-channel DBF-SAR system."

    "abstract": "Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are critical infrastructure components in modern Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) services, playing a vital role in both civilian and defense applications. These systems operate in specific frequency bands that are also utilized by other Earth Observation technologies, such as GNSS-Radio Occultations and GNSS-Reflectometry. Other passive microwave remote sensing techniques such as microwave radiometers, work with very faint signals in nearby frequency bands within the L-Band. However, the increasing prevalence of Radio-Frequency Interferences (RFI) poses a significant threat, potentially compromising the integrity and reliability of PNT services, and corrupting geophysical observations. Effective RFI mitigation relies on accurate detection and classification of interference sources, a task that becomes increasingly challenging due to the complexity and diversity of RFI signals. This work presents an automated classification system for RFI detection and characterization in GNSS bands. The methodology employs advanced digital signal processing techniques and statistical algorithms to improve RFI detection and classification. RFI events are then stored in a long-term database to provide insights into the local spectrum, and to aid in mitigation and law enforcement efforts. This study provides a description of the classification system, including its architecture, implementation, and performance analysis. The results highlight the potential of this system to enhance the resilience of GNSS PNT services against RFI."

    "abstract": "In environments where GPS signals are weak, interfered, or unavailable (e.g., urban canyons, large steel-structured factories, hangars, or multipath-dense zones), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) autonomous return-to-home and landing face amplified localization errors, trajectory drift, and end-phase alignment difficulties. To address these issues, this paper proposes a three-stage visual recognition-assisted precision landing system for GPS-degraded conditions: (1) Approach Guidance (AG) employs overhead or rooftop cameras to detect UAV body/markers and estimate pose, enabling early correction of lateral and heading deviations; (2) Backup End-Phase Recognition (BEPR) activates within the final altitude window (≈1 m) when the primary visual pipeline degrades due to occlusion, backlight, overexposure, or blur, leveraging onboard vision fused with IMU and optical flow (CFC-CKF framework) under conservative control laws to ensure safe descent and alignment; (3) Post-Landing Verification (PLV) uses side or ground cameras to read UAV-attached codes/markers, independently measuring landing-point offset, heading error, and attitude stability while logging slip/bounce events. The system integrates sliding-window filtering and systematic bias correction [7], nested (double-layer) marker design, covariance-feedback Cubature Kalman Filter (CFC-CKF) vision–inertial fusion, image-space visual servoing, and real-time latency budgeting. Simulation and flight tests cover frontlight/backlight/low light, varying occlusion levels, GPS error levels, and dynamic platforms. Representative results show mean landing errors of ≈2.0 cm under favorable static scenarios, ≈4.0 cm under complex scenarios, and ≈3.8 cm verified offsets in PLV, with success rates of 90–98%. These results align with recent state-of-the-art systems and demonstrate engineering robustness through backup and verification loops."

    "abstract": "This study focuses on real-time Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) speech quality assessment. It thoroughly analyzes the root causes of complexity in traditional Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ) algorithms (based on ITU-T P.862 [1]) and proposes an improved PESQ algorithm. By examining the sources of complexity in preprocessing, feature extraction, auditory modeling, and quality scoring, three core improvement strategies are implemented. In feature extraction, the wavelet transform replaces the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), while linear cepstrum filters simplify the computation of the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC). For auditory model optimization, the number of filters is reduced from 24 to 8, while segmented linear compression replaces exponential compression. The computational architecture incorporates multithreaded parallel processing and GPU acceleration. Experimental results demonstrate that the improved algorithm reduces computational complexity by 56%, lowers processing latency to 12.8ms, and achieves high consistency with the original PESQ algorithm [1], effectively meeting the requirements for real-time VoIP evaluation scenarios (latency < 20ms)."

    "abstract": "This article describes the design and implementation of a solar-powered smart agriculture sensor node system with integrated cloud-based visualization. At its core, the system is an ESP32 microcontroller integrated with multiple environmental sensors for measuring soil temperature and moisture, pH, conductivity, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium (NPK) concentration, carbon dioxide (CO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>), total volatile organic compounds (TVOC), particulate matter (PM2.5), ambient temperature, humidity, and light intensity. The collected data is displayed on a local LCD module and transmitted via the Zigbee protocol in a star topology to a central coordinator, which then forwards the data to a Raspberry Pi server. Data storage and visualization are implemented using a SQLite database and a Node-RED dashboard, while Cloudflared Tunnel ensures secure remote access without the need for a static IP address. To reduce power consumption, an intermittent sensing strategy is combined with the deep sleep mode of ESP32, reducing the average current to 14.6 mA. This enables approximately 28 days of battery-powered operation, which can be extended to 50 days with solar-assisted charging. The system’s compact modular design is highly scalable and cost-effective, making it ideal for large-scale agricultural deployment. Results demonstrate the system’s ability to achieve reliable long-term operation, real-time monitoring, and sustainable energy independence."

    "abstract": "Serial redundant robotic manipulators improve operational flexibility, especially in unstructured environments or tasks demanding high accuracy, outperforming conventional robot arms. Obstacle avoidance is a fundamental capability for robots to function efficiently in workspaces. This paper proposed a novel constrained obstacle avoidance approach to ensure effective collision avoidance as well as accurate end-effector trajectory tracking for redundant robotic manipulators under joint position constraints, without employing inverse kinematics solutions. In the proposed control structure, the first layer accomplishes obstacle avoidance, accounts for physical limitations, and effectively resolves the inverse kinematics problem. The second layer is employed to control the robot arm to achieve objectives established in the initial stage. By applying Lyapunov theory, the stability of the closed-loop system is clearly demonstrated under a given condition. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is verified on a three-degree-of-freedom planar robotic manipulator via intensive simulation results."

    "abstract": "Fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles (FCHEV) are recognized for their high efficiency and reduced environmental impact. The effectiveness and durability of these vehicles hinge on well-designed energy management strategies (EMS). While traditional reinforcement learning methods, such as Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithms, have shown good potential, they trade off challenges like slow convergence, less accurate power allocation, and limited flexibility under varying driving conditions. This paper proposes a Quantum Soft Actor-Critic (QSAC)-based EMS that uses quantum computing techniques to improve performance for solving these problems. By utilizing quantum-based state representations, policy optimization, and parallel computation, QSAC greatly enhances learning efficiency and decision-making precision. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that QSAC achieves faster, more stable reward convergence compared to standard SAC. Moreover, QSAC optimizes power distribution, reducing wear on the fuel cell and battery while extending their operational life. This quantum-enhanced EMS offers a reliable and efficient solution for advanced FCHEV systems, paving the way for wider adoption of quantum computing in automotive control applications."

    "abstract": "Layer 1 blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum suffer from scalability issues, limiting their throughput and latency. In response, Layer 2 solutions have emerged for off-chain transaction processing to improve performance with distinct metrics, such as throughput, latency, transaction fees, etc. This paper proposes a rigorous decision-making framework for the evaluation and selection of Layer 2 blockchain solutions. The framework employs a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach, integrating key performance metrics, including throughput, latency, decentralization, data availability, adoption, transaction fees, and total value locked (TVL). First, we performed metric normalization to standardize evaluation criteria such as throughput, latency, decentralization, and transaction fees. Second, we collected real-world data for Layer 2 solutions, including Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Starknet, and zkSync Era, and applied a weighted composite scoring mechanism. Third, we incorporated 25 distinct evaluation profiles to reflect diverse real-world application needs, such as prioritizing scalability, decentralization, or cost efficiency. Results across 25 profiles illustrate that preferences over metrics materially affect the ranking of L2s, underscoring the need for profile-aware selection rather than a one-size-fits-all choice. Sensitivity analysis further validated the robustness of the rankings by measuring the impact of varying parameter weights. This approach provides a transparent, data-driven tool for stakeholders, facilitating the selection of optimal Layer 2 solutions tailored to decentralized application requirements and advancing blockchain scalability."

A novel control method, combining Variable-Frequency and Phase-Shift (VFPS) control, is proposed to address these limitations. This VFPS control aims to enhance conversion efficiency, mitigate the reduction in voltage pulse width in the resonant tank, and ensure zero-voltage switching (ZVS) under conditions of coil misalignment. A prototype BWPT system operating at 96 V and 48 V on both terminals, delivering a rated power of 240 W, is developed for experimental evaluation. Coil distances of $30 \\mathrm{~mm}, 35 \\mathrm{~mm}$, and 40 mm, corresponding to lateral misalignments of $0 \\mathrm{~mm}, 5 \\mathrm{~mm}$, and 10 mm, are tested. Compared to conventional phase shift control, the proposed VFPS strategy demonstrates average conversion efficiency enhancements of $3.0 \\%$, $4.5 \\%$, and $5.3 \\%$ at coil misalignments of $0 \\mathrm{~mm}, 5 \\mathrm{~mm}$, and 10 mm, respectively. Therefore, the enhancement of conversion efficiency by the proposed VFPS control strategy can be determined."

    "abstract": "Breastfeeding is essential for infant nutrition, but the increasing number of women returning to work before weaning highlights the need for efficient and comfortable milk expression methods. Traditional breast pumps rely solely on vacuum suction, which can cause discomfort, tissue damage, and longer extraction times compared to natural nursing. This study aims to develop a breast pump that better mimics the biomechanics of infant breastfeeding to improve comfort and efficiency. We investigated two actuator designs–membrane and soft pleated–integrated into the breast shield to replicate infant sucking. The pleated actuator proved most effective, offering a wide range of expansion and contraction. Unlike traditional pumps, vacuum is applied through radial expansion, allowing the nipple to widen rather than elongate, closely simulating infant tongue movements. The breast shield was fabricated using additive manufacturing with soft, elastic materials, enabling complex geometries and varied stiffness. The prototype was tested against a commercial pump using an artificial breast phantom. Results suggest this design can enhance milk output, reduce pumping time, and improve user comfort. By merging soft robotics with biological insights, our approach offers a promising alternative to conventional breast pumps."

    "abstract": "Bag packing is widely used in logistics due to its flexibility and convenience. It is important for a firm to reduce the use of bags, not only to cut costs but also to protect the environment and promote sustainable waste management practices. In this study, we propose a novel Three-Dimensional Bag Packing Problem (3D-BGPP) which aims to pack a set of items into a set of flexible bags considering rotation. A mixed-integer linear programming model is formulated. We show that this problem is strongly NP-hard.To solve the problem more efficiently, we develop a hybrid combinatorial Benders decomposition-Beam Search algorithm (CBD-BS). This algorithm decomposes 3D-BGPP based on the combinatorial Benders decomposition, where the master problem is solved by an enhanced model and the slave problems are solved by a novel extreme point-based beam search as well as mathematical programming. Specifically, the beam search algorithm addresses the challenge of representing unused space in flexible containers and uses a limited tree search to construct promising packing solutions. The overall algorithm is further enriched with valid inequalities, variable fixing and other acceleration techniques. Computational experiments are conducted on both real order data provided by an e-commerce company and generated instances. The results show that CBD-BS can obtain high-quality solutions within seconds in small and medium scale instances, and within minutes in large scale instances."

The presence of abundance unlabeled data offers a chance to explore methods that could significantly improve SER systems. This study explores the feasibility of enhancing general speech models by incorporating unimodal and multimodal training objectives derived from unlabeled data, specifically tailored to extract emotional content. These multimodal objectives aim to refine <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">self-supervised learning</i> (SSL)-based representations that, while effective in SER, were not originally created to extract emotional cues from speech. Our methodology introduces a set of multimodal objectives focused on capturing information from three primary sources: acoustic signals, through a representation objective based on the extended <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Geneva Minimalistic Acoustic Parameter Set</i> (eGEMAPS); facial expressions, via visual representations obtained from a pre-trained facial expression recognition system; and textual content, through pseudo-labels generated by a pre-trained emotion sentiment model. These objectives are automatically generated from 70.7 hours of unlabeled emotional content captured in naturalistic settings. We apply our strategy to four state-of-the-art SSL-based speech models, aiming to enhance their capabilities in SER tasks with multimodal signals while still keeping inference strictly audio-only. Our experimental evaluations across the CREMA-D, MSP-IMPROV, and MSP-Podcast datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves SER performance, especially in settings with limited labeled data."

Among these, single-phase faults are the most common type and passive elements such as Peterson coils have been traditionally employed to mitigate their impact and maintain a reliable power supply. However, these solutions come with inherent drawbacks, including limited flexibility and functionality, which hinder their effectiveness in dynamic grid scenarios. This work presents a novel system designed to ensure high-quality power supply continuity before, during, and after single-phase faults. The proposed approach uses already installed four-leg power converters in the grid, eliminating the need for additional passive equipment. A new control strategy is developed in the natural <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$abc$</tex-math></inline-formula> reference frame, which enables the use of classical control techniques in the MIMO system and simplifies the analysis of the output voltage loops without changing the reference frame. Simulations and experimental results confirm that the proposed control framework effectively compensates for faults and maintains grid stability, improving fault resilience in MV distribution networks."

    "abstract": "Future Internet-of-Things networks are envisioned to use small and cheap sensor nodes with extremely low power consumption to avoid the extensive use of batteries. To provide connectivity to a massive number of these nodes, backscatter communication (BC) is emerging as an energy- and cost-efficient technology exploiting the reflection of radio frequency signals. However, challenges such as round-trip path loss and direct link interference (DLI) between the carrier emitter and the reader limit its performance. To tackle these limitations, this paper proposes a joint access point role selection and a novel beamforming technique for bistatic BC in a distributed multiple-input multiple-output setup. The proposed approach boosts the received backscattered energy while effectively mitigating DLI, thereby reducing the error probability. We also propose a channel estimation method tailored to operate under DLI conditions and propose a mismatch detector using estimated channel coefficients. Furthermore, we derive a closed-form expression for the probability of error for the detectors and model the quantization noise caused by DLI. Finally, comprehensive simulation results show that the proposed method with 1-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) effectively mitigates DLI, reduces the quantization noise, and enhances backscattered signal energy, achieving performance comparable to the benchmark scenario with 8-bit ADCs."

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology is a key enabler for 6G Internet of Things (IoT) networks due to its efficient spectrum utilization and functional integration. By leveraging reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), ISAC systems can dynamically manipulate propagation environments, enhance signal quality and coverage in complicated scenarios, particularly for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks. This paper proposes a novel framework for jointly optimizing trajectory and beamforming in RIS-aided ISAC systems, where the downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-enabled UAV network is considered. The framework aims to maximize the average achievable rate (AAR) by jointly optimizing UAV trajectory, base station (BS) beamforming, and RIS phase shifts, under communication and sensing constraints. The maximization problem is decomposed into three subproblems, i.e., BS beamforming optimization, RIS phase shift and UAV trajectory design. Successive interference cancellation (SIC) is employed to transform the first two subproblems into semidefinite programming (SDP) problems, and the non-convex trajectory optimization is addressed by using the successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RIS-UAV-assisted system significantly outperforms traditional ISAC schemes in terms of communication and sensing efficiency. Simulation results also reveal the superiorities of the joint optimization algorithm compared to its counterparts."

At the core of QSJP, we propose a novel Secure Multi-Party Quantum Scalar Product (SMQSP) protocol, supported by a Secure Multi-Party Quantum Summation (SMQS) scheme that enables privacy-preserving and efficient aggregation of intermediate results. The SMQSP protocol leverages Fourier entangled states and GHZ states to achieve scalable and efficient scalar product computation with polynomial complexity. We further validate the correctness and practicality of the proposed framework through circuit simulations on IBM Qiskit."

    "abstract": "Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) plays a crucial role in applications such as autonomous driving, environmental monitoring, and industrial inspection. However, the small size of targets, their blurred edges, and complex backgrounds often result in significant limitations of existing methods in terms of feature synergy and edge information utilization. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an Edge-Semantic Synergy Network with Edge-Aware Attention (ESSNet) for Infrared Small Target Detection. ESSNet substantially enhances detection performance by explicitly reinforcing edge information and optimizing multi-level feature interactions. Specifically, the Edge-Semantic Synergy Module (ESSM) leverages edge details at the lowest level and semantic information at the highest level to achieve long-range level modulation, thereby enhancing the synergy between edges and semantics. Additionally, ESSM integrates a Multi-Scale Edge-Aware Attention (MSEA), which embeds edge features into the attention mechanism through explicit edge supervision, effectively improving the accuracy of boundary detection. Furthermore, the Multi-Level Feature Fusion (MLFF) module is introduced to mitigate semantic loss during the decoding process via a layer-wise guidance mechanism, preserving the structural integrity of detected targets. Experiments conducted on the SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K datasets demonstrate that ESSNet significantly outperforms existing methods on key metrics, achieving state-of-the-art performance."

    "abstract": "Recently, remote sensing image captioning (RSIC) has become an emerging research hot spot that requires models to understand and describe remote sensing images. However, the huge modal gap between vision and text makes that it is difficult to achieve accurate cross-modal transformation for RSIC. Existing methods usually directly transform the vision modal into the text modal based on the multi-task learning strategy or visual attention mechanism, which do not make full use of existing prior information to build explicit cross-modal knowledge for vision and text transformation. Considering to utilize the ability of cross-modal alignment in the vision-language model (VLM), we propose a novel dual prompts aware cross-modal semantic interaction and fusion network for RSIC. It can explicitly dig out potential entity concepts and predict scene class in the images. And it further builds dual prompts to achieve cross-modal interaction and fusion, which can build cross-modal common semantic space to provide prior information for caption generation. Specifically, we first introduce an entity-concept exporter to obtain explicit entity concepts in the image based on pre-setting entity space. Next, we design a multi-scale scene predictor to obtain fine-grained visual semantic features and scene class. Then, we propose a prompt aware cross-modal interaction module to build cross-modal common semantic space as intermediate connection for caption generation. Finally, we further design a prompt aware attention fusion module for the transformer decoder, which can utilize cross-modal prompt features to generate accurate captions. We conduct extensive experiments on three challenging datasets, including UCM-Captions, RSICD and NWPU-Captions, and our method achieves SoTA performance. In the typical remote sensing image captioning dataset RSICD, our method achieves 3.3% and 20.0% improvement in BLEU@4 and CIDEr respectively, which show the effectiveness of our method."

This paper reviews recent advances in multiband absorbers, frequency selective surfaces (FSS), and polarization converters, emphasizing their operating principles, structural configurations, and performance trade-offs. Particular attention is given to the dimensional and resonator aspects of metasurfaces, highlighting how unit-cell geometry, periodicity, and resonant structures directly influence (1) absorption efficiency, angular stability, and operating frequency in absorbers, and (2) spectral selectivity, bandwidth control, and miniaturization in FSS, and (3) conversion efficiency, bandwidth, and polarization purity in polarization converters. These interdependent parameters provide key guidelines for designing compact yet high-performance metasurfaces across different functionalities. Multiband absorbers exploit impedance matching and multi-resonant unit-cell to achieve near-unity absorption across multiple frequency bands, with applications in stealth, electromagnetic interference (EMI) suppression, and RF energy harvesting. FSS structures integrate nested or hybrid resonators within subwavelength cells to deliver high selectivity, angular stability, and miniaturized filtering for communication and radar systems. Polarization converters extend metasurface functionality by enabling linear-to-linear and linear-to-circular transformations within ultra-thin platforms, addressing the growing demand for polarization-agile devices in modern wireless and sensing applications. By identifying limitations and opportunities, this review underscores the role of multiband metasurfaces as enabling technologies for next-generation EM systems."

These problems are further complicated since the entire system has interdependencies ranging from battery capacity limitations, nonlinear charging characteristics, energy demand variability, and even time windows for delivery. To effectively handling EVRPs, this study proposes an innovative hybrid optimization framework, that combines the Mountain Gazelle Optimizer (MGO), reinforced learning, and dimensionality reduction techniques. More in detail, the MGO model is used with some mutations to improve the effective local search performance for discrete optimization problems. Reinforcement learning reduces dimensionality in this form of a problem, thus providing an efficient exploration of solution space for quality solutions. In addition, an adaptive charging strategy is integrated into the framework to adaptively change the distribution of energy and the schedules for charging so as to save on operational costs and improve delivery efficiency. Extensive experiments are conducted using benchmark datasets, and results show the proposed framework is superior to all other world-class methods in managing and controlling EVs. A total cost saving of 12% is obtained, proving the method is solid and scalable. This is very promising for the future of EV logistics, providing answers to route and schedule issues into practice in the future of green transportation."

    "abstract": "The escalating threat of cyberattacks on real-time critical infrastructures poses significant risks to public safety, necessitating detection methods that can effectively capture complex system interdependencies and adapt to evolving attack patterns. Traditional real-time anomaly detection techniques often produce excessive false positives due to their statistical sensitivity to high data variability and class imbalance. To address these limitations, recent research has explored modeling causal relationships among system components. However, prior work predominantly focuses on offline causal graph-based approaches that require static historical data and fail to generalize to real-time settings. These methods are fundamentally constrained by: (1) their inability to adapt to dynamic shifts in data distribution without retraining, and (2) the risk of catastrophic forgetting when lacking timely supervision in live systems.

    "abstract": "Robotic grinding of additively repaired blades with local deformation relies heavily on on-machine measurement for high-precision surface reconstruction, with line laser scanner being widely utilized for its rapid response capabilities. However, due to high curvature and reflective properties of blades, the prevailing Hessian matrix-based centerline extraction algorithms exhibit certain limitations, such as noise points and deviations caused by diffraction and scale mismatch, respectively. Therefore, this study presents a novel stripe centerline extraction algorithm to enable rapid and accurate blade reconstruction with two stages. In stage I, the image is pre-processed to segment the laser stripe into multiple ROIs (Regions of interest), where the continuously varying stripe width is discretized for computation. In stage II, an adaptive-scale Gaussian filtering approach is proposed, which aims to exhibit the stripe centerline while retaining edge features. Then fast centerline extraction is achieved based on differential calculation, followed by bilateral filter smoothing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm produces low radius error of 0.139 mm (1.1%) in criteria sphere reconstruction and outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in blade reconstruction with superior accuracy and noise robustness."

We propose STAR, a cross-stage computetation and memory–efficient algorithm–hardware co-design tailored for Transformer inference under LTPP. STAR introduces a leading-zero-based sparsity prediction using log-domain add only operations to minimize prediction overhead. It further employs distributed sorting and a sorted updating FlashAttention mechanism, guided by a coordinated tiling strategy that enables fine-grained stage interaction for improved memory efficiency and latency. These optimizations are supported by a dedicated STAR accelerator architecture, achieving up to 9.2× speedup and 71.2× energy efficiency over A100, and surpassing SOTA accelerators by up to 16.1× energy and 27.1× area efficiency gains. Further, we deploy STAR onto a multi-core spatial architecture, optimizing dataflow and execution orchestration for ultra-long sequence processing. Architectural evaluation shows that, compared to the baseline design, Spatial-STAR achieves a 20.1× throughput improvement."

    "abstract": "This paper suggests an energy regeneration system that utilizes a gas accumulator connected to a piston cavity of an excavator’s boom cylinder (ERSUA). When the boom descends, the gravitational energy equivalent mass is converted into energy of oil and accumulated in the gas accumulator. This stored energy is then supplied to the suction line of the hydrostatic pump to assist during the boom lifting process. As the pressure differential across the pump is reduced, the energy required to drive the pump decreases accordingly. Simulation results using the Amesim software demonstrate that the energy requirement of the hydraulic pump is reduced by nearly 20% in the regeneration circuit. Meanwhile, kinematic factors such as boom cylinder displacement and velocity remain largely unchanged compared to the conventional system."

A fixed-order disturbance observer estimates lumped wind/wave/current forces online and feeds them forward so that nominal backstepping gains can be kept modest while preserving stability guarantees from a composite Lyapunov analysis. On the Cybership II benchmark in MATLAB/Simulink, the method achieves ≈0.3 s settling, millimetre-level position error, and milli-radian heading error under sinusoidal disturbances, while reducing peak thrust by ~25× versus an LQR baseline; tuned PID exhibits larger steady oscillations and phase lag. These results are simulation-based (no sensor noise/actuator dynamics) but indicate an implementation-ready alternative to classical marine regulators."

This study proposes a predictive classification model for patient discharge outcomes based on the admission nursing assessment questionnaire from a medical institution. By integrating data mining and machine learning techniques, the study employs the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm as the core classifier, further enhanced by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and Weighted KNN (WKNN) to improve classification accuracy. Additionally, random oversampling is applied to address data imbalance issues. Experiments were conducted using six training set sizes under two preprocessing strategies—basic numerical transformation and advanced numerical encoding—and evaluated in both multiclass (six-class) and binary classification tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PCA-WKNN model consistently outperforms other approaches in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. These findings suggest that the proposed method is effective in enhancing predictive performance and holds significant potential for clinical applications in nursing care."

A simple capacitance evaluation method using the device simulation model is proposed in the paper. The switching characteristic of SiC-MOSFET is experimentally extracted using a single-pulse test (SPT). The behavior of the simulation model was then compared to the characteristics obtained from the SPT to assess model performance.

We propose a low-voltage architecture based on two series-connected inverter modules and a specialized controller that performs geometric (vector) voltage addition with dynamic phase coordination. Each module can operate from ≥ 6 V, and the controller synchronizes amplitude and phase to synthesize a stable 220 V output across wide irradiance variations. The control stack integrates low-voltage MPPT, PLL synchronization, adaptive amplitude regulation, and seamless mode transitions with built-in protections. Across representative overcast conditions, the architecture increases delivered AC energy by ≈6–15% (median ≈10–12%) versus a single inverter with a 10.8 V cutoff, by harvesting low-irradiance windows; low-voltage conversion efficiency improves by ≈5–7 percentage points at 0.2–0.4 p.u. input while remaining within ±1 pp of the baseline at nominal irradiance. The concept is applicable to distributed PV/ESS and retrofit scenarios where maintaining 220 V under sub-nominal DC conditions is critical, extending the operating envelope of PV inverters toward lower input voltages."

Our design combines a Merkle Tree and a biometric matching algorithm within a zkSNARK circuit to prove that a user’s biometric trait matches one of the registered templates in an anonymous manner. To ensure compatibility with state-of-the-art Deep Neural Network (DNN) models, we introduce a complete quantization pipeline that converts floating-point embeddings into zkSNARK-friendly representations. Our experiment results show constant transaction gas cost and proof size, regardless of the embedding vector length, thereby demonstrating the practicality of zk-SABER for real-world blockchain environments."

Therefore, a transaction is considered confirmed if its block is sufficiently deep in the blockchain. This depth is usually set empirically at some fixed number such as six blocks. We analyze forks under varying network delays in simulation and actual Bitcoin data. Based on this analysis, we establish a relationship between block depth and the probability of confirmation revocation due to a fork. We use prospect theory to relate transaction confirmation probability to transaction amount and user risk tolerance."

    "abstract": "In contactless continuous monitoring of vital signs, assessing the quality of extracted signals is essential to increase the fidelity of the estimation. For this reason, a set of frequency-based quality indices is studied and analysed on a public dataset of torso displacements related to respiratory volume and recorded remotely under free breathing conditions. All the indices are based on the ratio between the power extracted in a frequency band associated with respiratory activity, against the complementary frequency band associated with noise. Parameters affecting the proposed indices, such as the number of harmonics and the frequency bandwidth around each harmonic, are evaluated to choose the most appropriate frequency band. Moreover, the indices are evaluated theoretically to understand in what range of noise they could properly work. Three experiments are performed: in the first one, white Gaussian noise is added to the considered signals to generate respiratory signals with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ranging from -30 to 27 dB; in the second one, the temporal noise extracted from a depth camera at distances less than 4 meters from a wall is added to the considered signals to simulate a scenario closer to the real application. Mean absolute error (MAE) of less than 2 dB, root mean square error (RMSE) of less than 3 dB, and Pearson’s correlation between 0.97 to 0.99 in the defined range of applicability are the obtained results for the evaluated quality indices. In the third one, an experimental scenario with recordings from Intel RealSense D455 and Kinect V2, the proposed metrics demonstrated to discriminate adequately between lower and higher quality signals determined by subjects at increasing distances from the camera. The metrics showed to recognise the presence of occlusions and motion artefacts; a Respiration-to-Noise Ratio (RNR) with frequency interval of 0.4 Hz showed a great sensitivity to occlusions with a median worsening of the signal quality of 6 to 10 dB; on the other hand, an RNR with frequency interval of 0.05 Hz showed greater sensitivity to low-frequency body movements when comparing the breathing signals extracted from sitting against standing subjects."

To enhance measurement accuracy, the impact of the time interval is analyzed when applying repetitive pulses with fast rise times, and practical recommendations are proposed. As second topic, the influence of switching frequency is compared for different frequencies with an equal number of pulses. The combined effects of switching frequency and time interval between each voltage step are thoroughly examined. Last point is to investigate PD patterns to assess their potential for use as post-processing indicators of insulation degradation. An experimental test cases are conduced with twisted pair samples with various insulation grades to obtain the keynotes."

Binary encoding scheme is used for scheduling the transmission of innovation between sensor nodes due to limited bandwidth. Random bit error is considered in order to reflect the existence of binary bit flipping during actual channel transmission. A switching-model approach is adopted to convert the multi-rate systems into the single-rate ones. Stochastic nonlinearity is characterized by statistical properties to enhance generality. Different occurrence probabilities of attacks in distinct channels are characterized by virtue of a group of random variables following the Bernoulli distribution. The objective of the addressed filtering issue is to design a distributed filter such that the filtering error dynamics is stochastically finite-time bounded and satisfies <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$H_{\\infty }$</tex-math></inline-formula> performance requirement. Sufficient conditions guaranteeing the satisfaction of specified filtering performance are established with the assistance of matrix inequalities and stochastic analysis techniques. The gain parameters of the distributed filter are determined by solving certain linear matrix inequalities. Simulation outcomes validate the efficacy of the proposed filtering method."

    "abstract": "Ocean exploration using acoustical 3-D imaging is gaining popularity as it provides information about the 3-D geometry of the targets even under mild turbid conditions. A major challenge in underwater 3-D imaging is the high cost of the planar arrays and the computational complexity of the image reconstruction algorithms. In this work, we introduce the use of a uniform rectangle array placed at the edges of a uniform planar array for underwater 3-D imaging. During reconstruction, an orthogonal combination of two linear arrays which forms an L-shape is used to perform two independent and parallel 2-D delay and sum beamforming and the 3-D image is reconstructed using the product of the resulting beams. Each quadrant in the imaging slice is reconstructed in parallel using different L-shaped arrays. This quadrant-based time domain receive beamforming focuses on achieving relatively low computational complexity for real-time 3-D imaging in underwater environments. The proposed method with 47 hydrophones has reduced the main lobe width by <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text{2}^\\circ$</tex-math></inline-formula> with 6 dB increase in the peak side lobe level when compared to the conventional delay and sum beamforming using a uniform planar array of 576 elements. Although there is an increase in the side lobe level, the asymmetric beam pattern of the proposed L array and the quadrant-based beamforming restrict the side lobes within a quadrant. The proposed method achieves a reduction in computation time by a factor of 97 for 3-D imaging compared to the conventional method, while maintaining acceptable image quality. For qualitative analysis, the 3-D images of different underwater targets have been reconstructed and compared in simulation and experiment."

    "abstract": "The weakly electric fish Eigenmannia virescens naturally swims back and forth to stay within a moving refuge, tracking its motion using visual and electrosensory feedback. Previous experiments show that when the refuge oscillates as a low-frequency sinusoid (below about 0.5 Hz), the tracking is nearly perfect, but phase lag increases and gain decreases at higher frequencies. Here, we model this nonlinear behavior as an adaptive internal model principle (IMP) system. Specifically, an adaptive state estimator identifies the a priori unknown frequency, and feeds this parameter estimate into a closed-loop IMP-based system built around a lightly damped harmonic oscillator. We prove that the closed-loop tracking error of the IMP-based system, where the online adaptive frequency estimate is used as a surrogate for the unknown frequency, converges exponentially to that of an ideal control system with perfect information about the stimulus. Simulations further show that our model reproduces the fish refuge tracking Bode plot across a wide frequency range. These results establish the theoretical validity of combining the IMP with an adaptive identification process and provide a basic framework in adaptive sensorimotor control."

    "abstract": "In this article, we propose a smart cushioning device (SCD) that integrates a self-folded corrugated structure (SCS) with a passive wireless sensing mechanism. Using inkjet printing–based self-folding, highly reproducible corrugated geometries were formed from planar paper sheets in a simple and scalable manner. By increasing the number of layers and paper thickness, the SCD achieved a maximum load capacity of 39.0 N, exhibiting a 1014% improvement in load-bearing capability compared to a single-layer configuration. A planar spiral coil integrated within the structure enabled LC resonance wireless sensing of deformation, showing up to 51.5% inductance variation and corresponding resonance frequency shifts. The response remained stable after 1000 compression cycles, confirming high mechanical durability. In a load-position identification test, the device exhibited a frequency shift of Δf/f₀ = 0.10, demonstrating high spatial sensitivity to localized deformation. Owing to its modular design, the proposed SCD allows flexible adjustment of sensor number and placement, offering a promising approach for real-time pressure-distribution sensing in evacuation shelters, nursing care, and smart furniture applications."

Centralized cloud-based AI models, however, conflict with intensifying requirements around data privacy, along with cybersecurity risks, due to reliance on the data for intelligence. This article detailed that Federated Learning (FL) is the optimum architectural solution for resolving the 6G conundrum. We explain how FL’s corner-stone principle of collaborative model training with edge clients, lacking raw data transfer, aligns with 6G infrastructure and privacy-by-design edge computing. The study focuses on the 6G ecosystem’s technical integration of FL and its application in building secure digital twins and collaborative intelligence. Moreover, the article methodically addresses FL persistent challenges, from communication overhead, Byzantine, and data poisoning attacks, while proposing robust countermeasures like Differential Privacy and Secure Aggregation."

    "abstract": "This article proposes a novel constrained multiobjective evolutionary Bayesian optimization algorithm based on decomposition (named CMOEBO/D) for expensive constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs). In CMOEBO/D, an expensive CMOP is decomposed into some approximate constrained subproblems by Gaussian process models, reference vectors, and the augmented Tchebycheff function. Then, we devise a new infill criterion (named CPoB) to evaluate the performance of solutions. Specifically, in CPoB, on each approximate constrained subproblem, any two solutions are compared based on the product of two probabilities. For each solution, the first probability (denoted as PoB) is its likelihood of outperforming the other in terms of the predicted augmented Tchebycheff function value, and the second probability (denoted as PoF) is its likelihood of satisfying all constraints. It is obvious that PoB and PoF measure the convergence and feasibility of a solution, respectively. Based on CPoB, the approximate constrained subproblems are solved via collaborative evolutionary optimization to obtain their near-optimal solutions. Furthermore, by combining the information of the database, we design a bilevel candidate selection strategy to select some of these near-optimal solutions for expensive fitness evaluations, which can make good diversity, convergence, and feasibility contributions simultaneously to the database. Extensive experiments verify the competitiveness of CMOEBO/D."

Reliable, continuous operation of NN is essential for safety-critical applications.

Explicit testing methods for hardware accelerators cannot detect transient faults during inference, are unsuitable for always-on applications, and require extensive test vector generation and storage.

    "abstract": "High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) is an interface standard for 3D-stacked synchronous dynamic random-access memory achieving higher bandwidth, lower power, and a smaller footprint than DDR4 and GDDR5. It is becoming a key component of compute devices used in supercomputers and datacenters as well as in high-end embedded platforms, such as autonomous driving systems, as it matches the performance requirements of Artificial Intelligence and other emerging data-intensive workloads. In many cases, these applications require some form of determinism or guarantees in terms of response time, in addition to mere performance. This is the case of hard real-time tasks in safety-critical environments, e.g. in automotive applications. However, deterministic response is also relevant for the multi-tenant settings of HPC, datacenter, and cloud systems, where tenants may be offered precise guarantees in terms of Quality of Service (QoS). Performance predictability has been investigated for DDR memory controllers, while it is an unexplored topic for HBM. While DDR and HBM share some technical aspects, such as the opportunity of reducing data bus reversals by command reordering, the HBM standard also poses additional difficulties compared to DDR, such as tougher timing constraints, which increase the latency of commands targeting the same bank group. In this work, we introduce an implementable architectural model of a deterministic HBM controller, which addresses the above technical issues, along with a quantitative closed-form analysis to fully characterize its response times. We also demonstrate a complete physical implementation derived from the model, along with practical simulation and synthesis toolflows, which allow an extensive experimental evaluation and the test of the controller under real-world memory-intensive workloads. We measure a peak throughput of 13.5 GB/s per pseudo-channel, which is higher than a recent comparable controller design, and an aggregate peak throughput of 432 GB/s under time predictability guarantees. Our evaluation also sheds some light on how the mapping of address bits to banks/rows/columns impacts the performance of HBM commands."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the security and privacy issues of the global models in Federated Learning by proposing a new approach, called PDFL, which tackles the challenges of poisoning attacks and privacy leakage in FL rounds. PDFL is based on secure multi-party computation and performs privacy-preserving cluster analysis on encrypted data from participants in order to identify malicious poisoning attackers. This approach involves a two-server mechanism and integrates four privacy-preserving protocols based on two-party computation (2PC): SecJudge for normalizing gradients, SecCosine for computing the cosine similarity values among gradients, SecClu for countering poisoning attacks, and SecAgg for secure aggregation by the server. These protocols are designed to achieve low computational costs, preserve client data privacy, and mitigate poisoning attacks from the potentially malicious clients. We provide a theoretical proof that our four sub-protocols and the PDFL scheme are both safe and reliable, demonstrating that PDFL can ensure the privacy and security of the participating data. Additionally, we conduct extensive simulation experiments to evaluate the accuracy, efficiency, computational overhead, and communication overhead associated with the PDFL scheme. Experimental results show the potential of the PDFL scheme in significantly enhancing the ability to identify malicious poisoning attackers in federated learning systems accurately and efficiently, hence making PDFL a promising solution for addressing privacy and security concerns in this domain."

Prior works have addressed this challenge by employing pruning techniques to reduce parameters and computational loads. Among these techniques, fine-grained <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>:<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</i> pruning methods achieve high sparsity rates but at the cost of generating substantial indexing overhead and potential workload imbalance. In contrast, pattern-based pruning methods reduce indexing complexity and achieve workload balancing but suffer from low sparsity. To overcome these limitations, this article proposes a kernel-aware hybrid pruning (KAHP) method that simultaneously attains high sparsity, workload balancing, and reduced indexing overhead. Moreover, to accelerate the inference of the models pruned by the KAHP method, we design an efficient accelerator based on the systolic array architecture.

    "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of video clips has sparked growing interest in text-video retrieval, where the core challenge lies in effectively matching textual queries with relevant video segments. Previous approaches learn a joint embedding space based primarily on global frame-level alignment, often overlooking the rich semantic cues present at the region level. In this paper, we argue that region-level modeling and stochastic text representation can significantly enhance video understanding by capturing fine-grained semantic information and textual ambiguity. We propose a novel cross-modal embedding framework that jointly captures frame-level and region-level interactions while modeling text as a multivariate distribution. Our design integrates a vision encoder with proxy-guided attention, a cross-embedding association graph, and a stochastic text encoder. Empirical results on MSR-VTT dataset show that incorporating both region-aware modeling and stochastic embedding boosts retrieval accuracy to 17% R@1, compared to only 12% R@1 in frame-only settings. In addition, compared to the existing robust methods, the proposed system also shows superior performance. This highlights the benefit of combining local spatial details and probabilistic semantics in video retrieval."

In this paper, an experimental validation of automatic balancing control strategy using a synchronous notch filter and a PLL-based speed estimator is carried out on a laboratory scale test rig. For the operation of the synchronous notch filter, rotational speed of the rotor must be provided. By leveraging the orthogonality property of the sine and cosine functions, the rotational speed of the rotor can be estimated using a Phase-locked Loop (PLL) structure, thereby streamlining the system since no additional speed sensor is needed. The PLL structure is described and discussed in detail from a practical application perspective, ensuring the implementation with the synchronous notch filter is straightforward. Experimental results show that the fundamental components of the synchronous vibration are removed from the control signal when the synchronous notch filter and PLL-based speed estimator are enabled."

In this paper, we introduce the first framework to directly extract complex topological features—contours, Jacobi sets, and ridge-valley graphs—from a type of continuous implicit model known as multivariate functional approximation (MFA). MFA replaces discrete data with continuous piecewise smooth functions. Given an MFA model as the input, our approach enables direct extraction of complex topological features from the model, without reverting to a discrete representation of the model. Our work is easily generalizable to any continuous implicit model that supports the queries of function values and high-order derivatives. Our work establishes the building blocks for performing topological data analysis and visualization on implicit continuous models."

To enhance robustness and tracking performance, a hybrid Proportional-Derivative Time-Delay Estimation (PD-TDE) controller is adopted. However, the optimal tuning of PD-TDE parameters remains a critical issue. This paper proposes a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach based on the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agent algorithm in reinforcement learning to automatically optimize the controller parameters. The proposed method does not require prior dynamic knowledge of the system and employs an Actor-Critic architecture. After the agent is successfully trained offline, the Actor network is extracted and used to tune the parameters of the PD-TDE controller by observing the system state and applying a reward function that encourages accurate and smooth motion. Finally, the proposed approach is validated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink using a 3D Simscape robot model imported from SolidWorks, demonstrating superior performance compared to conventional PD-TDE tuning method."

We have then considered multiple filtering strategies to isolate different parts of the network, such as excluding single-connection nodes or central hubs. The results show that as the network has grown, its average connectivity has decreased, and its reliance on hubs has increased.

    "abstract": "Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables secure communication by using the principles of quantum mechanics. A critical stage in QKD protocols such as BB84 is information reconciliation, where the communicating parties correct errors in their sifted sequences without revealing extra information to a potential eavesdropper. The CASCADE protocol is a widely used interactive error-correction algorithm for this purpose. The classical CASCADE and its known modifications perform well under the assumption of uniformly distributed errors in the quantum channel. However, this assumption can break down in real conditions, where short-term noise bursts create clusters of errors. This paper proposes a modification of the CASCADE designed to improve its efficiency in channels with time-varying, non-uniform error distributions. The main idea is to identify and discard blocks with a relatively high concentration of errors during reconciliation, preventing inefficient correction attempts and reducing the number of communication rounds. Two new modifications based on existing CASCADE variants are presented. The proposed approach reduces the number of interactions, which is a critical performance metric for reconciliation protocols."

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral image classification plays a key role in accurately identifying land cover, but still faces challenges such as mixed pixels, spectral heterogeneity, and multi-scale fusion. Existing methods remain limited in frequency-domain feature extraction, cross-modal interaction, and multi-scale information integration. To address these issues, this paper proposes FDSNet, a model that fuses frequency- and spatial-domain features to enhance classification performance. In the spatial stream, a dual-path encoding mechanism extracts frequency and spatial features, while cross-cooperative attention further captures spatial context. In the spectral stream, a cross-scale interaction pyramid strengthens multi-scale spectral representations, combined with dynamic convolution and spectral–spatial attention to refine feature learning. Finally, an improved cross-modal interaction module achieves efficient fusion of spectral and spatial features. Experiments on the PU dataset show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in overall accuracy (OA), average accuracy (AA), and the Kappa coefficient, demonstrating superior effectiveness and robustness."

    "abstract": "Elevator systems are among the major energy consumers in buildings, with substantial energy losses occurring during motor braking. This study proposes the integration of a supercapacitor as an energy storage device, managed by a fuzzy-based bidirectional DC-DC converter, to optimize regenerative energy recovery and improve elevator efficiency. In the proposed system, the supercapacitor captures braking energy and releases it during motoring operation, while the bidirectional converter regulates power flow between the motor, supply, and storage unit. Two fuzzy logic controllers—dedicated to voltage and current regulation—are employed to ensure efficient charge—discharge management. The objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of fuzzy-based control in enhancing energy storage and utilization. Simulation results confirm that the supercapacitor substantially reduces energy wastage during generating mode by storing and reusing energy in motoring mode, thereby improving about 80% of the overall performance of the elevator system."

The method is evaluated in both islanded and grid-connected modes. In islanded operation, dVOC exhibits droop-like behavior for frequency and voltage regulation, while in grid-connected operation it enables accurate active power tracking while maintaining stable frequency. Simulation results in PLECS, including power setpoint variations and load step tests, show that the $50-\\mathrm{kW}$ inverter with dVOC achieves correct steady-state power regulation and demonstrates faster, smoother transient responses compared to conventional droop control."

The grid-side controller maintains the DC-link voltage and regulates both active and reactive power exchange with the grid.

This work proposes a generalized disjunctive programming optimization model to solve a generation and transmission expansion planning model alongside a Markov Random Field approach to model the spatiotemporal relationships among compound hazards. This approach is demonstrated on a 123-bus representation of the Texas grid, adapted herein to be suitable for the proposed model."

The method of combining numerical simulation, effect test and microscopic detection is adopted. It is found that when the injection power reaches the device damage threshold, the damage positions of High Electron Mobility Transistor (HMET) under HPM are consistent with the numerical simulation results, but the effect threshold of damage test is higher. This is mainly because, in numerical simulation, the damage criterion is usually used as whether the internal temperature of the device reaches the melting point. However, in the experiment, the function of the device will be completely disabled only when all the gate metal strips have fuse damage. At this time, the input channel of the device signal is interrupted, the channel loss increases, and the gain of the device decreases to 0 or even exhibits attenuation characteristics."

This framework models each base station as an independent agent and uses an Actor-Critic dual-network architecture to generate task offloading and operation mode adjustment actions. By integrating a multi-dimensional state model that combines real-time traffic load, remaining computing resources, the framework enhances resource matching accuracy. Additionally, it utilizes an optimized experience replay mechanism to improve sample sampling and training stability, achieving a coordinated optimization of energy consumption and latency. Simulation experiments show that compared with the full-power operation mode, this method reduces energy consumption by an average of 18.7%, with a slight increase in latency but still significantly better than the low-power operation mode. Compared with the genetic algorithm, energy consumption is reduced by an average of 3.7%, and latency is basically the same under various task loads. Compared with the all-low-power operation mode, latency is reduced by an average of 12.6%, effectively balancing energy efficiency and service quality, and meeting the task processing requirements of 5G dynamic traffic scenarios."

    "abstract": "Many robots are not equipped with a manipulator and many objects are not suitable for prehensile manipulation (such as large boxes and cylinders). In these cases, pushing is a simple yet effective non-prehensile skill for robots to interact with and further change the environment. Existing work often assumes a set of predefined pushing modes and fixed-shape objects. This work tackles the general problem of controlling a robotic fleet to push collaboratively numerous arbitrary objects to respective destinations, within complex environments of cluttered and movable obstacles. It incorporates several characteristic challenges for multi-robot systems such as online task coordination under large uncertainties of cost and duration, and for contact-rich tasks such as hybrid switching among different contact modes, and under-actuation due to constrained contact forces. The proposed method is based on combinatorial hybrid optimization over dynamic task assignments and hybrid execution via sequences of pushing modes and associated forces. It consists of three main components: (I) the decomposition, ordering and rolling assignment of pushing subtasks to robot subgroups; (II) the keyframe guided hybrid search to optimize the sequence of parameterized pushing modes for each subtask; (III) the hybrid control to execute these modes and transit among them. Last but not least, a diffusion-based accelerator is adopted to predict the keyframes and pushing modes that should be prioritized during hybrid search; and further improve planning efficiency. The framework is complete under mild assumptions. Its efficiency and effectiveness under different numbers of robots and general -shaped objects are validated extensively in simulations and hardware experiments, as well as generalizations to heterogeneous robots, planar assembly and 6D pushing."

    "abstract": "The functional brain network (FBN) serves as an important tool for investigating neurological and mental disorders. Unlike many traditional networks whose structures are often known in advance, FBNs need to be estimated from neuroimaging or electrophysiological data, and their quality generally determines the performance of downstream tasks, particularly in disorder detection. Recent studies have shown that high-order FBNs tend to achieve better discriminative performance, while some other work indicates that increasing the order of FBN does not necessarily bring additional gains in discriminative performance and may even lead to a rapid decline in discriminability. To fully leverage information across different-order FBNs and identify optimal order for downstream tasks, we design an adaptive high-order FBN fusion learning framework (AHFL) with attention mechanism for brain disorder detection. Specifically, we first construct a series of FBNs with continuously increasing orders and propose a data-driven approach to evaluate each order's contribution to the classification performance. The self-attention mechanism is employed to capture contextual dependencies during the sequential generation of multi-order FBNs, thereby offering a natural fusion approach. Experimental evidence shows that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to the baseline. In particular, we find that third-order FBN is achieved the highest weights, playing a crucial role for the detection of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), whereas second-order FBN is the most effective for identifying patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Our findings advance the identification of discriminative high-order FBNs and establish a generalizable diagnostic framework for brain disorders."

    "abstract": "The relentless advancement of the semiconductor industry continues to be fueled by the pursuit of enhanced transistor performance. As CMOS technology undergoes aggressive scaling to enable higher integration densities in modern integrated circuits (ICs), there arises a pressing demand for novel device architectures that can minimize cell area without compromising functionality. The complementary-field-effect-transistor (CFET) is emerging as a leading contender to succeed gate-all-around (GAA) FETs beyond the 2-nm technology node, offering a compelling pathway to sustain Moores Law into the next era of scaling. Unlike forksheet FET (FSFET) architectures, where nFET and pFET devices are laterally separated, CFETs adopt a vertically stacked configuration. This vertical integration minimizes the required device footprint, constrained primarily by cell height rather than horizontal spacing. As a result, CFETs not only enhance the effective channel width and drive current but also offer the potential for up to a twofold increase in integration density compared to conventional CMOS technologies. This review explores recent advances in CFET architectures, fabrication progress, and associated challenges, exciting prospects in IC design enabled by CFET’s compact structure and vertical integration. Finally, the article highlights critical reliability concerns, emphasizing the need for continued innovation to ensure robust device performance. CFET stands at the forefront of next-generation transistor technologies."

    "abstract": "Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) architecture is promising to be adopted in the 5G/6G communication systems to combat the severe attenuation of millimeter-wave and terahertz bands by implementing precoding and combining at the transmitter and receiver jointly. Nevertheless, such massive MIMO-based systems are highly susceptible to pilot spoofing attacks (PSAs) because of the openness of wireless channel and the public pilot sequences. These PSAs will not only render significant decrease in system capacity, but also make the transmitted information leak to the attackers. In this paper, a novel multi-cue detection and identification network (MCDI-net) is proposed to conduct spoofing detection and identify the attacked user simultaneously. The MCDI-net integrates a dual-branch convolutional neural network with squeeze-and-excitation (SE) attention modules to extract the complementary features from two distinct cues, which are in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) and statistical features derived from pilot correlation and projected average power. This multi-cue fusion approach can enhance the network’s ability to detect pilot spoofing and identify the attacked legitimate user accurately. Numerical results are presented to validate the superior performance of the MCDI-net framework in detection and identification accuracy compared to the existing ones."

We investigate the impact of IRS size, curvature, and transmitter beam width on end-to-end system performance, taking into account attenuation, atmospheric turbulence, and pointing errors. To accommodate the effects of surface curvature, we enhance and refine the channel pointing model and derive novel closed-form expressions for key performance metrics, including bit error rate, outage probability, and ergodic capacity. Numerical results based on realistic system parameters confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach, albeit at the cost of increased geometric channel losses. Finally, we carry out numerical simulations to validate the new channel model and derived closed-form expressions, providing valuable insights for the design of future non-terrestrial networks architectures based on FSO systems."

Additionally, the circuit can seamlessly switch between phase shifter and diplexer modes without redesign, enhancing its versatility. To validate the proposed concept, phase shifter and diplexer prototypes operating at <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathrm {19.3~GHz}~\\text {to}~\\mathrm {20.3~GHz}$</tex-math> </inline-formula> and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathrm {29.5~GHz}~\\text {to}~\\mathrm {30.5~GHz}$</tex-math> </inline-formula> have been fabricated and tested.

For the diplexer mode, port-to-port isolation exceeds 25 dB across all phase states. The proposed phase shifter design offers simplicity, robustness, and flexibility, with flat phase range and amplitude, while allowing independent tunable phase states across transmit and receive bands, making it highly suitable for LEO satellite communications systems."

    "abstract": "Communication reliability, as defined by 3GPP, is the probability of achieving a desired quality of service (QoS). Traditionally, this metric is evaluated by averaging the QoS success indicator over spatiotemporal random variables. Recently, the meta distribution (MD) has emerged as a two-level analysis tool that characterizes system-level reliability as a function of link-level reliability thresholds. However, existing MD studies have two limitations. First, they focus exclusively on spatial and temporal randomness corresponding to node distribution and fading channels, respectively, leaving stochastic behaviors in other domains largely unexplored. Second, they are restricted to first-order MDs with two randomness levels, restricting applicability to scenarios requiring higher-order MD characterization. To address these gaps, we propose a hierarchical framework for higher-order MD reliability in wireless networks, where each layer’s success probability is formulated and fed into the next layer, yielding overall MD reliability at the highest level. We apply this framework to wireless networks by capturing three levels of temporal dynamics representing fast, slow, and static random elements, and provide a comprehensive second-order MD reliability analysis for two application scenarios. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated via these representative scenarios, supported by detailed analytical and numerical evaluations. Our results highlight the value of hierarchical MD representations across multiple domains and reveal the significant influence of inner-layer target reliabilities on overall performance."

    "abstract": "The evolution of 5G networks toward 6G presents an opportunity to shift from centralized security to decentralized, intelligent, and autonomous security. While 5G introduces decentralization through software-based virtualization and edge computing, it also exposes network infrastructure to a new and dynamic threat landscape that still relies largely on static, centrally deployed threat detection. This work proposes a lightweight anomaly detection framework based on Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML), specifically designed to address the latency, memory, and energy constraints of 5G edge devices. Using promising model compression techniques, including integer quantization and pruning, we demonstrate that highly optimized models can run entirely on-device without relying on cloud infrastructure. Our experiments using a real-world 5G dataset demonstrate that the quantized TinyDenseNet achieves over 99% detection accuracy while keeping the model size below 30 KB and inference latency under 11 ms. By embedding intelligent detection at the network edge, this approach presents self-defending, ultra-reliable, and context-aware infrastructures for future 6G networks. The proposed approach focuses on next-generation networks, in which decentralized, low-power, and privacy-preserving security mechanisms will be essential."

Here, we construct a real-time super-resolution imaging system based on zero-shot learning strategy for the non-invasive infrared thermography and photothermal coherence tomography techniques. To validate the feasibility and accuracy of this super-resolution imaging system, IRT systems were employed to test several industrial samples and one biomedical sample.

In this study, we analyze a pre-trained neural network trained with residential smart meter load data and its transferability for aggregated-level load profile analysis. This study introduces ViT4LPA 2.0, a pre-trained hierarchical vision transformer (H-ViT) tailored for load profile analysis. ViT4LPA 2.0 is adapted for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) load disaggregation at an aggregated-level, leveraging knowledge from individual smart meter load profiles. The H-ViT model employs a window self-attention mechanism to capture both local and global features. Pre-training is performed using masked image modeling on 2,000 smart meter load profiles, followed by domain adaptation and fine-tuning with limited labeled data. Extensive simulations demonstrate the model’s effectiveness, achieving approximately 5% daily accumulated error on aggregated-level load disaggregation with less than 15% HVAC consumption visibility in residential households. The model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, showing a 20–35% performance improvement. Additionally, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis and interpretability study provide insights into hyperparameter selection and the model’s decision-making process."

When using a UAV, it is necessary to consider destabilizing factors that lead to random changes in microphone orientation and random fluctuations in the UAV’s spatial position. To assess the potential for information leakage, a formant calculation was performed using five octave frequencies of verbal intelligibility for various signal-to-noise ratios depending on the distance to the UAV. It is shown that using a UAV to create an acoustic information leakage channel can be effective when the UAV is no more than 30–35 meters away. However, the main destabilizing factor affecting the distance from which information can be collected is the noise of the UAV’s propellers."

    "abstract": "This electronic document is a “live” template and already The global economy and critical national security infrastructure are increasingly reliant on satellite communication (SATCOM) systems. This dependence, coupled with the rapid commercialization of space, has significantly expanded the cyber-attack surface, exposing vulnerabilities in data integrity, command and control, and access management. While Layer-1 (L1) blockchains offer robust security through decentralization and immutability, their inherent limitations in scalability, latency, and transaction costs make them unsuitable for the high-throughput, resource-constrained environment of SATCOM networks. This paper proposes AetherLedger, a novel hierarchical Layer-2 (L2) blockchain architecture designed to provide scalable, efficient, and secure communications for SATCOM systems. The framework integrates a ZK-Rollup as its primary L2 solution to bundle and process the bulk of transactions—such as telemetry data, command logs, and access requests—off-chain, inheriting the security of an underlying L1 blockchain through cryptographic validity proofs. For high-frequency, time-sensitive operations between specific nodes, AetherLedger incorporates off-chain State Channels that settle their final state on the L2 rollup. This architecture is supported by a resource-aware model where powerful ground stations and LEO satellites act as L2 sequencers and provers, while resource-constrained terminals and sensors operate as lightweight nodes. A comparative analysis indicates that AetherLedger can theoretically increase transaction throughput by several orders of magnitude and drastically reduce transaction costs and latency compared to a purely L1-based approach. The ZK-Rollup layer provides fast transaction finality, which is critical for timely command verification, while State Channels offer near-instantaneous interaction for mission-critical maneuvers. The architecture provides robust defenses against prevalent SATCOM cyberattacks, including command spoofing, data manipulation, and denial-of-service, by ensuring cryptographic verification and data integrity. AetherLedger presents a viable and sophisticated framework for securing next-generation SATCOM networks. By strategically combining ZK-Rollups and State Channels in a hierarchical model, it effectively addresses the blockchain trilemma-balancing security, scalability, and decentralization-within the unique operational constraints of the space domain."

    "abstract": "Currently, most kinematic calibration models for serial robots are developed by differentiating the forward kinematics equations, which leads to a lack of clarity in defining the error and understanding its physical origin. To address this limitation, this study proposes a general error model for rigid body motion, in which the error is defined based on a clear separation between the actual and nominal motions. The model is linearized using the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff (BCH) expansion in the Lie algebra space se(3). Based on this foundation, a hybrid calibration framework is constructed by combining the Modified Denavit–Hartenberg (MDH) model with the Product of Exponentials (POE) method for serial robots. The error of each link is modeled locally in its own coordinate frame according to MDH conventions, then propagated along the kinematic chain and accumulated at the end-effector. The number of calibration parameters is reduced by exploiting the geometric properties and motion structure in the se(3) space, thereby improving computational stability. In addition, we formulate a method to reduce the general motion of a rigid body to that of three fixed points, while preserving all six degrees of freedom. This enables calibration to be performed by determining only the coordinates of these three points instead of the full pose, thereby simplifying the measurement setup and experimental procedure. The model is validated through simulations on the SCARA robot and the PUMA 560 robot. The results show fast convergence and significant improvement in end-effector positioning accuracy under large initial errors and high noise conditions. The proposed method can be extended to general multi-body mechanical systems."

    "abstract": "Lip-sync DeepFakes, which manipulate lip movements to match tampered audio while preserving visual identity, pose significant challenges to digital content integrity due to their subtle temporal inconsistencies. Traditional detection methods focusing on spatial artifacts are often ineffective against these forgeries, while recent temporal correlation models, despite their accuracy, are computationally intensive and impractical for resource-constrained devices. This paper proposes a lightweight, real-time framework for lip-sync DeepFake detection, leveraging compact neural networks, temporal attention mechanisms, and knowledge distillation. Utilizing ShuffleNetV2x0.5 as the backbone, our model incorporates audio-visual temporal modeling and human-inspired perceptual cues, such as lip-speech synchronization, to achieve robust detection. Knowledge distillation transfers insights from a high-capacity teacher model to ensure high accuracy with a model size of only 18 MB and an inference speed of 20 FPS on standard CPUs, optimized for edge device deployment. Evaluated on the AVLIP and FakeAVCeleb datasets, our approach achieves 93.50% average precision on AVLIP and 99.23% average precision on FakeAVCeleb, rivaling state-of-the-art models while enabling real-time performance on edge devices. This framework is well-suited for applications like mobile video authentication, livestream monitoring, and content moderation, addressing the growing need for efficient and scalable DeepFake detection solutions."

This study proposes an FPGA-accelerated Sobel filter in which each convolution adder is replaced by a configurable k-bit approximate carry-lookahead adder, synthesised in Vitis HLS and deployed on a PYNQ-Z2. A design-space sweep shows that a 3-bit approximation delivers the best trade-off, achieving 357 FPS at 125 MHz—1.6 × faster than an exact-adder FPGA and four orders of magnitude faster than a CPU reference—while processing 225 × 225 frames with 2.8 ms latency and requiring only 0.164 W of dynamic power, which translates to 2178 FPS/W energy efficiency. Image quality remains well within acceptable limits (PSNR ~ 22 dB, SSIM ~ 0.953) such as remote sensing transmission or embedded visual IoT applications, where small degradations in visual quality are tolerable, and hardware overhead is negligible, with LUT and FF counts increasing by less than 0.5 % and no additional DSP, BRAM or clock resources. These results demonstrate that modest, data-aware approximation unlocks substantial speed-and-power gains without perceptible edge-map degradation, positioning approximate arithmetic as a practical optimisation lever for embedded vision accelerators."

Building on these structures, advanced analytical tasks—such as volumetric branch decomposition and contour extraction—have been introduced to facilitate large-scale scientific analysis. Despite these advancements, such analytical tasks substantially increase memory usage, which hampers scalability. In this paper, we propose a pre-simplification strategy to significantly reduce the memory overhead associated with analytical tasks on distributed hierarchical contour trees.

    "abstract": "Quantum federated learning (QFL) is emerging as a key enabler for intelligent, secure, and privacy-preserving model training in next-generation 6G networks. By leveraging the computational advantages of quantum devices, QFL offers significant improvements in learning efficiency and resilience against quantum-era threats. However, future 6G environments are expected to be highly dynamic, decentralized, and data-intensive, which necessitates moving beyond traditional centralized federated learning frameworks. To meet this demand, blockchain technology provides a decentralized, tamper-resistant infrastructure capable of enabling trustless collaboration among distributed quantum edge devices. This paper presents <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">QFLchain</i>, a novel framework that integrates QFL with blockchain to support scalable and secure 6G intelligence.

    "abstract": "Nowadays, cooperation between different organizations to form a cross-industry anti-fraud alliance by using federated learning (FL) is promising for transaction fraud detection. However, there are two challenges when building the federated learning-based fraud detection method. First, existing FL-based fraud detection methods cannot fully use participants' local data to better distinguish unknown types of abnormal fraud transactions. A lot of local data would be discarded due to the private set intersection process under the federated learning framework. Second, they mainly focus on the fraud detection performance but ignore the privacy and communication costs during the training of the fraud detection model. In response to the above challenges, we propose a privacy-aware (P) transaction fraud detection model with low (L) communication costs (C) under a vertical and horizontal joint federated learning framework in this paper, named PLC. Specifically, we merge horizontal federated learning and vertical federated learning to build a normal behavior model to improve the fraud detection performance for solving the first challenge. Meanwhile, we design a sparse factor-based SMC aggregation method to reduce communication costs without sacrificing detection performance for solving the second challenge. The experimental results show that the communication costs can be reduced by 46.7% and 55.4% under the ECC dataset and the Vesta dataset, respectively. The ablation experiment results show that our proposed method can provide good privacy protection performance with a small sparse factor. Our proposed fraud detection model can significantly improve the fraud detection performance under the joint federated learning framework."

    "abstract": "Streaming graph signal (GS) estimation is common in various network systems. Several graph filter algorithms have been proposed for streaming GS estimation, but they still fail to reach optimal levels. To achieve optimal performance in both estimation accuracy and convergence rate, this paper adopts the recursive least squares (RLS) method in processing GS. When the RLS algorithm is directly combined with GS, its recursive mechanism causes the estimation performance to experience severe degradation. To address this issue, a graph RLS with non-cooperation algorithm and a distributed graph diffusion RLS (DRLS) algorithm, both following the fully recursive structure of the standard RLS, are proposed first. By analyzing these two algorithms, it is found that streaming GS and graph topology are complex and variable, so the previous recursive mechanism is not suitable. Therefore, a dynamic adaptive recursive mechanism is designed, and based on this, a distributed graph improved DRLS (IDRLS) algorithm is proposed. Convergence analysis confirms that the proposed algorithm achieves mean stability and mean-square convergence at a linear rate. Furthermore, we thoroughly examine the causes of performance degradation and demonstrate the superiority of the distributed graph IDRLS algorithm. Finally, experiments, conducted on two different graphs with different levels of sparsity and real-world dataset, verify that the proposed graph IDRLS algorithm can achieve the superior estimation performance and convergence rate and be more effective than the related graph algorithms."

However, achieving this performance advantage requires an extensive list decoding scale, substantially increasing decoding latency and limiting its practicality. In this letter, we propose generalized special nodes for PAC codes and provide a corresponding fast list decoding algorithm. The simulation results indicate that the proposed decoding algorithm offers superior parallel processing capabilities with negligible performance degradation. Specifically, the decoding latency for PAC code (128, 70) can be reduced by 31.75% compared to the current state-of-the-art work."

However, the development of efficient planar bandpass filters for terahertz frequencies remains limited. This study introduces a new class of terahertz bandpass filters on an all-silicon, substrate-less platform. The design employs cascaded 2D and 1D photonic crystal structures with effective-medium claddings. The proposed approach allows for precise control of the center frequency and bandwidth, providing the flexibility to filter designs that can potentially cover all 69 channels in the IEEE 802.15.3 d standard between 252 GHz and 325 GHz. In this work, we demonstrate filter designs for four different channels, with two representative prototypes fabricated and characterized. Experimental results show low insertion loss better than 1.5 dB, high out-of-band rejection beyond 25 dB, flat group delay of 0.25 ns within the passband, and low group delay dispersion around 0.01 <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\rm{ns}^{2}$</tex-math></inline-formula> .

However, previous studies primarily focused on the closed-set diagnosis with same label space shared by the training and testing data, which struggle to address the problem of new fault identification under intricate industrial dynamics. To overcome this obstacle, a trustworthy Evidential Open-Set Domain Generalization Network (EOSDGN) is proposed for open-set fault diagnosis under unseen conditions. In the EOSDGN method, an evidential deep classifier is constructed to quantify the uncertainty of predicted results, an evidential domain discriminator is employed to integrate the data from diverse source domains, and an evidential uncertainty calibration is established to reconcile the misleading evidence and class-based evidence assignments. The EOSDGN model effectively addresses both domain and label shift challenges by integrating domain-invariant features extraction and uncertainty quantification of the predicted probabilities, which enables efficient classification of known faults while simultaneously facilitating the identification of unknown faults. The effectiveness of the EOSDGN model has been substantiated using public and practical datasets. Experimental findings demonstrate that the EOSDGN model surpasses the performance of the state-of-the-art models."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a large-scale, non-intrusive person identification framework using footstep-induced structural vibration signals. The increasing adoption of structural vibration analysis for person identification comes from its inherent non-intrusiveness and privacy preserving characteristics. However, existing methodologies are often constrained by the scarcity of extensive datasets, both in terms of the number of subjects and the temporal length of individual recordings, and frequently rely on supervised learning paradigms coupled with manual feature engineering. Consequently, the generalization capabilities of these approaches to broader populations are typically limited. To address these limitations, we have curated a comprehensive dataset of structural vibration signals acquired from 100 individuals. In addition, we have developed an unsupervised event detection method using features based on time, frequency, and wavelet analysis. Furthermore, we have developed DeepStep, a residual attention-based framework specifically designed for efficient feature extraction and classification of structural vibration signals. Experimental evaluation on our curated dataset demonstrates that the proposed approach achieves a Rank-1 accuracy of approximately 92% and a Rank-5 accuracy of approximately 96%."

    "abstract": "In recent years, interest in multiphase converters has grown significantly, driven by the demand for higher efficiency and reliability in electric drives. Simultaneously, multilevel converter technology has matured, offering a practical solution for delivering high power from devices with limited voltage ratings. The integration of these two technologies, multiphase and multilevel converters, provides increased degrees of freedom, enabling the implementation of various fault-tolerant control strategies. However, the higher number of switching devices in multilevel converters also raises the likelihood of switch faults. To mitigate the effects of an open-switch fault, conventional strategies often aim to nullify the current in the faulty phase. Multilevel inverters, with their inherent flexibility, allow for more sophisticated fault-tolerant approaches. This paper presents a comparative analysis of four fault-tolerant control strategies for five-phase, three-level neutral-point clamped (NPC) inverters. Each method exploits the multiphase system's redundancy to reduce the impact of a single open-switch fault, focusing on minimizing voltage ripple across the DC bus capacitors within each switching cycle and throughout the fault duration."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates mutual coupling between phase-dependent amplitudes (PDAs) and designed phase shifts within pixels of near-field (NF) reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in the presence of phase errors (PEs). In contrast to existing research that treats phase shifts with errors (PSEs) and the PDAs separately, we introduce a remaining power (RP) metric to quantify the proportion of power preserved in the signals reflected by the RIS, and we prove its asymptotic convergence to theoretical values by leveraging <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">extended Glivenko-Cantelli theorem</i>. Then, the RP of signals passing through RIS pixels is jointly examined under combined phase and amplitude uncertainties. In addition, we propose four pixel reflection models to capture practical conditions, and we derive approximate polynomial upper bounds for the RP with error terms by applying <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Taylor expansion</i>. Furthermore, based on <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Friis transmission formula</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">projected aperture</i>, we propose a general NF channel model that incorporates the coupling between the PSEs and the PDAs. By using <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Cauchy-Bunyakovsky-Schwarz inequality</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Riemann sums</i>, we derive a closed-form upper bound on spectral efficiency, and the bound becomes tighter as the pixel area decreases. We reveal that as the RIS phase shifts approach the ends of their range, the RP under independent and identically distributed PEs is smaller than that under fully correlated PEs, whereas this relationship reverses when the phase shifts are near the middle of their range. Neglecting the PEs in the PDAs leads to an overestimation of the RIS performance gain, explaining the discrepancies between theoretical and measured results."

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) is highly effective for accurate encrypted malicious traffic identification by using highquality training data. In fact, obtaining such data is costly and challenging. As a result, many ML-based models are inevitably trained on low-quality data and perform poorly. To enhance performance, some methods utilize various sample selection techniques to choose confident samples for model training. However, they often rely on a single metric for this selection, which restricts their adaptability across diverse datasets and noise conditions. In this paper, we propose a robust framework BAPTISM for identifying encrypted malicious traffic with low-quality training data. Particularly, BAPTISM selects a suitable base model for each task, and trains it with early stopping to generate traffic representation before overfitting occurs. Then, we devise an adaptive metric selection strategy to select confident samples. By employing two metrics (JSD and CSD) to assess the characteristic of traffic representation from distinct perspective, we find the more proper metric for each class and apply it for confident sample selection. According to the confident samples and selected metric for each class, we develop a label correction tactic which adapts to class nature to improve the quality of training data. Finally, we employ parallel training strategy to train the base model with the corrected data, further mitigating the impact of low-quality data. We conduct experiments across three real-world malicious traffic datasets with various noise settings. The results demonstrate that BAPTISM is compatible with different base models and outperforms across noise ratios ranging from 20% to 90%. Meanwhile, BAPTISM consistently selects the confident samples with the highest purity and volume under each setting."

Recently, various machine learning algorithms have been employed for NILM, however, their effectiveness largely depends on the availability of substantial high-quality labeled data. In practice, the manual and automatic labeling based on event waveform extracted from master meter data inevitably introduce the noisy labels, which impacts the performance of load identification neural network model. To this end, we propose a label noise robust learning approach for non-intrusive load monitoring based on meta-learning. On the basis of traditional teacher-student framework, multiple meta networks are generated by adjusting student network parameters using pseudo labels, which are derived from the noisy labeled data according to neighbor feature similarity. These meta networks further generate predictions, which are compared with the teacher network predictions to constitute the meta loss. The NILM model trained with meta loss can extract valuable information from noisy labeled data and avoid overfitting to incorrect labels. Comparison tests on two public datasets and one private dataset demonstrate that our method provides better performance under different noise rates."

This study examines the performance of three deep learning models: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), across three learning frameworks: Federated Learning (FL), Split Learning (SL), and Regular Learning (RL). Four sampling approaches are used to mitigate class imbalance: SMOTE, Random Oversampling (ROS), Random Undersampling (RUS), and NearMiss Undersampling (NMU). Although accuracy, precision, and recall are conventional assessment measures, the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) functions as the primary performance metric. FL and RL robustness was further assessed through noisy client simulations. Experimental findings indicate that FL surpasses RL, demonstrating enhanced stability under certain adversarial scenarios. The proposed FL model achieved higher AUC-ROC performance than the Federated SDT model on the same dataset. This research advances the development of privacy-preserving and robust fraud detection systems, facilitating future enhancements in decentralized machine learning frameworks."

    "abstract": "In many new power electronic systems higher switching frequencies and steeper switching slopes could be realized, resulting in higher efficiency and power density. This leads to increased electromagnetic interference (EMI). Passive components for attenuating common-mode (CM) EMI often are bulky and heavy and reduce the power density significantly. For this reason, active EMI filters (AEFs) were developed for compensating the disadvantages of passive filters. Besides analog active EMI filters, digital active EMI filters (DAEF) have been introduced. Most active filters measure the EMI and generate a cancellation signal which is superimposed to the EMI to reduce it. The cancellation signal generation requires signal processing leading to delays. This results in a misalignment of EMI and cancellation signals, and the compensation performance is reduced. In some cases, a future noise signal can be predicted for a certain time. If the time that can be seen into the future is longer than the time required to generate the cancelation signal from a noise signal, the delay can be compensated. For example, periodic signals allow predictions of the future course. This paper discusses the predictability of the EMI and methods for synchronization between power electronic systems as noise source and DAEF. Selected methods for generating the cancellation signal are described and the filter performance is compared based on a motor inverter test setup. Advantages and disadvantages of the methods are discussed."

    "abstract": "This study investigates model predictive speed control for permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) under repetitive disturbances. A novel single-loop dual-layer MPC framework incorporating an iterative learning observer (ILO) is proposed. First, a discrete-time ILO is designed to estimate repetitive disturbances. By fully utilizing the repetitive characteristic, the ILO enables accurate estimation of harmonic disturbances while simultaneously providing a preview of their future behaviors. Second, the state reference trajectory and the control reference trajectory of the PMSM are derived by incorporating both the reference sequence and the previewed disturbance sequence. Finally, a single-loop MPC is developed to track the reference trajectories. Departing from existing MPC schemes, the proposed framework demonstrates three distinctive advantages: (1) exact tracking of references under repetitive disturbances, (2) preservation of structural simplicity, and (3) no requirement of explicit exogenous signal modeling. The stability of the proposed controller is rigorously analyzed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing disturbance-observer-based MPC designs in steady-state speed fluctuation suppression capability."

This study experimentally evaluates an FRT system’s robustness against facial occlusions, including masks, glasses, and headwear-under both daylight and poor lighting conditions, measuring its False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR). The results reveal that while the system performed perfectly in ideal daylight, its accuracy deteriorated significantly in poor lighting. The combination of multiple occlusions under these adverse conditions led to high error rates, reaching up to $15 \\%$ FAR and $15 \\%$ FRR. To address these vulnerabilities, a dual-layered security model integrating facial recognition with appearancebased person recognition is proposed. And experimentally validated. This hybrid approach enhances system resilience by using non-biometric identifiers for continuous tracking, thereby improving security without sacrificing data privacy principles."

    "abstract": "Decentralized applications (dApps) in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) face a fundamental tension between regulatory compliance requirements like Know Your Customer (KYC) and maintaining decentralization and privacy. Existing permissioned DeFi solutions often fail to adequately protect private attributes of dApp users and introduce implicit trust assumptions, undermining the blockchain’s decentralization. Addressing these limitations, this paper presents a novel synthesis of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), and AttributeBased Access Control to enable privacy-preserving on-chain permissioning based on decentralized policy decisions. We provide a comprehensive framework for permissioned dApps that aligns decentralized trust, privacy, and transparency, harmonizing blockchain principles with regulatory compliance. Our framework supports multiple proof types (equality, range, membership, and time-dependent) with efficient proof generation through a commit-and-prove scheme that moves credential authenticity verification outside the ZKP circuit. Experimental evaluation of our KYC-compliant DeFi implementation shows considerable performance improvement for different proof types compared to baseline approaches. We advance the state-of-the-art through a holistic approach, flexible proof mechanisms addressing diverse real-world requirements, and optimized proof generation enabling practical deployment."

Using the Cosmos SDK, Ethermint, and the ONNX runtime, we enable AI models to run on-chain across multiple blockchain nodes. We evaluate the system’s feasibility, performance, and portability, showing that it can support different AI engines and model types. By enabling GenAI inference on-chain, our approach expands what smart contracts can do, especially for data-driven DeFi, and opens the door to new applications in the future."

When these tasks execute on the same GPUs that drive the simulation, resource contention can degrade performance. We propose an asynchronous framework that offloads visualization to idle CPU cores and overlaps in situ work with simulation execution. The framework uses ASCENT for efficient data movement and rendering and applies core pinning. Evaluated with NekRS on Polaris and JUWELS Booster, it reduced end-to-end runtime by 21–40% for slice-based visualizations compared to inline GPU instrumentation. Slice outputs incurred little overhead and overlapped cleanly with the simulation. Heavier filters like isovolumes, multilevel contours, and volume rendering were \"free\" (i.e., visualization time was encapsulated by simulation time) only at lower node counts, consistent with a CPU-budget model: filter cost and output cadence must fit the cores available per node."

The derivative of the heat kernel with respect to time is determined by the Laplacian, and the heat content derived from the kernel can serve as a basis for graph comparison and recognition. In this work, the coefficients of the heat content power series are used to represent the structural properties of graphs as feature vectors. The relationships for determining the Mahalanobis (weighted Euclidean) distance between feature vectors—heat kernel invariants and elementary symmetric polynomials of graphs— are presented. This distance measure enables quantitative comparison of graph structures and can be applied in pattern recognition, computer vision, and signal identification tasks. The study also considers the use of Laplacian-based learning to optimize the Mahalanobis matrix for improved discrimination between graph representations. The obtained results demonstrate the feasibility of using heat content coefficients as invariant descriptors of graph structure."

While Software-Defined Networking (SDN) offers a solution, its widespread adoption is hindered by high costs and compatibility issues with existing traditional (legacy) infrastructure. This paper addresses this gap by proposing and implementing a prototype of a configuration management system for dynamic VLAN reconfiguration in legacy network environments. The core of the solution is an experimental testbed built within the EVE-NG emulation platform, integrating Ansible for network automation, Prometheus for metrics collection, and Grafana for visualization and monitoring. The prototype successfully demonstrates the automated execution of VLAN configuration changes on emulated Cisco devices via SSH, coupled with the ability to monitor the resulting network state through collected NetFlow data and system metrics. The developed framework serves as a foundational closed-loop system for managing network configuration, validating the practical feasibility of the approach. The results confirm functionality of the prototype and lay the groundwork for future integration of intelligent optimization algorithms for fully autonomous network management."

The reconstruction methods of ionospheric electron density is mainly divided into three categories including tomography, data assimilation, and deep learning, and integration of multi-source data is the development direction of three-dimensional electron density reconstruction. This paper used spaceborne SAR data, ionosonde data, GNSS-TEC data, and IRI model data to construct the constraint conditions for three-dimensional electron density reconstruction, and then reconstructs the three-dimensional electron density of the ionosphere. The specific idea was as follows, the regional TEC is inverted from spaceborne SAR data, GNSS-TEC is used to calibrate the regional TEC baseline, the peak height and maximum electron density of the F2 layer are calibrated by ionosonde data, and finally the electron density profiled from IRI model was corrected to obtain the three-dimensional electron density profile. Simulation experiments showed that the three-dimensional electron density reconstruction method proposed in this paper can reconstruct high-precision three-dimensional electron density profile of the ionosphere, which might provide reference for further research and verification."

Simulations verify that adaptive control significantly enhances frequency stability and power response compared to fixed-parameter VSG.

The proposed configuration enables both active and reactive power control, thereby facilitating reactive power compensation while supplying substation auxiliary loads. As a result, it contributes to reducing the rated power and downsizing of the highvoltage line-frequency transformer required in substation facilities. However, unlike conventional SDBC-based systems, the nonlinear characteristics of the diode rectifier prevent cluster power balancing via circulating current control. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a novel method utilizing negative-sequence current for cluster balancing. The effectiveness of the proposed method is experimentally verified using a $100 \\mathrm{~V}, 5 \\mathrm{kVA}$ downscaled model."

    "abstract": "The application of Stable Diffusion Models (SDMs) in Internet of Things (IoT) image processing raises significant ethical concerns, particularly regarding model copyright infringement and the dissemination of inappropriate Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated images. Model watermarking technology has proven effective for copyright verification and tracing the source model of AI-generated content. While initial-noise-modification-based watermarking can provide provable security and achieve lossless embedding, existing methods rely on Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) inversion for watermark extraction, which suffer from inherent precision limitations that compromise extraction accuracy. More critically, most of the existing approaches of this type still rely on access to the original or a compatible SDM during watermark verification, which introduces considerable practical constraints due to the model’s size and computational demands. To address these limitations, an end-to-end flexible SDM watermarking framework is proposed that replaces the DDIM inversion process with a lightweight watermark extractor, thereby eliminating the dependency on inversion in conventional provably secure watermarking. Specifically, a universal watermark extractor across SDM V1/V2 variants is designed based on a Transformer and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) framework, complemented by fine-tuning a pre-trained watermark decoder, to directly recover watermark information from generated images. Experimental results confirm that our watermarking method yields superior performance in terms of fidelity and robustness. The lightweight extractor offers additional advantages of low computational cost and high transmission efficiency, providing an efficient and practical solution for watermark extraction in SDM-generated image."

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel at extracting spatial and channel-wise features, but reliance on final-layer activations often underutilizes intermediate representations and weakens hierarchical cues. We propose RyNet, a theoretically grounded, modular, and CNN-agnostic dual-attention framework that integrates dynamic channel refinement with multi-level feature fusion in a single backbone. RyNet aggregates low-, mid-, and high-level feature maps, applies channel squeezing with learnable channel-wise attention scores to promote selective activation, and fuses recalibrated features via a lightweight summation strategy. This yields stage-to-stage coupling with implicit spatial emphasis at negligible computational cost. RyNet achieves hierarchical complementarity without branch duplication or concatenation–projection stacks. Integrated into VGG16 and ResNet18, RyNet improves CIFAR-10 test accuracy from 89.90% to 90.84% (a relative improvement of 1.04%) and from 90.42% to 91.74% (a relative improvement of 1.50%), respectively, On the PlantVillage (tomato) dataset, a custom CNN-based model integrated with RyNet achieves 99.61% accuracy, representing a relative improvement of 1.54%. Under identical datasets and training conditions, RyNet consistently and statistically outperforms SE and CBAM, and beyond this, demonstrates superiority over recent CNN–Transformer hybrids and other state-of-the-art methods. Feature-space analysis reveals a 121.9% increase in inter-class separability, while visualizations and interpretability evaluations confirm the effectiveness of dynamic channel selection under multi-level fusion. These results provide strong theoretical, empirical, and statistical validation for the proposed design. Overall, RyNet emerges as a principled, lightweight, and easily integrable module for enhancing CNN representations in resource-constrained environments, with significant performance gains and improved model explainability."

    "abstract": "Accurate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction for turbofan engines remains a challenging issue for the aviation industry due to operational condition variability, sensor noise, and the relatively complex degradation patterns of turbofans. To address this important research problem, we propose a new Bidirectional LSTM with Dual-Attention (BiLSTM-Attn) model that integrates (1) temporal attention (αt) for phase-aware degradation modeling mechanism, (2) feature attention (βj) via convolution for sensor importance weighting, (3) hybrid normalization for condition invariance, and (4) gated fusion of spatiotemporal contexts particularly to model RUL for turbofan engines. Evaluated on the NASA C-MAPSS, the proposed BiLSTM-Attn model achieves an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 16.0 across the FD001-FD004 dataset, thus outperforming the competing model (CNN-LSTM) by 10% accuracy measure while maintaining real-time inference speed. The interpretable attention weights of the proposed model also provide maintenance engineers with significantly useful actionable insights into critical degradation patterns, as demonstrated through case studies on FD003 failure mode datasets. This combination of relatively high accuracy (R2 = 0.82) along with the explainability of the proposed model makes it suitable for both offline analysis and onboard deployment actions in aviation health management systems."

    "abstract": "The existing works concerning movable antenna (MA) arrays often stipulate a half-wavelength minimum antenna spacing to avoid mutual coupling (MC) between antennas. This letter unveils the potential performance improvement of MA arrays by strategically leveraging MC for the first time. Firstly, the impacts of MC are precisely characterized by the MC matrix, which is derived based on rigorous circuit and antenna theories. Upon this approach, the maximization of the sum rate is formulated as a problem, where the minimum-spacing constraints for antennas are naturally removed. Subsequently, a hybrid convex optimization and particle swarm optimization (CO-PSO) is proposed to tackle the proposed problem efficiently. Simulations results are provided to validate the robustness of our proposed CO-PSO algorithm. These results demonstrate that MC can enhance the spectral efficiency of MA arrays by approximately 1.75 bps/Hz, thus highlighting the potential of MC in improving the capacity of MA-assisted wireless communications."

    "abstract": "Commercial light-emitting diodes (LEDs) offer fixed lighting patterns with limited canopy coverage, creating a mismatch with dragon fruit's dynamic photosynthetic and phenological needs. To mitigate the inherent limitations of conventional unidirectional irradiance distributions, a bi directional emission LED system incorporating adjustable focusing mechanisms is engineered. Monte Carlo ray-tracing and numerical integration are employed to quantitatively analyze the influence of plant architectural complexity, LED positioning strategies, and angular emission profiles on canopy light distribution. Concurrently, three optimization algorithms— Simulated Annealing (SA), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)—are comparatively evaluated for their efficacy in maximizing radiation efficiency (RE) and utilization efficiency (UE). The proposed method (1) achieves targeted photon delivery while minimizing light spillage between canopies, resulting in 39.39% and 206.67% higher UE compared with the other two schemes under the same static fixture at a height of 1.7 m and an emission angle of 50°, and (2) achieves high prediction accuracy, with RE and UE determination coefficients (R²) of 96% and 97%, respectively."

Then, a three-stage weighting function, and K-means clustering to classify residuals into reliable and outlier sets, with the maximum residual from the reliable set used to adaptively determine the threshold. Finally, by employing a dual-statistics joint test to extract two-dimensional statistical features from residual matrices, an unreliable information isolation algorithm with low computational complexity is developed. Experimental results demonstrate that the method outperforms the state-of-the-art results with ensured accuracy and robustness for cooperative vehicle localization in urban environments."

However, existing benchmarks on face anti-spoofing mainly focus on RGB images, further challenged by consistently developed 3D high-fidelity (HiFi) masks. To facilitate the research on multimodal face anti-spoofing, we construct the HyperSpectral Face Anti-Spoofing (HySpeFAS) dataset. We introduce the newly-developed snapshot spectral imaging (SSI) technology to capture real and spoof faces, as well as identify unknown HiFi masks. Specifically, hyperspectral images (HSIs) acquired by SSI sensor contain rich information about the chemical composition of the targets, which can be used to effectively distinguish live human skin and various spoof materials. The HySpeFAS dataset contains 22,368 multimodal images (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e</i>., RGB, SSI, HSI) of 17 live subjects and 60 spoof subjects. Moreover, extensive experiments with baseline deep learning models validate the special features of the SSI images and the potential of SSI in FAS. By publishing the dataset as well as the baseline models, we encourage the community to foster the algorithm study associated with hyperspectral images and the development of SSI-equipped intelligent systems."

    "abstract": "Green transformation has become a global consensus, but enterprises often treat it as a symbolic strategy rather than a substantive commitment. While existing studies have examined how internal capabilities and external pressures influence enterprise green actions, few have explored how digital transformation enables external green strategies such as green mergers and acquisitions (M&A), or how CEO career concerns shape such decisions. This study examines the impact of digital transformation on green M&A among Chinese A-share listed enterprises from 2010 to 2023, with an in-depth analysis of the moderating role of CEO career concerns in this process. The results show that digital transformation significantly promotes green M&A, particularly when CEOs face external and prospective concerns, whereas internal career concerns weaken this effect. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the digital–green relationship varies by CEO characteristics, industry type, and enterprise characteristics. The study enriches the understanding of sustainable strategic decision-making mechanisms in engineering management. It offers enterprises guidance on aligning incentives to promote the synergy between digital transformation and green transition."

    "abstract": "Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome, with high morbidity and mortality. Timely treatments and precise interventions are crucial for improving sepsis patient outcomes. Reinforcement learning (RL) models have made promising advances in associating sepsis treatments. However, existing models face obstacles when applied to heterogeneous sepsis patients with an imbalanced distribution of disease severity, struggling to maintain optimal performance. To provide optimal therapeutic intervention strategies for sepsis with different disease severity, we proposed a novel treatment recommendation model named Medical ontology knowledge and disease diagnosis Position aware Transfer learning - Double Dueling Deep Q Network (MPT-D3QN). Through the attention mechanism, medical ontology knowledge and disease diagnosis positions were introduced to achieve a more accurate representation of patient states. Subsequently, an offline deep reinforcement learning algorithm was used to recommend therapeutic intervention strategies for a specific patient population. The transfer learning framework was responsible for the information transfer across patient groups in different domains. We trained and tested MPT-D3QN model on the Multi-Parameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset. Compared with the reported strategies in present clinical practice, the MPT-D3QN model could obtain a higher expected return value (12.98 vs. 10.61) and reduce the estimated mortality from 13.20% to 6.15% in all test datasets. Moreover, the experimental test on an external dataset eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU) further demonstrated the robust generalization capability of the model. Compared with the state-of-the-art models, the proposed model not only guaranteed higher expected returns but also generated optimal and interpretable treatment strategies for sepsis with different disease severity."

    "abstract": "The most fundamental security requirement for signature schemes is unforgeability, which guarantees that no one can create a valid signature on a message without the secret signing key. However, in signature schemes, there are potential attacks in which a third party forges the message and verification key of a valid signature and “hijacks” the signature. Such attacks are referred to as key substitution attacks. Key substitution attacks obscure the ownership of a signature—that is, who actually created it—and therefore must be taken into account in practical applications. In this article, we investigate security against key substitution attacks of a wide range of aggregate signature schemes and multi-signature schemes: the Boneh-Gentry-Lynn-Shacham aggregate signature scheme, the sequential aggregate signature scheme by Lysyanskaya et al., the multi-signature scheme by Bellare and Neven, MuSig2, and the ordered multi-signature scheme by Boldyreva et al. Furthermore, if any of the schemes does not provide security against key substitution attacks, then we modify the scheme to become secure against the attacks. This paper also provides important insights for practical deployments of signature schemes. For example, MuSig2 is actually used in blockchain systems, but if key substitution attacks were possible, the authenticity of the block contents would be called into question."

    "abstract": "Accurate trajectory prediction is crucial in IoT-based intelligent transportation systems. This task remains challenging due to the uncertainty of agent intentions and the highly stochastic social interactions between agents. Despite the promising progress, most existing studies overlook the impact of scene heterogeneity on driving behavior, thereby limiting the predictive performance of models across diverse scenes. Moreover, the highly stochastic social interactions between agents have not been fully explored, thus weakening the reliability of predictions. To address these challenges, a novel dynamic diffusion graph convolutional network with scene-guided gating is proposed in this study. First, a pioneering scene-guided gating is introduced to capture and leverage the impact of scene heterogeneity on driving behavior. This mechanism generates scene-specific non-shared parameters to selectively filter information, thus establishing scene-guided information bottlenecks to facilitate more socially-aware trajectory prediction. Then, a dynamic diffusion graph convolutional layer is formulated to comprehensively account for the highly stochastic social interactions between agents. It models social interactions as a diffusion process on a lane graph and employs bidirectional random walks on lane attention graphs to simulate the stochastic nature of social interactions. Finally, extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model."

    "abstract": "Probabilistic modeling is a core challenge in statistical machine learning. Tensor-based probabilistic graph methods address interpretability and stability concerns encountered in neural network approaches and allow tractable inference (e.g., marginal inference and conditional inference). In this paper, we introduce tensor ring decomposition for density estimation, which reduces the number of permutation candidates compared to existing methods, while simultaneously enhancing expressive power and maintaining tractable inference. Different non-negative strategies for density function results in two variants: Born TRDE offers simpler inference and sampling but with slightly lower accuracy, while Energy TRDE, though more complex, achieves superior performance. Furthermore, a mixture model that incorporates multiple permutation candidates with adaptive weights is designed, resulting in increased expressive flexibility and comprehensiveness. Unlike existing methods that focus on finding a single optimal permutation, our approach, inspired by ensemble learning, demonstrates that combining multiple suboptimal permutations can yield superior results. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach excels in estimating probability density functions and sampling, capturing intricate details with competitive or superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) tractable density methods."

This study aims to examine how various stimuli in live streaming environments such as promotion intensity, trustworthiness, streamer expertise, attractiveness, interactivity, and live room activities affect customer perceived pleasure and arousal, and how these emotional responses influence impulsive purchasing behavior. This study use the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) model as the theoretical framework. Data were collected through an online survey and cleaned and analyzed 389 gen z respondent using quantitative methods. The results revealed that six out of seven key variables had a significant positive effect on either pleasure or arousal. The Strongest variables were attractiveness affected pleasure; interactivity and expertise affected arousal; and trustworthiness was weakest. Notably, streamer expertise significantly influenced arousal but had no significant impact on pleasure, suggesting that emotional engagement in live shopping is driven more by entertainment and interpersonal connection than by information provided by the streamer."

Unlike traditional Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT), which maximizes instantaneous power, CPPT focuses on maintaining a stable and predictable power delivery. Therefore, this paper proposes a high-efficiency CPPT for PVGSs. The proposed CPPT estimates the solar irradiance and ambient temperature of a PVGS using two sets of voltage and current measurements, along with the Newton-Raphson method. The CPP can then be directly calculated to restrict the instantaneous power output of the PVGS. The proposed CPPT can also dynamically switch to MPPT if the estimated power output of the PVGS is lower than the restricted power output of the PVGS without extra measurement sets. Therefore, a high-efficiency CPPT can be realized meanwhile maintaining the potential maximum power output. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the CPP or MPP in 3s with a tracking accuracy of 99.82% under a tracking interval of 1 s."

    "abstract": "This article presents a novel three-port bidirectional DC-DC converter (BDC) featuring an integrated inductor to enhance power density and reduce system cost. The proposed converter topology enables the integration of electric vehicles (EVs), energy storage systems (ESSs), and a DC-Bus. Under high power demand, energy can be dispatched from the EV or ESS to the DC-Bus. Conversely, when the DC-Bus reaches full capacity, excess energy can be stored in the ESS or EV. This bidirectional energy flow enhances the reliability and flexibility of DC-microgrids (DC-MGs) while reducing reliance on a single energy source. To improve performance, the lowvoltage ports utilize a two-phase interleaving technique, which effectively minimizes current stress and ripple. The highvoltage ports utilize a tapped-inductor winding configuration, allowing for a high voltage-gain through adjustable turn ratios. This study focuses on power control between a 400 V DC-Bus and a 60 V ESS, and includes analysis of operating principles and steady-state behavior. The system verification using a 1 kW prototype circuit confirms that the proposed converter achieves both high voltage-gain and stable bidirectional power transfer, demonstrating its practical feasibility."

This paper presents a compact and interpretable regression framework for predicting luminous-flux degradation using Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The study utilizes 249 hours of hourly measurements collected in a controlled environment, encompassing temperature, humidity, voltage, and current, with the addition of two temporal features representing hours elapsed and hour-of-day. All features undergo standardization, and a five-fold cross-validated XGBoost regressor is trained with 100 trees, maximum depth of 6, sub-sampling, and column sampling. The model achieves $R^{2}=0.8899$ on the full dataset with RMSE $=0.7185$ lux and MAE $=0.3744$ lux. Cross-validation yields mean $R^{2}=0.9065( \\pm 0.0768)$, demonstrating strong generalization and low residual bias. Featureimportance analysis reveals that environmental drivers dominate predictive power, with temperature contributing $50.5 \\%$ and humidity 32.73%, significantly exceeding electrical parameters. A 15,000-hour simulation projects approximately 6% luminous-flux reduction from 266.25 to 250.31 lux without reaching L70 under stable conditions. However, long-horizon extrapolation should be interpreted cautiously given the early-life training data and absence of accelerated-aging signals. The results support shortto mid-horizon forecasting and predictive maintenance with a minimal sensor set while emphasizing thermal and humidity management for enhanced reliability."

Local features are extracted from different spectra of multiple radars by a multi-branch CNN residual group convolution module, and then after feature fusion, the AEM is applied, which focuses on the action region through spatial attention, and filters the key features through channel attention, which is complementary to Swin Transformer's global contextual modeling capability, and thus significantly improves the quality of the features in the high-level semantic stage. The experiments use the publicly available dataset from Delft University of Technology for 5-fold crossvalidation, which proves that the method can effectively recognize 9 different types of human actions with a recognition accuracy of 98.06%."

    "abstract": "Since the late 1990s, the first Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellation named Iridium was established. Since then, LEO has progressively been employed to augment Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). The train control system adapts GNSS for continuous train localization to deliver reliable distance between two trains. The more accurate and reliable the train location is, the more safe distance between two trains can be calculated and can be used as input for train control. LEO satellites that provide various information for the GNSS can deliver either more accurate ultra-rapid ephemeris or Doppler observations for end-user location calculation. This paper proposes a train localization method based on BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) ultra-rapid ephemeris augmentation utilizing LEO satellite observations.In order to carry out the experiments, a simulated LEO platform named DFZ is established,which includes a Trajectory Conversion Tool, a Scenario Editing Tool, and a Simulation Control Terminal. This approach employs the simulated LEO platform to acquire measurements from BDS satellites, enabling the generation of enhanced ultra-rapid ephemeris for the BDS constellation. We carried out experiments using the platform, generating GNSS signal as train moves along the track on the Beijing-Shenyang railway line, using the LEO satellites to generate ultra-rapid ephemeris.The simulated ultra-rapid ephemeris achieves an orbit determination accuracy of 5 cm and a clock offset precision of 3 ns. This augmented ephemeris data is then received and combined with observation files derived from a Beijing-Shenyang railway line. Positioning is implemented using a pseudorange-based least squares method. Comparative experiments demonstrate that, relative to positioning achieved using standard BDS broadcast ephemeris, this LEO-augmented method improves localization accuracy from 1.92 m to 1.44 m."

Different from previous works, we require neither the calibration among the multi-view cameras nor the actually captured BEV video. This makes the studied problem closer to real-world applications, however, more challenging. For this purpose, in this work, we propose a novel BEVTrack scheme. Specifically, given multi-view videos, we first use a virtual BEV transform module to obtain the BEV for each view. Then, we propose a unified BEV alignment module to fuse the respectively generated BEVs, in which we specifically design the self-supervised losses by considering both the spatial consistency and the temporal continuity. During the inference, we design the camera-subject collaborative registration and tracking strategy to make use of the mutual dependence between the multi-view cameras and the multiple targets, to achieve the desired BEV tracking. We also build a new benchmark for training and evaluation, the experimental results on which have verified the rationality of the problem and the effectiveness of our method."

    "abstract": "Intertidal mangrove communities present significant challenges for remote sensing classification due to tidal dynamics, intertwining canopies, and spectral confusion between species. These factors often lead to classification errors and indistinct species boundaries, primarily due to intraspectral variation and interspectral similarity, and also limit the capture of vertical structural features. To address these issues, we propose MSMNet, a specialised multimodal deep learning method for fine-grained mangrove species classification based on Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery. The model uses ResNet50 as its backbone architecture and integrates the Mamba state-space module to model long-range spatial correlations. MSMNet incorporates wavelet transform technology to enhance its ability to represent textures and uses three pathways to extract three key mangrove remote sensing modalities: morphological texture, spectral features, and vegetation physiological characteristics. The design of the multimodal dynamic fusion and enhanced multiscale integration modules supports cross-modal adaptive weight allocation and efficient cross-scale feature aggregation, leveraging complementary information across dimensions. It is demonstrated by experimental results that all baseline models are significantly outperformed by MSMNet with 73.80% mIoU, 84.47% F1 score, and 99.37% overall accuracy. Compared to the second-best approach, its metrics improved by 2.25%, 1.59% and 0.06% respectively. MSMNet notably demonstrated exceptional performance in classifying key mangrove species such as Rhizophora stylosa, achieving a 4.06% accuracy improvement and significantly reducing misclassification rates at species level. These findings confirm that multimodal feature fusion and multiscale information integration are crucial for improving the accuracy of mangrove species classification. MSMNet provides an efficient solution for precise intertidal mangrove mapping.

    "abstract": "Although most aircraft are equipped with active communication systems such as ADS-B and satellite links, these systems may fail in emergencies or when signals are lost. At this point, remote sensing, as a passive observation method that does not require a target response, can provide crucial visual information and effectively gaps left by traditional methods. With the support of existing remote sensing technologies, aircraft targets in remote sensing imagery can now be effectively identified and extracted through using image features. However, when reconstructing sub-diffraction-limited targets (e.g., aircraft registration numbers), key high-frequency information is irreversibly lost during imaging due to the optical system's inherent diffraction limit. This significantly restricts image interpretability. To address this limitation, we propose a new super-resolution reconstruction framework that combines physical optical modeling with deep diffusion models. Firstly, a parallel collimated light simulation system is constructed to model the degradation process due to diffraction and generate training samples that characterize the multi-level blurring effect. Secondly, the collected multi-frame training samples with varying degrees of blurriness are used as the conditional input to the diffusion model to enhance feature representation. Inspired by the principle of wavefront modulation and its compensation, we have designed two dedicated modules: the Selective Channel Attention Unit (SCAU) and the Spatial Gated Feature Enhancement (SGFE), which explicitly compensate for the high-frequency attenuation caused by diffraction. The experimental results demonstrate that this method outperforms existing methods on both public remote sensing datasets and self-collected real-world datasets. It is effective at reconstructing identity information, such as aircraft registration numbers, from aerial remote sensing images, expanding the range of identities detectable by current remote sensing satellites."

    "abstract": "Smart grids, as a critical application of the Internet of Things (IoT), integrate diverse power generation sources while serving a vast number of energy consumers. Therefore, multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting methods are essential for power forecasting. The existing deep MTS forecasting models have already achieved remarkable performance. They deploy different architectures to analyze MTS features from the temporal, frequency and variable dimensions. However, tight combinations of three types of MTS features have rarely been explored, resulting in imperfect predictions, especially for power systems, wherein the variates are correlated mostly because of the close spatial locations of power plants and clients. To address this problem, a novel MTS forecasting model, SimTFV, that is capable of simultaneously modeling temporal-frequency-variable features is proposed in this work. SimTFV mixes temporal and frequency features via an enhanced instance normalization mechanism based on Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Moreover, SimTFV possesses multiple modified attention modules for simultaneously and efficiently extracting MTS features from the temporal and variable dimensions. Extensive experiments on three energy generation benchmarks and one energy consumption benchmark demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of SimTFV. The code is released on https://github.com/OrigamiSL/SimTFV."

These localized descriptors extract corresponding heterogeneity features for different radiomic features and are able to capture tumor characteristics at various localization levels. These descriptors also capture tumor heterogeneity both at the individual tumor level and across the whole dataset, providing decision-making models with features that are both more effective and interpretable. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed features with the Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) across multiple centers, yielding an AUC of 0.92 when combined with pathological features and demonstrating good performance in external datasets (AUCs of 0.84 and 0.81). Additionally, we transform the best model into a symbolic formula to intuitively explain the machine learning model's prediction process, showing how factors such as age, HER2, Ki-67 and heterogeneity influence the prediction. The symbolized model is consistent with the experience of clinical experts, which enhances users' confidence in deep models. The experimental results show that our proposed features and method outperform classical heterogeneity features and end-to-end neural networks with a small additional computational cost."

Our computational approach incorporates (1) class imbalance correction via Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), applied exclusively to training data; (2) mutual-information-based feature selection to identify key predictors; and (3) a hierarchical hybrid architecture uniquely combining support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), and bagged trees, with a logistic regression meta-classifier. Using 5-fold cross-validation, the hybrid model achieved a weighted-average accuracy of 99.29%, sensitivity of 99.27%, and F1 score of 99.24%, outperforming various standalone models—especially in predicting low birth weight (LBW) and high birth weight (HBW) classes.

Technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulation method was also employed to explore the underlying physical mechanisms. The results demonstrate that the combined effect of a positive pulse injected into the collector (CEMP) and pulsed X-ray irradiation exceeds the linear superposition of their individual effects. Conversely, the combined effect of a positive pulse injected into the base (BEMP) and pulsed X-ray irradiation aligns closely with the results observed under BEMP acting alone. Mechanism analysis reveals that when CEMP and pulsed X-ray irradiation act simultaneously, there is a significant increase in both the drift photocurrent at the collector junction and the diffusion photocurrent near the collector junction. However, when BEMP and pulsed X-ray irradiation act simultaneously, these photocurrent components remain small, leading to a combined effect similar to the results observed when BEMP acts alone. These findings provide critical insights for the radiation-hardening design of bipolar circuits in harsh radiation environments."

    "abstract": "Four-port single-junction circulators are widely employed in in-band full-duplex systems owing to their advantages in size and manufacturing cost. This article presents a broadband synthesis method for miniaturized four-port single-junction microstrip circulators. By applying multiple rotation mode (MRM) analysis to the design of the four-port single-junction configuration, the azimuthal characteristics of the internal modes within the cross resonator are effectively reconstructed. For the central junction with arbitrarily complex conductor geometries, a simple and effective method for extracting input impedance is proposed, and the reactance compensation principle of the central junction is analyzed in combination with the equivalent circuit. A folded transmission circuit is constructed via a compact impedance-matching network to achieve the miniaturization of broadband circulators. The proposed miniaturized four-port single-junction circulator prototype is fabricated and measured, with the measurement results demonstrating an excellent agreement with the expected performance.

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous multicore systems, such as ARM's big.LITTLE architecture requires efficient task scheduling to balance deadline misses, energy consumption, and throughput. Traditional methods often assign tasks based on static classifications of computational or memory intensity, which do not fully utilize the dynamic nature of these systems. This paper proposes a scheduling algorithm called the Dynamic Scoring-Based Task Scheduling (DSTS) algorithm, which dynamically assigns tasks to cores by considering real-time processor states and task requirements. The algorithm uses task and processor scores, which account for computational needs, memory demands, and urgency, to ensure efficient task processor mapping and core utilization. The proposed approach significantly reduces energy consumption and improves system performance. The results show that DSTS reduces average energy consumption by 30.95 percent compared to four other leading schedulers, cuts missed deadlines by 26.92 percent, and increases throughput by 3.11 percent. These results demonstrate that DSTS effectively reduces energy use and improves deadline adherence, making it suitable for energy-critical applications such as mobile devices, cloud services, and embedded systems."

    "abstract": "This article studies the event-triggered prescribed-time distributed observer network design problem of linear time-invariant systems subject to unknown input (UI), where each observer node has access only to partial output information of the target system. The issue of the prescribed-time distributed event-triggered state estimation has not been adequately addressed. To this end, a novel prescribed-time distributed unknown input observer (PTDUIO), featuring the periodic delayed terms and prescribed-time coupling gain, is proposed under the scenario of continuous-time communication. It is analytically proved that the constructed PTDUIO enables each observer node to reconstruct the target system's states in the prescribed settling time regardless of initial conditions, with completely eliminating the influence of UI. To reduce the communication frequency among neighboring nodes, an improved event-triggered mechanism with the triggering condition related to the prescribed-time function is designed. Such a design facilitates the simultaneous realization of prescribed-time convergence and event-triggered communication. In addition, the sufficient criterion is derived to achieve the practical prescribed-time distributed state estimation in the event-triggered communication fashion, and the Zeno behavior is excluded. Finally, numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the designed PTDUIO."

    "abstract": "This study addresses the problem of radar maritime target detection in scenarios characterized by low signal-to-clutter ratios (SCR) and out-of-distribution (OoD). The complex scattering characteristics of sea clutter are difficult to model precisely. Detection methods often exhibit mismatches between their modeled clutter scattering characteristics and the actual sea clutter, resulting in poor detection performance in diverse maritime environments. This study proposes a multi-feature fusion detection method, namely the multi-feature fusion detector (MFFD), that employs disentangled representation learning. The MFFD is designed to adapt to varying environments and comprehensively utilize information from radar data. Specifically, the MFFD first extracts polarization-Doppler and polarization time frequency features from raw radar echoes. These features are then encoded into disentangled representational vectors, which include target vectors, sea state classification vectors, and redundant vectors. Finally, the MFFD fuses target vectors using an attention mechanism. During training, the MFFD employs a multi-task loss function to ensure the accurate disentanglement of representational vectors. Furthermore, a method for filtering target label noise has been introduced to improve the quality of datasets, especially in instances where target occlusion occurs. The experimental results demonstrate that the MFFD achieves superior detection performance compared to several existing detection methods, thereby offering a promising solution for maritime target detection in challenging conditions."

To address these challenges, this paper proposes EI-Cooper, an Edge Intelligence (EI)-enhanced cooperative framework for adaptive and efficient CP in heterogeneous vehicular networks. The novelty of EI-Cooper is fourfold.

Existing methods for determining load torque involve the use of a torque sensor, which increases the weight, size, and cost of the test rig. A method for determining load torque based on a Kalman filter is proposed. This involves direct measurements of the electric motor stator current and voltage, recover the state vector using a Kalman filter, and calculating the current value of the load torque using angular velocity and electromagnetic torque values, averaging the value of the load torque over a sliding window. Using this method, it was possible to achieve a relative torque error of 1.6% in static conditions with supply voltage distortions and fluctuations, and 0.15% in the absence of supply voltage fluctuations and distortions. The proposed method for determining load torque does not require significant hardware resources and can be implemented on modern microcontrollers.."

    "abstract": "The use of digital twins in electric drive control tasks is driven by ever-increasing requirements for the quality of transient processes. The digital twin of a dynamic system is a discrete model, the use of which always entails some loss of accuracy and the appearance of distortions in the frequency domain. Mathematical models of cable lines are characterized by relatively small time constants, which imposes conditions on the choice of sampling frequency in accordance with the requirements imposed by the Shannon-Nyquist theorem. However, in practice, the choice of sampling period is limited by the processing power of the digital signal processor. As a result, the purpose of the article is to determine the limits of applicability in the frequency domain of existing methods of transition to the Z-region using the analog prototype method by conducting a comparative analysis of the error in approximating the frequency characteristics of the analog prototype with digital models of the RLC low-pass filter for each of the methods. It has been established that an increase in the sampling period leads to a discrepancy between digital models and their analogue prototypes in an integral sense over the entire frequency range. In addition, this leads to the loss of information about such physical processes in a real system, such as resonance or a change in the phase of the signal at the output of a dynamic system. For most engineering problems, the Tustin method can be recommended under appropriate assumptions about the stationarity of the dynamic system. However, if signs of non-stationarity appear or increased requirements for the design of regulators, according to the authors, it is worth paying attention to analytical models of dynamic systems"

In addition, the cascaded cell number may also influence the output performance. Therefore, this paper attempts to quantify the output quality of the CHB converter based STATCOM using the well-known flux-linkage ripples analysis. The analytical results show that the output quality varies with different modulation indices, and the comparative results show that a higher number of cascaded cells yields better output quality. The circuit simulation is also conducted to demonstrate the output performance agrees well with the analytical findings."

A six-phase PMSM model is established using the dual-DQ transformation, while the hardware architecture employs six half-bridge inverter modules with L-type coupling circuits. A digital signal processor (DSP)based controller with current-mode control is implemented to ensure real-time stability. For numerical computation, a trapezoidal-leapfrog integration method is adopted to simulate motor current dynamics efficiently. Both simulation and experimental results validate that the developed six-phase EME can accurately reproduce current and speed responses of the motor model under step response and four-quadrant operation.

The results indicate that electrically isolated drivers provide reliable gate signals while achieving lower drive power consumption and higher efficiency. Meanwhile, high-drive-capability architectures demonstrate advantages in reducing gate drive losses. Furthermore, compared to conventional silicon-based power devices, widebandgap semiconductors (SiC MOSFETs), combined with highefficiency gate drive strategies, not only enhance overall drive efficiency but also significantly reduce the total energy consumption of the driver circuit, highlighting their potential advantages in high-frequency and high-power-density applications.

However, financial and resource constraints make it impractical to install SCADA facilities in all distribution substations. This paper aims to determine the optimal locations for Remote Control Switches (RCS) within a single feeder by considering multiple decision criteria, including distribution substation load, number of customers affected by outages, number of priority customers, and travel time to the distribution substation. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach is used to prioritize the candidates for distribution substations with RCS based on the criteria mentioned above. The results of this study are expected to provide strategic recommendations on the number and optimal locations for RCS deployment, ensuring investment and operational efficiency. This study offers practical insights for PT.

Recent studies highlighted the significant contribution of brake and tire wear to overall vehicle emissions. To mitigate this, regenerative braking has been adopted in pure electric and hybrid electric vehicles, reducing fuel consumption, emissions, and brake wear. However, traditional brakes remain necessary for low-speed and emergency braking, introducing new challenges. This paper presents a comprehensive vehicle model featuring an advanced braking system, including: an electro-hydraulic actuator with fluid compressibility and thermal and rheological effects; a lumped capacitance model for disc temperature; a friction coefficient model dependent on contact temperature, pressure, and sliding speed. The drag torque effect, caused by the pads not completely separating from the disc at the end of braking phase is also considered. For the tribological analysis, detailed models were implemented. Several wheel slip controls were also compared to identify optimal strategies. Simulations show that using variable friction coefficient (CoF) yields more realistic, albeit harsher, braking conditions, increasing pressure, stress, and wear, yet preserving vehicle stability. Only with variable CoF the brake fading is detectable. First Order Sliding Mode Control (FOSM) and Second Order Sliding Mode Control (Second Order SMC) proved more efficient and robust than the Proportional-Integral controller."

    "abstract": "To address the lack of road feeling feedback in Steer-by-Wire (SBW) systems, this paper presents the design and simulation of a steering feel feedback controller based on Sliding Mode Control (SMC) to reproduce the road reaction torque at the steering wheel. The reference feedback torque is calculated from the steering rack force, determined through vehicle dynamics simulations, and applied as the controller input. A torque feedback motor then reproduces the road feel at the steering wheel. A co-simulation environment integrating MATLAB/Simulink and CarSim was developed to support the design, simulation, and validation of the steering feel feedback controller using a high-fidelity vehicle model. CarSim provides detailed vehicle dynamics, including road reaction forces and steering system characteristics, while Simulink implements the control algorithm and models the steering wheel dynamics. This co-simulation setup enables a realistic evaluation of the proposed controller in a Simulation-in-the-Loop (SiL) framework under various driving scenarios. The proposed method is validated through different standardized driving tests based on ISO procedures, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating robust and realistic steering feel feedback for SBW systems. The results, derived from co-simulation, indicate that the proposed controller successfully generates a steering feel with stable torque tracking."

This project focuses on the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University, a 281-acre living museum founded in 1872 in Boston. Drawing on more than a century of curatorial data, the research combines historical analysis with computational methods to visualize the biographies of plants and people. The resulting platform reveals patterns of care and scientific observations, along with the collective dimensions embedded in botanical data. Using techniques from artificial intelligence, geospatial mapping, and information design, the project frames the arboretum as a system of shared agency—an active archive of more-than-human affinities that records the layered memory of curatorial labor, the situated nature of knowledge production, and the potential of design to bridge archival record and future care."

    "abstract": "In increasingly complex electromagnetic environments, single-snapshot direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation confronts growing technical challenges, particularly with non-Gaussian impulsive noise emerging as a critical factor that severely compromises estimation accuracy. This paper presents a single-snapshot DOA estimation framework that integrates Isolation Forest (IForest)-based anomaly detection with an enhanced sparse reconstruction algorithm to address the challenges posed by impulsive noise and local convergence. First, leveraging the impulsive noise's outlier characteristics, the IForest algorithm is applied to identify anomalies within single-snapshot observations, enabling effective mitigation of impulsive interference. Subsequently, to avoid the susceptibility of traditional non-convex optimization algorithms to local minima, an improved Focal Underdetermined System Solver (FOCUSS) is proposed by reformulating the objective function and refining the optimization strategy, thereby enhancing sparse signal recovery performance. Finally, the purified measurements obtained from the anomaly detection process are fed into the improved FOCUSS algorithm to achieve high-resolution and robust DOA estimation. Simulation results verify that under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions with impulsive noise contamination, the proposed approach significantly outperforms conventional methods in terms of estimation accuracy, interference suppression, and robustness, while exhibiting enhanced resolution capabilities."

    "abstract": "Traditional centralized voltage regulation in distribution grids is typically formulated using the DistFlow model, which requires complete system knowledge, including topology and line parameters. However, due to limited observability, complete system information is often unavailable or unreliable at the grid edge. Previous works introduce data-driven approaches to overcome this problem, and input convex neural networks (ICNNs) have been applied to preserve convexity, enabling tractable optimization. However, discriminative learning models like ICNNs often overfit historical data, leading to poor generalization to unseen operating conditions. Overfitting may lead to biased control, particularly under shifting operating conditions caused by high penetrations of distributed energy resources (DERs). Challenges to regularizing such data-driven surrogates lie in the absence of a generative mapping from voltage states to control variables like power injections. To address these limitations, we propose a Regularized ICNN (RegICNN) incorporating a cyclic neural architecture for physics-based regularization. In RegICNN, we (1) enable a form of generative regularization to capture bidirectional mappings between voltage and power for unseen operation points; (2) further introduce a quadratic regularization term tailored to power flow physics; and (3) theoretically analyze the injection-voltage mapping under the DistFlow model, showing its convexity conditions and justifying the use of ICNNs as optimum data-driven surrogates for voltage control. Specifically, RegICNN learns a convex neural surrogate that approximates the injection-voltage mapping while preserving feasibility and global optimality for gradient-based control. Experiments on 3-, 12-, 116-, and 123-bus distribution feeders demonstrate that the RegICNN-based surrogate significantly improves modeling accuracy and control robustness when facing changes in operating points, making it a promising approach for data-driven voltage control in modern, dynamic distribution grids."

    "abstract": "In Cyber-Physical Systems security (CPSs), replay attacks disrupt the temporal alignment between inputs and outputs. The dual nonlinearity of Hammerstein system and quantized measurements further increases the difficulty of parameter estimation. This paper investigates the intrusion tolerant (meaning the capable of maintaining performance despite attack interference) identification problem of quantized Hammerstein systems under replay attacks. On the attack side, an optimal attack strategy is formulated by maximizing estimation error under energy constraints. A closed-form solution is derived using quadratic optimization and projection. For the defense design, a sending mechanism based on stochastic intervals and binary detection sequences is proposed. By leveraging the statistical properties of the detection sequence, the mechanism compensates for estimation errors caused by attacks. The system’s nonlinear and quantized structure is reformulated as a solvable nonlinear system, enabling joint estimation of system parameters and attack probabilities. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal, and an optimal setting for defense factors is presented. Simulation examples validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach in terms of identification accuracy and attack resistance."

    "abstract": "Additive Friction Stir Deposition (AFSD) is an emerging metal additive manufacturing process gaining increased attention due to its solid-state processing nature, resulting in desirable mechanical properties and the capability of fabricating large parts. To understand the multi-physics nature of the process, modeling of thermal distribution and material velocity during processing is imperative, which can be addressed by solving the related partial differential equations (PDEs). However, complex coupled PDEs entail inaccuracies and slowness in utilizing the existing numerical methods, such as the Finite Volume Method (FVM). This work proposes a neural network-based method, coupled Physics Informed Neural Network (coPINN), as a fast and accurate mesh-free solution for predicting the thermomechanical states during the AFSD process. In the case studies, the proposed coPINN accurately predicts the velocity and temperature distribution for a steady-state non-linear coupled fluid dynamics-heat transfer model of the AFSD process faster than the existing FVM. Comprehensive comparisons with residual errors show the proposed method’s trustworthiness in handling coupled physics, non-linearity, and mixed boundary conditions. In addition, the solutions of our approach show better conformance with the actual experimental data than the FVM-based solver. Overall, this work shows more efficient neural network-based solutions of a PDEs-based model than a traditional numerical method."

Unlike traditional sim-to-real transfer methods that strongly rely on marker points with full correspondences, our approach simultaneously learns a deformation function space and a confidence map – both parameterized by a neural network – to map simulated shapes to their real-world counterparts. As a result, the sim-to-real learning can be conducted by input from either a 3D scanner as point clouds (without correspondences) or a motion capture system as marker points (tolerating missed markers). The resultant sim-to-real transfer can be seamlessly integrated into a neural network-based computational pipeline for inverse kinematics and shape control. We demonstrate the versatility and adaptability of our method on two vision devices and across four pneumatically actuated soft robots: a deformable membrane, a robotic mannequin, and two soft manipulators."

This paper presents the Design and Learning Research Group's solution to the euROBIN Manipulation Skill Versatility Challenge (MSVC) at IROS 2024, in which a standardized electronic task board is operated through a fixed sequence of subtasks. We deliberately adopt a simple, industry-style implementation: each subtask is taught by recording an open-loop Tool Center Point (TCP) and gripper trajectory in the task-board frame, a wrist-mounted depth camera is used once per run to localize the board and a few key features, and a web dashboard exposes the resulting motion primitives as reusable code blocks that can be reordered and reparameterized. With this pipeline, our system completes the benchmark in 28.2 s in the lab (37.2 s on-site), compared to a human baseline of 16.3 s and an average of 83.5 s for previous teams, closing a large part of the performance gap without advanced learning or feedback control. We further demonstrate limited skill transfer by retargeting the same subtask library to a smoke-detector battery replacement scenario required by the competition. Finally, we release our implementation as open source and discuss how competition design and benchmark structure influence the balance between simple engineered solutions and richer sensing and learning."

    "abstract": "Innovation ecosystems (IE) have gained prominence as drivers of business and sustainable development. Given their importance for social and economic development, they help address the increasing competition in globalized markets, the scarcity of natural resources, and the overall complexity of the innovation process. Despite their growing relevance, existing literature is characterized by theoretical ambiguity and methodological diversity. To address this, we propose a refined approach to measuring firms' IE orientation and clarifying its impact on innovation and collective benefits. We first conducted a qualitative content analysis to conceptualize the IE orientation. These insights informed a quantitative cluster analysis that was used to derive a classification variable. We then empirically tested this variable using survey data from 287 innovation managers to assess its relationship with innovation performance and collective benefits across economic, social, and environmental dimensions — aligned with the triple bottom line (TBL). Our findings from Southern European firms present a nuanced understanding of how IE orientation not only fosters enhanced innovation capabilities but also generates significant TBL benefits. This study underscores the potential role of IE in driving sustainable development within similar institutional contexts. By bridging the gap between theoretical conceptualization and empirical measurement, the study provides a more systematic and actionable understanding of IE."

    "abstract": "Neck muscle weakness causes the inability to raise and move the head, leading to fatigue, neck pain, and a “head-on-chest” posture (dropped head syndrome) in severe cases, which significantly affects quality of life. Static neck collars are the current standard of care. However, these collars are passive, which cannot restore the head-neck movement necessary for daily tasks. Emerging robotic devices like powered neck exoskeletons were developed to enable head-neck movements. Previous laboratory tests showed improved patients’ ability to follow prescribed trajectories; however, the ability to assist with daily tasks of such a robotic device remains unknown. In this paper, the functional range of motion allowed by a state-of-the-art powered neck exoskeleton was compared to a clinic-standard static neck collar in healthy adults performing simulated daily tasks wearing these devices. Results showed a greater head range of motion and consequently less compensatory torso movements while wearing the neck exoskeleton in its transparent mode. Participants rated the neck exoskeleton more favorably than the static collar in terms of comfort and ability to perform the tasks. Results also revealed the range of motion limits of the current neck exoskeleton for these daily tasks. These results provided justifications for using neck exoskeletons to restore daily functions and offered critical insights into future refinement of this technology to enable head range of motion for critical daily activities."

    "abstract": "Acoustic signals originating from distinct sources inherently exhibit diverse spectral and temporal characteristics. In this study, we propose a novel framework, termed the graph neural network of multiple diagonal constraints (GMDC), which is designed to learn class-specific representations of sound events within the graph domain. The proposed method initially encodes an input audio signal as a graph structure, which is subsequently extended into multiple class-specific graphs to enable the detection of overlapping sound events. To construct these class-specific graphs, the model learns a set of multi-graph structures represented by an adjacency tensor, which is derived based on temporal annotations for each sound class. The learning process is guided by two distinct loss functions: the first enforces diagonal constraints to emphasize features in event regions, while the second further refines this by suppressing off-diagonal activations in non-event regions. Furthermore, the GMDC framework integrates graph learning with event detection through both sequential and joint learning strategies, enabling more effective modeling of complex acoustic scenes. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate that the proposed GMDC framework improves the F1-score by 8.0% to 12.1% and reduces the error rate (ER) by 0.02 to 0.04 compared to the baseline convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN). Furthermore, on the synthetic underwater dataset, the GMDC consistently outperforms the CRNN baseline across various signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and signal-to interference ratio (SIR) conditions. Even under severely degraded conditions such as -12 dB SNR and SIR, the GMDC achieves improvements of 12.6% and 10.3% in F1-score and reductions of 0.16 and 0.21 in ER, respectively."

However, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) solutions for cross-chain data exchange across multiple domains are constrained by synchronous networks, hindering efficient data exchange in intermittent network environments. Furthermore, there is a lack of research on asynchronous cross-chain transaction pool mechanisms, which are crucial for optimizing system utility.

Built upon a specially designed asynchronous sidechain architecture, the system leverages a committee to provide AC-BaaS for data exchange across multiple IoT domains. To fulfill the need for asynchronous and efficient data exchange, we combine the ideas of aggregate signatures and verifiable delay functions to devise a novel cryptographic primitive called delayed aggregate signature (DAS), which constructs asynchronous cross-chain proofs (ACPs) that ensure the security of cross-chain interactions. To ensure the consistency of asynchronous transactions, we propose a multilevel buffered transaction pool that guarantees the transaction sequencing. We further propose a heuristic for optimizing the utility of the buffer pool mechanism to strike a balance between performance and resource consumption. We also examine DAS delay size settings to trade-off security and efficiency. We analyze and prove the security of AC-BaaS, simulate asynchronous communication environments under various security levels, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation. The results show that AC-BaaS outperforms SOTA schemes, improving throughput by an average of 1.71 to 5.09 times, reducing transaction latency by 64.36% to 85.49%, and maintaining comparable resource overhead."

Complex system operating conditions and poor stability margin have introduced new HFR risks, restricting the conventional suppression methods. Therefore, this paper provides two passivation schemes based on the virtual flux and digital differentiator to remove the influence of the time delay terms in control units, eliminating the negative damping risks. The realization methods of the integrator and differentiator in the passivation schemes are designed to facilitate practical implementation, with the fuzzy adaptive control method introduced to correct the control parameter. The passivation schemes have superior performance in HFR suppression amidst the changeable operation conditions and various MMC time delays, improving the stability and passivity. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes is verified through simulations and experiments of the MMC-HVDC system."

    "abstract": "Carbon nanostructured materials offer unique properties for spatial tactile sensors, but their inherent heterogeneous nature also presents challenges in signal processing to reduce hysteresis, enhance pressure-sensitive performance, and long-term stability. To address these challenges, a robust regularization technique using electrical mapping for implementation and evaluation within an embedded system is proposed. A low-power wireless sensing node is proposed to detect and classify the electrical response of a two-dimensional multiwall carbon nanotube/polypropylene (MWCNT/PP) tactile sensor using robust adaptive regularization and weighted order statistics methods. The location-dependent piezoresistive response of a MWCNT/PP square membrane is obtained from boundary electrical measurements and electrical mapping. The proposed system addresses the ill-posed inverse problem by implementing spatial tactile detection in a low-power microcontroller, thereby enabling the development of new Internet-of-Things (IoT) self-sensing integrated systems. Experimental results show a high accuracy of 93.94% for the spatial tactile detection, achieved with a low power consumption of 0.79 mW. The robust regularization coupled with the weighted order statistical classification and their implementation in a low-power microcontroller offers a promising approach to accurately detect spatial tactile responses."

This paper investigates a STAR-RIS-assisted multi-user uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) communication system, formulating a joint optimization problem to maximize the system sum-rate for different operational protocols of STAR-RIS, namely energy splitting (ES), mode switching (MS), and time switching (TS). The optimization variables comprise the active and passive beamforming, the deployment location of the STAR-RIS and the communication time allocation. In addition, we incorporate practical constraints, such as coupled phase-shift, discrete amplitude and phase settings and limited deployment regions. Given the non-convex nature of the problem due to multiple coupled variables and realistic constraints, we propose a low-complexity alternating optimization (AO) algorithm based on fractional programming (FP) theory. Specifically, the FP theory is employed to transform the optimization problem into a more tractable weighted sum form. Then, the optimization problem is decoupled into four subproblems, which are solved using specific methods tailored to each protocol. Finally, all variable blocks are optimized in an alternating manner until convergence. Numerical results indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves significant performance gains with low computational complexity and offers valuable guidance for the selection of the STAR-RIS deployment location and operational protocols."

    "abstract": "The growing integration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) within the smart grid has increased its exposure to significant cyber-physical threats. Intrusion and anomaly detection systems (IADS) are employed to enhance situational awareness, but they often generate large volumes of low-level alerts with limited context, thereby reducing their operational value for security analysts. Additionally, current cyber situational awareness tools lack the depth to support DER cybersecurity, limiting the Security Operation Center’s (SOC) ability to detect, interpret, and respond effectively. This paper presents CySIDER, a real-time Cyber Situational Intelligence framework designed to strengthen cybersecurity visibility in DER networks. CySIDER integrates edge-based machine learning anomaly detection with cloud-level alert correlation and knowledge-graph reasoning to transform raw alerts into coherent high-level incident representations. The framework supports standardized threat mapping through the MITRE ATT&CK model and contextual analytics for rapid, informed response. The framework is validated within an experimental testbed environment using DER-specific datasets, achieving low prediction latency ($\\approx 2 \\mathrm{~ms}$) and high alert confidence ($\\approx 96 \\%$), with high alert reduction and correlation rates. This framework is protocol-agnostic and IADS-platform independent, making it a scalable and practical solution to secure next-generation DER networks."

Integrating the Metaverse with DTs redefines human–computer interaction by seamlessly blending physical and virtual reality. In this paper, we propose an immersive digital twin framework for human organs that integrates real-time bio-signal data. We design a DT framework by creating 3D models of the heart and lungs organs in Unity, targeting Virtual Reality (VR) platforms, such as the Meta Quest. These models animate dynamically in response to live sensor streams (e.g., smartwatch-derived heart rate). Additionally, we enhance the framework with machine learning models that forecast short-term physiological trends and can also detect anomalies in the patterns. The proposed system supports real-time interaction, visualization, and prediction, offering applications in remote healthcare, continuous monitoring, medical training, and patient education. Our approach demonstrates the potential of combining immersive environments with bio-signal-driven machine learning to create intelligent, interactive, and adaptive healthcare systems with application sin surgery and medicine, in general."

These attacks disconnect players from ongoing game sessions against their will. Cheaters can launch them as a Denial-of-Service against opponents with very few packets (sometimes only one) to steal the victory from the target without exposing themselves as fraudsters.This paper shows how such issues present in a single game engine can spread widely across several games produced by different editors, focusing on Unreal Engine, whose source code is publicly available. UE is also commonly found in digital twins, virtual reality, and other Metaverse solutions. We present our analysis of the design and implementation choices made within Unreal Engine. We cover how to exploit UE networking protocols and discuss how to defeat some common countermeasures used on the Internet against IP spoofing. We propose some mitigation strategies for video game developers."

The limitations imposed by available communication bandwidth make achieving lightweight compression and high-quality reconstruction under low compression ratios particularly challenging. Although widely utilized in hyperspectral image processing, Transformer remains constrained in practical remote sensing applications due to its considerable computational burden. In response to this issue, this paper propose a CNN–Mamba hybrid (CMH) architecture-based compressed sensing (CS) network (CMCSN). As the core of feature enhancement, the CMH block effectively combines the local modeling capability of CNN and the global representation power of Mamba, achieving efficient feature representation while maintaining linear computational complexity. Considering the strip-based data acquisition characteristics of push-broom hyperspectral sensors, we propose the SSHF module to extract vertical spatial features at multiple scales and progressively fuse spectral information. To meet the low computational complexity requirements of satellite platforms, a lightweight encoder is designed using strip convolutions, effectively reducing resource consumption on edge devices. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a slight performance improvement over CNN-Transformer mixture architecture-based compressed sensing network (CTCSN) under a 1% sampling rate, while simultaneously reducing the computational complexity and the number of parameters by approximately 25%.

To address this gap, this study investigates board-level ISG involvement through twelve semi-structured interviews with Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs). Using an inductive thematic analysis followed by deductive interpretive mappings of the six conceptual board roles, the study provides empirical insights into their actual manifestations. Although many aspects of conceptual role definitions align with practice, important nuances emerged, including the reactive and compliance-driven nature of board engagement. In addition to refining theoretical understanding, the paper analyzes board-level responsibilities, challenges, and contextual influences; identifies key barriers to implementation; and proposes future research directions to reduce the gap between boards' theoretical responsibilities and practical activities."

A traction control strategy usually focuses on keeping the slip of the driving wheels in a stable region. One unique phenomenon for motorcycles is the wheelie, which hasn’t been addressed for electric motorcycles. In this paper, an Integrated Wheelie-Traction Control System (IWTCS) is designed to accelerate the motorcycle as fast as possible. The proposed IWTCS consists of a classical Proportional-Integral control algorithm for traction control and a Wheelie Detector (WD) that uses a Kalman-Filter for wheelie intervention. The developed IWTCS is analyzed in the Quarter Mile scenario and compared against a controller based on synthetic user behavior with zero delays to wheelies and a TCS without Wheelie Control. The results demonstrate that the IWTCS can match the synthetic user behavior performance in quarter mile scenario and reduce both the wheelie duration and keep body pitch angle stable to improve safety and comfort. When compared to the TCS without Wheelie Control, the IWTCS, improves average acceleration by ~3% and significantly reduces both body pitch angle and total wheelie duration."

By treating dreams as symbolic data and nightmares as distortions of subjective recognition, the project translates psychological fear into tangible visual forms. Utilizing AI-driven imagery, embodied dance performance, and virtual production technologies, Psychomare creates an immersive dream-scape where the dancer confronts surreal nightmare entities derived from personal and collective dream memories. Drawing on Lacanian theory, the work proposes that nightmares emerge from a mis-recognition of the self—a mirrored distortion of unconscious desires and fears projected onto dream imagery. This symbolic mis-recognition becomes the conceptual core of the project, guiding its aesthetic and choreographic strategies. Feedback from the dancer, audience, and a psychoanalyst reveals strong emotional resonance and aesthetic depth, suggesting that the visualization of nightmares can foster self-reflection, emotional confrontation, and collective empathy. This project offers a new model for integrating immersive art, psychoanalytic theory, and technological mediation as a path of collective care."

    "abstract": "Grid-Forming (GFM) inverter has become an important research topic in recent years, and dispatchable virtual oscillator control (dVOC) is one of the control methods that shows the characteristic of GFM and has many other advantages. However, the overcurrent protection is one of the major challenges to overcome. This article discusses the effects of different kinds of time delays on dVOC inverter with the switch-level current limitation. Computer simulations with MATLAB/Simulink are shown to validate the ability of the current limitation with time delays. A prototype of dVOC inverter with the current limitation is also built and shown a similar result as the simulations present. The values of the current ripple under different conditions are also discussed and compared with experimental results."

A hybrid architecture is proposed that combines a Siamese network and U-Net, which makes it possible to increase the accuracy of segmentation even in conditions of heterogeneous image structure. The architecture uses metric learning to compare pairs of images (support and query), providing sustainable learning and generalization with only 5–50 labeled examples. The results of experiments that demonstrate high values of Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice coefficient, precision, and recall are presented. A comparative analysis of modern low-resource learning methods, including MAML, Transfer Learning, GANs and VAEs, with a description of their key features and limitations, is also performed."

This paper presents the design, verification, and in-orbit commissioning of the AOCS, including equipment calibration and system parameter estimation performed in flight.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a lumped parameter modeling approach for the dynamic analysis and control design of feed drive systems utilizing ball-screw nut mechanisms. The proposed model integrates key physical parameters such as equivalent inertia, structural stiffness, and friction to accurately represent the mechanical behavior of the drive system. Based on this model, a cascade control structure is developed, consisting of an inner velocity loop and an outer position loop. The velocity loop is regulated by a PI controller designed using the Internal Model Control (IMC) methodology, which enables a systematic selection of control gains to ensure fast, stable, and robust tracking. Meanwhile, the outer position loop is governed by a Sliding Mode Controller (SMC), which is well-known for its robustness against parameter variations and external disturbances. Simulation results from MATLAB/Simulink demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme in achieving high-precision position tracking, improved disturbance rejection, and enhanced control stability under varying load conditions. This integrated modeling and control strategy provides a practical and scalable solution for precision motion control applications, such as CNC machine tools and industrial automation systems."

    "abstract": "Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) provide time-synchronized, high-resolution measurements essential for real-time monitoring and control of modern power systems. However, PMU networks are vulnerable to data quality issues such as missing and delayed measurements, often caused by cyberattacks, synchronization failures, or hardware malfunctions. These disruptions can compromise cyber resilience for critical functions by degrading the accuracy of essential grid applications, including state estimation, fault detection, and stability assessment. To address this challenge, we present a decentralized, in-network PMU data recovery framework using P4-programmable switches. Our system detects and recovers missing and delayed data directly within the communication infrastructure, reducing dependency on centralized processing and enabling faster, more resilient responses. We implement the recovery scheme on P4 software switches and evaluate its performance using real-world PMU data from a campus microgrid. Results show that incorporating delayed data into the recovery process significantly improves accuracy, achieving a 20.69% reduction in magnitude mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and a 28.6% reduction in average phase angle error. In the 5% missing PMU data scenario, the proposed approach maintains a low magnitude MAPE of 0.0279% and an average phase angle error of just 0.0272 degrees, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving data recovery accuracy."

The design of a new polishing tool incorporates features such as low oscillation, low vibration, high replaceability, and safety devices equipped with wireless pressure sensors and protective detectors. For flat test samples, various processes were conducted prior to the polishing process, including fine milling, burnishing, and plasma nitriding hardening. In the burnishing process, referring to the optimal combinations of burnishing parameters from previous studies, the surface roughness of the flat specimens was reduced from Ra 0.22 um to Ra 0.056 um. For the plasma nitriding hardening process, after conducting experiments using the Taguchi method, the optimal parameter combination for the nitriding hardening was determined These parameters increased the hardness after burnishing from 40 HRC to 49 HRC, an improvement of 22.5%. Through matrix polishing experiments, the optimal parameter combination for polishing was determined. This parameter combination reduced the surface roughness of the hardened specimens from Ra 0.15 um to Ra 0.08 um, improving surface roughness values by 47%."

The proposed method uses a quintic polynomial with boundary constraints on position, velocity, and acceleration to determine the coefficient of freedom to generate a motion trajectory for a 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robotic system designed for upper limb rehabilitation. Firstly, the movement trajectory is divided into multiple segments connecting predefined waypoints, representing typical motions in upper limb rehabilitation exercises. The quintic polynomial ensures smooth transitions in position, velocity, and acceleration across all trajectory segments. Second, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied to determine the polynomial coefficients to generate a trajectory that follows the desired path within the robot’s workspace. The coefficients obtained through the GA are implemented within the workspace to generate the motion path for the rehabilitation robot. To evaluate the performance of the developed approach, simulations were conducted in MATLAB SIMULINK to perform motion planning for the robot. The results produced an optimal trajectory with the determined polynomial coefficients, playing a crucial role in planning movement trajectories for patient rehabilitation."

The relevance of this research is widespread induction motor using in digital controlled electric drives of oil and gas industry. The discrete time models are used to develop and analyze control algorithms. We compare the accuracy of models based on the bilinear transform (Tustin’s method), the forward difference method, and the backward difference method. The research results help to select the most suitable method of discrete time in IM models according to the required accuracy, computational resourced, and modeling objectives. Discrete time models are derived by using of the forward and backward difference methods; and these models show a larger absolute error throughout the simulation time in comparison to the real time model of the induction motor. The calculated integral relative error transient processes quantitatively express quantitatively, such as no load startup, load application, and load shedding. We find some facts that the state variable plots of the discrete time models are based on the forward and backward difference methods and they are mirrored relative continuous time of IM model’s state in variable plots."

Data were collected from realistic scenarios with 14 novice ATCO trainees, with workload recorded at one-minute intervals. Workload deviation was compared between conflict and non-conflict intervals using the Mann-Whitney U test, with effect size quantified by rankbi-serial correlation. Results show that the mean deviation was nearly twice as high in conflict intervals compared to non-conflict intervals (35.2 vs. 15.2; $\\mathbf{p} \\lt 0.001; \\mathbf{r} \\_{\\mathbf{r b}}=0.449$), corresponding to a medium effect size. These findings confirm that conflict situations significantly increase ATCO cognitive load.

This review analyzes peer-reviewed studies and documented pilot deployments from Scopus, Google Scholar and industry sources (2018-2024) to evaluate the effectiveness and limitations of exoskeletons in aerospace environments. Evidence suggests that shoulder exoskeletons can reduce deltoid and trapezius muscle activity by 15–64% during overhead tasks, with partial improvements in perceived exertion. Real-world trials from Airbus, Boeing and Lufthansa Technik confirm potential benefits but reveal challenges related to user acceptance, contamination, maintenance and certification under standards.

ChainFedTwin improves current DT frameworks by proposing advanced cryptographic methods, safe bias detection and protection mechanisms, and smart contract-based governance to realize security, privacy, and fairness upgrades. The XAI layer integrates SHAP and LIME for end-to-end interpretability and contains embedded bias detection per aggregation step with fairness validation services. Experimental evaluation on the NSL-KDD dataset proves that ChainFedTwin outperforms the baseline FedAvg algorithm substantially. Specifically, ChainFedtwin achieved a final test accuracy of 94.1% while FedAvg was 91%, an improvement of 3.1 percentage points. Apart from that, it converged to 90% accuracy in 48 iterations, a 47% iteration decrease from FedAvg’s 91 iterations, reflecting enhanced convergence speed and stability at the lower end final loss. While it causes about a 15% communication overhead due to privacy and auditing requirements, this is an acceptable compromise for increased security, trustworthiness, and interpretability in mission-critical DT applications."

The work translates pre-recorded neural activity from brain organoids, lab-grown three-dimensional clusters of neurons, into a multi-sensory environment composed of generative visuals, spatial audio, living plants, and fabricated clay artifacts. These biosignals, streamed through a real-time system, modulate emergent agent behaviors inspired by natural systems such as termite colonies and slime molds. Rather than using biosignals as direct control inputs, Simulacra Naturae treats organoid activity as a co-creative force, allowing neural rhythms to guide the growth, form, and atmosphere of a generative ecosystem. The installation features computationally fabricated clay prints embedded with solenoids, adding physical sound resonances to the generative surround composition. The spatial environment, filled with live tropical plants and a floor-level projection layer featuring real-time generative AI visuals, invites participants into a sensory field shaped by nonhuman cognition. By grounding abstract data in living materials and embodied experience, Simulacra Naturae reimagines visualization as a practice of care, one that decentralizes human agency and opens new spaces for ethics, empathy, and ecological attunement within hybrid computational systems."

The proposed graphical method approximates the optimal UPFC current trajectory using geometric constructions of the dq-axis currents. This approach aims to reduce computational complexity and hence allows for adaptability to parameter variations in real-time. Simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiments demonstrate that the proposed method maintains a power factor above 0.99 during load transitions."

Also, the balancing efficiency can decrease due to component losses and dependent balancing conditions, requiring approaches to address these existing limitations and improve efficiency. Therefore, this paper comprehensively analyzes approaches to improve the efficiency of conventional active cell balancing circuits, including components reduction, bidirectional energy transfer, and enhanced switching control algorithms. Based on this analysis, we propose a high-efficiency active cell balancing circuit and switching control algorithm. Through validation of the proposed circuit technology, it is confirmed that the proposed circuit provides three times faster balancing speed compared to conventional active cell balancing circuits under the same balancing conditions."

However, when SEVs move past buildings or nearby objects, they experience significant irradiance fluctuations and should be controlled to continually maximize PV energy generation. Conventional maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control methods are not optimized for rapid and repeated irradiance changes, and such changes can temporarily drop the output power to zero. To solve this problem, an control called voltage offset resistive control (VRC) is utilized along with experimental shading test to develop an adaptive VRC MPPT strategy. This adaptive VRC approach reduces the power loss caused by rapid changes in shading and shows potential for the effective integration of photovoltaic cells into SEVs."

    "abstract": "A position sensorless control technique for interior permanent magnet synchronous motors (IPMSMs) has been developed using a full-order observer based on a simplified motor model that omits the q-axis inductance $L_{q}$. This simplified model also facilitates the implementation of maximum torque per ampere(MTPA)control. However, designing the full-order observer is complex owing to the four-dimensional nature of its error equation. To address this limitation, this study proposed a sliding mode observer based on the simplified IPMSM model. In this method, the error equation is reduced from four dimensions to two by sliding mode control, making it easier to analyze the pole assignment problem compared with the full-order observer. This advantage makes enables the design the observer pole assignment for robust flux estimation in the presence of velocity estimation inaccuracies, which is a parameter of the observer, and provides a clear solution to the pole placement problem. The simulation result demonstrates that the proposed pole assignment for the sliding observer is effective, and that MTPA control can be implemented in position and velocity sensorless control of IPMSM."

The conventional chopper circuit typically requires large and heavy inductor to reduce current ripple, which is undesirable on-board moving train cars. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a non-isolated dc-dc converter with a single auxiliary chopper circuit, which transfers power using a triangular ac inductor current, allowing the inductor mass and volume to be reduced. This paper presents the basic operation principles and a control method that regulates output power using feedback control. Simplified theoretical expression of the output power is derived and verified through comparisons with both simulation and experimental results. Furthermore, the proposed control method is validated using a downscaled experimental setup, where the output power was observed to be stable under dynamic conditions."

The proposed architecture leverages Jetson devices as both processing units for image analysis and blockchain nodes, creating a decentralized network where inspection results are recorded through smart contracts. This approach ensures data immutability, transparency, auditability, and system resilience through decentralization. Experimental evaluation across three Jetson device models (Nano, Xavier NX, and Orin Nano Super) demonstrate that blockchain operations consume minimal resources. With the newer hardware Jetson Orin Nano Super showing average CPU usage of only 5.35% during blockchain operations (including ordering service), significant computational capacity remains available for AI-driven image inspection tasks. This enables the simultaneous execution of computer vision and AI recognition, as well as secure blockchain data recording, on a single edge device. The research implementing blockchain technology in resource-constrained edge devices proves the feasibility of blockchain-secured AOI in manufacturing environments."

    "abstract": "Active magnetic compensation is commonly combined with passive magnetic shielding structures in magnetocardiography measurements to suppress environmental magnetic disturbances and improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Accurate measurement of the disturbance field in the target region is essential for control decisions. Active compensation systems that rely on a single reference sensor often suffer from inaccurate disturbance estimation and degradation of the target signal signal-to-noise ratio. In this work, a computationally efficient magnetic field observation method based on two-dimensional spherical harmonics is proposed. By exploiting the spatial correlation differences of signals, a Kalman filter is designed to suppress random noise and target signal components in the reference sensor while interpolating the disturbance field in the target region. Validation experiments were conducted on a prototype magnetocardiography system equipped with a barrel-shaped magnetic shielding structure. The results demonstrate that the proposed observation method can effectively guide the active compensation system to suppress disturbances in the target region, with the suppression rate improved from 43.05% using a single sensor to 84.14%. This disturbance observation approach provides valuable insights for the development of multi-channel active compensation systems and magnetocardiography devices operating without passive magnetic shielding."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a highly compact and ultra-sensitive microfluidic sensor based on the cavity resonator for biofluids. Aiming at the problem that cavity sensors under planar channels have difficulty achieving high sensitivity, a simple and efficient design method based on coupled mode theory(CMT) is proposed, and a highly miniaturized device is optimized based on the proposed concept. Instead of the drilled channel of a typical substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) cavity with a top and bottom metal layer, the proposed resonator is based on a planar integration of the channel. An additional patch resonator is introduced in the cavity center for establishing a coupled resonator system. The high sensitivity is obtained by mode splitting generated from the strong coupling of the SIW resonator and the introduced patch resonator. The miniaturization strategies of folded SIW and spiral complementary split ring resonator (CSRR) are applied to the two coupled resonators, respectively, to put the channel position at maximum field levels. The highly miniaturized device reduces the amount of necessary fluid during testing while maintaining the performance. The sensor is operational in the frequency range 0.6-1.7 GHz and has a size 0.21 × 0.21 λ<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> at 1.7 GHz.

The efficacy of machine learning methods for such tasks heavily relies on the optimal selection and tuning of their associated parameters. This study investigates the performance of quantum optimization techniques for enhancing Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels for SVM classifiers. The Improved Quantum Genetic Algorithm (IQGA) exhibits superior stability, consistently achieving high validation accuracy and demonstrating improved, faster convergence rates compared to the Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA) and classical Genetic Algorithm (GA). These results suggest that IQGA shows significant promise for optimizing SVM classifiers in real-world applications. Through training on the well-known Dop-NET dataset, the proposed IQGA-optimized approach achieves a high recognition test accuracy of approximately 96% on Dop-NET, and 89% on unseen test data from our custom hand gesture dataset, outperforming neural networks and standard classifiers. Furthermore, the study demonstrates the method’s capability for cross-sensor generalization, effectively overcoming hardware discrepancies. This enables the deployment of robust gesture recognition on low-cost, resource-constrained embedded systems without the need for computationally expensive retraining on the end-user device."

However, the efficacy of TECAS varies among individuals, and it remains unclear which populations are more sensitive to this treatment. This study aims to investigate the impact of TECAS on brain functional networks by analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) data, distinguishing between responders and non-responders. We included 57 patients with mild to moderate depression and collected EEG data at baseline and after 8 weeks of TECAS treatment. Our analysis focused on identifying baseline network characteristics correlating with positive TECAS responses. The results indicate that patients with higher network integration and synchrony, particularly those with elevated delta frequency band network topology parameters, showed better outcomes with TECAS. Additionally, using a nonlinear regression model, we predicted the effectiveness of TECAS with a correlation coefficient of 0.52 and an RMSE of 17.3 %. Machine learning techniques were further employed to identify responders and non-responders at baseline, with the XGBoost classifier achieving the highest accuracy of 82.91 %. These findings suggest that specific EEG network features can serve as predictors for the efficacy of TECAS in treating depression."

    "abstract": "Secure communications in low-altitude economy networks (LAENets) are critical because the broadcast nature of air-ground links, the strong line-of-sight (LoS) propagation, and the high mobility of intelligent aerial agents (IAAs) inherently expose transmissions to agile, coordinated jamming and eavesdropping. In this paper, we consider a dynamic adversarial scenario where a legitimate IAA simultaneously provides service to multiple terrestrial receivers, while being threatened by collaborative adversarial entities comprising an intelligent UAV-based jammer and a ground-level eavesdropper. The adversaries cooperatively optimize their spatial trajectories and spectrum allocation strategies through real-time adaptive coordination. To counter such coordinated threats, we propose a synergistic framework where a lightweight retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-enhanced large language model (LLM) predicts, from sequential wireless observations, the probabilistic jamming/eavesdropping intent distributions across frequency bands and the jammer's next-step trajectory. These predictions are then exploited by a soft actor-critic (SAC)-based reinforcement learning agent at the IAA to jointly optimize frequency-hopping selection, trajectory control, and power allocation, thereby enabling anticipatory and context-aware secure communication. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared to baseline models from deep learning (DL) and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, our framework achieves an average secrecy-rate improvement of approximately 53.84%, while also delivering faster convergence and greater robustness against adaptive, coordinated attacks. The experiments are conducted under comparable training budgets, and our approach outperforms typical DL models (e.g., convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), Transformer) and optimization baselines (e.g., proximal policy optimization (PPO), simulated annealing) across secrecy rate, convergence speed, and robustness. This establishes the proposed framework as a practical solution for securing next-generation LAENets under coordinated jamming and eavesdropping."

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-based edge computing (EC) has been a core enabler for task offloading in the last decade with a major focus on UAV energy and task processing delay minimization, especially for delay-sensitive applications that require high availability of task offloading services throughout the day, such as vehicular networks. In this work, we tackle the problem of task offloading for internet of things (IoT) devices in UAV-based EC networks by introducing compute reuse for result sharing. The goal is to minimize the energy consumption of the edge-computing UAVs and the task processing delay. By considering the original problem split into two subproblems on two different time scales: the small time scale handles the forwarding decisions and the CPU operating frequency at each UAV, while the large time scale handles the wake-sleep status of each UAV. Most existing work in this area ignores the discussion of result reuse in a UAV edge setup and considers a single agent on each time scale without sequential decision-making. Additionally, the literature concerning sending UAVs to sleep for energy savings under edge computing framework or the integration of both sequentiality and hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) under a multi-time scale framework remains unexplored in the literature. An algorithm based on a hierarchical sequential multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (HSMADRL) framework is developed. The hierarchical DRL explores patterns between the two time scales; and the sequential and multi-agent designs address the curse of dimensionality and decision-making coordination, respectively. Simulation results show that our algorithm can quickly converge and outperform baselines, while the energy computation efficiency (ECE) is maximized."

However, the essence of traditional fixedly deployed IMSs is to let the signal bypass fixed obstacles, which cannot match the increasingly dynamic communication demands in the future. In this paper, an IMS-aided urban transparent transmission scheme is proposed, where wall-embedded deployment and adaptive scheduling of IMSs are put forward for the first time by building grid sliding rails inside the wall, thus achieving signal low-loss or even lossless wall-penetration and dynamic on-demand services. Specifically, we elaborate on embedded deployment and adaptive scheduling of IMSs in terms of objective advantages. Moreover, a potential structure and an operating procedure for IMS-aided transparent transmission system are proposed and the corresponding trial system is established. Then, several key issues that still need to be resolved are highlighted. Finally, a reasonable experiment is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Measurement results show that our proposed scheme is more suitable for complex user demands and more conducive to the realization of urban wall-penetrated transmission compared to traditional fixedly deployed IMSs."

    "abstract": "Model predictive control is a well established control technology for trajectory tracking. Its use requires the availability of an accurate model of the plant, but obtaining such a model is often time consuming and costly. Data-Enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) addresses this shortcoming in the linear time-invariant setting, by skipping the model building step and instead relying directly on input-output data. Unfortunately, many real systems are nonlinear and exhibit strong operating-point dependence. Building on classical linear parameter-varying control, we introduce DeePC-GS, a gain-scheduled extension of DeePC for unknown, regime-varying systems. The key idea is to allow DeePC to switch between different local Hankel matrices–selected online via a measurable scheduling variable–thereby uniting classical gain scheduling tools with identification-free, data-driven MPC. We test the effectiveness of our DeePC-GS formulation on a nonlinear ship-steering benchmark, demonstrating that it outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven MPC while maintaining tractable computation."

This research aims to systematically identify the pedagogical challenges in current AR-based educational applications, derive a validated set of pedagogical principles, and evaluate the impact of applying these principles in the design of ARLEs. By doing so, this study contributes a comprehensive framework that can guide educators, instructional designers, and developers in creating more meaningful, inclusive, and impactful AR-based learning environments. For this purpose a three-phase methodology was adopted in study: 1) pedagogical issues were identified using a systematic literature review (PRISMA framework) and teacher surveys; 2) 21 pedagogical principles were derived and validated by Experts panel using the Delphi method, prioritized using Best Worst Scaling Survey(BWS) method and classified using exploratory factor analysis into five categories: Instructional Design, Technology Integration, Assessment, Collaboration, and Inclusion; and ethics 3) the principles were implemented in the design and development of ARLE and evaluated using an experimental pre-test/post-test design with control and experimental groups. The study results indicated that ARLEs designed on the basis of these principles significantly improved learner engagement, learning gains, and long-term retention of knowledge. The study proposes a validated pedagogical framework to guide the design and integration of Augmented Reality (AR) as an educational technology owing to its positive impact on achievement of learning outcomes.

Unlike conventional pseudo-random number generators that rely on software-based random seeding, these hardware-bound entropy sources are non-replicable across devices and thus significantly harder for an attacker to predict or replay. A logistic chaotic map seeded with these features generates binary key streams that pass standard randomness tests, while compressed sensing provides sparse-domain encoding to lower computational and transmission overhead. Secure data transmission is realized via XOR-based stream ciphering with reconstructed keys.

The proposed method integrates error-driven variable gains to dynamically enhance transient performance and steady-state performance, includes a finite-time variable gain tracking differentiator (FTVGTD), a finite-time variable gain extended state observer (FTVGESO) and a finite-time variable gain controller (FTVGC). The FTVGTD is designed to accurately extract differential signals from measured displacement signals with noise. Inspired by super-twisting theory, the FTVGESO is developed to estimate unknown states and disturbances in finite-time, while mitigating chattering during the estimation process. Based on the power integral technique, the FTVGC is proposed to compensate the disturbances in real time, thereby improving system robustness. For convergence analysis of the proposed method, robust analysis techniques and Lyapunov methods are utilized to address the non-Hurwitz characteristic of variable gain matrices, and the disturbance rejection capability is analyzed theoretically. Finally, simulation and experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for active suspension hydraulic systems."

The proposed approach significantly improves memory efficiency and rendering speed compared to traditional Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) based methods. It achieves up to 67% memory reduction, a threefold reduction in training time, and real-time rendering at over 89 frames per second (fps) while maintaining high visual fidelity, with Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) up to 32 decibels (dB), on a consumer-grade NVIDIA RTX 3060 graphics card. The reconstruction pipeline integrates the Structure-from-Motion technique for camera pose estimation, followed by adaptive Gaussian optimization and model refinement. The final models are cleaned, compressed, and visualized in real time using Unreal Engine through the XV3DGS plugin, enabling immersive walkthroughs and educational applications. The experimental results on multiple data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in terms of reconstruction accuracy, processing time, and deployment readiness. Additionally, we evaluate the impact of image acquisition strategies, training iterations, and dataset types on reconstruction quality and performance. The results indicate that using fewer, carefully chosen images from the most informative viewpoints can achieve high-fidelity reconstructions. This work provides a functional link between academic 3D reconstruction and real-time virtual deployment, offering a practical framework for cultural heritage preservation, simulation, visualization, and immersive exploration."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS)-assisted secure transmission for remote state estimation in the presence of an eavesdropper. To counter the eavesdropper and enhance data reception for the remote estimator, the sensor can dynamically switch between traditional and IRS-assisted channels, the latter combining both traditional and IRS-based links. Compared to traditional channels, IRS-assisted channels reduce eavesdropping rates and improve reception. However, frequent use of IRS-assisted channels increases detection risk by the eavesdropper due to enhanced channel awareness. Thus, a trade-off exists between transmission performance and stealthiness. We propose a framework for channel selection and a metric to evaluate the stealthiness of IRS-based channels. Additionally, the trade-off is modeled as a constrained Markov decision process (MDP), and we derive a sufficient condition for the optimal channel selection policy. By transforming the constrained MDP into an unconstrained one using the Lagrange multiplier approach, we elucidate the optimal policy structure for the unconstrained MDP with discounted costs. Finally, a longitudinal flight example is presented to validate the theoretical results."

In this paper, an improved three-phase three-level multi-port converter (TPTL-MPC) is presented for the PV, ES, and grid-connected hybrid systems, which can effectively reduce power conversion stage, thereby further enhancing overall system efficiency. Moreover, an optimal zero-sequence component (ZSC) injection method is proposed to reduce inductor current ripple under active power, reactive power, and different operational modes and dc port voltage. Meanwhile, the proposed optimal ZSC injection method can also reduce low-frequency voltage and current ripples of the PV port and ES port, which is beneficial for reducing the filter capacitors at the ports. To accommodate the voltage variation of PV and ES, dc voltage ratio-based sinusoidal pulse width modulation (DVR-SPWM) and its digital implementation for improved TPTL-MPC are proposed. The smooth switching between the various operational modes is also realized by control strategy. Finally, the experimental results have been provided to confirm effectiveness and feasibility of the improved TPTL-MPC based on the proposed optimal ZSC injection method."

By reformulating the problem, our method reduces the dimensionality of the optimization space compared to conventional approaches, enabling faster optimization and improved solution quality. The simulation results show that our method delivers high-quality solutions for complex scenarios under various constraints, achieving on average a nearly 30× lower cost than existing metaheuristics while running significantly faster, and maintaining an optimality gap of less than 3% relative to the exact solver baseline. This work advances the theoretical foundation of coordinated UAV–UGV operations and presents a practical framework for efficient multi-objective network planning.

Novel MADCC schemes are proposed, and schemes are also derived from existing MACC schemes with <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</i>-design and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</i>-GDD topologies.

A comparison of the proposed schemes with those derived from existing MACC schemes, as well as with the existing MADCC scheme under a cyclic wrap-around topology, shows that the proposed schemes have an advantage in either load per user or subpacketization level or both. Additionally, several low subpacketization level coded caching schemes are obtained for the original D2D network with dedicated caches."

    "abstract": "With the increasing sophistication of malware, enhanced Attributed Control Flow Graphs (ACFGs) have become a fundamental representation and are widely applied in malware detection. However, existing CFG-based detection techniques primarily extract shallow features of malware, neglecting deeper structural and semantic characteristics. Additionally, retaining all basic blocks in CFGs significantly increases the memory overhead of detection models. To address these issues, we propose MCLPF, collaborative malware detection with interpretable pruning, to improve the overall performance of existing malware detection systems that rely on fine-grained control flow features. MCLPF first introduces a novel Attributed Interpretable Flow Graph (AIFG) to extract functional attributes, integrating node-level features, edge-level features, and assembly language embedding features derived from Large Language Models (LLMs). Subsequently, it proposes an efficient and reliable detection scheme by alternately updating the graph structure and language learning modules through L-Step and G-Step, rather than synchronously training Language Models (LMs) with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on large-scale graphs. We conduct experiments using public datasets involving four different architectures (i.e., PE-32, PE-64, ELF-32, and ELF-64) and demonstrate that our model achieves an exceptionally high detection accuracy (i.e., 99.30%). After pruning 100% of noncritical nodes and edges, the sample size is reduced to approximately 8% of the original, with an average time cost reduction of 74.7%, while the detection performance fluctuation averages only about 1%. Extensive cross-dataset evaluations validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is a challenging, yet valuable task within unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), which adapts pretrained models to diverse unlabeled target domains while safeguarding the data security of the source domain. However, existing SFDA methods primarily focus on computer vision applications, often overlooking the unique characteristics of time series, such as temporal dependencies and sequential nature. Moreover, the fine-tuning paradigm of current SFDA methods is typically limited to <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">posterior adaptation</i>, focusing solely on constraining the statistical properties of model outputs. We argue that this black-box paradigm lacks semantic interpretability and risks aligning with spurious contextual noise, leading to negative transfer. This necessitates a paradigm evolution from blind statistical adaptation to interpretable adaptation. To this end, we introduce <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">model salience</i> as a quantifiable proxy of semantic interpretability, representing the importance weights a trained model assigns to specific temporal fragments. Accordingly, we propose a novel fine-tuning paradigm for time-series SFDA, termed PrEPoA, which integrates Prior Evaluation of model salience with Posterior Adaptation. In the prior evaluation stage, a key pattern reconstruction (KPR) module based on a sensitive masking mechanism is designed to quantify the model salience, while a novel interpattern triplet loss is introduced to calibrate it. In the posterior adaptation stage, robust prototype clustering (RPC) generates trustworthy reference labels as pseudo-ground truth for adaptation. Comprehensive experiments on the wireless sensor data mining (WISDM), human activity recognition (HAR), heterogeneity HAR (HHAR), machine fault diagnosis (MFD), and sleep stage classification (SSC) datasets demonstrate the superiority of our PrEPoA framework compared to nine UDA and seven SFDA methods. Furthermore, we experimentally validate that PrEPoA serves as a plug-and-play module that effectively incorporated into other SFDA methods."

    "abstract": "In the marine seismic acquisition, ghost waves are treated as typical noises. They interfere with primary reflections, forming notch frequencies, which decrease the resolution in the data and cause artifacts in the depth migration images. The suppression of ghost waves in the records, as well as the associated artifacts in the images, refers to the necessary seismic processing step named deghosting. Deep-learning-based deghosting methods have been developed in various domains, and they are used as alternatives to conventional deterministic ones for overcoming the drawbacks, e.g., the instability issue in deconvolution-based methods. Usually, for either the data-domain or image-domain deghosting methods, a requisite step is to prepare training sets that are commonly composed of records or images with and without ghost effects, followed by a supervised training process to establish a neural network, e.g., the U-net. Rather than training novel neural networks or tuning pre-trained ones, we explore possibilities to adopt a pre-established deghosting neural network to an extended application scenario. Through a dissection of ghost artifacts in the pre-stack depth image domain, we developed a deghosting approach to directly invoke a pre-established U-net that was already trained with local stacked depth images. We use a Beam pre-stack depth migration engine to generate the ghost-contaminated pre-stack angle-domain image volume. Then, in a nested workflow, we suppress ghost artifacts in the extended angle-domain common image gathers. Through both numerical examples and a field data test, we examine the effectiveness of the proposed deghosting method under various observation geometries, including the conventional towed-streamers and the sparse ocean-bottom nodes. Limitations and potential application prospects are also discussed in depth."

    "abstract": "Satellite images have gained considerable traction for near-real-time and rapid flood mapping because they are agnostic to flooding mechanisms and their drivers, hence applicable to any floods, whether pluvial, fluvial, or both (i.e., compound flood). However, flood mapping using satellite images is challenging due to cloud cover and shadows, particularly in regions where floods typically occur during monsoon seasons with frequent and extensive cloud cover (e.g., South Asian countries). Generally, optical images (e.g., Landsat) are used alone or in combination with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images (e.g., Sentinel-1) under the multisource flood mapping (MSFM) framework for rapid flood detection. However, clouds often affect optical images, limiting their ability to provide reliable flooding information. Additionally, the MSFM requires diligent (and often manual) identification of a pre-flood image, which may be challenging when automatically delineating multiple floods. Moreover, using a unique permanent water body for flood delineation may be erroneous for regions like northeastern Bangladesh, where the water extent climatology varies significantly for monsoon months (when floods usually occur). In contrast, this work presents a rapid, simple, and comparable thresholding algorithm for flood delineation using Sentinel-1 SAR images, where backscatter coefficient values are used to identify the watered pixels, and the flooded pixels are determined by comparing them with the monthly climatology of water extent. The method is applied to map the surface water and flood extents for catastrophic back-to-back flood events in the northeastern part of Bangladesh in 2022 caused by heavy local precipitation and upstream discharges (i.e., compound flood), leveraging the cloud based computing capabilities of Google Earth Engine (GEE). The results (i.e., surface water and flood extent maps) are comparable to those obtained using the recently developed sophisticated MSFM and existing SAR-based methods. Besides, our thresholding algorithm provides reliable flood maps for instances where MSFM miscalculates flood extent due to significant cloud cover. The technique developed in this study will enable decision makers and emergency responders to obtain precise information rapidly during time-sensitive flooding events, supporting informed decision-making for resource allocation and rescue planning."

    "abstract": "A metaverse can bring many benefits (i.e., self-sustaining and proactive analytics (e.g., analysis before user requests)) to wireless applications; however, its deployment is very challenging due to simultaneous quality of service (QoS) and quality of physical experience (QoE) constraints. Furthermore, the computing and communication resources of end-nodes are limited. For instance, immersive experience devices (e.g., augmented reality (AR) headsets) in a metaverse have limited computing power and therefore, might not be able to perform rendering tasks. Consequently, this paper proposes a novel task offloading framework for metaverse-empowered wireless systems. Our formulated problem aims at minimizing the cost of task offloading in the metaverse while considering both QoS and QoE constraints by optimizing the task offloading, resource allocation, and transmit power allocation variables. For QoS, we consider latency and reliability, whereas for QoE, we consider both immersive experience and packet error rate. To optimize the formulated problem, we use a decomposition-based scheme that further uses modified block-successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM), convex optimization, and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for transmit power allocation, resource allocation, and task offloading, respectively. Our solution of using convex optimization-assisted MARL for joint resource allocation and task offloading significantly improves the performance of learning in terms of reward and attaining fast QoS as well as QoE. Furthermore, BSUM significantly improves transmit power allocation when used in conjunction with a convex optimizer and MARL. Other than that, we also use a dueling (i.e., it is a reinforcement learning architecture combining the dueling network structure with the double deep Q-learning network method for more stable and efficient Q-value learning) concept to further improve the performance of MARL. Our analyses show that convex optimization, BSUM, and dueling help in significantly improving the performance of MARL. Compared to traditional MARL, our proposal results in significant improvement in terms of reward and cost, as illustrated by the results."

This study integrates statistical analysis, atypical state identification, and consensus-based data quality control to evaluate pilots’ physiological responses under varying flight conditions. In a Cessna 172 simulator, biosensors $(250 \\mathrm{~Hz})$ recorded data from 26 pilots (13 experts, 13 novices) during At Rest, Visual Flight Rules (VFR), and Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) scenarios. Between 3.1% and 3.8% of noisy data were eliminated using DBSCAN, Isolation Forest, and Elliptic Envelope algorithms. Mahalanobis distances with chi-square thresholds identified atypical states; t-tests and ANOVA assessed group and condition effects. Experts exhibited higher HR and HRV ($p \\lt 0.0001$, Cohen’s d up to 43.699) and progressive HR/HRV changes from At Rest to IFR, reflecting adaptive autonomic regulation. Novices showed greater RR variability and less controlled stress responses. Atypical states ranged $2.6-5.9 \\%$, with lower IFR incidence in experts ($2.6 \\%$ vs. $3.0 \\%$).

    "abstract": "Autonomous navigation in tight industrial environments demands compact and holonomic drive systems. This paper introduces a Mecanum drive with fully integrated motor and gearbox, embedded directly in the wheel hub. The design reduces system height while retaining omnidirectional mobility. Experimental evaluation includes trajectory tracking, motion stability, and load resilience tests. The results demonstrate performance with a maximum lateral error below 4.1 cm at 0.7 m/s and show that the rollers withstand loads exceeding 5000 N. This confirms the suitability of the design for use in space-constrained, sensor-driven robotic platforms."

    "abstract": "This study introduces a synchronous terminal sliding mode control (STSMC) integrated with time-delay estimation (TDE) for a 4-DoF parallel manipulator subject to uncertain dynamics and varying payloads. To achieve precise and coordinated control of multi-joint systems, a sliding mode surface is constructed using a cross-coupling error formulation that incorporates both the individual joint tracking errors and the synchronous errors between joints. Moreover, TSMC provides finite-time convergence of system trajectories onto the designed sliding surface, after which they are driven toward the origin. Meanwhile, TDE is utilized to approximate the nonlinear dynamics and lumped uncertainties, including parameter variations and external perturbations acting on the manipulator. Through the integration of TSMC and TDE, the proposed control scheme achieves high-precision tracking performance and strong robustness against lumped uncertainties. The closed-loop stability is rigorously established through Lyapunov analysis. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method—characterized by simplicity, robustness, and fast convergence—is verified via simulations on a 4-DoF parallel robot."

    "abstract": "This article presents an enhanced integration framework of a plug and play digital twin (DT) of robots. The motivation for this study is that to date there is no library dedicated to the implementation of the Reference Architectural Model for Industry 4.0 (RAMI) architecture for digital twins in Node-RED. There is only a knowledge graph library to handle the semantic of a DT model but without any node to link the digital twin and its physical counterpart. Our objective was to design and implement a DT which connects seamlessly the simulation module with the robot and handles the digital twin closed loop. The added value of our lightweight integration framework is twofold. First, the Node-RED orchestrator enhanced with our customized set of nodes, manages the integration of the upper layers of the RAMI architecture, from the data management and information element layer to the decision and user interface element layer. Secondly, a configurable framework enables seamless integration and closed-loop communication between customized controllers and drivers components. In other words, we provide users with a framework to define their own specific key robots components including controllers, drivers, sensors and actuators. The main interest is that the integration is operated once for all, and these components are then the same in the digital and physical world. This avoids to develop twice the same element as for instance a trajectory controller which reduces the discrepancies of behavior between the twins."

    "abstract": "In this paper, an active fault-tolerant control method based on feedback linearization and model predictive control is proposed for safe and reliable trajectory tracking for automated vehicles under actuator faults. First, state feedback and coordinate transformation are used to achieve feedback linearization of the vehicle nonlinear model. Then, the Gaussian process is applied to learn the dynamic changes of the vehicle when the actuator suffers fault. It is combined with the nominal model to describe the vehicle real dynamics under faults and formulate the fault compensation. Finally, the estimated model is implemented in the model predictive control framework to get the optimal control policy with the inverse transformation and it achieves optimal trajectory tracking for automated vehicles under the actuator fault. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can accurately learn the unmodeled dynamics caused by the fault and realize safe tracking. Furthermore, compared with the traditional Jacobian linearization method, it leads to better trajectory tracking performance, and the tracking accuracy is improved by 22% to 31% under different fault scenarios."

The proposed SMC ensures the convergence of system states, improving the response and robustness against the uncertainties of the system parameters. Meanwhile, the NDO estimates and compensates for the external disturbances and model uncertainties in real time, thereby eliminating the system disturbance. In addition, a mathematical model of the quarter-car active pneumatic suspension system is developed, considering the dynamics and nonlinearities of the air spring system. And then, the stability of the proposed closed-loop system is proved by using Lyapunov theory. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SMC-NDO controller significantly reduces the vehicle body acceleration, suspension deflection, and tire dynamic force compared with the conventional sliding controller and passive suspension system. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is determined by improving ride comfort, handling stability, and road holding under various road excitation conditions based on ISO 2631."

Under such conditions, traditional compressive sensing reconstruction algorithms based on greedy iteration and convex optimization suffer from low computational efficiency and reconstruction accuracy. Message passing algorithms avoid matrix inversion through vector operations, and their large-system limit theory ensures efficient and convergent processing of large-scale data. To address these challenges, this paper adopts a sparse Bayesian learning algorithm based on generalized approximate message passing (GAMP-SBL). This approach fully leverages sparse prior information while integrating the efficient iterative mechanism of GAMP, thereby improving signal reconstruction accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that this method outperforms traditional algorithms in terms of convergence speed and reconstruction accuracy, offering an efficient solution for processing complex communication signals."

In light of the dynamic marine environment and diverse mission requirements, traditional approaches to task phase identification—reliant on human expertise—have proven insufficient in delivering the efficiency and precision required for effective decision support. Consequently, automating and enhancing task phase recognition through available operational parameters has emerged as a critical pathway to improving situational assessment and decision-making capabilities. The research aims to uncover underlying patterns in multidimensional data—such as flight altitude generated by multi-mission aircraft during maritime operations—using data-driven techniques, with the goal of establishing interpretable and generalizable rules for intelligent intent inference. The proposed method capitalizes on the random forest algorithm's robust feature learning and classification performance to extract salient features from historical flight data, construct a mapping between mission phases and key flight parameters, and thereby enable accurate identification of aircraft mission intent."

To lower the risks involved when joining or creating data space, a decision framework is necessary that supports the systematic assessment of a data space. In this paper, we developed a feasibility assessment framework that aims to support decision-makers in assessing the viability and potential success of data spaces on a use case level. To develop the framework, we followed a design science research methodology and conducted two design cycles, combining insights from science and practice. We demonstrated the applicability and validity of our framework by applying it to three use cases of established data spaces."

Firstly, a dynamic ETC mechanism that only transmits local leader reference signals among follower agents is proposed, effectively reducing communication overhead. Subsequently, state constraints are addressed under entirely unknown initial states by employing a shift function and a nonlinear state-dependent function. Finally, an adaptive neural bipartite containment controller is designed to decrease computational burden, with each controller incorporating a single adaptive law, and the proposed virtual and actual controllers do not involve feasibility conditions and partial derivative terms. It is demonstrated that all closed-loop signals remain bounded, the bipartite containment error converges to a user-defined interval, and state constraints are not breached. The efficacy of the proposed scheme is further verified through two simulation examples."

    "abstract": "Understanding why only some breast cancers become metastatic, and predicting metastatic risks at earlier cancer stages, are two major goals of breast cancer research. These goals are clearly connected and synergistic, but are rarely integrated within a single study. Knowledge discovery-oriented research has identified critical biological pathways related to metastasis, but the interplay between these pathways remains elusive, resulting in models that lack prediction accuracy. Conversely, complex machine learning models achieve high prediction accuracy without detailed biological knowledge, making the explanation challenging. Here, we propose a novel computational framework that addresses both goals simultaneously. To support knowledge discovery, we construct gene regulatory networks (GRNs) to model the cellular states of metastatic and non-metastatic patients. To enable explainable metastasis prediction, we introduce a dysregulation score based on the GRN models. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only identified significant metastasis-associated GRN changes, but also revealed the loss of co-regulation among key biological processes in metastatic patients. Leveraging the dysregulation score, our model-free classifier outperformed complex machine learning models under rigorous evaluation. This work bridges a significant gap between knowledge discovery and accurate, explainable prediction by employing carefully designed knowledge models and knowledge-based prediction, with potential applicability in other disease contexts."

To address this gap, this study employs dynamic capability theory to examine the impact of digitalization on reducing environmental misconduct, along with the moderating effects of returnee directors and market competition. Leveraging a longitudinal dataset of 4,234 Chinese-listed firms (2009–2022), we reveal a robust negative association between digitalization and environmental misconduct. In addition, returnee directors and intense market competition amplify this deterrence effect, underscoring the interplay between technological capabilities and institutional governance. The findings remain robust across various alternative measures and endogeneity tests, including the Heckman two-stage model, PSM, and a two-year lagged approach. Overall, this study extends digitalization and corporate governance literature in the environmental management context by offering fresh insights into the relationship between digitalization and environmental misconduct in emerging economies"

The sensors have been fabricated on flexible PDMS substrate which is patterned using emery papers having grit size of 80 and 100. The electrical characterization have been undertaken in PDMS-based flexible devices mounted on smart gloves with structures PEDOT:PSS/GNP/PDMS. The microscopic study of the microstructured PDMS is done using field emission scanning electron microscopy. The size of PDMS microstructure based on 80 grit and 100 grit emery papers is found to be in the range of 165–196 um and 121–148 um, respectively. FTIR peaks at 677 cm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−1</sup>, 930 cm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−1</sup>, ~1000–1110 cm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−1</sup>, and 1519 cm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−1</sup> signify the C—S, S—O, Si–O–Si, and C=C stretching, respectively. From XRD, the diffraction peak at 26.60° corresponds to 002 facets of GNP, whereas PEDOT: PSS showed no distinct peaks of PEDOT:PSS film indicating amorphous nature of the polymer. The gauge factor of the sensor based on 80-grit emery paper is determined to be 601.3 within the strain ranging from 0–46%. The sensor shows highly reproducible response over 2100 bending and stretching cycles suggesting long-term durability. Response and recovery time of the fabricated sensor is calculated to be 140 and 155 ms, respectively. The developed smart glove integrated flexible strain sensor is capable to detect human pulse, monitor the real-time human motions and therefore it may find a great promise for application in smart wearable electronics and human-machine interface."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a pivotal paradigm for multi-client collaborative learning, primarily due to its inherent capability to safeguard privacy. Nonetheless, the heterogeneity among FL clients, characterized by their disparate resource capabilities and not independent and identical (NonIID) local datasets, presents a significant challenge. Specifically, low-resource clients, such as edge devices, grapple with the inadequacy to accommodate the entire model parameter set for training purposes. To mitigate this issue, preceding research has ventured into devising methodologies that entail extracting sub-models from the overarching global model, tailored to the specific communication, computational, and memory constraints of individual clients. Despite these advancements, prevailing sub-model extraction techniques, which predominantly hinge on pre-established rules, overlook a crucial factor: the impact of NonIID local data on the trajectory of neuron update dynamics. This oversight can amplify discrepancies between the practical local updates inferred by the sub-model and those anticipated via the entire model, thereby undermining overall performance. In this paper, we introduce <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">FedGSE</b>, an innovative Gradient-based Neuron Selection methodology designed explicitly for FL environments. This methodology aims to curate sub-models that significantly reduce discrepancies in local updates, enhancing alignment with the global model's learning trajectory. Central to the <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">FedGSE</b> approach is a sophisticated algorithm that handpicks critical neurons for sub-model construction. These neurons are identified through their pronounced gradient magnitudes, resulting from the training of the global model on a dataset mirroring the client's data distribution. Consequently, the sub-model's induced local gradient updates closely emulate those derived from directly training the client's data on the full global model, fostering enhanced alignment and performance. Extensive experiments over diverse datasets and tasks demonstrate the superiority of <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">FedGSE</b> over existing baselines."

    "abstract": "In dual active bridge (DAB) converters, series inductor and transformer functionalities are integrated into a single magnetic core structure to improve efficiency or power density. Allowing independent tuning of this integrated series inductance and magnetizing inductance gives higher design flexibility. However, the existing integrated magnetic methods often lower magnetizing inductance, compromise the transformer winding coupling, require complex custom core designs, or cannot effectively decouple transformer and inductor fluxes in the case of separate transformer and inductor windings. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes a unified core structure that allows independent tuning of series inductance without the abovementioned limitations. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed integrated structure, a DAB converter for a DC-DC electric vehicle charging application is built, and the proposed integrated structure is compared with discrete transformer and inductor structures under identical core volume and thermal steady-state conditions. It is experimentally validated that for the proposed structure at a high output voltage and high load conditions of 450 V and 9 kW, the magnetic power loss reduction is 8.8%, whereas, at a low output voltage and high load conditions of 250 V and 7 kW, the magnetic power loss reduction is 13.0%. Furthermore, the paper presents an iterative design methodology based on the derived reluctance and analytical models to systematize the design process."

    "abstract": "Computing the number of distinct elements (i.e., cardinality) in the intersection of two sets is a fundamental task in various distributed systems, including measuring origin-destination flows in wide-area networks and data synchronization in distributed databases. Due to the enormous data scale, lightweight probabilistic methods, such as FM sketch and HyperLogLog sketch, are extensively used in these systems to estimate the set intersection cardinality, with memory efficiency, high accuracy, and low communication costs. However, if a set's sketch and the hash functions used to construct the sketch are disclosed to an untrusted third party, the privacy of the set's sensitive elements may be compromised. Applying the differential privacy mechanism directly to safeguard the sketch's privacy may incur significant estimation errors. To address this challenge, we propose a novel private sketch, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SetXor</i>, for securely estimating intersection cardinality for static sets.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models (DMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable success in modeling large-scale data distributions. However, many downstream tasks require guiding the generated content based on specific differentiable metrics, typically necessitating backpropagation during the generation process. This approach is computationally expensive, as generating with DMs often demands tens to hundreds of recursive network calls, resulting in high memory usage and significant time consumption. In this paper, we propose a more efficient alternative that approaches the problem from the perspective of parallel denoising. We show that full backpropagation throughout the entire generation process is unnecessary. The downstream metrics can be optimized by retaining the computational graph of only one step during generation, thus providing a shortcut for gradient propagation. The resulting method, which we call <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Shortcut Diffusion Optimization (SDO)</b>, is generic, high-performance, and computationally lightweight, capable of optimizing all parameter types in diffusion sampling.

Cross-modal fusion is achieved via a pixel-wise spatial attention mechanism combined with channel recalibration, allowing adaptive weighting of contributions from each modality. A dual-pathway segmentation head further improves prediction quality: the first pathway progressively refines coarse-to-fine masks under SAM2 guidance, while the second pathway performs hierarchical feature fusion to capture long-range contextual information. Extensive experiments on the Caltech RGB–T and PST900 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SAM-FuseNet, achieving improvements of up to 3.93% in mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) while reducing the trained model parameters by more than 50%. Qualitative results further demonstrate sharper boundaries, robustness under underexposed conditions, and resilience to modality degradation."

Simultaneously, the user leverages the line-of-sight (LoS) component to estimate its position, thereby enabling the ISAC functionality. Furthermore, to address the inherent computational challenges, the proposed scheme invokes variational inference for approximating the joint posterior distribution of user location and transmitted symbols. Meanwhile, the prior knowledge of the user’s spatial constraints is incorporated through a turbo-type iterative update mechanism, which significantly enhances the estimation accuracy. Finally, simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of both localization precision and detection reliability."

    "abstract": "Causal structure learning on event sequences is essential in critical systems such as communications, transportation, and industrial monitoring, where precise modeling of causal dependencies among event types significantly impacts tasks like root-cause alarm localization. Existing approaches often rely on Hawkes processes augmented with static network topology to eliminate the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption, yet their dependence on predefined fixed structures and manually chosen kernels limits adaptability to dynamic network systems. The key challenge is to automatically infer accurate causal graphs from event sequences where both temporal evolution and network topology change over time, while accounting for nonlinear dependencies. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Neural Hawkes Processes (ANHP), a novel neural point process framework comprising three core modules: (1) Adaptive Event-Graph Learning, which constructs dynamic topology directly from event embeddings; (2) Neural Topological Hawkes Process, which replaces traditional linear excitation kernels with neural parameterization to capture nonlinear, time-varying conditional intensities; and (3) Masked Sparse Causal Structure, which balances likelihood maximization and model complexity via kernel-parameters masking and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) penalization to suppress redundant edges. Experimental results on real-world communication network alarm datasets from Huawei Shennong Intelligent Maintenance and Operation Center (IMOC) and synthetic datasets demonstrate that ANHP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, robustness, and scalability.

    "abstract": "Transmission scheduling plays a critical role in energy conservation in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), particularly in mobile health (mHealth) systems that rely on multiple distributed sensing modalities. Although recent studies have proposed approaches to balance transmission efficiency and timeliness such as periodic sleep scheduling to reduce power consumption, these strategies often result in data loss which can severely degrade real-time diagnostic accuracy. To address this issue, this paper integrates transmission scheduling with data imputation. We propose an energy-efficient software-hardware co-designed framework for mHealth systems, and investigate a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Imputation Network (WGAIN) to recover missing data. Specifically, the WGAIN model captures heterogeneous inter-sensor correlations, temporal dependencies, and missing-data patterns through a divide-and-conquer learning strategy. Furthermore, we incorporate a dropout-based uncertainty approximation method into the imputation framework and demonstrate its theoretical equivalence to Gaussian processes under variational inference. In addition, a reinforcement learning-based algorithm is developed to dynamically schedule transmissions across heterogeneous sensing modules, with the objective of minimizing overall uncertainty at a target service time. Extensive experiments conducted on the MIT-BIH dataset, together with evaluations on a real-world system prototype, have demonstrated that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods."

ITALYSIG provides I/Q captures with up to 100 MHz bandwidth, collected across diverse urban and rural environments in Italy.

However, most reinforcement learning algorithms focus on harnessing individual learning and fail to leverage the social learning capabilities commonly exhibited by humans and animals. Social learning integrates individual experience with observing others’ behavior, presenting opportunities for improved learning outcomes. In this study, we focus on a social bandit learning scenario where a social agent observes other agents’ actions without knowledge of their rewards. The agents independently pursue their own policy without explicit motivation to teach each other. We propose a free energy-based social bandit learning algorithm over the policy space, where the social agent evaluates others’ expertise levels without resorting to any oracle or social norms. Accordingly, the social agent integrates its direct experiences in the environment and others’ estimated policies. The theoretical convergence of our algorithm to the optimal policy is proven. Empirical evaluations validate the superiority of our social learning method over alternative approaches in various scenarios. Our algorithm strategically identifies the relevant agents, even in the presence of random or suboptimal agents, and skillfully exploits their behavioral information. In addition to societies including expert agents, in the presence of relevant but non-expert agents, our algorithm significantly enhances individual learning performance, where most related methods fail. Importantly, it also maintains logarithmic regret."

However, the lack of sufficient training data as well as the ability to explore more comprehensive fault representation of key samples will draw limitations on DRL-based diagnostic model. To tackle these aforesaid issues, this study proposes a multi-scale residual active deep Q-learning network (MRADQN), which can not only select high-value samples from unlabeled candidates for expanding the number of training samples, but also extract local and global features from these newly-reconstructed samples. Specifically, MRADQN consists of an active deep Q-learning (ADQN) module and a multi-scale residual convolutional neural network (MRCNN) module. To pick out the most beneficial samples, ADQN designs a new state and action strategy based on entropy and cosine distance to calculate the uncertainty and similarity of samples, respectively, with the aim of quickly and accurately selecting the most significant data for labeling. For improving the ability regarding feature learning, a multi-scale residual block is designed in MRCNN to obtain rich feature representations. The experimental analyses show that MRADQN has strong fault detection capabilities, exceeding 99% diagnostic accuracy. And compared with many methods, MRADQN attains superior results when facing limited training data."

To efficiently detect codewords, we propose a deep unfolding forward-backward splitting algorithm that estimates transmitted codewords while automatically training algorithm hyperparameters via machine learning.

    "abstract": "In recent years, magnetic resonance wireless power transfer systems in the MHz band have been studied. However, higher operating frequency makes it difficult to achieve compatibility with higher output power due to limitations of components, such as switching devices and gate drivers. To address this issue, frequency multiplying circuits have been studied, which generate voltage at a switching frequency lower than the output frequency. We have proposed a frequency multiplying inverter based on a cascaded H-bridge. This paper verifies the feasibility of applying the proposed inverter to a wireless power transfer system through simulation and experimental evaluation. It also provides design insights for loss reduction and expansion of the operating range."

    "abstract": "To address the safety risks caused by metal foreign objects (MOs) in wireless electric vehicle charging (WEVC), this paper proposes a high-sensitivity metal object detection (MOD) method based on phase detection. The system injects a high-frequency excitation signal into an array of detection coils and monitors the real-time phase of the coil currents. Through impedance modeling of the detection coils, it is demonstrated that phase-based detection exhibits superior sensitivity compared to conventional amplitude-based techniques, especially for small-sized MOs. A high-resolution phase detection circuit, incorporating analog switches and a high-speed coil scanning mechanism, is designed to enable efficient multi-channel detection. A 3.3 kW WEVC prototype compliant with the SAE J2954 standard is developed to validate the proposed method. Experimental results show that the system can detect metallic objects as small as $1 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ anywhere within the $\\mathbf{7 5 0 ~ m m} \\times \\mathbf{6 0 0 ~ m m}$ power transmitting coil, achieving a minimum detectable phase variation of $\\mathbf{1 2 ~ m r a d}$ and completing a full scan in only 0.48 seconds."

Microgrid implementation, integrating renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic arrays and energy storage, represents a promising solution for reducing fossil fuel dependency while enhancing operational resilience and efficiency. This research focuses on power flow simulation and emission analysis of a hybrid photovoltaic and grid electricity system featuring a rooftop PV installation at Tanjung Emas Port, with a capacity of $6,250 \\mathrm{kWp}$. The simulation examines normal operational conditions and photovoltaic intermittency scenarios to assess system performance. It confirms that voltage levels remain within the IEC 60038 range of 0.90 to 1.10 per unit under both conditions. The islanded PV system successfully supplies outlet boxes at both terminals and office buildings despite minimum irradiance. This solar-powered shore power system achieves emission reduction of 61.39% compared to diesel-based systems, providing a technical foundation for advancing Tanjung Emas Port toward becoming an international smart port."

While lithium-ion batteries are widely used for their high energy density and long cycle life, issues related to cell imbalance and system safety remain critical challenges. To address this, the proposed system employs Typhoon HIL software for real-time modeling and simulation. A digital signal processor (DSP) TMS320F28069 is programmed with an active cell balancing algorithm and integrated with the HIL404 hardware. The system adopts a bidirectional converter topology to redistribute energy dynamically between unbalanced cells, with real-time monitoring through the HIL SCADA interface. Simulation results under both charging and discharging conditions demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness in reducing voltage and state-of-charge (SOC) deviations, thereby improving overall battery performance and operational safety. This work provides a cost-effective, real-time testing framework for validating BMS strategies, offering practical insights for future deployment in electric mobility and smart energy storage systems."

These factors are the integration aperture constraints and the angular domain sampling constraints. Then, we propose a fast backprojection algorithm and processing workflow tailored for TOPS SAR imaging, which maintains the computational accuracy and operational efficiency of the fast backprojection algorithm. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of this method through simulation experiments."

For cooperative detection scenarios involving multi-level threat zones and complex terrain, we propose a solution based on multi-algorithm comparative optimization. To evaluate algorithm performance, a simulation environment was established featuring six tier-3 threats, seven priority search areas (PSAs), and digital elevation terrain. A weighted cost function was constructed with objectives including path length, threat cost, altitude cost, smoothness cost, and detection reward. Four meta-heuristic algorithms—SFOA, GJO, MVO and ZOA—were systematically compared. Results indicate that (SFOA) demonstrates optimal overall performance in solving this problem, exhibiting superior convergence speed, solution quality, and stability compared to other algorithms. It can plan cooperative flight paths for UAV swarms that balance high detection efficiency with high safety. This study provides an effective basis for algorithm selection and solutions for multi-UAV collaborative mission planning in complex environments."

The aim is to monitor and track the safety status of elderly residents at home. The system is capable of rapidly alerting caregivers in the event of a detected fall, ensuring timely assistance for the elderly. Regarding the fall detection methods, three approaches are proposed in this thesis: pose estimation-based method, YOLOv5-based method, and the combination of YOLOv5 and pose estimation. Using pose estimation or YOLOv5 alone for fall detection might be limited by the diversity and quantity of training data, leading to suboptimal recognition performance. To address this issue, the thesis proposes a method that combines YOLOv5 and pose estimation. This combined approach effectively reduces false alarms from individual methods, consequently enhancing the accuracy of the fall detection system. By leveraging the strengths of both methods, this approach comprehensively considers the pose features within the image and the positional information of the target objects, thus improving the effectiveness of fall event detection."

This paper presents an automated secure merge workflow that integrates Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), aligned with the ISO/IEC 27001:2022 standard. The workflow leverages Semgrep for SAST and OWASP ZAP for DAST to enable early vulnerability detection, automated scanning, detailed reporting, and conditional merge control. Evaluation against the OWASP Benchmark dataset shows that Semgrep achieved a recall of 88.20%, while OWASP ZAP reached a precision of 97.77%, confirming their complementary roles. Beyond tool performance, the workflow demonstrates how ISO/IEC 27001 controls can be operationalized in practice, providing auditable evidence of secure coding and vulnerability management. While the pipeline alone cannot fulfill all principles of the standard, it strengthens compliance assurance and offers a practical model for integrating security into modern development pipelines."

Generally, typical desaturation (DESAT) circuits require design associated with gate driver ICs, including blanking time design, which is referred to the datasheet of gate driver ICs. However, the design method of the datasheet is under the ideal case. In practice, the tolerance, based on experience, is added to the blanking time under the non-ideal case caused by the parasitic inductance of the power switch. However, it is difficult to quantify the appropriate blanking time. Therefore, this paper proposes an estimation method based on the turn-on transient behavior of the MOSFET to improve the design procedure under the non-ideal case. Finally, simulation results are presented to verify the performance of the proposed estimate method."

The test system employs a passive circuit configuration that achieves power regeneration through a transformer, without the use of voltage or current sensors or a closed-loop controller. Compared to conventional systems using resistive loads or back-to-back configurations, the proposed method achieves reductions in volume, weight, and power consumption. Experimental verification using the prototype under conditions of 100 V voltage and 4 A peak current confirmed that power consumption was limited to 9.33 W. These results demonstrate that the proposed system can simultaneously achieve both soft switching and power regeneration, thereby establishing its suitability as a testing system optimized for soft-switching circuits."

    "abstract": "The development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and their increasing deployment bring new requirements for the reliability and safety of structural components. A particular challenge is the area of non-destructive testing (NDT), which is complicated by the use of additive manufacturing. This technology allows the creation of components with a heterogeneous internal structure, often combining solid and hollow segments, which reduces the effectiveness of conventional inspection methods. Components, such as multicopter arms, are exposed to high dynamic stress during operation, with landing being a particularly critical phase. Hard landings can lead to the formation of microcracks, which are difficult to detect by standard methods such as thermography or ultrasound. The limitations of these approaches are the layered surface, material texture and increasingly complex geometry optimized by evolutionary algorithms. The article aims to present an innovative approach to NDT, based on the integration of sensors directly into the design of UAV components. This system is designed for off-line diagnostics, i.e. pre-flight and in-flight inspection of critical points, without compromising the integrity of the structure. The presented solution represents a promising path to more reliable monitoring and extending the service life of UAVs manufactured using additive technologies, thereby contributing to higher operational safety and efficiency of their deployment.

The initial part of the study presents an overview of the methodology and findings, focusing on the structural and content-related aspects of military aviation regulations. The comparative assessment was conducted using the aviation regulatory systems of the United States Air Force (USAF) and the Russian Federation Air Force (AFoRF), two of the world’s largest and most influential military air powers. The results obtained were subsequently compared with the regulatory environment of the Slovak Republic. Special attention has given to the interoperability of military and civil aviation regulations as well as to cross-comparisons between different military regulatory frameworks. Findings indicate that, while civil and military aviation regulations share several common principles, they also exhibit significant structural and procedural divergences. One of the most notable distinctions lies in the fact that each country maintains its own military regulatory system. They often differ in organizational hierarchy, document classification, and operational procedures when compared to civil aviation standards."

    "abstract": "Haze severely degrades the visual quality of remote sensing images, resulting in the loss of fine details and reduced reliability in subsequent tasks. Although Transformer-based approaches have recently achieved notable progress in image dehazing, most existing methods mitigate computational complexity by constraining self-attention to channel interactions or fixed spatial regions. This design inevitably restricts their capacity to capture long-range spatial dependencies, which are crucial for effectively modeling haze distributions. To address this limitation, we propose a Histogram-guided Remote Sensing Image Dehazing Transformer (HRSformer). The framework is built upon two key components: a Histogram Degradation Representation Block (HDRB), which dynamically selects spatial feature ranges and collaboratively processes distant pixels with similar degradation patterns to suppress global haze interference, and a Multi-Expert Modulation Block (MEMB), which employs a mixture-of-experts strategy to adaptively capture multi-scale and multi-granularity contextual features in a sample-specific manner, thereby improving the reconstruction of fine local textures. Extensive experiments on multiple public remote sensing dehazing benchmarks demonstrate that HRSformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality, validating its effectiveness and superiority."

    "abstract": "Simultaneous transmit and receive, or in-band full-duplex (IBFD), holds significant promise for radar and wireless communication systems using time-domain cancellation at radio frequencies. These systems rely on precise control of group delay to effectively mitigate self-interference. Piezoelectric-based traveling microwave acoustic wave devices provide a compact, passive means to implement such delays with high fidelity. This work explores the integration of piezoelectric acoustic delay lines to enhance self-interference cancellation (SIC) performance through precise group delay control and demonstrates SIC with such devices for a single tap demonstration."

    "abstract": "This article investigates data-driven methods for distributed cooperative control of multi-input linear systems. In model-free scenarios, designing cooperative control laws is particularly challenging due to strong dynamic coupling and limited communication between neighboring agents. We consider both partially known and completely unknown system models, and propose corresponding direct and indirect data-driven procedures for distributed controller design. For systems with partially known models, we develop several algorithms tailored to different cases of unknown system matrices. For completely unknown systems, we adopt an indirect data-driven framework, reformulating the system identification process as a distributed optimization problem. The problem admits a unique optimal solution which accurately represents the system model, with the uniqueness guaranteed by the distributed design of control inputs. A practical algorithm is proposed to obtain this optimal solution, and the communication load with neighbors is independent of data length and system size, demonstrating favorable scalability. To enhance the practicality of the proposed methods, several acceleration techniques with mild approximations are incorporated, significantly reducing communication and computation costs. Moreover, we also provide discussions on the effect of data quality and noise on the identification performance. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms are validated through numerical simulations."

    "abstract": "Integrated circuit (IC) marking detection faces critical “Triple C” challenges: compact marking scales, complex multidirectional layouts, and costly annotation requirements. Traditional models struggle with data scarcity in dynamic manufacturing environments where fine-grained labeled data are expensive and time-consuming to obtain. This work presents MarkingVLM, a specialized vision-language model designed for IC marking detection with exceptional few-shot learning capabilities. MarkingVLM adapts cross-modal understanding from Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) through unique innovations: 1) dual-granularity detection combining patch-level semantic alignment with pixel-level visual decoding; 2) layout mirror module enabling efficient multidirectional text flow recognition through feature-level augmentation; and 3) enhanced prompt engineering with learnable contexts for effective domain adaptation. Extensive experiments across two IC marking datasets with distinct characteristics substantiate superior performance: 94.2% precision and 96.5% recall on Dataset-1, and 89.6% precision with 92.6% recall on the more challenging Dataset-2. Most significantly, MarkingVLM achieves 92.7% precision with 32 training samples and maintains over 80% recall with merely 8 samples, demonstrating notable data efficiency improvement over conventional methods. Results establish a new paradigm for industrial text detection by bridging open-domain vision-language knowledge with specialized manufacturing requirements."

    "abstract": "Integrating quantum key distribution (QKD) with multicore fiber (MCF) optical networks to build large-capacity and high-security networks is a promising method to meet the traffic and security demand in the future. In this paper, an innovative algorithm named QKD Transceiver Planning for Key Generation and Consumption Matching (QTP-KGCM) is proposed to solve the problem of mismatch between key generation and consumption. On demand of achieving synergistic transmission of classical and quantum signal, a heuristic resource allocation algorithm named Classical and Quantum signals Layered Interleaved (CQLI) is proposed. Furthermore, this paper pro poses the Deep Q Network based Synergistic Resource Allocation (DQN-based SRA) algorithm in response to the limited effective ness, which is a common issue in heuristic resource allocation algorithms. Simulation results show that QTP-KGCM algorithm can ensure that secure key rate of generation exceeds consumption rate 94.7% of the time in real-time key consumption scenario, while secure key quantity of generation exceeds consumption 99.5% of the time in cumulative key consumption scenario. Compared with existing conventional channel allocation algorithm, CQLI algorithm achieves a maximum increase of 0.485 in synergistic degree. DQN-based SRA algorithm demonstrates superior synergistic degree performance, achieving a maximum improvement of 0.213 and 0.198 in synergistic degree compared with the CQLI algorithm and existing synergistic core and wave length allocation algorithm, respectively."

    "abstract": "Deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) in dynamic edge environments is challenging, as scheduling decisions must consider both the topological complexity of the DNN model and the variability of dynamic edge resources. Existing methods often fail to balance this trade-off, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this study, we introduce Heterogeneous Graph-Attention-Network-Based Collaborative Inference (HANCI), a framework designed to minimize end-to-end inference latency using an intelligent, context-aware scheduling approach. This framework employs a decoupled feature extraction architecture based on a heterogeneous graph attention network. It independently extracts high-quality features from static DNN computational graphs and dynamic edge environments. This decoupling allows HANCI to generate comprehensive, interference-free state embeddings. These embeddings support a hybrid decision-making strategy that combines a learned partitioning policy with a heuristic-guided placement mechanism, making the complex scheduling problem tractable. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that HANCI considerably outperforms baseline methods. It reduces inference latency by 21.6% for lightweight models and by up to 78.1% for complex architectures. This study provides a robust and adaptive solution to the challenge of collaborative DNN inference in edge environments."

    "abstract": "Infantile epileptic spasm syndrome (IESS) is developmental epileptic encephalopathy occurring in childhood. It is often difficult to predict long-term seizure outcomes at the time of onset, particularly in patients with unknown etiology. Predicting long-term seizure outcomes from electroencephalograms (EEG) at onset may be helpful for decision-making on therapeutic strategy by clinicians and families. This study included twenty-two patients with IESS of unknown etiology with a median follow-up period of 11 years (range 5-14 years). We categorized patients diagnosed with IESS of unknown etiology into good and poor outcome groups according to the presence or absence of seizures at the time of the last follow-up. Fifteen patients were categorized into the good outcome group, and the rest into the poor outcome group. A machine learning (ML) model was developed using scale EEG data during sleep to identify patients in the poor outcome group. A self-attention autoencoder (SA-AE), which is an anomaly detection method for time-series data, was adopted because the numbers of patients in the poor and good outcome groups were unbalanced. The ML model achieved a sensitivity of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$1.00\\pm 0.05$</tex-math></inline-formula>, specificity of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$0.88\\pm 0.11$</tex-math></inline-formula>, and accuracy of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$0.95\\pm 0.06$</tex-math></inline-formula>.

Thus, the SA-AE model under development enabled highly accurate prediction of long-term prognosis in patients with IESS of unknown etiology. We confirmed that trained attention among the EEG channels could be explained from the viewpoint of pathophysiology of IESS. This study contributes to the determination of appropriate treatment for patients with IESS of unknown etiology."

    "abstract": "Spatiotemporal trajectory data’s sparsity, irregularity, and fine-grained nature pose significant processing challenges. To address this, we introduce PointFormer, a deep learning framework. We demonstrate its efficacy through aircraft type identification, a quantifiable task that requires mining distinct flight patterns of different types from large-scale historical flight trajectories. At the first stage of our work, we employ Grad-CAM to demonstrate that points within trajectory sequences exhibit uneven contributions to predictions. Motivated by this, we propose the point-to-dynamic-voxel mapping and resampling (PMR) module, which dynamically merges redundant points by mapping clustered neighbors into sequence-specific voxels and employs farthest point sampling (FPS) to retain discriminative points. This generates a structured key-point sequence, thus enabling small-batch parallel training while ensuring no loss of critical information. Furthermore, to directly address irregular point dispersion, we design multi-scale consistent point embedding (MSCPE) using three distinct sliding window scales. PointFormer achieves significant and consistent gains, with PMR, MSCPE, and their combination delivering +14.9%, +7.2%, and +19.2% average improvements respectively, across varying aircraft type combinations."

    "abstract": "The growing demand for high-power-density electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is accelerating the adoption of power converters operating at ultra-high switching frequencies. However, conventional modulation techniques such as PWM and SVPWM face increasing limitations at high frequencies, including narrow pulse issues, sampling inaccuracies, wide-bandwidth current sensor requirements, and high complexity in real-time control algorithms. This paper proposes and implements Pulse Density Modulation (PDM) as an alternative control strategy for the three-phase six-switch current source rectifier (CSR6SW) in fast EV chargers under 400 VDC. The proposed PDM technique is based on an offline modulation architecture, enabling enhanced resolution by adjusting the number of modulation blocks and switching pulses per cycle. LTspice simulation results at various frequencies (38.4 kHz, 172.8 kHz, and 691.2 kHz) demonstrate that PDM can synthesize near-sinusoidal input currents with low total harmonic distortion (THDi) and high power factor (PF > 0.99), requiring no real-time feedback. Notably, at 691.2 kHz, the system achieves THDi = 1.29% and PF = 0.9985, outperforming SVPWM in both waveform quality and control hardware simplicity. The proposed PDM approach shows strong potential for next-generation fast EV chargers employing current source rectifiers, centralized DC distribution, and high-efficiency isolated DC-DC converters - especially when combined with SiC/GaN power devices."

The system employs three microchannels with optical path lengths of 6 mm, 12 mm, and 18 mm to analyze photonic behavior, including transmission, scattering, and absorption. Experimental results demonstrate that transmission decreases with increasing optical path lengths and bacterial concentrations, consistent with light extinction theory. For nominal concentrations of 125 ppm, 250 ppm, and 500 ppm, the system estimates concentrations with deviations of -8 percent, -6.4 percent, and -9.4 percent, respectively. The bacterial radii are measured with high accuracy, showing deviations of 1.8 percent, 3.3 percent, and 4.3 percent around the nominal size of 1 µm. This microfluidic system offers real-time analysis, reduced sample volumes, and high precision, providing a groundbreaking platform for Staphylococcus aureus detection and characterization in biological diagnostics and environmental monitoring."

    "abstract": "The Modern era has changed conventional farming into smart farming that uses various robots for monitoring or doing mechanical jobs. To support the autonomous function of the robot, a method of battery charging that is fully autonomous is required. The wireless charging method or wireless power transfer (WPT) can be applied to overcome this problem. Li-Po batteries are often used in robots and need a charging system that is fast, safe, and protects the battery’s life. This study proposes a synchronous buck converter used as the WPT receiver side for a battery charging controller using the constant current-constant voltage (CC-CV) method. A digital proportional integrator (PI) controller was implemented to regulate the charging process, maintaining a constant current of 3 A in CC mode and a 12 V constant voltage in CV mode. The converter has successfully developed and achieved 91.8% maximum efficiency under the CC mode. It has also successfully charged a 3-cell, 5000 mAh Li-Po battery within 1 hour, achieving an average efficiency of 85%."

Six different classifiers were rigorously evaluated. Random Forest demonstrated the highest overall precision, achieving an accuracy of 97.75%. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques were employed, with SHAP and LIME effectively identifying critical features and relevant EEG channels. These metrics are highly beneficial for this classification.

By identifying low density region, DBSCAN effectively removes outliers, while SMOTE addresses class imbalance by generating synthetic samples of minority class. The attention mechanism enhances the MLP’s ability to focus on critical features, improving detection accuracy for rare attack instances. Experimental results on a benchmark DDoS dataset show improvements in F1-Score (0.929) and PR-AUC (0.956) compared to baseline models. The proposed method proves effective in detecting low-frequency DDoS attacks, while maintaining low false-positive rates in imbalanced network environments."
