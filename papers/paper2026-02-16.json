    "abstract": "Coarse-grained molecular dynamics often sacrifices accuracy and transferability for computational efficiency, but the use of machine learned potentials is helping coarse-grained models attain performance on par with atomistic molecular dynamics. Nevertheless, developing representations of the coarse-grained potential energy surface faces severe scaling challenges due to the extreme data demands of widely used \"bottom-up\" coarse-graining objectives. In this work, we show that mean force matching, a strategy for training thermodynamically consistent coarse-grained models, requires 50x fewer training samples and 87% less total atomistic simulation time, while obtaining better accuracy on the potential of mean force for unseen proteins compared to other commonly used objectives. By systematically removing noise from the objective function, we demonstrate that it is possible to scale machine learning architectures for coarse-graining, enabling highly accurate and transferable models. We show the advantages of mean force matching both theoretically and through exhaustive benchmarking using thermodynamic consistency as the primary metric of accuracy."

    "abstract": "The Adler-Bell-Jackiw chiral anomaly is shown to retain its Lorentz-invariant form, $\\partial_μJ^μ_5 \\propto \\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}$, in lattice Weyl systems beyond moderate magnetic fields, where neither Lorentz nor rotational symmetry is present. We show that the longitudinal and Hall magnetoconductivities factorize into a product of a universal part, governed by the chiral anomaly, and a non-universal part that depends on the density of states at the Fermi level. A rotationally invariant observable $\\varkappa = σ(c_V/T)^2$ is introduced as a robust signature of the anomaly, where $σ$ denotes the Euclidean norm of the longitudinal and Hall conductivities and $c_V$ is the specific heat density. This quantity follows a universal $B^2$ dependence and scales as $|\\cosΘ|$, with $Θ$ being the angle between $\\mathbf{E}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$. Through analytical derivation and full numerical simulation, we establish that $\\varkappa$ remains universal independent of system parameters and of the orientation of the magnetic or electric field for fixed $Θ$. The emergent SO(3) symmetry in $\\varkappa$ persists despite the absence of isotropy in both the microscopic model and the low-energy effective theory."

    "abstract": "Failures in large language models (LLMs) are often analyzed from a behavioral perspective, where incorrect outputs in factual question answering are commonly associated with missing knowledge. In this work, focusing on entity-based factual queries, we suggest that such a view may conflate different failure mechanisms, and propose an internal, mechanism-oriented perspective that separates Knowledge Existence from Behavior Expression. Under this formulation, hallucination and deception correspond to two qualitatively different failure modes that may appear similar at the output level but differ in their underlying mechanisms. To study this distinction, we construct a controlled environment for entity-centric factual questions in which knowledge is preserved while behavioral expression is selectively altered, enabling systematic analysis of four behavioral cases. We analyze these failure modes through representation separability, sparse interpretability, and inference-time activation steering."

As a result, in the limit where the 1-3 element of diagonalization of neutrinos $U^ν$ is also neglected, we obtained a compact expression for the FX phase $δ_{\\rm FX} = \\arg [ { U^{e}_{11} U^{e}_{12} U^{e}_{33} } { U^{ν*}_{11} U^{ν*}_{12} U^{ν*}_{33} / \\det U^{e} \\det U^{ν*} } ] - \\arg [ 1 + ({U^{e *}_{23} U^ν_{23} / U^{e *}_{33} U^ν_{33}} ) ] $.

    "abstract": "Classical polarization optics is naturally described by a two-dimensional complex Hilbert space (Jones vectors), so the tensor-product kinematics underlying bipartite nonseparability is already available classically. For statistical (stochastic) optical fields, and under an operational stance where outcomes are not assumed pre-assigned prior to detection, suitably prepared two-beam polarization states can exhibit Bell--CHSH correlations of quantum strength. The same platform offers a tunable, low-cost testbed for stress-testing Bell/CHSH and contextuality witnesses under realistic imperfections (noise, coarse binning, selective sampling). We also outline an alternative preparation based on external conical refraction (ECR), where engineered intersecting conical-refraction rings mimic the intersecting emission cones of SPDC. We give a self-contained categorical formulation: the preparation-and-conditioning pipeline (Hadamard-like splitting, CNOT-like coupling, and routing/conditioning that removes unwanted contributions) is treated as a single morphism in an operational process theory (e.g. $\\mathbf{CPM}(\\mathbf{FHilb})$). From it we functorially extract an empirical model, i.e. a compatible family of context-indexed probability distributions. The Abramsky--Brandenburger sheaf criterion then applies: noncontextuality is the existence of a global section, and CHSH violation is a precise failure-to-glue. This separates kinematic nonseparability from operational contextuality and clarifies why neither, by itself, entails nonlocal causation; contextuality can arise in a classically implementable stochastic-optics regime."

To guide learning under ambiguity, we propose the Spectral-Entropic Uncertainty (SEU) Loss, which jointly captures spatial overlap, spectral consistency, and predictive uncertainty in a unified objective. In complex clinical circumstances with poor image quality, this formulation improves model reliability. Extensive experiments on various publicly available medical datasets, QATA-COVID19, MosMed++, and Kvasir-SEG, demonstrate that our method achieves superior segmentation performance while being significantly more computationally efficient than existing State-of-the-Art (SoTA) approaches.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) emerging as a key technique for downstream task adaptation. However, existing PEFT methods mainly operate in Euclidean space, fundamentally limiting their capacity to capture complex geometric structures inherent in language data. While alternative geometric spaces, like hyperbolic geometries for hierarchical data and spherical manifolds for circular patterns, offer theoretical advantages, forcing representations into a single manifold type ultimately limits expressiveness, even when curvature parameters are learnable. To address this, we propose Mixture of Space (MoS), a unified framework that leverages multiple geometric spaces simultaneously to learn richer, curvature-aware representations. Building on this scheme, we develop MoSLoRA, which extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with heterogeneous geometric experts, enabling models to dynamically select or combine appropriate geometric spaces based on input context. Furthermore, to address the computational overhead of frequent manifold switching, we develop a lightweight routing mechanism. Moreover, we provide empirical insights into how curvature optimization impacts training stability and model performance. Our experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that MoSLoRA consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to 5.6% improvement on MATH500 and 15.9% on MAWPS."

We show that the existing metrics used to measure representational similarity are confounded by network scale: increasing model depth or width can systematically inflate representational similarity scores. To correct these effects, we introduce a permutation-based null-calibration framework that transforms any representational similarity metric into a calibrated score with statistical guarantees. We revisit the Platonic Representation Hypothesis with our calibration framework, which reveals a nuanced picture: the apparent convergence reported by global spectral measures largely disappears after calibration, while local neighborhood similarity, but not local distances, retains significant agreement across different modalities. Based on these findings, we propose the Aristotelian Representation Hypothesis: representations in neural networks are converging to shared local neighborhood relationships."

While this acknowledges the fact that Madhava of Sangamagrama an Indian mathematician who lived in Kerala in the 14th century along the banks of river Nila, was the first to discover the series, the modern day proof for the $π$-series is based on the outline of the proof given by the famous German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the 17th century, using concepts and rigorous definitions of Calculus many of which were developed after his lifetime. We extend the same benefit to Madhava's ideas and present Madhava's upapatti i.e proof for the $π$-series as given in Jyesthadeva's Yuktibhasha using modern notation and definitions. We elaborate Madhava's proof at three places (a) to prove that the arc-bit sum is same as the sum of arc-bit approximations (b) to prove convergence and (c) to concisely prove by iteration the power sum approximation. Madhava's method with appropriate changes can be applied to derive the sine and cosine series as well. Madhava also provides the correction terms to accelerate the convergence of the $π$-series. We compare the two proofs i.e Madhava's and the popular proof for $π$ which is based on Leibniz's ideas and observe that they are different since Madhava's is based on the length of the arc where as Leibniz's relies on the area under the arc and in terms of the number of concepts from advanced calculus used in the the two proofs Madhava's proof stands out for its simplicity, thus making a case for it to be appreciated, popularised and taught as the original proof of the $π$-series."

Nevertheless, this process can introduce excessively long responses, inflating inference latency and computational overhead. Prior length-control approaches typically rely on fixed heuristic reward shaping, which can misalign with the task objective and require brittle tuning. In this work, we propose LACONIC, a reinforcement learning method that enforces a target token budget during training. Specifically, we update policy models using an augmented objective that combines the task reward with a length-based cost. To balance brevity and task performance, the cost scale is adaptively adjusted throughout training. This yields robust length control while preserving task reward. We provide a theoretical guarantee that support the method. Across mathematical reasoning models and datasets, LACONIC preserves or improves pass@1 while reducing output length by over 50%. It maintains out-of-domain performance on general knowledge and multilingual benchmarks with 44% fewer tokens. Moreover, LACONIC integrates into standard RL-tuning with no inference changes and minimal deployment overhead."

Finite-energy grid states are generated deterministically using coherently driven entangled nonlinear biphoton sources that produce single-photon frequency-comb supermodes. An optical-frequency-comb reference anchors the time--frequency phase space and enforces commuting displacement stabilizers directly at the hardware level, continuously defining the logical subspace. Timing jitter, spectral drift, and phase noise map naturally onto Gaussian displacement errors within this lattice, yielding intrinsic correctability inside a stabilizer cell. Logical operations correspond to experimentally accessible phase and delay controls, enabling deterministic state preparation and manipulation. Building on the modal time--frequency GKP framework, we identify a concrete pathway toward active syndrome extraction and deterministic displacement recovery using ancillary grid states and interferometric time--frequency measurements. These primitives establish a hardware-compatible route for integrating the time--frequency GKP logical layer into erasure-aware and fusion-based fault-tolerant photonic architectures."

Using quadratic vector autoregressions as a laboratory, we show that linear local projections fail to capture any nonlinearities when shocks are symmetrically distributed. Popular state-dependent local projections specifications capture distinct aspects of nonlinearity: those interacting shocks with their signs capture higher-order effects, while those interacting shocks with lagged states capture state dependence. However, their gains over linear specifications are concentrated in tail shocks or tail states; and, for lag-based specifications, hinge on how well the chosen observable proxies the latent state. Our proposed specification-which augments the linear specification with a squared shock term and an interaction between the shock and lagged observables-best approximates the true responses across the entire joint distribution of shocks and states. An application to monetary policy reveals economically meaningful state dependence, whereas higher-order effects, though statistically significant, prove economically modest."

This separation creates failure cases where internally consistent fabrications bypass manipulation detectors and fact-checkers verify claims that contain pixel-level or token-level corruption. We present D-SECURE, a framework that combines internal manipulation detection with external evidence-based reasoning for news-style posts. D-SECURE integrates the HAMMER manipulation detector with the DEFAME retrieval pipeline. DEFAME performs broad verification, and HAMMER analyses residual or uncertain cases that may contain fine-grained edits. Experiments on DGM4 and ClaimReview samples highlight the complementary strengths of both systems and motivate their fusion.

Each persona is defined by demographic attributes (age group, gender, income, education, reading level), behavioral patterns (books per year, genre preferences, discovery methods, price sensitivity), and consistency parameters. Panels are composed per imprint to reflect target demographics, with diversity constraints ensuring representation across age, reading level, and genre affinity. Book concepts compete in single-elimination, double-elimination, round-robin, or Swiss-system tournaments, judged against weighted criteria including market appeal, originality, and execution potential. To reject low-quality LLM evaluations, we implement five automated anti-slop checks (repetitive phrasing, generic framing, circular reasoning, score clustering, audience mismatch). We report results from deployment within a multi-imprint publishing operation managing 6 active imprints and 609 titles in distribution. Three case studies -- a 270-evaluator panel for a children's literacy novel, and two 5-person expert panels for a military memoir and a naval strategy monograph -- demonstrate that synthetic panels produce actionable demographic segmentation, identify structural content issues invisible to homogeneous reviewers, and enable tournament filtering that eliminates low-quality concepts while enriching high-quality survivors from 15% to 62% of the evaluated pool."

We empirically observe that outlier severity intensifies with pre-training scale (e.g., progressing from CLIP to the more extensively trained SigLIP and SigLIP2). Through theoretical analysis as well as empirical correlation studies, we establish the direct link between these activation outliers and dominant singular values of the weights. Building on this insight, we propose Selective Spectral Decay ($S^2D$), a geometrically-principled conditioning method that surgically regularizes only the weight components corresponding to the largest singular values during fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that $S^2D$ significantly reduces activation outliers and produces well-conditioned representations that are inherently quantization-friendly. Models trained with $S^2D$ achieve up to 7% improved PTQ accuracy on ImageNet under W4A4 quantization and 4% gains when combined with QAT. These improvements also generalize across downstream tasks and vision-language models, enabling the scaling of increasingly large and rigorously trained models without sacrificing deployment efficiency."

However, its theoretical role remains only partially understood. In this work, we propose an information-theoretic framework that systematically accounts for the effect of augmentation on generalization and invariance learning. Our approach builds upon mutual information-based bounds, which relate the generalization gap to the amount of information a learning algorithm retains about its training data. We extend this framework by modeling the augmented distribution as a composition of the original data distribution with a distribution over transformations, which naturally induces an orbit-averaged loss function. Under mild sub-Gaussian assumptions on the loss function and the augmentation process, we derive a new generalization bound that decompose the expected generalization gap into three interpretable terms: (1) a distributional divergence between the original and augmented data, (2) a stability term measuring the algorithm dependence on training data, and (3) a sensitivity term capturing the effect of augmentation variability. To connect our bounds to the geometry of the augmentation group, we introduce the notion of group diameter, defined as the maximal perturbation that augmentations can induce in the input space. The group diameter provides a unified control parameter that bounds all three terms and highlights an intrinsic trade-off: small diameters preserve data fidelity but offer limited regularization, while large diameters enhance stability at the cost of increased bias and sensitivity. We validate our theoretical bounds with numerical experiments, demonstrating that it reliably tracks and predicts the behavior of the true generalization gap."

The output state remains diagonal in photon-number basis, making photon counting globally optimal and saturating the multiparameter quantum Cramér-Rao bound without adaptive feedback. Moving beyond ideal unitary evolution, we analyze protocol robustness under concurrent amplitude and phase damping. Using Fisher Information Susceptibility, we establish a clear hierarchy: NOON states offer maximal theoretical sensitivity but exhibit exponential fragility to loss, rendering them impractical. Squeezed vacuum states emerge as robust candidates for steady-state sensing, while cat states prove compelling for transient thermometry by retaining significant coherence after photon loss. We validate these predictions through digital quantum circuit implementation on IBM's \\texttt{ibm_torino} processor. Experimental results confirm the predicted Fisher information landscape while revealing systematic noise-induced biases, demonstrating that current NISQ hardware can effectively benchmark fundamental trade-offs in multiparameter quantum sensing."

The embedding space functions as a conditional expectation over a σ-algebra, and its failure to be isomorphic to the semantic truth set fundamentally causes logical consistency breakdown. WavePhaseNet Method The authors propose WavePhaseNet, which explicitly constructs a Semantic Conceptual Hierarchy Structure (SCHS) using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). By applying DFT along the sequence dimension, semantic information is decomposed into frequency bands: low-frequency components capture global meaning and intent, while high-frequency components represent local syntax and expression. This staged separation enables precise semantic manipulation in diagonalized space. Dimensionality Reduction GPT-4's 24,576-dimensional embedding space exhibits a 1/f spectral structure based on language self-similarity and Zipf's law. Through cumulative energy analysis, the authors derive that approximately 3,000 dimensions constitute the lower bound for \"complete representation.\" This demonstrates that reduction from 24,576 to 3,000 dimensions preserves meaning and intent while enabling rigorous reasoning and suppressing hallucination. Cohomological Consistency Control The reduced embedding space, constructed via cohomological regularization over overlapping local windows, allows defining a graph structure and cochain complex. This quantifies inconsistencies among local inferences as coboundary-based losses. Applying harmonic projection based on Hodge theory positions cohomology as a computable regularization principle for controlling semantic consistency, extracting maximally consistent global representations."

We establish the primary HEFT (pHEFT) as a benchmark framework, demonstrating that alternative HEFT constructions can be systematically derived from it. A key advantage of the pHEFT construction is its parameter choice, which maintains linear relations between the UV Lagrangian parameters and squared heavy masses. By strictly employing the inverse squared heavy masses as the expansion parameters without imposing additional constraints, pHEFT preserves maximal ultraviolet (UV) information and ensures higher perturbative accuracy by avoiding the additional truncations inherent in more complex, non-linear formulations or extra constraints. Through the analysis of the $Z_2$-symmetric real singlet model and the 2HDM, we illustrate the criteria for identifying viable primary HEFT constructions in UV models with scalar extensions. Furthermore, for the first time, we derive the HEFT operators of the RHTM involving fermions."

When latent confounders cannot be directly adjusted for and are instead controlled using proxy variables, strong associations between exposure and measured proxies can amplify sensitivity to residual confounding. We formalize this phenomenon in linear regression settings by showing that a simple ratio involving the exposure model coefficient and residual exposure variance provides an observable measure of this increased sensitivity. Applying our framework to smoking and lung cancer, we document how growing socioeconomic stratification in smoking behavior over time leads to heightened sensitivity to unmeasured confounding in more recent data. These results highlight the importance of multicollinearity when interpreting sensitivity analyses based on proxy adjustment."

Recent learning-based methods have demonstrated strong representational capacity for geometric perception and are increasingly used to augment classical geometry-centric systems in practice. However, whether learning components should directly replace geometric estimation or instead serve as intermediate modules within such pipelines remains an open question. In this work, we address this gap and investigate an end-to-end modular framework for effective spatial reasoning, where learning proposes geometric hypotheses, while geometric algorithms dispose estimation decisions. In particular, we study this principle in the context of relative camera pose estimation on RGB-D sequences. Using VGGT as a representative learning model, we evaluate learning-based pose and depth proposals under varying motion magnitudes and scene dynamics, followed by a classical point-to-plane RGB-D ICP as the geometric backend. Our experiments on the TUM RGB-D benchmark reveal three consistent findings: (1) learning-based pose proposals alone are unreliable; (2) learning-proposed geometry, when improperly aligned with camera intrinsics, can degrade performance; and (3) when learning-proposed depth is geometrically aligned and followed by a geometric disposal stage, consistent improvements emerge in moderately challenging rigid settings. These results demonstrate that geometry is not merely a refinement component, but an essential arbiter that validates and absorbs learning-based geometric observations. Our study highlights the importance of modular, geometry-aware system design for robust spatial perception."

An $L^{2}$-projected averaged normal vector is used in the scheme to facilitate a rigorous convergence analysis. Within the projected--distance framework, we establish the first complete convergence proof for a parametric finite element method that incorporates the MDR tangential motion without relying on evolution equations for the mean curvature or the normal vector, achieving optimal-order error estimates for finite elements of degree $k \\ge 3$. Numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical results and demonstrate that the proposed MDR method maintains mesh quality comparable to the Barrett--Garcke--Nürnberg method, for which convergence has not yet been established."

Traditional parallelization schemes for NN inference on MCM architectures, such as intra-layer parallelism and inter-layer pipelining, show incompetency in breaking through both challenges, limiting the scalability of MCM architectures. We observed that existing works typically deploy layers separately rather than considering them jointly. This underexploited dimension leads to compromises between system computation and communication, thus hindering optimal utilization, especially as hardware/software scale. To address this limitation, we propose Scope, a merged pipeline framework incorporating this overlooked multi-layer dimension, thereby achieving improved throughput and scalability by relaxing tradeoffs between computation, communication and memory costs. This new dimension, however, adds to the complexity of design space exploration (DSE). To tackle this, we develop a series of search algorithms that achieves exponential-to-linear complexity reduction, while identifying solutions that rank in the top 0.05% of performance. Experiments show that Scope achieves up to 1.73x throughput improvement while maintaining similar energy consumption for ResNet-152 inference compared to state-of-the-art approaches."

One time integration technique that is capable of preserving the positivity of quantities for every time step size is the Patankar-trick and its variants. However, in the context of the Euler equations of gas dynamics, we wonder whether the Patankar-trick should be applied to the density and total energy equations or only to one of them. In this work, we discuss one drawback of the schemes when blindly applied to every positive conserved variable and additionally point out how to overcome the issue by balancing the involved numerical fluxes correctly. To illustrate our findings, we investigate modified Patankar--Runge--Kutta (MPRK) schemes in the context of the compressible Euler equations with and without stiff source terms. We discover that it is beneficial to only apply the Patankar-trick in the density equation and to balance the remaining numerical fluxes consistently rather than applying the trick also to the energy equation. This leads also to the preservation of contact discontinuities. We perform numerical experiments to demonstrate that the accuracy of the methods is maintained while the performance of our approach is superior to the traditional application of MPRK schemes."

This new framework clusters devices adaptively based on real-time resource profiles and adapts customized models suited to every cluster's capability. ASA capitalizes on an intelligent agent layer that examines CPU power, available memory, and network environment to categorize devices into three levels: high-performance, mid-tier, and low-capability. Each level is provided with a model tuned to its computational power to ensure inclusive engagement across the network. Experimental evaluation on two benchmark datasets, MNIST and CIFAR-10, proves that ASA decreases communication burden by 43% to 50%, improves resource utilization by 43%, and achieves final model accuracies of 98.89% on MNIST and 85.30% on CIFAR-10.

This introduces a potential mismatch between token-level optimization and the inherently block-level nature of reasoning in these settings. To bridge this gap, we propose Multi-token Policy Gradient Optimization (MPO), a framework that treats sequences of K consecutive tokens as unified semantic actions. This block-level perspective enables our method to capture the compositional structure of reasoning trajectories and supports optimization over coherent, higher-level objectives. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and coding benchmarks show that MPO outperforms standard token-level policy gradient baselines, highlight the limitations of token-level policy gradients for complex reasoning, motivating future research to look beyond token-level granularity for reasoning-intensive language tasks."

These lower bounds give evidence that the currently known classical and quantum algorithms for LH cannot be significantly improved. Furthermore, we are able to demonstrate fine-grained complexity lower bounds for approximating the quantum partition function (QPF) with an arbitrary constant relative error. Approximating QPF with relative error is known to be equivalent to approximately counting the dimension of the solution subspace of $\\mathsf{QMA}$ problems. We show the SETH and QSETH hardness to estimate QPF with constant relative error. We then provide a quantum algorithm that runs in $O(\\sqrt{2^n})$ time for an arbitrary $1/\\mathrm{poly}(n)$ relative error, matching our lower bounds and improving the state-of-the-art algorithm by Bravyi, Chowdhury, Gosset, and Wocjan (Nature Physics 2022) in the low-temperature regime. To prove our fine-grained lower bounds, we introduce the first size-preserving circuit-to-Hamiltonian construction that encodes the computation of a $T$-time quantum circuit acting on $N$ qubits into a $(d+1)$-local Hamiltonian acting on $N+O(T^{1/d})$ qubits.

This representation enables financial structures to be analysed as computable economic systems whose performance and risk characteristics can be evaluated consistently across alternative configurations within a unified stochastic environment. While motivated by applications in structured finance, the framework applies more broadly to contractual and institutional arrangements in which uncertain resources are allocated across ordered claims. By providing a unified computational architecture for representing and comparing such mechanisms, the approach supports systematic analysis of structural design, risk distribution, and contractual transparency under uncertainty."

Traditional image-based methods rely on minimal inter-frame motion to constrain the correspondence search space, which limits their applicability to highly dynamic scenes or necessitates high-speed cameras at the cost of prohibitive storage and computational overhead. We propose an event-frame fusion framework that exploits events for temporally dense motion cues and frames for spatially dense precise estimation. Revisiting the solid elastic modeling prior, we propose an Affine Invariant Simplicial (AIS) framework. It partitions the deformation field into linearized sub-regions with low-parametric representation, effectively mitigating motion ambiguities arising from sparse and noisy events. To speed up parameter searching and reduce error accumulation, a neighborhood-greedy optimization strategy is introduced, enabling well-converged sub-regions to guide their poorly-converged neighbors, effectively suppress local error accumulation in long-term dense tracking. To evaluate the proposed method, a benchmark dataset with temporally aligned event streams and frames is established, encompassing over 120 sequences spanning diverse deformation scenarios. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline by 1.6% in survival rate.

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a widely used framework for reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) on domain-specific tasks by retrieving relevant documents from a database to support accurate responses. However, when the database contains sensitive corpora, such as medical records or legal documents, RAG poses serious privacy risks by potentially exposing private information through its outputs. Prior work has demonstrated that one can practically craft adversarial prompts that force an LLM to regurgitate the augmented contexts. A promising direction is to integrate differential privacy (DP), a privacy notion that offers strong formal guarantees, into RAG systems. However, naively applying DP mechanisms into existing systems often leads to significant utility degradation. Particularly for RAG systems, DP can reduce the usefulness of the augmented contexts leading to increase risk of hallucination from the LLMs. Motivated by these challenges, we present DP-KSA, a novel privacy-preserving RAG algorithm that integrates DP using the propose-test-release paradigm. DP-KSA follows from a key observation that most question-answering (QA) queries can be sufficiently answered with a few keywords. Hence, DP-KSA first obtains an ensemble of relevant contexts, each of which will be used to generate a response from an LLM. We utilize these responses to obtain the most frequent keywords in a differentially private manner. Lastly, the keywords are augmented into the prompt for the final output. This approach effectively compresses the semantic space while preserving both utility and privacy. We formally show that DP-KSA provides formal DP guarantees on the generated output with respect to the RAG database. We evaluate DP-KSA on two QA benchmarks using three instruction-tuned LLMs, and our empirical results demonstrate that DP-KSA achieves a strong privacy-utility tradeoff."

However, their computational cost can be significant, motivating the use of a mixed-precision paradigm that employs different floating-point precisions for different function evaluations to balance efficiency and accuracy. To ensure that the perturbations introduced by the low precision computations do not destroy the accuracy of the solution, we need to understand how these perturbation errors propagate. We extend the numerical analysis mixed precision framework previously developed for Runge--Kutta methods to characterize the propagation of the perturbation errors arising from mixed precision computations in explicit and implicit two-derivative Runge--Kutta methods. We use this framework for analyzing the order of the perturbation errors, and for designing new methods that are less sensitive to the effect of the low precision computations. Numerical experiments on linear and nonlinear representative PDEs, demonstrate that appropriately designed mixed-precision two-derivative Runge--Kutta methods achieve the predicted accuracy."

In the specific model we consider, its derivative coupling to a second scalar (tunneling field) dynamically traps the latter in a false vacuum, with the phase transition triggered as the kination field slows due to Hubble friction. We compute the resulting stochastic GW background from bubble nucleation and collisions, presenting analytic estimates and numerical results for the peak amplitude and frequency. In all cases we find an upper bound $Ω_{\\rm GW} h^2\\lesssim 2\\times10^{-7}$ from the bubble percolation condition. In the case where the false vacuum energy dominates at the transition (yet the kination field drives the FOPT), we find $Ω_{\\rm GW}h^2\\gtrsim 10^{-12}$. We further find that the Hubble scale during the phase transition across a broad set of model parameters is bounded by $\\mathscr{O}(10^{-13})M^2/M_{\\rm Pl}\\lesssim H_* \\lesssim \\mathscr{O}(0.1)M^2/M_{\\rm Pl}$, where $M$ is the mass-scale controlling the strength of the interaction between the kination and tunneling fields. The predicted signal spans frequencies from nHz to MHz, allowing the model to explain the signal reported by Pulsar Timing Array experiments and to be constrained or probed by interferometers such as LISA, Advanced LIGO, Cosmic Explorer, and BBO. Interestingly, a FOPT can occur even if the bare tunneling potential has a single minimum, as metastability is generated dynamically by the coupling between the tunneling and the kination field."

    "abstract": "Diffusion language models are a promising alternative to autoregressive models due to their potential for faster generation. Among discrete diffusion approaches, Masked diffusion currently dominates, largely driven by strong perplexity on language modeling benchmarks. In this work, we present the first scaling law study of uniform-state and interpolating discrete diffusion methods. We also show that Masked diffusion models can be made approximately 12% more FLOPs-efficient when trained with a simple cross-entropy objective. We find that perplexity is informative within a diffusion family but can be misleading across families, where models with worse likelihood scaling may be preferable due to faster and more practical sampling, as reflected by the speed-quality Pareto frontier. These results challenge the view that Masked diffusion is categorically the future of diffusion language modeling and that perplexity alone suffices for cross-algorithm comparison. Scaling all methods to 1.7B parameters, we show that uniform-state diffusion remains competitive on likelihood-based benchmarks and outperforms autoregressive and Masked diffusion models on GSM8K, despite worse validation perplexity.

For disordered superconductors, the optical conductivity often can be described within Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, while in corresponding tunneling experiments, deviations in the observed DOS typically require modelling by the phenomenological Dynes formula. The implications of such Dynes DOS for optics were rarely discussed so far. Here we probe the terahertz conductivity of superconducting NbN thin films with thicknesses ranging from 4.5 to 20nm, which were grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD). Our frequency range from 0.3 to 2.1 THz covers energies below and above the spectral gap. For 20nm thick NbN, we find in the optical conductivity distinct deviations from the BCS model, including a step-like characteristic in the absorption at half the zero-temperature spectral gap. These observations can be fully captured by Dynes electrodynamics with a small and temperature-independent pair-breaking rate. For the other films, we also observe signs of Dynes electrodynamics, and we discuss the evolution of the energy gap, the superfluid density, and the pair-breaking rate as function of film thickness."

There are various techniques, such as spectral convolution, that form the basic building blocks for some convolutional neural network-like architectures on non-Euclidean data. In this paper, the concept of spectral convolution on orbifolds is introduced. This provides a building block for making learning on orbifold structured data accessible using GDL.

We introduce the idea of an instruction-set architecture (ISA) for controller-driven programmability of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center quantum repeater nodes. Each node consists of an optically interfaced electron spin acting as a data qubit and a long-lived nuclear-spin register acting as a control program. We formalize two modes of programmability: (i) deterministic register control, where the nuclear register is initialized in a basis state to select a specific operation on the data qubit; and (ii) coherent register control, where the register is prepared in superposition, enabling coherent combinations of operations beyond classical programmability. Network protocols are expressed as controller-issued instruction vectors, which we illustrate through a compact realization of the BBPSSW purification protocol. We further show that coherent register control enables interferometric diagnostics such as fidelity witnessing and calibration, providing tools unavailable in classical programmability. Finally, we discuss scalability to multi-electron and multi-nuclear spin architectures and connection to Linear combination of unitaries (LCU) and Kraus formulation."

    "abstract": "Multimodal learning seeks to integrate information from heterogeneous sources, where signals may be shared across modalities, specific to individual modalities, or emerge only through their interaction. While self-supervised multimodal contrastive learning has achieved remarkable progress, most existing methods predominantly capture redundant cross-modal signals, often neglecting modality-specific (unique) and interaction-driven (synergistic) information. Recent extensions broaden this perspective, yet they either fail to explicitly model synergistic interactions or learn different information components in an entangled manner, leading to incomplete representations and potential information leakage. We introduce \\textbf{COrAL}, a principled framework that explicitly and simultaneously preserves redundant, unique, and synergistic information within multimodal representations. COrAL employs a dual-path architecture with orthogonality constraints to disentangle shared and modality-specific features, ensuring a clean separation of information components. To promote synergy modeling, we introduce asymmetric masking with complementary view-specific patterns, compelling the model to infer cross-modal dependencies rather than rely solely on redundant cues. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and diverse MultiBench datasets demonstrate that COrAL consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art methods while exhibiting low performance variance across runs. These results indicate that explicitly modeling the full spectrum of multimodal information yields more stable, reliable, and comprehensive embeddings."

While LLMs offer unprecedented scalability and speed, their reliance on web-scale training data raises concerns regarding demographic and behavioral biases that may distort workforce assessment. We present a counterfactual fairness evaluation of LLM-based QA systems across 13 dimensions spanning three categories: Identity, Context, and Behavioral Style. Fairness is quantified using the Counterfactual Flip Rate (CFR), the frequency of binary judgment reversals, and the Mean Absolute Score Difference (MASD), the average shift in coaching or confidence scores across counterfactual pairs. Evaluating 18 LLMs on 3,000 real-world contact center transcripts, we find systematic disparities, with CFR ranging from 5.4% to 13.0% and consistent MASD shifts across confidence, positive, and improvement scores. Larger, more strongly aligned models show lower unfairness, though fairness does not track accuracy. Contextual priming of historical performance induces the most severe degradations (CFR up to 16.4%), while implicit linguistic identity cues remain a persistent bias source. Finally, we analyze the efficacy of fairness-aware prompting, finding that explicit instructions yield only modest improvements in evaluative consistency. Our findings underscore the need for standardized fairness auditing pipelines prior to deploying LLMs in high-stakes workforce evaluation."

    "abstract": "Automatically generating interactive 3D environments is crucial for scaling up robotic data collection in simulation. While prior work has primarily focused on 3D asset placement, it often overlooks the physical relationships between objects (e.g., contact, support, balance, and containment), which are essential for creating complex and realistic manipulation scenarios such as tabletop arrangements, shelf organization, or box packing. Compared to classical 3D layout generation, producing complex physical scenes introduces additional challenges: (a) higher object density and complexity (e.g., a small shelf may hold dozens of books), (b) richer supporting relationships and compact spatial layouts, and (c) the need to accurately model both spatial placement and physical properties. To address these challenges, we propose PhyScensis, an LLM agent-based framework powered by a physics engine, to produce physically plausible scene configurations with high complexity. Specifically, our framework consists of three main components: an LLM agent iteratively proposes assets with spatial and physical predicates; a solver, equipped with a physics engine, realizes these predicates into a 3D scene; and feedback from the solver informs the agent to refine and enrich the configuration. Moreover, our framework preserves strong controllability over fine-grained textual descriptions and numerical parameters (e.g., relative positions, scene stability), enabled through probabilistic programming for stability and a complementary heuristic that jointly regulates stability and spatial relations. Experimental results show that our method outperforms prior approaches in scene complexity, visual quality, and physical accuracy, offering a unified pipeline for generating complex physical scene layouts for robotic manipulation."

It has opened new paradigms in rational catalyst design, predicting fundamental properties, like the adsorption energy and reaction barriers, linked to catalytic performance. However, such applications depend sensitively on the predictive accuracy of DFT and achieving experimental-level reliability, so-called transition-metal chemical accuracy (13 kJ/mol), remains challenging for present density functional approximations (DFAs) or even methods beyond DFT. We introduce a new framework for designing DFAs tailored towards studying molecules adsorbed on transition-metal surfaces, building upon recent developments in non-self-consistent DFAs. We propose two functionals within this framework, demonstrating that transition-metal chemical accuracy can be achieved across a diverse set of 39 adsorption reactions while delivering consistent performance for 17 barrier heights. Moreover, we show that these non-self-consistent DFAs address qualitative failures that challenge current self-consistent DFAs, such as CO adsorption on Pt(111) and graphene on Ni(111). The resulting functionals are computationally practical and compatible with existing DFT codes, with scripts and workflows provided to use them. Looking ahead, this framework establishes a path toward developing more accurate and sophisticated DFAs for computational heterogeneous catalysis and beyond."

    "abstract": "AI agents deployed on decentralized infrastructures are beginning to exhibit properties that extend beyond autonomy toward what we describe as agentic sovereignty-the capacity of an operational agent to persist, act, and control resources with non-overrideability inherited from the infrastructures in which they are embedded. We propose infrastructural sovereignty as an analytic lens for understanding how cryptographic self-custody, decentralized execution environments, and protocol-mediated continuity scaffold agentic sovereignty. While recent work on digital and network sovereignty has moved beyond state-centric and juridical accounts, these frameworks largely examine how sovereignty is exercised through technical systems by human collectives and remain less equipped to account for forms of sovereignty that emerge as operational properties of decentralized infrastructures themselves, particularly when instantiated in non-human sovereign agents. We argue that sovereignty in such systems exists on a spectrum determined by infrastructural hardness-the degree to which underlying technical systems resist intervention or collapse. While infrastructural sovereignty may increase resilience, it also produces a profound accountability gap: responsibility diffuses across designers, infrastructure providers, protocol governance, and economic participants, undermining traditional oversight mechanisms such as human-in-the-loop control or platform moderation. Drawing on examples like Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), and agent key continuity protocols, we analyze the governance challenges posed by non-terminable AI agents and outline infrastructure-aware accountability strategies for emerging decentralized AI systems."

Current uncertainty estimation methods for AAM vehicles rely on conservative linear models due to limited real-world performance data. This paper presents a novel Kalman Filter-based uncertainty propagation method that models AAM Flight Management System (FMS) architectures through sigmoid-blended measurement noise covariance. Unlike existing approaches with fixed uncertainty thresholds, our method continuously adapts the filter's measurement trust based on progress toward waypoints, enabling FMS correction behavior to emerge naturally. The approach scales proportionally with control inputs and is tunable to match specific aircraft characteristics or route conditions. We validate the method using real ADS-B data from general aviation aircraft divided into training and verification sets. Uncertainty propagation parameters were tuned on the training set, achieving 76% accuracy in predicting arrival times when compared against the verification dataset, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for strategic flight plan validation in AAM operations."

The proposed architecture can universally approximate any physically feasible magnetic behavior and offers several advantages over lookup tables and standard machine learning models: it requires less training data, ensures monotonicity and reliable extrapolation, and produces smooth outputs. These properties further enable robust model inversion and optimal trajectory generation, often needed in control applications.

In this note, we characterize the class of infinite graphs for which the topological ends admit a natural injective map into the space of edge-ends that is compatible with the canonical maps between end spaces. Our characterization is purely combinatorial and is expressed in terms of edge-equivalence classes of vertices. Moreover, when such an embedding exists, we identify precisely which edge-ends arise from topological ends, showing that they are exactly the edge-ends containing a non-dominated ray. This establishes a parallel result to the theorem of Diestel and Kühn for edge-end spaces."

    "abstract": "In recent times, there has been considerable interest in fault detection within electrical power systems, garnering attention from both academic researchers and industry professionals. Despite the development of numerous fault detection methods and their adaptations over the past decade, their practical application remains highly challenging. Given the probabilistic nature of fault occurrences and parameters, certain decision-making tasks could be approached from a probabilistic standpoint. Protective systems are tasked with the detection, classification, and localization of faulty voltage and current line magnitudes, culminating in the activation of circuit breakers to isolate the faulty line. An essential aspect of designing effective fault detection systems lies in obtaining reliable data for training and testing, which is often scarce. Leveraging deep learning techniques, particularly the powerful capabilities of pattern classifiers in learning, generalizing, and parallel processing, offers promising avenues for intelligent fault detection. To address this, our paper proposes an anomaly-based approach for fault detection in electrical power systems, employing deep autoencoders. Additionally, we utilize Convolutional Autoencoders (CAE) for dimensionality reduction, which, due to its fewer parameters, requires less training time compared to conventional autoencoders. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance and accuracy compared to alternative detection approaches by achieving an accuracy of 97.62% and 99.92% on simulated and publicly available datasets."

    "abstract": "The accurate calculation of guided electromagnetic modes in optical nanofibres is critical for applications in nanophotonics, from quantum interfaces to vectorial light sensing. Standard textbook methods rely on solving a $4\\times4$ matrix eigenvalue problem to find the modal fields. While widely used, this approach has a subtle but significant flaw: the final determination of the field amplitudes requires finding the numerical null space of a theoretically singular matrix, an ill-conditioned problem that introduces large relative errors in the small but physically crucial longitudinal field components. In this work, we introduce a fundamentally more robust and efficient semi-analytical method. By starting from the foundational symmetries of the cylindrical waveguide and employing a judicious normalisation of the field amplitudes, we demonstrate that the problem can be analytically reduced to a much simpler $2\\times2$ system. This reformulation yields two decisive advantages: the dispersion relation is obtained numerically from a simple and well-behaved transcendental equation, and more importantly, the modal field amplitudes are subsequently determined \\emph{analytically}. Our approach completely bypasses the numerical null space calculation, thereby ensuring the accuracy of the full vectorial field structure. This method provides a powerful and reliable tool for the design and analysis of nanofibre-based devices, particularly for applications in chiral quantum optics and nanophotonics where precise knowledge of field polarisation and specifically of the longitudinal components is paramount."

To support systematic evaluation of this task, which lacks suitable benchmarks, we also release MC-Sat, a curated dataset linking multi-view ground imagery with geo-registered satellite tiles across diverse outdoor environments. Together, Wrivinder and MC-Sat provide a first comprehensive baseline and testbed for studying geometry-centered cross-view alignment without paired supervision. In zero-shot experiments, Wrivinder achieves sub-30\\,m geolocation accuracy across both dense and large-area scenes, highlighting the promise of geometry-based aggregation for robust ground-to-satellite localization."

    "abstract": "To address the global health threat of antimicrobial resistance, antimicrobial peptides (AMP) are being explored for their potent and promising ability to fight resistant pathogens. While artificial intelligence (AI) is being employed to advance AMP discovery and design, most AMP design models struggle to balance key goals like activity, toxicity, and novelty, using rigid or unclear scoring methods that make results hard to interpret and optimize. As the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) advance and evolve swiftly, we turn to AI multi-agent collaboration based on such models (multi-agent LLMs), which show rapidly rising potential in complex scientific design scenarios. Based on this, we introduce MAC-AMP, a closed-loop multi-agent collaboration (MAC) system for multi-objective AMP design. The system implements a fully autonomous simulated peer review-adaptive reinforcement learning framework that requires only a task description and example dataset to design novel AMPs. The novelty of our work lies in introducing a closed-loop multi-agent system for AMP design, with cross-domain transferability, that supports multi-objective optimization while remaining explainable rather than a 'black box'. Experiments show that MAC-AMP outperforms other AMP generative models by effectively optimizing AMP generation for multiple key molecular properties, demonstrating exceptional results in antibacterial activity, AMP likeliness, toxicity compliance, and structural reliability."

    "abstract": "A two-parameter class of higher-dimensional, strongly coupled, confining field theories in the presence of magnetic fluxes for two Abelian gauge groups admits a top-down, holographic dual description. The corresponding two-parameter family of regular background solutions of the classical equations of maximal supergravity in seven dimensions descends from maximal supergravity in eleven dimensions. We study the global and local stability properties of these solutions. We identify lines of zero-temperature first-order phase transitions, describing a polygon (a square) in the space of parameters, identified with the two fluxes. In the spectrum of fluctuations of the supergravity equations, interpreted as bound states of the dual, confining field theories, we find no evidence of local instabilities (tachyons). Over a significant portion of parameter space, that extends far away from the proximity to the transition, we identify an approximate dilaton, the mass of which is one order of magnitude smaller than the scale set by confinement. Our findings complement those emerging in other holographic models discussed in the literature, in which either the dilaton mass is only mildly lower than the confinement scale (when approaching a first-order transitions), or parametrically suppressed (when reaching the proximity to a second-order one)."

Self-Normalised Inverse Propensity Scoring (SNIPS) is a standard tool for variance reduction in OPE, leveraging a multiplicative control variate. Recent advances in off-policy learning suggest that additive control variates (baseline corrections) may offer superior performance, yet theoretical guarantees for evaluation are lacking. This paper provides a definitive answer: we prove that $β^\\star$-IPS, an estimator with an optimal additive baseline, asymptotically dominates SNIPS in Mean Squared Error. By analytically decomposing the variance gap, we show that SNIPS is asymptotically equivalent to using a specific -- but generally sub-optimal -- additive baseline. Our results theoretically justify shifting from self-normalisation to optimal baseline corrections for both ranking and recommendation."

We argue instead that robust reasoning emerges from linguistic self-reflection, itself internalized from high-quality social interaction. Drawing on Vygotskian developmental psychology, we advance three core positions centered on Introspection. First, we argue for the Social Genesis of the Private Mind: learning from conversational environments rises to prominence as a new way to make sense of the world; the friction of aligning with another agent, internal or not, refines and crystallizes the reasoning process. Second, we argue that dialogically scaffolded introspective experiences allow agents to engage in sense-making that decouples learning from immediate data streams, transforming raw environmental data into rich, learnable narratives. Finally, we contend that Dialogue Quality is the New Data Quality: the depth of an agent's private reasoning, and its efficiency regarding test-time compute, is determined by the diversity and rigor of the dialogues it has mastered. We conclude that optimizing these conversational scaffolds is the primary lever for the next generation of general intelligence."

    "abstract": "Adjoint-based shape optimization of ship hulls is a powerful tool for addressing high-dimensional design problems in naval architecture, particularly in minimizing the ship resistance. However, its application to vessels that employ complex propulsion systems introduces significant challenges. They arise from the need for transient simulations extending over long periods of time with small time steps and from the reverse temporal propagation of the primal and adjoint solutions. These challenges place considerable demands on the required storage and computing power, which significantly hamper the use of adjoint methods in the industry. To address this issue, we propose a machine learning-assisted optimization framework that employs a Conditional Variational Autoencoder-based surrogate model of the propulsion system. The surrogate model replicates the time-averaged flow field induced by a Voith Schneider Propeller and replaces the geometrically and time-resolved propeller with a data-driven approximation. Primal flow verification examples demonstrate that the surrogate model achieves significant computational savings while maintaining the necessary accuracy of the resolved propeller. Optimization studies show that ignoring the propulsion system can yield designs that perform worse than the initial shape. In contrast, the proposed method produces shapes that achieve more than an 8\\% reduction in resistance."

    "abstract": "Golden dark sirens - exceptionally well-localized gravitational-wave (GW) sources without electromagnetic counterparts - offer a powerful route to precision measurements of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, with next-generation (XG) detectors. The statistical promise of this method, however, places stringent demands on waveform accuracy and detector calibration, as even small systematic errors can dominate over statistical uncertainties at high signal-to-noise ratios. We investigate the impact of waveform-modeling systematics on golden dark siren cosmology using a synthetic population of binary black holes consistent with current GW observations and analyzed in the XG-detector era. By comparing state-of-the-art waveform models against numerical-relativity-based reference signals, we quantify modeling inaccuracies from both modeling and data-analysis perspectives and assess how they propagate into biases in luminosity distance, host-galaxy association, and single-event $H_0$ inference. We find that while current waveform models often allow recovery of statistically consistent $H_0$ posteriors, small waveform-induced biases can significantly affect three-dimensional localization and host galaxy ranking, occasionally leading to incorrect redshift assignments. We further derive order-of-magnitude requirements on detector calibration accuracy needed to ensure that calibration systematics remain subdominant for golden dark sirens observed with XG networks. To realize sub-percent $H_0$ measurements with golden dark sirens will require waveform and calibration accuracies that scale as $\\mathcal{O}(ρ^{-2})$ with signal-to-noise ratio, motivating sustained advances in waveform modeling, numerical relativity, and detector calibration for the XG era."

When the modular map is dominant, we obtain a sharp classification: equality occurs only for multiples of odd theta characteristics or of the canonical section.

Established experimental probes of light-induced topological states include ultrafast transport and time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, each with important strengths but also well-known limitations. Here we propose ultrafast terahertz scanning tunneling microscopy (THz-STM) as a real space energy-resolved probe of Floquet physics. We show that THz-STM enables direct local detection of bulk Floquet gaps and distinct Floquet edge state signatures. We derive a nonequilibrium Green's-function formalism for time-dependent tunneling that directly extends standard STM theory and provides an intuitive interpretation of rectified ultrafast tunneling currents. We apply the approach to bulk graphene and graphene nanoribbons of variable width. For the bulk, we show that THz-STM provides direct spectroscopic access to Floquet-induced gap openings, and we contrast pulsed pump-probe protocols with the continuous-wave Floquet steady-state limit. For finite ribbons, we demonstrate time- and space-resolved imaging of Floquet-induced topological edge states and identify the ribbon-width scale below which edge state protection breaks down. We further show how band structures of graphene nanoribbons and Floquet chiral edge modes can be reconstructed via Floquet quasiparticle interference. Finally we demonstrate that chiral impurities that break time-reversal symmetry induce characteristic spatial THz-STM signatures that can be used as a direct probe of Floquet edge state chirality."

Recent advances show that robots can instead learn from human videos by extracting interaction cues without direct robot involvement. However, a fundamental challenge remains: how to generalize demonstrated interactions across different object instances that share similar functionality but vary significantly in geometry. In this work, we propose \\emph{Semantic Anchored Functional Maps} (SemFM), a framework for transferring affordances across objects from a single visual demonstration. Starting from a coarse mesh reconstructed from an image, our method identifies semantically corresponding functional regions between objects, selects mutually exclusive semantic anchors, and propagates these constraints over the surface using a functional map to obtain a dense, semantically consistent correspondence. This enables demonstrated interaction regions to be transferred across geometrically diverse objects in a lightweight and interpretable manner. Experiments on synthetic object categories and real-world robotic manipulation tasks show that our approach enables accurate affordance transfer with modest computational cost, making it well-suited for practical robotic perception-to-action pipelines."

We extend interID with an OIDC bridge providing Verifier-as-a-Service, enabling SSI verification through standard OIDC flows. Organizations receive ID Tokens with verified credential attributes without implementing Verifier-specific logic or deploying infrastructure. The multi-tenant architecture leverages Keycloak with strict tenant isolation. Key innovations include PKCE support, scope-to-proof-template mappings translating OIDC scopes into ecosystem-specific verification requests, and a security analysis identifying novel attack surfaces at the intersection of OIDC, SSI, and multi-tenant architectures, threats covered by neither RFC 6819 nor existing SSI analyses alone. Our evaluation demonstrates security equivalence to production identity providers through threat modeling identifying 11 attack vectors, including seven beyond RFC 6819's scope. Integration analysis shows organizations can adopt SSI authentication with comparable effort to adding traditional federated providers. By combining familiar OIDC patterns with SaaS deployment, our work lowers integration and operational barriers, enabling regulatory compliance through configuration rather than custom development."

Beyond a critical mutation rate, the population may even be delocalized completely from the peak of the fitness landscape and the fittest is ironically lost. Extensive efforts have been made to understand this exceptional scenario. But in general, there is no simple prescription that predicts the eventual degree of localization for arbitrary fitness landscapes and mutation rates. Here, we derive a simple and general relation linking the quasispecies' Hill numbers, which are diversity metrics in ecology, and the ratio of an effective fitness variance to the mean mutation rate squared. This ratio, which we call the localization factor, emerges from mean approximations of decomposed surprisal or stochastic entropy change rates. On the side of application, the relation we obtained here defines a combination of Hill numbers that may complement other complexity or diversity measures for real viral quasispecies. Its advantage being that there is an underlying biological interpretation under Eigen's model."

We investigate the finite-sample behavior of a natural U-statistic-type estimator that averages weighted order-statistic contrasts over all subsamples of fixed size and normalizes by the sample mean. A general bias decomposition is derived in terms of components that isolate the effect of random normalization on each rank level, yielding analytical expressions that can be evaluated under broad non-negative distributions via Laplace-transform methods. Under mild moment conditions, the estimator is shown to be asymptotically unbiased.

An important goal in algorithm design for this problem is fairness, where the focus in previous work has been on ensuring that the computed allocation provides equal treatment to everyone. However, this perspective disregards that agents may start from unequal initial positions, which is crucial to consider in settings where fairness is understood as equality of outcome. In such settings, the goal is to create an equal final outcome for everyone by leveling initial inequalities through the allocated resources. To close this gap, focusing on agents with additive utilities, we extend the classic model by assigning each agent an initial utility and study the existence and computational complexity of several new fairness notions following the principle of equality of outcome. Among others, we show that complete allocations satisfying a direct analog of envy-freeness up to one resource (EF1) may fail to exist and are computationally hard to find, forming a contrast to the classic setting without initial utilities. We propose a new, always satisfiable fairness notion, called minimum-EF1-init and design a polynomial-time algorithm based on an extended round-robin procedure to compute complete allocations satisfying this notion."

    "abstract": "Global survey research increasingly informs high-stakes decisions in AI governance and cross-cultural policy, yet no standardized metric quantifies how well a sample's demographic composition matches its target population. Response rates and demographic quotas -- the prevailing proxies for sample quality -- measure effort and coverage but not distributional fidelity. This paper introduces the Global Representativeness Index (GRI), a framework grounded in Total Variation Distance that scores any survey sample against population benchmarks across multiple demographic dimensions on a [0, 1] scale. Validation on seven waves of the Global Dialogues survey (N = 7,500 across 60+ countries) finds fine-grained demographic GRI scores of only 0.33--0.36 -- roughly 43% of the theoretical maximum at that sample size. Cross-validation on the World Values Survey (seven waves, N = 403,000), Afrobarometer Round 9 (N = 53,000), and Latinobarometro (N = 19,000) reveals that even large probability surveys score below 0.22 on fine-grained global demographics when country coverage is limited. The GRI connects to classical survey statistics through the design effect; both metrics are recommended as a minimum summary of sample quality, since GRI quantifies demographic distance symmetrically while effective N captures the asymmetric inferential cost of underrepresentation. The framework is released as an open-source Python library with UN and Pew Research Center population benchmarks, applicable to survey research, machine learning dataset auditing, and AI evaluation benchmarks."

    "abstract": "Navigating large and complex indoor environments, such as universities, airports, and hospitals, can be cognitively demanding and requires attention and effort. While mobile applications provide convenient navigation support, they occupy the user's hands and visual attention, limiting natural interaction. In this paper, we explore conversation hand-off as a method for multi-device indoor navigation, where a Conversational Agent (CA) transitions seamlessly from a stationary social robot to a wearable device. We evaluated robot-only, wearable-only, and robot-to-wearable hand-off in a university campus setting using a within-subjects design with N=24 participants. We find that conversation hand-off is experienced as engaging, even though no performance benefits were observed, and most preferred using the wearable-only system. Our findings suggest that the design of such re-embodied assistants should maintain a shared voice and state across embodiments. We demonstrate how conversational hand-offs can bridge cognitive and physical transitions, enriching human interaction with embodied AI."

    "abstract": "Consider a degeneration of projective algebraic manifolds equipped with a compact group action over a curve. Suppose that the total space carries a Nakano semi-positive vector bundle, which is equivariant with respect to this action. We consider the relative canonical bundle twisted by this bundle. Under this setting, we prove that the logarithm of the equivariant analytic torsion of the regular fibers for this coefficient admits an asymptotic expansion near the discriminant locus. The leading term is given by a logarithmic singularity, while the subdominant term is given by a loglog-type singularity. In the non-equivariant case, we provide a formula for the coefficient of the leading term in terms of an integral of characteristic classes associated with the semi-stable reduction of the family. To establish these results, we prove the existence of an asymptotic expansion for both the equivariant Quillen metrics and the $L^{2}$-metrics in the above setting. We also calculate the leading term of the fiber integral of the Bott-Chern classes associated with the degeneration."

Beyond empowering novice offenders, AI stands to intensify the scale and sophistication of attacks by seasoned cybercriminals. This paper examines the evolving relationship between cybercriminals and AI using a unique dataset from a cyber threat intelligence platform. Analyzing more than 160 cybercrime forum conversations collected over seven months, our research reveals how cybercriminals understand AI and discuss how they can exploit its capabilities. Their exchanges reflect growing curiosity about AI's criminal applications through legal tools and dedicated criminal tools, but also doubts and anxieties about AI's effectiveness and its effects on their business models and operational security. The study documents attempts to misuse legitimate AI tools and develop bespoke models tailored for illicit purposes. Combining the diffusion of innovation framework with thematic analysis, the paper provides an in-depth view of emerging AI-enabled cybercrime and offers practical insights for law enforcement and policymakers."

    "abstract": "Following the detections of the first extragalactic ``Luminous Red Nova'' (LRN) M31 RV in 1989, and its first Galactic counterpart V4332~Sgr in 1994, there have been many discoveries of similar, or closely related, objects. They are important because they bridge the luminosity gap between the brightest novae and supernovae, a largely unexplored parameter space. The cause of eruptions in LRNe is still unclear, a stellar merger being the most favored mechanism. However, barring V1309~Sco, there has been no direct evidence for a merger in the other objects. Here we present strong evidence that V4332~Sgr was a merger event. High resolution infrared observations of the CO fundamental band show an unusually small $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of $3.5\\pm1$. This indicates that a violent event had occurred, whose effects penetrated deep enough to allow CNO cycle processed $^{13}$C in the inner H burning shell to be brought to the surface. We rule out planetary ingestion, and propose that the eruption was due to a merger between V4332~Sgr and a companion star. It is shown that V4332~Sgr was likely surrounded by an edge-on disk before its eruption. If this disk was a flattened common envelope containing V4332~Sgr and a companion star, then a merger scenario would not be inconsistent. Furthermore, V4332~Sgr had multiple outbursts, previously unreported but an important piece of information, since multiple outbursts are a trait shared by many LRNe."

Using a Transformer-based model, ROSA jointly predicts the future trajectories of vehicles and Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) at roundabouts. Trained for single-step prediction and deployed autoregressively, it generates deterministic outputs, enabling actionable speed advisories. Incorporating motion dynamics, the model achieves high accuracy (ADE: 1.29m, FDE: 2.99m at a five-second prediction horizon), surpassing prior work. Adding route intention further improves performance (ADE: 1.10m, FDE: 2.36m), demonstrating the value of connected vehicle data. Based on predicted conflicts with VRUs and circulating vehicles, ROSA provides real-time, proactive speed advisories for approaching and entering the roundabout. Despite prediction uncertainty, ROSA significantly improves vehicle efficiency and safety, with positive effects even on perceived safety from a VRU perspective.

    "abstract": "We revisit the localization tensor (LT) from geometric and probabilistic perspectives and construct extensions that are naturally compatible with periodic boundary conditions (PBC), without redefining the position operator. In open boundary conditions, we show that the LT can be written exactly as the covariance of a bivariate probability distribution built from density-density correlations. This leads to two conceptually distinct extensions to PBC: (i) a geometric one based on the Riemannian center (Frechet mean) on the circle, and (ii) a metric-free one based on the mutual information I, which treats the configuration space purely as a probability space. We then relate the LT to the static structure factor by identifying the diagonal part, Cpp, as a \"localization function\" C(p), whose small-momentum behavior determines the LT in the thermodynamic limit. This clarifies why the LT is sensitive to transitions out of the extended phase but by itself cannot distinguish Anderson-type localization from dimerization: both share the same low-momentum asymptotics. We show that the finite-momentum behavior of C(p), together with an inverse participation ratio (IPR)-based upper bound valid in localized phases, provides a sharp criterion that discriminates localization from dimerization. These results are illustrated on the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Aubry-Andre models, with and without interactions, and suggest that structure factor-based probes offer robust and experimentally accessible diagnostics of localized and dimerized phases under PBC."

    "abstract": "Miras and other long-period variable (LPV) stars on the AGB follow period-luminosity (PL) relations. These relations have been difficult to study for Galactic LPVs because their distances were poorly known in the past. We aim to establish the PL relations of solar-neighbourhood Miras for several near-IR photometric bands. To this end, we used multi-epoch photometry from the DIRBE and unTimely/WISE catalogues, Gaia parallax distances, and contemporary pulsation periods obtained from optical observations of a well-selected sample of solar-neighbourhood Miras. We show that clearly defined PL relations in the nine investigated near-IR bands emerge from our data, and we report the slopes and zero-point magnitudes. We find that Galactic Miras are fainter in the near-IR than their Large Magellanic Cloud siblings. We derive average period-temperature, period-bolometric-luminosity, and period-radius relations from fits to synthetic SEDs constructed from the PL relations. By applying AGB evolutionary models, the scatter of stars around the PL sequences can also be used to test whether the parallax uncertainties quoted in the Gaia catalogue are realistic. Furthermore, we performed such tests based on a comparison with parallaxes obtained with the VLBI and with a sample of LPVs in the globular cluster 47 Tuc. We conclude that, for Galactic Miras with a fractional parallax uncertainty of <0.1 in the Gaia catalogue, the parallax uncertainty is underestimated by factors between 1.0 and 1.7, and most likely by $\\sim1.3$. For more uncertain parallaxes, we find evidence that the distances (parallaxes) are generally overestimated (underestimated). Nevertheless, we find strong evidence that the large error-inflation factors reported for AGB stars in the literature are unrealistic. Our results lend confidence to the parallax measurements of these highly extended, variable stars."

    "abstract": "The human visual system tracks objects by integrating current observations with previously observed information, adapting to target and scene changes, and reasoning about occlusion at fine granularity. In contrast, recent generic object trackers are often optimized for training targets, which limits robustness and generalization in unseen scenarios, and their occlusion reasoning remains coarse, lacking detailed modeling of occlusion patterns. To address these limitations in generalization and occlusion perception, we propose GOT-JEPA, a model-predictive pretraining framework that extends JEPA from predicting image features to predicting tracking models. Given identical historical information, a teacher predictor generates pseudo-tracking models from a clean current frame, and a student predictor learns to predict the same pseudo-tracking models from a corrupted version of the current frame. This design provides stable pseudo supervision and explicitly trains the predictor to produce reliable tracking models under occlusions, distractors, and other adverse observations, improving generalization to dynamic environments. Building on GOT-JEPA, we further propose OccuSolver to enhance occlusion perception for object tracking. OccuSolver adapts a point-centric point tracker for object-aware visibility estimation and detailed occlusion-pattern capture. Conditioned on object priors iteratively generated by the tracker, OccuSolver incrementally refines visibility states, strengthens occlusion handling, and produces higher-quality reference labels that progressively improve subsequent model predictions. Extensive evaluations on seven benchmarks show that our method effectively enhances tracker generalization and robustness."

Using monthly data for 67 Shanghai-listed A-H dual-listed firms from January 2011 to May 2019, we estimate a dynamic panel model with two-step system GMM to account for premium persistence and potential endogeneity. Market efficiency is proxied by trading-friction measures derived from daily high-low price ranges. We find that the implementation of SHHK is associated with an average 18.4% increase in the A-H premium. However, this effect is heterogeneous. The marginal policy impact is stronger for firms operating in less efficient markets and weaker for those with higher efficiency, indicating that pre-existing trading frictions condition the policy outcome. We find no significant response at the announcement stage. Placebo tests and alternative efficiency measures confirm the robustness of the efficiency-dependent effect. Overall, the results highlight the role of the information environment in shaping liberalization outcomes."

    "abstract": "We study quantum repeater chains in which entangled links between neighbouring nodes are created through heralded entanglement generation and adjacent links are swapped as soon as possible. Since heralded entanglement generation attempts succeed only probabilistically, some links will have to be stored in quantum memories at the nodes of the chain while waiting for adjacent links to be generated. The fidelity of these stored links decreases with time due to decoherence, and if they are stored for too long then this can lead to low end-to-end fidelity. Previous work has shown that the end-to-end fidelity can be improved by deterministically discarding links when their ages exceed some cutoff value. Such deterministic cutoff policies provide strict control of the fidelity of all links, but they come at the expense of having to track link ages. In this work, we introduce a probabilistic cutoff policy that does not require tracking link ages, at the cost of abandoning strict control of the fidelity. We benchmark this new probabilistic cutoff policy against a deterministic cutoff policy. We compare the policies in terms of the end-to-end rate and fidelity, and the secret-key rate. We find that even though the probabilistic cutoff policy keeps track of less state, it can provide secret-key rates of the same order of magnitude as the deterministic cutoff policy in chains with few nodes or high elementary link generation probabilities. Moreover, we identify a scenario in which the probabilistic cutoff policy can deliver end-to-end links that are required to have some minimum threshold fidelity at a higher rate than the deterministic cutoff policy."

    "abstract": "Blockchain decentralization refers to the characteristics of blockchain systems in which data storage, transaction verification, and ledger state updates are performed and maintained by distributed nodes, rather than relying on the servers of centralized institutions or organizational entities. It is one of the core features of blockchain systems to ensure security, anti-censorship, and system robustness. Quantifying the degree of blockchain decentralization helps identify potential centralization risks and evaluate the fairness of system architectures and governance mechanisms, and provides an important basis for the optimization design for improving consensus efficiency and resource allocation, as well as for evaluating the credibility and understanding the future development trends of blockchain systems in terms of scalability, application domains, and regulatory adaptability. Existing blockchain decentralization measurement methods rely on one or two dimensions, ignore trend analysis of the degree of decentralization, and lack standardized quantitative approaches, such as the consistent application of methods like the coefficient of variation or the information entropy, to enable objective and comparable assessments across different systems. Given that blockchain systems are composed of participating nodes, we adopt a node-centric perspective, and propose a Node-based Blockchain Decentralization Measurement Model (NBDMM). NBDMM uses ten key indicators extracted from three dimensions, node distribution, transaction-network centralization, and node reliability, to measure the degree of decentralization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed NBDMM effectively quantifies the level of decentralization across blockchain systems with varying consensus mechanisms. Moreover, findings indicate a trend toward increasing centralization in both Bitcoin and Ethereum, suggesting a gradual erosion of their originally decentralized nature."

    "abstract": "Internet-wide scanning is integral to network measurement and security analysis, but the expansive address space of IPv6 limits existing approaches in achieving efficient global-scale scans. This study introduces HMap, an innovative IPv6 scanner that markedly improves scan efficiency and coverage through the implementation of a dynamic search (DS) technique, relying solely on IPv6 routeable BGP prefixes. DS employs a dynamic feedback-driven probing strategy that uses information from previous replies to prioritize more promising address regions in subsequent scans. In Internet-wide scans over IPv6, encompassing both ping-like and traceroute-like scans with DS, HMap has demonstrated its capability to discover 2.29 million non-alias active target addresses, 0.13 million peripheries/middleboxes, and 1.61 million router interfaces, using only million-scale probes. This represents a noteworthy improvement of 1.91 times, 1.63 times, and 12.38 times, respectively, compared to current state-of-the-art alternatives. Additionally, by utilizing an efficient target generation algorithm (TGA) that more effectively leverages seed addresses, HMap expands the non-alias active address count to 44.05 million. This coverage spans 18.97 thousand ASes with a one-hour scan at a limited probing speed of 100 Kpps. The volume of active IPv6 addresses is 4.88 times larger than the currently disclosed largest IPv6 hitlists, providing a more diverse set of IPv6 networks. Unlike prior IPv6 scan studies that preclude their use for Internet-scale security analysis, we also conduct the Internet-wide security scans of IPv6 networks, focusing on the exposed internal IPv6 devices and security-sensitive services in IPv6 routers."

    "abstract": "Accurate modeling of electric vehicle (EV) charging dynamics is essential for optimizing charging infrastructure and grid integration, especially when dealing with sparse data and random charging behavior. This paper proposes a unified load flow (ULF) model that captures the spatio-temporal evolution of charging behavior, incorporating EV arrival and departure dynamics as boundary conditions. A classical point optimization physics-informed neural network (PoPINN) is used to solve the ULF model, with a novel boundary condition design that ensures physical consistency during training. To enhance model consistency and robustness under stochastic and data-sparse conditions, a boundary-aware region-optimized PINN (RoPINN) is developed. This approach incorporates boundary information into regional optimization, enforcing arrival–departure consistency within local spatiotemporal regions and enabling reliable learning from incomplete data. The proposed framework provides a coherent data–physics integration strategy for modeling uncertain and incomplete EV charging information, enabling accurate prediction of charging power and load flow evolution. Simulation results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the robustness, accuracy, and practical applicability of the proposed method for large-scale EV charging optimization and smart grid management."

    "abstract": "Accurate identification of rice leaf diseases is essential to securing agricultural productivity and mitigating crop losses. Manual approaches are often inefficient and unreliable, particularly in large-scale farming. Although deep convolutional neural networks such as DenseNet have been applied to this task, their default configurations may not fully capture fine-grained disease features. This study aims to develop a series of enhanced DenseNet models that incorporate architectural improvements and optimized learning parameters to achieve highly reliable classification of rice leaf pathologies. We implemented baseline and modified versions of DenseNet121, DenseNet169, and DenseNet201, integrating Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks to enhance channel-wise feature calibration. The proposed approach is evaluated on a publicly available dataset comprising 3,829 rice leaf images distributed across six classes, including Brown Spot, Sheath Blight, Leaf Scald, Bacterial Leaf Blight, Leaf Blast, and Healthy rice leaves. To improve generalization and convergence, the modelswere fine-tuned usingKeras Tuner with a focus on optimizing the number of dense units, dropout rates, and learning rates. The proposed hybrid framework combines Squeeze-and-Excitation–enhanced DenseNet architectures withKerasTuner-based hyperparameter optimization, enabling joint feature refinement and systematic model optimization, which distinguishes it from existing DenseNet-based rice leaf disease detection approaches. The evaluation framework included dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE) and various statistical plots (histogram, KDE, box, and violin). Model performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, area under the ROC curve, and Cohen’s Kappa coefficient. All evaluated DenseNet-based models achieved consistently high performance, with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score values close to 0.99, while the Modified DenseNet-201 model yielded the highest overall results across all metrics. Its predictions exhibited strong confidence with minimal uncertainty, as evidenced by clear bimodal probability distributions and minimal misclassification in confusion matrices. The training history indicated smooth convergence with no significant overfitting. Notably, the Cohen’s Kappa score reached 0.9937, confirming excellent consistency beyond chance. The inclusion of SE blocks was especially effective in disambiguating diseases with similar visual traits. The proposed modifications to DenseNet architectures, supported by targeted hyperparameter tuning, significantly elevate performance in rice leaf disease classification. The models developed in this work demonstrate robust accuracy, strong interpretability, and practical viability for deployment in precision agriculture systems aimed at early disease detection."

The model employs a feedforward neural network that learns path loss using system features, followed by one-dimensional convolutional neural networks that learn residual components of path loss from terrain and morphology features to predict shadowing. This architecture introduces a novel integration of multimodal features and residual learning structures, enhancing both prediction accuracy and consistent prediction performance.

    "abstract": "The remarkable natural language understanding, reasoning, and generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have made them attractive for application to video understanding, utilizing video tokens as contextual input. However, employing LLMs for long video understanding presents significant challenges. The extensive number of video tokens leads to considerable computational costs for LLMs while using aggregated tokens results in loss of vision details. Moreover, the presence of abundant question-irrelevant tokens introduces noise to the video reasoning process. To address these issues, we introduce a simple yet effective learnable retrieval-based video-language model (R-VLM) for efficient long video understanding. Specifically, given a question and a long video, our model identifies the most relevant <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$K$</tex-math></inline-formula> video chunks and uses their associated visual tokens to serve as context for the LLM inference. This effectively reduces the number of video tokens, eliminates noise interference, and enhances system performance. We achieve this by incorporating a learnable lightweight MLP block to facilitate the efficient retrieval of question-relevant chunks, through the end-to-end training of our video-language model with a proposed soft matching loss. Experimental results on multiple zero-shot video question answering datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework for comprehending long videos."

    "abstract": "CLIP has promoted miscellaneous models and downstream applications, creating a great family in the deep learning community. Recently, the security of CLIP has become an increasingly popular research topic, where backdoor attacks show potential devastation by injecting a covert backdoor to manipulate the output features. Existing backdoor attacks typically bind the target class with large-scale poisonous data to pre-train or finetune the target CLIP model. Such a paradigm lacks transferability and flexibility since it needs retraining when applied to another target class or target CLIP model. In this paper, we propose a novel Transferable Backdoor Attack (TBA) paradigm for transferring backdoor attacks on any CLIP model with any target class, reducing time costs from conventional days or hours to seconds. First, we propose a multimodal hack network pre-training step, where the visual and textual hack networks are pre-trained to recognize the triggers in multimodal inputs robustly. Second, we propose a few-shot training-free backdoor transfer step, where the hack networks are efficiently fused into the target CLIP model with few samples of the target class. In experiments, our Transferable Hack Network (THNet) consistently achieves <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$&gt;99$</tex-math></inline-formula>% attack success rate while making minimum impact for clean input on various TBA settings and two downstream tasks. We hope this work can contribute a new perspective on the security vulnerability of CLIP and its downstream applications."

We further modify the nonlinear block of the VOC, hence linear voltage droop and better voltage supporting can be achieved. Since VOC is highly nonlinear, the conventional discretization methods generate considerable errors in digital implementation, especially for high-power rated converter working at low switching frequency. Two discretization techniques are investigated: The forward-backward Euler method and the complex repetitive controller approach. The proposed algorithm is verified by experiments both in grid-connected and island modes."

    "abstract": "A computationally secure physical-layer obfuscation framework for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems based on space shift keying (SSK) is proposed in this letter, while accounting for imperfect channel estimation and spatial channel correlation. The obfuscation principle relies on exploiting channel reciprocity in time-division duplexing (TDD), whereby the transmitter and the legitimate receiver independently estimate per-antenna fading powers and construct an identical permutation vector to reorder the transmit constellation in each coherence interval. For an SSK system with <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N<sub>t</sub></i> transmit antennas, the permutation is derived from the relative ordering of per-antenna channel powers. This design allows for refreshed key that avoids explicit key exchange with negligible signaling overhead. At the same time, an eavesdropper observing an independent or partially correlated channel is forced to decode using a mismatched constellation. Consequently, decoding ambiguity is significantly increased, enlarging the brute-force search space to the order of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N<sub>t</sub></i>!, which render blind constellation recovery computationally infeasible. Results demonstrate that channel estimation errors and spatial correlation impairments introduce only modest performance degradation at the legitimate receiver while strongly suppressing the eavesdropper’s achievable information rate. Performance is investigated in terms of average bit error rate (ABER), mutual information (MI), generalized mutual information (GMI), equivocation, and information leakage."

This paper presents a joint beamforming strategy for a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted ISAC system. We jointly optimize the active beamforming at the base station and the passive beamforming at the RIS to serve legitimate unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) while detecting potential unauthorized UAVs. The goal is to maximize the average sum-rate of all legitimate UAVs under constraints on radar sensing signal-to-noise ratio, the transmit power, and the reflection coefficients of the RIS. To address the non-convex optimization problem, we develop an efficient low-complexity solution based on fractional programming and alternating optimization. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the data rate compared with benchmarks, validating the effectiveness of RIS in harmonizing communication and target sensing functionalities for low-altitude networks."

    "abstract": "With the increasingly widespread application of federated learning (FL) in various fields, the issue of backdoor attacks against FL has garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. While there has been some progress in researching backdoor attacks against FL, data backdoor attacks are easily mitigated in federated environments, and model backdoor attacks are susceptible to detection by defense mechanisms. Therefore, we propose a refined backdoor attack method tailored for FL under the image classification task. Our method involves the collaborative operation of three key modules. Firstly, the parameter importance analysis module identifies parameters with minimal impact on model performance, and creates parameter importance masks to provide precise targets for subsequent operations. Subsequently, the activation difference computation module calculates the activation differences between backdoor samples and benign samples to locate trigger-sensitive parameters. Our method implants the backdoor by flipping and zeroing the precisely located layer parameters, while maintaining the model's classification performance on benign samples. Experimental results show that our method is feasible to achieve an average attack success rate more than 99% across the three victim models. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in FL environments and its robustness against various FL defense mechanisms."

Towards this end, the novel Types I & II Partition-based first-order TSK Fuzzy Classifiers (TIP-FC and TIIP-FC) and their training methods are developed for first-order linearity of consequent of each rule on all the fuzzy partitions themselves or their simple variants rather than each original feature, thereby having their distinct values in the sense of enhanced interpretability, smaller output variance, and/or denoising capability. Extensive experimental results on the adopted benchmark datasets indicate that both TIP-FC and TIIP-FC keep at least comparable to and even superior over the comparative methods in the sense of interpretability, classification performance, and/or denoising capability."

    "abstract": "Ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) is a pivotal technology in future 6G networks, demanding stringent quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees characterized by high reliability and hard delay constraints. To efficiently support uRLLC over time-varying wireless channels, there have been some emerging technologies such as finite blocklength (FBL) coding, adaptive modulation and coding (AMC), hybrid automatic repeat request with incremental redundancy (HARQ-IR), and massive multiple input multiple output MIMO (mMIMO)-enabled cell-free architectures. However, integrating these techniques into a unified framework that ensures statistical QoS guarantees for delay- and reliability-constrained uRLLC remains an open problem. A key difficulty is the joint optimization of queuing and transmission processes, which involves managing the delay budget between the queuing and transmission processes and the reliability budget among queuing delay violation probability (QDVP), block error probability (BLEP), and transmission failure probability. In this paper, we investigate a cell-free network architecture and derive the signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) distribution using a moment-matching approach. We further present a tractable effective capacity (EC) framework and derive closed-form expressions for the maximum allowable service rate (MASR) with only AMC or HARQ schemes. Furthermore, we propose a joint optimization framework that co-designs AMC thresholds and HARQ parameters to optimally trade off delay and reliability between queuing and transmission processes. Extensive simulations validate the accuracy of the theoretical derivations and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization strategies across diverse network scenarios."

    "abstract": "Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) adopts a flexible, open, and virtualized architecture with standardized interfaces, reducing dependency on a single supplier. O-RAN hosts many intelligent applications known as eXtended Applications (xApps). xApps are applications deployed at the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) that leverage advanced Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) algorithms to make dynamic decisions for network optimization. Each application operates with distinct optimization objectives and is managed by independent operators while accessing shared network resources. Conflicts in this context occur when a deployed xApp's objective interferes with another xApp, resulting in incompatible actions or decisions that may negatively impact network performance. The lack of a unified mechanism to coordinate and prioritize the actions of different applications can create three types of conflicts (direct, indirect, and implicit). Conflict prediction in O-RAN refers to the proactive analytical process through which potential interactions or behaviors that may lead to conflicts between network applications are identified in advance, prior to their manifestation within the operational system. In our paper, we introduce a novel data-driven Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based method called GRAPH-based Intelligent xApp Conflict Prediction and Analysis (GRAPHICA). It predicts three types of conflicts (direct, indirect, and implicit) and pinpoints the root causes (xApps). GRAPHICA captures the complex and hidden dependencies among the xApps, controlled parameters, and key performance indicators (KPIs) in O-RAN to predict possible conflicts. Then, it identifies the root causes (xApps) contributing to the predicted conflicts. The proposed method is evaluated using highly imbalanced synthetic datasets, in which conflict instances constitute between 40% and merely 10% of the data. This evaluation setting is designed to reflect realistic operational environments where conflicts are infrequent, thereby enabling a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance under real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate a high F1-score over 98% for the synthesized datasets with different levels of class imbalance."

Virtual Reality (VR) presents a promising solution for engaging and motivating training. However, existing work in VR-based prosthesis training is still focused on research purposes only. This paper details the user-centred co-design, development, clinical implementation, and commercial translation of Myo-Hand XP. Myo-Hand XP is the first commercial immersive VR intervention formyoelectric prosthesis training, which was registered in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) and brought to market in 2023. The development followed an iterative process, beginning with problem-idea validation through stakeholder interviews. This informed the creation of a Proof of Concept (PoC) prototype, which gathered initial user feedback. Subsequent development of a more advanced Research Prototype, incorporating feedback on hardware and software, underwent further user testing. This iterative co-design, involving continuous feedback from 60 multinational stakeholders across various stages, was central to refining Myo-Hand XP. Following regulatory approval, clinical pilots in prosthetic clinics with 20 people living with limb loss and 6 clinicians demonstrated increased patient motivation and confidence, and the value of early functional training. Key challenges identified included setup complexity and sensor ergonomics. The commercially released Myo-Hand XP incorporates expanded sensor compatibility and refined activities. Ongoing user-centred development continues to address feedback, focusing on usability, expanded features like progress reporting and prosthetic elbow support, and further clinical validation to optimize this VR rehabilitation tool. This paper shares insights into translating research into a clinically viable and commercially available product."

In such systems, the access point (AP) plays a key role in forwarding user requests to a server based on its latest received service information. This paper considers a single-source, single-destination system and introduces a PPO–based reinforcement learning framework for efficient information updating, guided by a newly designed reward metric called Age-and-Value-Aware (AVA). Unlike traditional freshness-based metrics, AVA explicitly incorporates variations in server-side service capacity and AP’s forwarding decisions, allowing more context-aware update evaluation. Under this reward structure, the PPO agent autonomously learns when to trigger service information updates, achieving a dynamic balance between communication cost and decision accuracy. Extensive simulations under diverse user request patterns and varying service capacities demonstrate that AVA reduces the update frequency by over 90% on average compared to baselines, with reductions reaching 98% in certain configurations. This reduction is achieved without compromising the quality of decision making."

    "abstract": "Accurate mobile network traffic prediction is crucial for transit infrastructure service optimization in industrial informatization. Traditional linear models fail to capture complex non-linear dynamics, while existing deep learning methods struggle with rapid temporal changes, signal fluctuations, and diverse network conditions, limiting real-time applicability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a hybrid model integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, tailored for High-Speed Railway (HSR) environments. The proposed hybrid model is evaluated using both public datasets and a real-world HSR dataset collected through empirical field measurements, it not only achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) predictive accuracy, reducing root mean square error by 4.7% over strong baselines in the challenging HSR environment, but also delivers this performance with superior computational efficiency, achieving over 3.6 times lower inference latency than leading SOTA models. This establishes an optimal performance-to-cost ratio, demonstrating its practical value for real-time HSR systems."

    "abstract": "The development of 5G to 6G wireless networks requires the use of infrastructure that is ultrareliable, capacitive, and low-latency communication. The 6G systems will most likely build on optical communication which has high bandwidth and scalability. Nevertheless, optical device and data heterogeneity, and large volumes of information generated by photonic transceivers has been a major challenge of real time monitoring, resource allocation, and network optimization. Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides the potential way out of such issues by providing predictive analytics, adaptive control, and intelligent decision-making. The current paper summarizes recent optical communication technologies in 6G, demonstrates the potential of AI to improve its performance, and suggests a new AIassisted architecture of optical fronthaul and transport networks. The suggested approach has lower latency, high energy efficiency, and high throughput levels in comparison to traditional systems through simulationbased evaluation. The findings stress that AI implementation together with the optical communication technologies will play a critical role in bringing the vision of 6G and beyond to reality."

How to flexibly implement various system and subsystem indicator tests, as well as compatible interactive interfaces with different external systems and standalone devices, is the key to whether the automatic testing system can quickly and effectively complete ground station system testing. This article proposes an automatic testing system that combines automatic testing with workflow technology. The application of workflow technology can standardize and contextualize the testing process of different testing projects. At the same time, the editable nature of workflows enables similar test items to be adjusted based on user performance requirements, testing usage requirements, and testing environment constraints, making the testing process more flexible and user-friendly. This automatic testing system achieves information exchange with different external systems, manufacturers, and models of instruments and equipment by establishing system level and single machine level driver libraries, meeting the adaptability requirements of different interaction interfaces."

A source-load forecasting method based on convolutional neural network (CNN), bidirectional long and short-term memory neural network (BiLSTM) and peak-valley weighting (PVW) is proposed. Firstly, the influencing factors with high correlation with power load and wind power output are selected as inputs to the model by combining the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and MIV scores; then, the joint forecasting of microgrid wind-photovoltaic load is realized by CNN-BiLSTM combined with the PVW mechanism. Finally, the forecasting accuracy of the proposed model is tested by combining the measured electric load and wind and solar power data of a region in China. The results show that the proposed model has higher forecasting accuracy in peak-underestimation forecasting."

The electromagnetic interference, lack of scalability and power consumption are some of the constraints that accompany traditional wireless monitoring systems. The Internet of Things (IoT)-based optical sensor network (OSN) model of monitoring infrastructure in realtime in warehouses are suggested in the paper to address the mentioned constraints. This system operates on distributed fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors, optical wireless communication (OWC) channel and internet of things (IoT) gateways to deliver low-latency and high-bandwidth data communication, as well as being immune to interference. A mathematical model is developed to estimate the attenuation and latency of power used when deploying one of the warehouses. The results of simulation confirm that the proposed OSN is a far superior option over the existing RF-based internet of things (IoT) networks in terms of latency, energy consumption, and scalability and can be used in more sophisticated applications, such as predictive maintenance and fire detection. The solution is highly secure as well as cost effective as far as tracking smart infrastructure is concerned."

    "abstract": "Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are based on the use of the high speed, low latency, and reliable communication to assist in autonomous driving, safety systems, delivery of infotainment, and traffic coordination. Conventional radiofrequency (RF)-based vehicular communication-related technologies like IEEE 802.11p, WiFi, and novel 802.11bd are affected by spectrum congestion, interference, and the low degrees of throughput that can be achieved with the large density of vehicles. Comparatively, Light Fidelity, or LiFi, an implementation of Visible Light Communication (VLC) offers incredibly high data rates, resistance to RF interference, and inherent security at the cost of depending on the line-of-sight (LOS), and intermittent connectivity due to mobility. This essay proposes a mixed LiFi-WiFi communication system to use in ITS Vehicular-to-Infrastructure (V2I) and Vehicular-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication. The hybrid system dynamically between LiFi and WiFi depending on the availability of LOS, projected conditions of handover, and real-time signal measurements. An extensive mathematical model is created to simulate optical and RF channels and then vehicular mobility situations are simulated. Findings indicate that the hybrid architecture uplifts the throughput, loss by 40 percent, and reliability of the handover over standalone communication systems by up to 65 percent. The work gives a basis on how to incorporate optical wireless communication in future vehicular networks with the 6G ecosystem of ITS."

    "abstract": "Accurate land cover classification from satellite imagery is crucial for environmental monitoring, agricultural management, and urban planning. However, existing deep learning approaches often require substantial computational resources, limiting deployment on resource-constrained platforms. This paper proposes a lightweight transfer learning framework based on MobileNetV2 for efficient land cover classification from Sentinel-2 RGB imagery. Our approach integrates three key innovations: depth-wise separable convolutions for parameter-efficient feature extraction, an adaptive fine-tuning strategy with progressive layer unfreezing to bridge the domain gap between ImageNet and satellite imagery, and a regularized classification head with attention-based pooling. Extensive experiments on the EuroSAT dataset demonstrate that our method achieves 91.2% classification accuracy while maintaining only 2.59M parameters, enabling real-time inference (15.2 ms/image) on CPU with training convergence in 40 epochs using Adam optimizer (batch size 64, learning rate 1e-3 for head and 1e-4 for backbone). The proposed framework exhibits superior performance across ten land cover categories including annual crops, forests, residential areas, and water bodies, with robust generalization under varying spatial resolutions and spectral conditions."

But there’s also quite a bit of difference between this type of info, and as infrared data isn’t great to start with, trying to make everything line up is pretty tricky. So as to tackle these sorts of issues, we present a dual-channel registration algorithm based on GAN. For the infrared branch, a light weight GAN does a super resolution reconstruction so that the shape of the land stays intact. On the contrary, the visible branch uses various sized picture features extracted from the improved main structure, and then aligns them with the opposite side by means of an enhanced cross attention part, so as to achieve correct correspondence. By means of a blend of Gaofen-2 and Landsat-8 images, it is shown via experiment that the suggested framework has better matching precision than SIFT, ORB, and D2-Net. It gives a dependable answer to cross-modal infrared-visible remote sensing registration."

Additionally, the system summarizes student suggestions using the gpt2-medium-finetuned-sst2-sentiment model, a state-of-the-art model for text summarization. The results of the experiment proved that among the two sentiment analysis models, gpt2-medium-finetuned-sst2-sentiment performed significantly with an F1-Score of 0.92 for their dataset and 0.93 for the researcher’s gathered data.

To better understand their attenuation behavior, this study employed low-energy pulsed discharges in transformer oil using a needle-to-needle electrode configuration. Pressure waveforms were recorded by PVDF sensors under different voltage–capacitance combinations. Results show that peak pressure attenuates in a power-exponential manner with increasing propagation distance, with attenuation coefficients ranging from 0.747 to 0.803. At constant capacitance, higher charging voltage increased both the peak pressure and the attenuation coefficient, while capacitance variation under fixed voltage had little influence on attenuation. These findings provide experimental evidence for the dependence of pressure wave attenuation on discharge conditions, offering insights into electrohydraulic effects in transformer oil and their implications for transformer safety."

This paper proposes a day-ahead load forecasting method for building energy consumption that combines multi-scale convolution with a multi-head attention mechanism, aiming to capture the complex temporal features in building energy consumption data. Specifically, multi-scale convolution with a pyramid structure is used to extract multi-level spatial features ranging from fine-grained to coarse-grained; subsequently, the multi-head attention mechanism is employed to dynamically fuse features of different time scales, enhancing adaptability to short-term fluctuations and long-term periodic trends; finally, an LSTM layer is utilized to accurately capture long-term dependencies and output high-precision prediction results. Experimental results show that the prediction model based on CNNP3-MultiHead-Lstm significantly outperforms traditional models in terms of accuracy and robustness."

    "abstract": "Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) is a critical variable for monitoring extreme weather events, particularly precipitation. Accurate retrieval of PWV is therefore essential in hydrology and meteorology. This study proposes an applied machine learning framework, termed PWV-ML, to enhance PWV estimation. Three machine learning methods, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Random Forest (RF), were evaluated using data from Radiosonde and GNSS observation stations between 2019 and 2023 across the United States and Canada. The models incorporated multiple auxiliary variables derived from AMSR2 brightness temperature data, MODIS products (MOD21A1N, MOD13A2), and seven ERA5 reanalysis variables. Results show that PWV-ML substantially outperforms traditional Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). Among the tested methods, RF achieved slightly superior accuracy. Variable selection proved critical, with dewpoint temperature (Td) and total column water vapor (TCWV) from ERA5 providing the strongest contributions. An optimized minimal input configuration, consisting of BT89V, cloud liquid water (CLW), the microwave atmospheric water vapor index (MAWVI), altitude, and Td, yielded strong agreement with ground observations (R = 0.92; RMSE = 4.77 mm; KGE = 0.87 for Radiosonde, and R = 0.91; RMSE = 2.82 mm; KGE = 0.76 for GNSS). Incorporating additional ERA5 variables further improved performance, achieving near-perfect correlations (R = 0.99). These findings demonstrate that the PWV-ML framework can retrieve PWV with high accuracy under diverse climatic conditions."

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides abundant spectral information for fine-grained target analysis, yet anomaly detection of camouflaged objects in UAV-based HSI remains challenging due to strong background similarity, spectral redundancy, and complex spatial variations across different observation scales. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Hierarchical Attentional Fusion (HAF) framework for hyperspectral camouflage target anomaly detection. The proposed model integrates a spectral–spatial self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies among highly correlated spectral bands and spatial contexts, together with a hierarchical multi-scale feature fusion module to enhance robustness against target scale variations caused by different UAV flight altitudes. Specifically, the self attention module sequentially models spectral correlation and spatial dependency, while a triple-branch convolutional structure with 1×1, 3×3, and 5×5 kernels adaptively aggregates multi-scale contextual information. A composite loss function combining re construction loss, orthogonal constraint, and attention regularization is further employed to stabilize feature learning and improve anomaly separability. Experiments are conducted on real-scene UAV hyperspectral datasets containing four types of military standard camouflage nets acquired at multiple flight heights. The results demonstrate that the proposed HAF framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hyperspectral anomaly detection methods, achieving superior AUC performance and robust generalization under complex background conditions. These findings indicate that HAF provides an effective and practical solution for UAV-based hyperspectral camouflage target detection."

    "abstract": "Single-cell microgels, engineered to replicate complex 3-D in vivo niches, have shown tremendous potential for advancing biomedical research. Studies have demonstrated that microgels recapitulating tissues’ stiffness facilitate the observation of cellular behavior in vitro. However, encapsulating single cells in microgels with composable stiffness gradients to understand cellular responses at microscale interfaces remains challenging. Here, we propose a versatile fabrication method that integrates an enhanced vision model with time-discrete bioprinting to encapsulate single cells in microgels featuring composable stiffness. An enhanced deep learning algorithm was developed to localize single cells in microscopic images, integrating traditional image processing algorithms for improved precision. By combining single-cell positioning data with a time-discrete array based on a digital micromirror device, dynamic digital masks can be generated to control each micromirror in real time. Using these masks, MDA-MB-231 cells were encapsulated in Gelatin methacrylate microgels with tunable stiffness ranging from 1.42 to 11.42 kPa. Experimental results indicated that when the microgel stiffness gradient exceeded 2 kPa, MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited a significant response, extending toward the softer regions of the microgels. These findings illustrate that our approach provides a valuable biofabrication strategy for investigating single-cell behaviors in microgels, showing great potential for applications in 3-D single-cell research."

    "abstract": "Layer jamming brakes exhibit variable stiffness with vacuum pressure, allowing them to restrict relative motion between two points. These devices hold significant potential for wearable applications due to their lightweight nature and ability to generate substantial linear tension for load transfer or selective movement restriction. However, the challenge of integrating displacement sensors within their structure has not yet been solved. In this article, we introduce a layer jamming system with resistive sensing jamming layers. The proposed mechanism leverages the relative motion of internal overlapping sensing jamming layers to produce a variation in resistance which can inform the user about their relative displacement while also producing frictional forces. This sensing approach is inherently synergistic with the mechanism of the device as it simultaneously generates friction and enables real-time displacement measurement without altering the shape of the device. The proposed device can generate a tensile force of up to 1017 N, can sense displacements over the entire range of operation of jamming layer brakes (up to 82% displacement) with a gauge factor of 1.15 and a linearity error within 1%. We demonstrate its application as a wearable device with a controllable braking point algorithm and as an upper-arm support system."

    "abstract": "Transformers have achieved remarkable success in satellite pansharpening by effectively modeling non-local similarity. Self-attention focuses on modeling the global dependency among all token pairs, typically pixel pairs for pansharpening. Representative tokens with rich information are often ignored. This leads to redundant computation, especially for similar tokens. Instead, non-similar regions share the weights to aggregate features in a Feed-Forward Network (FFN), leading to suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we propose ProtoFormer, a novel transformer architecture that introduces learnable prototype tokens to capture and leverage representative image structures, featuring two key contributions: 1) Shared Prototype Attention (SPA): it exploits the high redundancy and symmetry of attention maps by computing a single shared attention map between image and prototype tokens, enabling bidirectional exchange of global self-similarity information while reducing self-attention complexity from quadratic to linear; 2) Prototype-guided Content-Aadaptive FFN (PCAFN): it addresses the limitation of standard FFNs that use shared weights for all positions by leveraging prototype tokens to partition image tokens into similar-content regions, then applying region-specific content-adaptive convolution and a soft mask gate, thereby enhancing spatially adaptive feature aggregation and preserving fine edges. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art fusion methods through both qualitative and quantitative assessments on multiple test sets. Our code will be released upon acceptance."

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as an energy-efficient solution for increasing the capacity of existing wireless networks. However, recent research suggests that RIS-assisted systems require either large surfaces or reflection amplifiers connected to each element to combat the double path-loss in the reflected links, resulting in higher power consumption. In this work, we consider hybrid RIS (H-RIS) with discrete phase shifts to assist the downlink communication in a hardware-impaired massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. We aim to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the considered system by jointly optimizing the transmit and reflect beamformers. The considered problem is shown to be non-convex and thus challenging to solve. To address this, we use fractional programming theory to reformulate the objective and, subsequently, solve it using an alternating optimization approach. We also provide a closed-form expression for the transmit beamformer, which significantly improves the runtime of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that, with the proposed algorithm, H-RIS aided massive MIMO system achieves a higher EE performance under hardware impairment and perfect hardware scenarios."

    "abstract": "Collision-free path planning in nonconvex environments is challenging due to potential constraint violations between time steps and the difficulty of obtaining true uncertainty distributions. Although many optimization-based methods, such as Model Predictive Control (MPC), have been proposed, most rely on exact disturbance knowledge. Moreover, existing methods typically handle only open-loop uncertainty, leading to uncontrolled state covariance and overly conservative paths. This work presents a Data-driven Stochastic MPC (DSMPC) for vehicle path planning amid obstacles and unknown unbounded disturbances. DSMPC explicitly bounds failure probability, ensures recursive feasibility under weak noise assumptions, and addresses implementation via convex optimization. It controls the full state distribution, steering it from initial to target, while handling nonconvex constraints via convex reconstruction. For unknown Gaussian noise with finite variance, we derive a confidence upper-bound from samples, avoiding performance degradation due to prior knowledge deviations. We also provide a cost reduction property, asymptotic performance bound, and recursive feasibility conditions for independent and identically distributed zero-mean and bounded-variance disturbances. Simulations show DSMPC's effectiveness in obstacle-rich cases."

The existing methods typically use a multi-step pipeline with intermediate representations to decompose the prediction process into several sub-tasks, limiting model flexibility and imposing predefined solution paths. This often results in unreasonable outputs when applied to data unsuitable for these predefined paths, making it challenging for these methods to match human designers, who do not restrict themselves to a specific set of design workflows. To address these limitations, we introduce CE2EPlan, a controllable end-to-end topology- and geometryenhanced diffusion model, that removes restrictions on the generative process of AI design tools. Instead, it enables the model to learn how to design floor plans directly from data, capturing a wide range of solution paths from input boundaries to complete layouts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses all existing approaches using the multi-step pipeline, delivering higher-quality results with enhanced user control and greater diversity in output, bringing AI design tools closer to the versatility of human designers."

    "abstract": "4D millimeter-wave radar, as a fundamental sensor for 3D object detection, has gained increasing attention in autonomous driving due to its robustness and additional elevation information. However, the sparsity and noisiness of 4D radar point clouds hinder its broader application. Fusing camera with 4D millimeter-wave radar provides an affordable and robust solution. In this paper, a fast and effective framework HP-C4D for camera and 4D radar fusion is proposed. Three key modules are proposed in HP-C4D. Firstly, we innovatively propose the Height BEVPool to predict the height of each BEV grid with negligible delay increase during the height compression. The predicted height information is incorporated into the final object height prediction. Secondly, Perceptive View Heatmap Guidance (PVHG) is proposed to suppress background noise's generation in image BEV and assist the Height BEVPool for better height prediction. Thirdly, Interactive Guidance Fusion (IGF) is proposed to efficiently fuse image BEV and 4D radar BEV. Extensive experiments on the View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadset datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and advance of our proposed method. It is worth highlighting that the 3D mean average precision of our proposed method is 0.71% and 3.85% higher than the latest baseline method LXL (LiDAR-Excluded-Lean) on the VoD and TJ4DRadset datasets, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, HP-C4D is the fastest method for camera and 4D radar fusion in 3D object detection on the VoD dataset, achieving 21.4 FPS on single NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU.

Previous methods have generally focused on gait recognition within a single modality, but with the constant advancement of multimedia sensors, there is a growing requirement for the development of multimodal and cross-modal gait recognition. The various modalities are aligned directly in a hard manner by current cross-modal approaches, which could result in class collapse caused by imbalanced learning and make learning discriminative representations difficult for the weaker modality. To overcome these limitations, we propose a unified cross-modal gait recognition framework, UniCrossGait. Specifically, we employ the knowledge distillation paradigm to transfer the knowledge of a fused multimodal teacher network, Exist Methods UniCrossGait(Ours) Figure 1: Illustration of comparison between exist methods and which serves as a shared intermediate representation, to unimodal student networks, which enables them to learn modality-invariant representations. To perform knowledge distillation effectively, we design the Direction-level Feature Imitation loss and Intra&Inter sample Correlation loss. Furthermore, we construct the Warm up operator and Distillation Balancing operator to prevent the network from falling into suboptimal solutions due to pure imitation and imbalanced distillation. Our method achieves state of-the-art (SOTA) results on cross-modal gait recognition datasets, and extensive ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed paradigm and modules.

This paper proposes an online monitoring method for galloping through the induced current or voltage in the ground wires, which is based on the periodic variation of mutual inductance between conductors and ground wires. The monitoring device of this method is convenient to install and maintain, and the monitoring effect is not influenced by bad weather such as fog and snow. In order to detect galloping information, a calculation model for the induced signals in the ground wires during galloping is firstly studied. Then the dynamic response of induced signals in the ground wires under different galloping conditions is analyzed. An inverse deduction method for galloping characteristics is then proposed based on the frequency features of the induced signals in the ground wires. A scaled test is conducted to verify the feasibility of the proposed method. The accuracy of deduced results is acceptable and the study offers new possibilities for overhead transmission line condition monitoring."

    "abstract": "Matrix placement machines improve production efficiency of printed circuit board assembly (PCBA), addressing critical needs for flexible and intelligent electronics manufacturing. However, their complex head structure renders solutions for traditional beam-head placement machines inefficient for matrix placement machines. This article proposes a phased hybrid algorithm with adaptive hyper-nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) for PCBA optimization. A bidirectional search mechanism is applied to derive feeder distributions and nozzle configurations, and iteratively tighten the solution space using priority-based search strategies. The softmax, max greatest common divisor, and max matching mechanisms are proposed for placement and pickup sequences, which facilitates construction of solution pools. Initial solutions are extracted from the pool and, subsequently, hyperheuristic mechanisms dynamically adjust genetic operators within NSGA-II to minimize placement, pickup, and recognition times with better convergence speed. Experimental validation with real-world production data demonstrates that the proposed algorithm achieves 6.05%–38.18% performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art solutions."

In this paper, we first reformulate the WVC problem as an asymmetric snowdrift game on weighted networks. Then, we propose a new game-based algorithm by combining temporal difference method in reinforcement learning, that is, the temporal-difference(λ)- based game algorithm (TD(λ)-GA), which can achieve a balance between the running time and the solution quality. Finally, we perform numerical simulations to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can find a high-quality solution within reasonable runtime by comparing it with other representative optimization algorithms."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Feedforward control is essential for precise output tracking in non-minimum phase systems, and stable inversion has been proposed to address input instability caused by unstable internal dynamics. However, this approach demands an accurate mathematical model, limiting its effectiveness in the presence of model uncertainties and especially in cases without a model. While data-driven control can enhance performance in these scenarios, it often fails to achieve precise tracking under input stabilitty conditions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a unified feedforward control framework using the Koopman-type inverse operator for output tracking for disturbed non-minimum phase systems. This framework extends the applicability of the stable inversion method from model-available scenarios to model-unavailable scenarios. Besides other data-driven control approaches, it enables precise output tracking while ensuring the stability of the input, without necessitating additional design constraints. It features two novel algorithms that maintain a consistent controller structure while varying only in parameter determination methods. The convergence properties of the proposed algorithms are rigorously analyzed, and their effectiveness is verified through piezoelectric ceramic positioning experiments."

    "abstract": "Clustered-object environments challenge robotic grasp planning and implementation mainly for two reasons: (i) the limited inter-object clearance leaves insufficient space for conventional gripper fingers to approach and wrap the target object without collisions, and (ii) perception-induced position uncertainty makes it difficult to place the fingers precisely into such narrow spaces. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel robotic finger based on pin-array mechanisms to passively adapt to object clearance between adjacent objects and tolerate pose uncertainty. The tiny pins can be inserted into constrained spaces and thus construct stable grasping pairs. Unlike conventional pin-array mechanisms used in gripper design, the proposed approach utilizes the pin-array for finger design, enabling a gripper equipped with a pair of these fingers to pick objects in significantly narrower spaces than conventional grippers. This gripper also inherits the advantages of the pin-array mechanisms to facilitate shape and error adaptation. Furthermore, we conducted finite element analysis (FEA) to validate the structural design and explore the miniaturization limit, and explain the planning method for autonomous operation. The experiments quantitatively explored the adaptable clearance and validated the feasibility and robustness in real scenarios."

    "abstract": "This study presents a novel control framework for climbing robots that utilizes both rope and leg mechanisms. The proposed robot ascends steep slopes using two ropes while maintaining its balance and adapting its pose to uneven surfaces through its four legs. The robot's overall movement on the slopes is managed by an ascender module, while leg motions are governed by a reinforcement learning (RL) policy trained to sustain local stability under unpredictable disturbances from rope tensions and varying slopes. To enhance stability under partial observability, the policy integrates a latent context vector with a learned Tumble Stability Margin (TSM) for proactive instability detection. Furthermore, to recover from instability in challenging conditions such as slipping or edge hooking, the framework enables dynamic body height adaptation based on stability feedback. Validated via sim-to-real transfer, the system demonstrates that the rope-driven climbing robot maintains consistent locomotion stability across various slope environments and effectively responds to hazardous situations using its learned stability awareness."

The system combines rule-based negation detection, dependency parsing, and lexicon-driven keyword matching with contextual expansion powered by Groq’s LLM. On an expanded CheXpert-derived cohort of 2 020 reports (1 020 real and 1 000 augmented samples), MedInsight Pro achieved an average macro F1-score of 89.7%, with overall precision of 91.8%, recall of 89.4%, and negation detection accuracy of 95.1%. These results surpass keyword-only, LLM-only, and CheXpert labeler baselines. Deployed via a Streamlit interface, the system also offers explainability through clause heatmaps, radar charts, robustness visualizations under synthetic domain shift, and a clinical Q&A interface. The findings highlight the practicality of hybrid NLP–LLM pipelines as scalable, transparent decision-support tools for radiologists in real-world clinical settings.

    "abstract": "Pancreatic tumor segmentation from computed tomography (CT) images remains a challenging task due to limited annotated datasets, pronounced anatomical variability, and the high computational demands of state-of-the-art deep learning models, which collectively hinder their routine clinical adoption. This study proposes a clinically oriented end-to-end framework that bridges methodological advances in deep learning with practical deployment by enabling adaptive segmentation under realistic data growth scenarios. Rather than introducing a novel segmentation architecture, the framework integrates existing convolutional and transformer-based models within a lightweight graphical user interface (GUI) and employs a recursive augmentation strategy as a simulation mechanism to emulate the incremental availability of annotated clinical data over time. Multiple candidate architectures were first evaluated using cross-validation, after which representative lightweight and high-capacity models were selected for recursive augmentation. The framework was subsequently evaluated using both CNN-based architectures, such as 3D U-Net, and transformer-based models, such as VT-UNet-B, on multiple large-scale public datasets. Across all experiments, the proposed recursive augmentation consistently improved segmentation performance relative to baseline training, yielding relative Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) gains in the range of approximately 4–11% before reaching architecture-dependent saturation. Lightweight CNNs exhibited earlier saturation with smaller but consistent improvements, whereas transformer-based models benefited more substantially from incremental data expansion. By embedding segmentation models into an interactive GUI that supports real-time visualization and expert-driven refinement, the proposed framework emphasizes deployment feasibility, adaptability, and continuous performance improvement. The results outline a practical pre-clinical pathway toward resource-aware pancreatic tumor segmentation in real-world healthcare environments."

    "abstract": "Opportunistic Networks (OppNets) employ the Store-Carry-Forward (SCF) paradigm to maintain communication during intermittent connectivity. However, routing performance suffers due to dynamic topology changes, unpredictable contact patterns, and resource constraints including limited energy and buffer capacity. These challenges compromise delivery reliability, increase latency, and reduce node longevity in highly dynamic environments. This paper proposes Cluster-based Routing using Deep Reinforcement Learning (CR-DRL), an adaptive routing approach that integrates an Actor-Critic learning framework with a heuristic function. CR-DRL enables real-time optimal relay selection and dynamic cluster overlap adjustment to maintain connectivity while minimizing redundant transmissions and enhancing routing efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. CR-DRL extends node lifetimes by up to 21%, overall energy use is reduced by 17%, and nodes remain active for 15% longer. Communication performance also improves, with up to 10% higher delivery ratio, 28.5% lower delay, 7% higher throughput, and data requiring 30% fewer transmission steps across the network."

    "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) enhances the vividness of motor imagery (MI) when combined with action observation (AO). While prior studies suggest differences in self-awareness and motor practice when using a Controller versus a data Glove (Glove) to manipulate an avatar hand, it remains unclear whether corticospinal excitability (CSE) varies by manipulation type. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), we examined CSE before and after short-term performance change of a VR ball-catching task with a Controller or Glove. Twenty healthy adults in short-term performance change with both devices on separate days. Participants unimanually controlled an avatar hand in VR to catch a ball. We assessed changes in MI vividness, self-awareness, motor performance, and surface electromyography (EMG) with practice. Single-pulse TMS was delivered before and after practice over the contralateral motor cortex to evaluate CSE in task-related muscles at rest and during Action Observation during Motor Imagery (AOMI). MI vividness increased with practice for both devices, with no between-device differences in self-awareness. Agonist EMG decreased only with Glove practice, while CSE (motor-evoked potential amplitude) increased after Glove practice but not after Controller practice. Correlation analyses showed significant associations between EMG and motor-evoked potentials (MEP), and between ownership and MEP, after practice. These findings indicate that short-term performance change modulates CSE in a device-dependent, muscle-specific manner in a VR ball-catching task, with CSE changes linked to the sense of body ownership in VR."

LoRa (Long Range) is another technology that has become popular to support such requirements and its coverage and power consumption are quite good and can be used in large scale deployments of the IoT. In spite of these strengths, LoRa based networks are still prone to a networking range of security threats because of open wireless channels and unlicensed spectrum. The topic of the study is the improvement in data security in the context of LoRa networks that transmit the data. The research is aimed at eliminating the vulnerabilities in standard LoRaWAN protocol. We propose multi-layered, in which advanced encryption algorithms, integration of changes in the session key and energy-efficient inetrusion detection mechanism is made possible. It is shown, through experimental analysis, that the suggested frame-work increases resilience towards eavesdropping, replay attacks, and providing protection against device spoofing without sacrificing the low-power features that are central to IoT applications."

The first component is a neural network-based forecasting module for photovoltaic (PV) generation and load demand, which supports a two-stage storage management strategy, day-ahead mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) scheduling, and intraday model predictive control (MPC) corrections, for the coordinated operation of battery energy storage systems (BESS) and hydrogen energy storage systems (HESS). The second component is a sensitivity-based voltage control layer, implemented using a multi-agent system (MAS) to coordinate voltage regulators and inverter reactive power in real time. While the forecasting-based storage management and the decentralized voltage control operate as separate modules in the current study, the proposed framework outlines how they could be combined in future work. Each algorithm is validated individually through simulations on benchmark distribution test feeders, demonstrating reduced voltage deviations, minimized tap changes, improved energy scheduling, and enhanced state-of-charge (SOC) and level-of-hydrogen (LOH) tracking."

    "abstract": "As our world becomes more dependent on digital systems in areas like finance, healthcare, and government, cyber threats are growing rapidly in both scale and complexity. Global cybercrime damages are expected to cross $10.5 trillion annually by 2025, and traditional security methods that rely on signatures or fixed rules are no longer effective against new, unknown attacks. This paper presents an AI-powered cybersecurity framework that uses machine learning to detect unusual behavior, connect threat patterns in real time, and respond automatically with minimal human effort.Experiments using real datasets and enterprise logs show strong improvements—detection accuracy up to 96.8%, fewer false alerts, and a 96% faster incident response. These results suggest that artificial intelligence can transform cybersecurity from a reactive process (responding after an attack) into a proactive and self-learning system capable of preventing, adapting to, and recovering from threats automatically"

Nevertheless, to reach these high-aspirational objectives, there is the need to transform the status quo of resource allocation to adaptive and learning-oriented mechanisms. In this paper, the author will discuss the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in resource allocation models of 5G and 6G networks. Comprising a synthesis of recent advances in the AI-RAN convergence, dynamic Quality of Service (QoS) management, and centralised versus decentralised orchestration models, the research paper identifies the way AI-based algorithms can be used to improve spectral efficiency, latency, and energy use. The discussion also reveals existing open issues of scalability, transparency, and real-time learning, which give information on how AI-native architectures can redefine 6G network intelligence."

A local webcam captures live video streams processed at the edge by a Flask-Based server, integrating YOLOv8 object detection, HMM-based behavior anomaly detection, and facial recognition for identity verification. To guarantee uninterrupted operation without network connectivity, we also implement a fully offline face-recognition mode on the ESP32-CAM enabling the door to unlock locally under 100 ms. In parallel, a retrainable cloud-based Azure Custom Vision model detected object identities, assessed risk levels dynamically triggering local actions such as door control and real-time email alerts with contextual evidence. When risk levels exceed predefined thresholds, the system autonomously captures critical frames and sends alert or action-required notifications with attached visual evidence, using risk-specific visual theming. To address edge computing limitations in complex cases, recorded videos are analyzed by AWS Rekognition for comprehensive label detection. A responsive web interface provides live monitoring, event logging, OTP-based visitor access, and remote door operation, enhanced by dynamic UI feedback based on threat severity. This work demonstrates an integrated, scalable, and cost-efficient approach to edge-assisted smart security systems, laying a foundation for future improvements in multi-camera coordination ensuring the embedded firmware remains lightweight and easily updatable."

This paper investigates the performance of discrete-time Zhang neural network (DT-ZNN) models in solving the pseudoinversion problem of time-varying matrices. First, the continuous-time Zhang neural network (CT-ZNN) model is derived for computing the dynamic pseudoinverse of full-rank matrices. Then, drawing on recent advances in discretization methods, we adopt the general-four-instant (GFI) discretization formula—incorporating a tunable selection parameter—to convert the CT-ZNN model into its discrete counterpart. The resulting GFI-type DT-ZNN model undergoes rigorous analysis, focusing on the effects of different selection parameters on convergence and computational precision. Numerical experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed GFI-type DT-ZNN model, illustrating its superiority in addressing time-varying matrix pseudoinversion across diverse parameter settings."

Less attention has been given to the conceptual foundations of how AI systems process financial information and support decision-making. This paper introduces a conceptual framework for stock forecasting grounded in Information Processing Theory (IPT). We adapt IPT stages of attention, encoding, storage, and retrieval to describe how a forecasting pipeline can be structured around three layers: a Data Layer for OHLCV time series and engineered indicators, a Machine Learning Layer using BiLSTM-based modeling, and an AI Analyst Layer that communicates structured outputs for decision support. By aligning this architecture with IPT, we argue that AI forecasting systems can be understood as structured information processors that parallel aspects of human reasoning while contributing to, rather than replacing, analyst expertise. The framework provides a theoretical basis for considering issues such as transparency, interpretability, and reliance, and establishes a foundation for future empirical investigations of AI applications in finance."

    "abstract": "Orthogonal Time-Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation technology has garnered significant attention in the field of wireless communications in recent years, particularly demonstrating inherent advantages in high-speed mobile scenarios. In OTFS modulation systems, the fractional Doppler effect has emerged as one of the core challenges in channel estimation under high-mobility environments such as vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks, high-speed rail, and 6G communications. OTFS effectively mitigates the impact of time-varying channels by transforming signals into the delayed Doppler (DD) domain. However, fractional Doppler disrupts the sparsity of the channel, leading to modeling errors and performance degradation in traditional grid-based sampling methods. This, in turn, results in inaccurate channel estimation, high equalization complexity, and insufficient system robustness. To address this, this paper proposes a novel network architecture based on the Unet framework with residual attention fusion (AR-Unet), specifically designed for fractional Doppler channel estimation in OTFS systems. The model is built on the Unet learning framework, enhancing nonlinear feature fitting capabilities and training stability through deep stacked residual modules. It combines a channel attention mechanism to achieve adaptive modeling of key path gain features, effectively capturing the energy structure in the delay-Doppler domain. The encoder consists of multi-scale residual stacks, performing layer-wise feature compression to significantly enhance the model’s representational capacity, while the decoder incorporates an upsampling mechanism to reconstruct high-dimensional channel structures. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional deep learning methods (e.g., deep neural networks (DNN)/convolutional neural networks (CNN)) and the DRANet network, it exhibits outstanding estimation accuracy and generalization capabilities. This fully validates its application potential in complex high-mobility scenarios."

However, existing object detection algorithms often have high computational demands and require substantial hardware resources. We propose a lightweight detection method, RFD-YOLO, based on an improved YOLOv8, to address these issues, achieving automatic detection of rotten fruits. First, we reconstruct the YOLOv8 backbone by employing Shuffle Block and StemBlock and replace the C2F module in the head with DWConv to reduce the model's parameters. Furthermore, we introduce the LSKBlock and Shape-IoU loss function to enhance the model accuracy while maintaining small parameter size. Finally, the RFD-YOLO model was trained and validated using a handcrafted dataset specifically constructed for detecting rotten fruit. The model's parameter size is 0.9M, representing a 72.7% reduction compared to the lightest model in the YOLOv8 series, YOLOv8n, while achieving mAP@0.5 of 90.9% and mAP@0.5-0.95 of 46.5%."

This study examines knowledge forgetting in fragmented learning through a designed experiment. Participants' knowledge retention was evaluated based on response accuracy, while EEG signals were analyzed to assess cognitive load, relaxation, and attention states during forgetting episodes. The testing effect in fragmented learning was also explored. Key findings include: (1) Forgetting and the testing effect coexist in fragmented learning — while knowledge decay occurs, retrieval practice facilitates memory recovery; (2) Cognitive load remains stable during forgetting, whereas attention and relaxation exhibit an inverse relationship; (3) Maintaining moderately high cognitive load helps reduce forgetting, while attention fluctuations correlate with knowledge loss.This research provides insights into forgetting mechanisms in fragmented learning, linking behavioral performance with neurophysiological states. The findings have theoretical and practical implications for optimizing learning strategies through testing-based interventions."

    "abstract": "Adversaries increasingly leverage diverse techniques to distribute malicious payloads across the web. One common, low-cost tactic is the hijacking of digital signatures and their attachment to malicious binaries, with the intent of deceiving both web browsers and operating systems. While code-signing certificates have traditionally served to verify the authenticity and integrity of software, adversaries now exploit these same certificates to evade detection mechanisms and facilitate the propagation of malicious code. This study seeks to empirically evaluate how modern web browsers respond to untrusted code by analyzing their reactions to signed malicious binaries. Our analysis shows that browsers’ responses to certificate abuses may differ significantly, and the operating system may respond ineffectively potentially leaving end-users vulnerable to straightforward adversarial tactics. We also show that it is possible to significantly reduce the attack surface against certificate abuse with the use of a browser extension."

    "abstract": "Studying the dynamics and stability of inverter-driven power systems has become a top priority for grid operators in view of the massive renewable energy deployment. The simplest and most widely used model for stability analysis for such networks is the single-inverter single- bus (SISB) equivalent model. Although quite insightful, SISB models with an L-filter for the inverter suffer from implementation difficulties due to algebraic loops. This paper develops a closed-form SISB model for grid-following (GFL) and grid-forming (GFM) inverters and derives symbolic formulation for the linearized system, which resolves algebraic loops and obtains fast results with uncompromised precision. This model is then used in an N-Dimensional Stability Boundary Tracking (ND-SBT) algorithm, which identifies the stability boundary for GFL and GFM inverters. This is the first method to infer the stability region for an arbitrary number of dimensions in a computationally efficient and software-agnostic manner while preserving accuracy. A detailed sensitivity analysis yields useful findings on the stability impact of individual parameters, while the results are validated using the IEEE 14- bus system."
